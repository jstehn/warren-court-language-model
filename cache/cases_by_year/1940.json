States Supreme Court\nAMALGAMATED UTILITY WORKERS v. CONSOL. EDISON CO. OF NEW YORK(1940)\nNo. 342\nArgued: January 31, 1940Decided: February 26, 1940\n\n\n\n Mr. Louis B. Boudin, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. William L. Ransom, of New York City, for respondents Consolidated Edison Co. of New York, Inc., et al.\n Mr. Isaac Lobe Straus, of Baltimore, Md., for respondents, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers et al.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The National Labor Relations Board ordered the Consolidated Edison Company of New York and its affiliated companies to desist from certain labor practices \n\n[309 \nU.S. 261, 262]\n\u00a0\n found to be unfair and to take certain affirmative action. The Circuit Court of Appeals granted the Board's petition for enforcement of the order, and its decree, as modified, was affirmed by this Court. Consolidated Edison Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, \n305 \nU.S. 197\n, 59 S.Ct. 206. Petitioner, Amalgamated Utility Workers, brought the present proceeding before the Circuit Court of Appeals to have the Consolidated Edison Company and its affiliated companies adjudged in contempt for failure to comply with certain requirements of the decree.\n The Board, in response to the motion, asserted its willingness to participate in an investigation to ascertain whether acts in violation of the decree had been committed and suggested that the court direct such investigation as might be deemed appropriate.\n The Court of Appeals denied the application upon the ground that petitioner had 'no standing to press a charge of civil contempt, if contempt has been committed'. The court held that under the National Labor Relations Act 'the Board is the proper party to apply to the court for an order of enforcement and to present to the court charges that the court's order has not been obeyed'. 2 Cir., 106 F.,2d 991. In view of the importance of the question in relation to the proper administration of the National Labor Relations Act, we granted certiorari. \n308 \nU.S. 541\n, 60 S.Ct. 123, 84 L.Ed. --. October 16, 1939\n\n\n Petitioner contends that the National Labor Relations Act1 'creates private rights'; that the Act recognizes the rights of labor organizations; and that it gives the parties upon whom these rights are conferred status in the courts for their vindication. In support of its alleged standing, petitioner urges that under its former name (United Electrical and Radio Workers of America) it filed with the National Labor Relations Board charges against the respondent companies, and that it was upon \n\n[309 \nU.S. 261, 263]\n\u00a0\n these charges that the Board issued its complaint and held the hearing which resulted in the order in question. Also, that petitioner was permitted to intervene in the proceedings before the Circuit Court of Appeals where the companies had moved to set aside the Board's order and the Board had moved to enforce it; and that the petitioner had also been heard in this Court in the certiorari proceedings for review of the decree of enforcement.\n Petitioner invokes the statement in Section 1 of the Act of 'findings and policy', with respect to the effect of the denial by employers of the right of employees to organize and to bargain collectively, and in particular the provision of Section 72 that\n'Employees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in concerted activities, for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection'.\n\n Neither this provision, nor any other provision of the Act, can properly be said to have 'created' the right of self-organization or of collective bargaining through representatives of the employees' own choosing. In National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, \n301 \nU.S. 1, 33\n, 34 S., 57 S.Ct. 615, 622, 108 A.L. R. 1352, we observed that this right is a fundamental one; that employees 'have as clear a right to organize and select their representatives for lawful purposes' as the employer has 'to organize its business and select its own officers and agents'; that discrimination and coercion 'to prevent the free exercise of the right of employees to self-organization and representation' was a proper subject for condemnation by competent legislative authority. We noted that 'long ago' \n\n[309 \nU.S. 261, 264]\n\u00a0\n we had stated the reason for labor organizations,-that through united action employees might have 'opportunity to deal on an equality with their employer', referring to what we had said in American Steel Foundries v. Tri-City Central Trades Council, \n257 \nU.S. 184, 209\n, 42 S.Ct. 72, 78, 27 A.L.R. 360. And in recognition of this right, we concluded that Congress could safeguard it in the interest of interstate commerce and seek to make appropriate collective action 'an instrument of peace rather than of strife'. To that end Congress enacted the National Labor Relations Act.\n To attain its object Congress created a particular agency, the National Labor Relations Board, and established a special procedure. The aim, character and scope of that special procedure are determinative of the question now before us. Within the range of its constitutional power, Congress was entitled to determine what remedy it would provide, the way that remedy should be sought, the extent to which it should be afforded, and the means by which it should be made effective.\n Congress declared that certain labor practices should be unfair, but it prescribed a particular method by which such practices should be ascertained and prevented. By the express terms of the Act, the Board was made the exclusive agency for that purpose. Section 10(a) provides:3\n'The Board is empowered, as hereinafter provided, to prevent any person from engaging in any unfair labor practice (listed in section 8 ( 158)) affecting commerce. This power shall be exclusive, and shall not be affected by any other means of adjustment or prevention that has been or may be established by agreement, code, law, or otherwise'.\n\n The Act then sets forth a definite and restricted course of procedure. A charge of an unfair labor practice may \n\n[309 \nU.S. 261, 265]\n\u00a0\n be presented to the Board, but the person or group making the charge does not become the actor in the proceeding. It is the Board, and the Board alone or its designated agent, which has power to issue its complaint against the person charged with the unfair labor practice. If complaint is issued, there must be a hearing before the Board or a member thereof or its agent. The person against whom the complaint is issued may answer and produce testimony. Other persons may be allowed to intervene and present testimony, but only in the discretion of the Board, or its member or agent conducting the hearing. Section 10(b).4 The hearing is under the control of the Board. The determination whether or not the person named in the complaint has engaged or is engaging in the unfair labor practice rests with the Board. If the Board is of the opinion that the unfair labor practice has been shown, the Board must state its findings of fact and issue its 'cease and desist' order with such affirmative requirements as will effectuate the policy of the Act. Section 10(c).5\n So far, it is apparent that Congress has entrusted to the Board exclusively the prosecution of the proceeding by its own complaint, the conduct of the hearing, the adjudication and the granting of appropriate relief. The Board as a public agency acting in the public interest, not any private person or group, not any employee or group of employees, is chosen as the instrument to assure protection from the described unfair conduct in order to remove obstructions to interstate commerce.\n When the Board has made its order, the Board alone is authorized to take proceedings to enforce it. For that purpose the Board is empowered to petition the Circuit Court of Appeals for a decree of enforcement. The court \n\n[309 \nU.S. 261, 266]\n\u00a0\n is to proceed upon notice to those against whom the order runs and with appropriate hearing. If the court, upon application by either party, is satisfied that additional evidence should be taken, it may order the Board, its member or agent, to take it. The Board may then modify its findings of fact and make new findings. The jurisdiction conferred upon the court is exclusive and its decree is final save as it may be reviewed in the customary manner. Section 10(e).6 Again, the Act gives no authority for any proceeding by a private person or group, or by any employee or group of employees, to secure enforcement of the Board's order. The vindication of the desired freedom of employees is thus confided by the Act, by reason of the recognized public interest, to the public agency the Act creates. Petitioner emphasizes the opportunity afforded to private persons by Section 10(f).7 But that opportunity is given to a person aggrieved by a final order of the Board which has granted or denied in whole or in part the relief sought. That is, it is an opportunity afforded to contest a final order of the Board, not to enforce it. The procedure on such a contest before the Circuit Court of Appeals is assimilated to that provided in Section 10(e) when the Board seeks an enforcement of its order. But that assimilation does not change the nature of the proceeding under Section 10(f), which seeks not to require compliance with the Board's order but to overturn it.\n What Congress said at the outset, that the power of the Board to prevent any unfair practice as defined in the Act is exclusive, is thus fully carried out at every stage of the proceeding. The text of the Act is so clear in this respect that there is no need to comment upon its legislative history. But this puts in a strong light the \n\n[309 \nU.S. 261, 267]\n\u00a0\n legislative intent. In the Senate, the Committee on Education and Labor in its report on the bill said:8\n'Section 10(a) gives the National Labor Relations Board exclusive jurisdiction to prevent and redress unfair labor practices, and, taken in conjunction with section 14, establishes clearly that this bill is paramount over other laws that might touch upon similar subject matters. Thus it is intended to dispel the confusion resulting from dispersion of authority and to establish a single paramount administrative or quasi- judicial authority in connection with the development of the Federal American law regarding collective bargaining'.\n\n And the Committee on Labor of the House of Representatives in its report stated:9\n'The Board is empowered, according to the procedure provided in section 10, to prevent any person from engaging in any unfair labor practice listed in section 8 'affecting commerce' as that term is defined in section 2(7). This power is vested exclusively in the Board and is not to be affected by any other means of adjustment or prevention. The Board is thus made the paramount agency for dealing with the unfair labor practices described in the bill'.\n\n After referring to the suitable adaptation of the Board's orders to the needs of particular cases, and especially to the power to reinstate employees with or without back pay, the Committee continued:\n'No private right of action is contemplated. Essentially the unfair labor practices listed are matters of public concern, by their nature and consequences, present or potential; the proceeding is in the name of the Board, upon the Board's formal complaint. The form of in- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 261, 268]\n\u00a0\n junctive and affirmative order is necessary to effectuate the purpose of the bill to remove obstructions to interstate commerce which are by the law declared to be detrimental to the public weal'.\n\n In both Houses of Congress, the Committees were careful to say that the procedure provided by the bill was analogous to that set up by the Federal Trade Commission Act, section 5,10 which was deemed to be 'familiar to all students of administrative law'. That procedure, which was found to be prescribed in the public interest as distinguished from provisions intended to afford remedies to private persons, was fully discussed by this Court in Federal Trade Commission v. Klesner, \n280 \nU.S. 19, 25\n, 50 S.Ct. 1, 2, 3, 68 A.L.R. 838, where it was said:\n'Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act does not provide private persons with an administrative remedy for private wrongs. The formal complaint is brought in the Commission's name; the prosecution is wholly that of the government; and it bears the entire expense of the prosecution. A person who deems himself aggrieved by the use of an unfair method of competition is not given the right to institute before the Commission a complaint against the alleged wrongdoer. Nor may the Commission authorize him to do so. He may of course bring the matter to the Commission's attention and request it to file a complaint. But a denial of his request is final. And if the request is granted and a proceeding is instituted, he does not become a party to it or have any control over it'.\n\n That sort of procedure concerning unfair competition was contrasted with that provided by the Interstate Commerce Act in relation to unjust discrimination. We said that 'in their bearing upon private rights' they are 'wholly dissimilar'. The Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq., im- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 261, 269]\n\u00a0\n poses upon the carrier many duties and creates in the individual corresponding rights. For the violation of the private right it affords 'a private administrative remedy'. The interested person can file as of right a complaint before the Interstate Commerce Commission and the carrier is required to make answer. We said that the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C.A.  41-51, 'contains no such features'. Id., 280 U.S. at page 26, 50 S.Ct. at page 3, 68 A.L.R. 838. The present Act, drawn in analogy to the Federal Trade Commission Act, contains no such features.\n As Congress has in this instance created a public agency entrusted by the terms of its creation with the exclusive authority for the enforcement of the provisions of the Act, decisions dealing with the legal obligations arising under the Railway Labor Act11 cannot be regarded as apposite. Texas & New Orleans R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Railway & S. S. Clerks, \n281 \nU.S. 548, 569\n, 570 S., 50 S.Ct. 427, 433; Virginian Railway Company v. System Federation No. 40, \n300 \nU.S. 515, 543\n, 544 S., 57 S.Ct. 592, 597.\n We think that the provision of the National Labor Relations Act conferring exclusive power upon the Board to prevent any unfair labor practice, as defined,-a power not affected by any other means of 'prevention that has been or may be established by agreement, code, law, or otherwise', necessarily embraces exclusive authority to institute proceedings for the violation of the court's decree directing enforcement. The decree in no way alters, but confirms, the position of the Board as the enforcing authority. It is the Board's order on behalf of the public that the court enforces. It is the Board's right to make that order that the court sustains. The Board seeks enforcement as a public agent, not to give effect to a 'private administrative remedy'. Both the order and the decree are aimed at the prevention of the \n\n[309 \nU.S. 261, 270]\n\u00a0\n unfair labor practice. If the decree of enforcement is disobeyed, the unfair labor practice is still not prevented. The Board still remains as the sole authority to secure that prevention. The appropriate procedure to that end is to ask the court to punish the violation of its decree as a contempt. As the court has no jurisdiction to enforce the order at the suit of any private person or group of persons, we think it is clear that the court cannot entertain a petition for violation of its decree of enforcement save as the Board presents it. As the Conference Report upon the bill stated,12 in case the unfair labor practice is resumed, 'there will be immediately available to the Board an existing court decree to serve as a basis for contempt proceedings'.\n The order of the Court of Appeals denying petitioner's motion is affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice MURPHY took no part in the consideration and decision of this cause. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 49 Stat. 449, 29 U.S.C.  151, et seq., 29 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 29 U.S.C.  157, 29 U.S.C.A.  157. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 29 U.S.C.  160(a), 29 U.S.C.A.  160(a). \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] 29 U.S.C.  160(b), 29 U.S.C.A.  160(b). \n[\nFootnote 5\n] 29 U.S.C.  160(c), 29 U.S.C.A.  160(c). \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Section 160(e). \n[\nFootnote 7\n] 29 U.S.C.  160(f), 29 U.S.C.A.  160(f). \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Sen.Rep.

NATIONAL L. R. BOARD(1940)\nNo. 70\nArgued: Decided: January 2, 1940\n\n\n\n Mr. Joseph A. Padway, of Washington, D.C., for petitioners.\n Mr. Charles Fahy, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question decisive of this case is whether a certification by the National Labor Relations Board under \n\n[308 \nU.S. 401, 402]\n\u00a0\n s 9(c) of the Wagner Act, 49 Stat. 449, 453, 29 U.S.C., Supp. IV,  151- 166, 29 U.S.C.A.  151-166, that a particular labor organization of longshore workers is the collective bargaining representative of the employees in a designated unit, composed of numerous employers of longshore workers at Pacific Coast ports, is reviewable by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia by the procedure set up in  10(f) of the Act.\n Petitioners, International Longshoremen's Association, and its affiliate, Pacific Coast District International Longshoremen's Association No. 38, are labor organizations, both affiliated with the petitioner, American Federation of Labor (A.F. of L.). In January, 1938, the International Longshoremen's & Warehousemen's Union, District No. 1, a labor organization affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organization ( C.I.O.) petitioned the Board for an investigation concerning the representation of longshoremen on the Pacific Coast, and that the Board certify the name of the appropriate representative for collective bargaining as provided in  9(c) of the Wagner Act.\n The Board directed an investigation with appropriate hearings, and a consolidation of the proceeding for purposes of hearing with two other proceedings already initiated by locals of the Longshoremen's Union. Petitioners were made parties to the consolidated proceedings and participated in the hearings, at the conclusion of which the Board made its findings of fact and of law and certified that the workers who do longshore work in the Pacific Coast ports for the employers which are members of five designated employer associations of Pacific Coast shipowners or of waterfront employers, constitute a unit appropriate for the purposes of collective bargaining within the meaning of  9(b) of the Act. It also certified that the C.I.O. affiliate, Longshoremen's Union, \n\n[308 \nU.S. 401, 403]\n\u00a0\n District No. 1, is the exclusive bargaining representative of all the workers in such unit within the meaning of the Act. In the Matter of Shipowners' Association of the Pacific Coast et al., 7 N.L.R.B. 1002\n\n\n The effect of the certification, as petitioner alleges, is the inclusion in single unit for bargaining purposes, of all of the longshore employees of the members of the employer associations doing business at the west coast ports of the United States, and to designate the C.I.O. affiliate as their bargaining representative so that in the case of some particular employers, their workers who are not organized or represented by the C.I.O. affiliate have been deprived of opportunity to secure bargaining representatives of their own choice. Although the petitioners who are affiliated with the A.F. of L. assert that they have in fact been selected as bargaining representatives by a majority of the employees of their respective employers, petitioners allege that they have nevertheless been prevented from acting in that capacity by the Board's designation of the C.I.O. affiliate as the exclusive representative of such employees.\n The present suit was begun by petition to the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia in which the petitioners set forth, in addition to the facts already detailed, that they were aggrieved by the 'decision and order of certification of the Board' in that the certificate is contrary to fact and to law; that the Wagner Act does not contemplate or authorize 'the designation by the Board of an employee unit constituting all the employees of different employers in different and distant geographical districts of the United States.' The petition prayed that the 'order of certification' be set aside, in so far as it attempts to designate a single exclusive bargaining representative for longshore employees of many employers on the Pacific Coast and denies to a majority of the longshore \n\n[308 \nU.S. 401, 404]\n\u00a0\n employees of a single employer the right to select one of the petitioners as their exclusive bargaining representative.\n The Court of Appeals dismissed the petition is not within the jurisdiction to review orders of the Board conferred upon it by  10 of the Wagner Act. 70 App.D.C. 62, 103 F.2d 933. We granted certiorari October 9, 1939, \n308 \nU.S. 531\n, 60 S.Ct. 76, 84 L.Ed. --, because of the importance of the question presented and to resolve an alleged conflict of the decision below with that of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers v. National Labor Relations Board, 105 F.2d 598.\n The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, like the several circuit courts of appeals, is without the jurisdiction over original suits conferred on district courts by  24 of the Judicial Code, as amended. 28 U.S.C.  41, 28 U.S.C.A.  41. Such jurisdiction as it has, to review directly the action of administrative agencies, is specially conferred by legislation relating specifically to the determinations of such agencies made subject to review, and prescribing the manner and extent of the review. Here, the provisions of the Wagner Act,  10(f), which gives a right of review to 'any person aggrieved by a final order of the Board', determines the nature and scope of the review by the court of appeals.\n The single issue which we are now called on to decide is whether the certification by the Board is an 'order' which, by related provisions of the statute, is made reviewable upon petition to the Court of Appeals of the District or in an appropriate case to a circuit court of appeals. The question is distinct from another much argued at the Bar, whether petitioners are precluded by the provisions of the Wagner Act from maintaining an independent suit in a district court to set aside the Board's action because contrary to the statute, and be- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 401, 405]\n\u00a0\n cause it inflicts on petitioners an actionable injury otherwise irreparable.\n By the provisions of the Wagner Act the Board is given two principal functions to perform. One, defined by  9, which as enacted is headed 'Representatives And Elections', is the certification, after appropriate investigation and hearing, of the name or names of representatives, for collective bargaining, of an appropriate unit of employees. The other, defined by  10, which as enacted is headed 'Prevention of Unfair Labor Practices', is the prevention by the Board's order after hearing and by a further appropriate proceeding in court, of the unfair labor practices enumerated in  8, 29 U.S.C.A.  158. One of the outlawed practices is the refusal of an employer to bargain with the representative of his employees .  8(5).\n Certification involves, under  9(b), decision by the Board whether 'the unit appropriate for the purposes of collective bargaining shall be the employer unit, craft unit, plant unit, or subdivision thereof', and the ascertainment by the Board under  9(c) of the bargaining representative who, under  9(a) must be 'designated or selected ... by the majority of the employees in a unit appropriate for such (bargaining) purposes'. The Board is authorized by  9(c) 'whenever a question affecting commerce arises concerning the representation of employees' to investigate 'such controversy' and to certify the names of the appropriate bargaining representatives. In conducting the investigation it is required to provide for appropriate hearing upon due notice 'and may take a secret ballot of employees, or utilize any other suitable method' of ascertaining such representatives. By  9(d) whenever an order of the Board is made pursuant to  10(c) directing any person to cease an unfair labor practice and there is a petition for enforcement or review of the order by a court, the \n\n[308 \nU.S. 401, 406]\n\u00a0\n Board's 'certification and the record of such investigation' is to be included in the transcript of the entire record required to be filed under  10(e) or (f), and the decree of the court enforcing, modifying or setting aside the order of the Board is to be made and entered upon the pleadings, testimony and proceedings set forth in the transcript.\n It is to be noted that  9, which is complete in itself, makes no provision, in terms, for review of a certification by the Board and authorizes no use of the certification or of the record in a certification proceeding, except in the single case where there is a petition for enforcement or review of an order restraining an unfair labor practice as authorized by  10(c). In that event the record in the certification proceeding is included in the record brought up on review of the Board's order restraining an unfair labor practice. It then becomes a part of the record upon which the decree of the reviewing court is to be based.\n All other provisions for review of any action of the Board are found in  10 which as its heading indicates relates to the prevention of unfair labor practices. Nowhere in this section is there mention of investigations or certifications authorized and defined by  9. Section 10( a) authorizes the Board 'to prevent any person from engaging in any unfair labor practice (listed in section 8(158)) affecting commerce'. Section 10( b) prescribes the procedure of the Board when any person is charged with engaging in any unfair labor practice, and requires that the person so charged shall be served with a complaint and notice of hearing by the Board with opportunity to file an answer and be heard. Section 10(c) directs the Board, if it is of opinion, as the result of the proceedings before it, that any person named in the complaint has engaged in an unfair labor practice 'to issue' 'an order' directing that person to cease the practice and command- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 401, 407]\n\u00a0\n ing appropriate affirmative action. If the Board is of opinion that there has been no unfair labor practice it is directed 'to issue' 'an order' dismissing the complaint. Section 10(e) authorizes a petition to the appropriate federal court of appeals by the Board for the enforcement of its order prohibiting an unfair labor practice.\n This brings us to the provisions for review of action taken by the Board in  10(f) which is controlling in the present proceeding. That subdivision1 appears as an integral part of  10. All the other subdivisions relate exclusively to proceedings for the prevention of unfair labor practices. Both they and subdivision (f) are silent as to the proceedings or certifications authorized by  9. Section 10(f), providing for review, speaks only of a 'final order of the Board'. It gives a right to review to persons aggrieved by a final order upon petition to a court of appeals in the circuit 'wherein the unfair labor prac- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 401, 408]\n\u00a0\n tice in question was alleged to have been engaged in or wherein such person resides or transacts business, or in the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia'. It directs that the order shall be reviewed on the entire record before the Board 'including the pleading and testimony' upon which the order complained of was entered, although no complaint or other pleading is mentioned by  9 relating to representation proceedings and certificates. Subdivision (f) provides that upon petition for review by an aggrieved person 'the court shall proceed in the same manner as in the case of an application by the Board under subdivision (subsection) (e)', and it is given the same jurisdiction 'to grant to the Board such temporary relief or restraining order as it deems just and proper, and in like manner to make and enter a decree enforcing, modifying, and enforcing as so modified, or setting aside in whole or in part the order of the Board.' See, Ford Motor Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, \n305 \nU.S. 364, 369\n, 59 S.Ct. 301, 305.\n In analyzing the provisions of the statute in order to ascertain its true meaning, we attribute little importance to the fact that the certification does not itself command action. Administrative determinations which are not commands may for all practical purposes determine rights as effectively as the judgment of a court, and may be reexamined by courts under particular statutes providing for the review of 'orders'. See Rochester Telephone Corporation v. United States, \n307 \nU.S. 125, 130\n, 135 S. et seq., 59 S.Ct. 754, 757, 759; Federal Power Commission v. Pacific Power & Light Co., \n307 \nU.S. 156\n, 59 S.Ct. 766. We must look rather to the language of the statute, read in the light of its purpose and its legislative history, to ascertain whether the 'order' for which the review in court is provided, is contrasted with forms of administrative action differently described as a purposeful means of excluding them from the review provisions. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 401, 409]\n\u00a0\n Here it is evident that the entire structure of the Act emphasizes, for purposes of review, the distinction between an 'order' of the Board restraining an unfair labor practice and a certification in representation proceedings. The one authorized by  10 may be reviewed by the court on petition of the Board for enforcement of the order, or of a person aggrieved, in conformity to the procedure laid down in  10, which says nothing of certifications. The other, authorized by  9, is nowhere spoken of as an order, and no procedure is prescribed for its review apart from an order prohibiting an unfair labor practice. The exclusion of representation proceedings from the review secured by the provisions of  10(f) is emphasized by the clauses of  9(d), which provide for certification by the Board of a record of a representation proceeding only in the case when there is a petition for review of an order of the Board restraining an unfair labor practice. The statute on its face thus indicates a purpose to limit the review afforded by  10 to orders of the Board prohibiting unfair labor proactices, a purpose and a construction which its legislative history confirms.\n Upon the introduction of the bill which was enacted as the Wagner Act, Congress had pointedly brought to its attention the experience under Public Resolution 44 of June 19, 1934, 48 Stat. 1183. That resolution authorized the National Labor Relations Board, predecessor of respondent, 'to order and conduct an election' by employees of any employer to determine who were their representatives for bargaining purposes. Section 2 provided that any order of the Board should be reviewed in the same manner as orders of the Federal Trade Commission under the Federal Trade Commission Act. The reports of the Congressional committees upon the bill which became the Wagner Act refer to the long delays in the procedure prescribed by Resolution 44, resulting from applications to the federal appellate courts for review of orders for elec- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 401, 410]\n\u00a0\n tions. \n2\n And in considering the provisions of  9(d) the committee reports were emphatic in their declaration that the provisions of the bill for court review did not extend to proceedings under  9 except as incidental to review of an order restraining an unfair labor practice under  10.3 \n\n[308 \nU.S. 401, 411]\n\u00a0\n The bill was similarly explained on the Senate floor by the committee chairman who declared: 'It provides for review in the courts only after the election has been held and the Board has ordered the employer to do something predicated upon the results of an election.' 79 Cong.Rec., 7658. The conclusion is unavoidable that Congress, as the result of a deliberate choice of conflicting policies, has excluded representation certifications of the Board from the review by federal appellate courts authorized by the Wagner Act except in the circumstances specified in  9(d).\n An argument, much pressed upon us, is, in effect, that Congress was mistaken in its judgment that the hearing before the Board in proceedings under  9(c), with review only when an order is made under  10(c) directing the employer to do something 'provides an appropriate safeguard and opportunity to be heard', House Rep., p. 23, and that 'this provides a complete guarantee against arbitrary action by the Board,' Sen.Rep., p. 14. It seems to be thought that this failure to provide for a court review is productive of peculiar hardships, which were perhaps not foreseen in cases where the interests of rival unions are affected. \n4\n But these are arguments to be addressed to \n\n[308 \nU.S. 401, 412]\n\u00a0\n Congress and not the courts. The argument too that Congress has infringed due process by withholding from federal appellate courts a jurisdiction which they never possessed is similarly without force. Shannahan v. United States, \n303 \nU.S. 596\n, 58 S.Ct. 732; see In re National Labor Relations Board, \n304 \nU.S. 486, 495\n, 58 S.Ct. 1001, 1005.\n The Board argues that the provisions of the Wagner Act, particularly  9(d), have foreclosed review of its challenged action by independent suit in the district court, such as was allowed under other acts providing for a limited court review in Shields v. Utah Idaho Central Railroad Co., \n305 \nU.S. 177\n, 59 S.Ct. 160, and in Utah Fuel Co. v. National Bituminous Coal Commission, \n306 \nU.S. 56\n, 59 S.Ct. 409; cf. Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., \n303 \nU.S. 41\n, 58 S.Ct. 459. But that question is not presented for decision by the record before us. Its answer involves a determination whether the Wagner Act, in so far as it has given legally enforceable rights, has deprived the district courts of some portion of their original jurisdiction conferred by  24 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A.  41. It can be appropriately answered only upon a showing in such a suit that unlawful action of the Board has inflicted an injury on the petitioners for which the law, apart from the review provisions of the Wagner Act, affords a remedy. This question can be properly and adequately considered only when it is brought to us for review upon a suitable record.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] '(f) Any person aggrieved by a final order of the Board granting or denying in whole or in part the relief sought may obtain a review of such order in any circuit court of appeals of the United States in the circuit wherein the unfair labor practice in question was alleged to have been engaged in or wherein such person resides or transacts business, or in the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, by filing in such court a written petition praying that the order of the Board be modified or set aside. A copy of such petition shall be forthwith served upon the Board, and thereupon the aggrieved party shall file in the court a transcript of the entire record in the proceeding, certified by the Board, including the pleading and testimony upon which the order complained of was entered and the findings and order of the Board. Upon such filing, the court shall proceed in the same manner as in the case of an application by the Board under subsection (e), and shall have the same exclusive jurisdiction to grant to the Board such temporary relief or restraining order as it deems just and proper, and in like manner to make and enter a decree enforcing, modifying, and enforcing as so modified, or setting aside in whole or in part the order of the Board; and the findings of the Board as to the facts, if supported by evidence, shall, in like manner be conclusive.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 'Weaknesses in Existing Law. ... (6) Obstacles to elections.- Under Public Resolution 44, any attempt by the Government to conduct an election of representatives may be contested ab initio in the courts, although such election is in reality merely a preliminary determination of fact. This means that the Government can be delayed indefinitely before it takes the first step toward industrial peace. After almost a year not a single case, in which a company has chosen to contest an election order of the Board, has reached decision in any circuit court of appeals.' Sen.Rep. No. 573, Committee on Education and Labor, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 5, 6.\n After referring to the procedure for review under Public Resolution 44, the House Committee declared: 'The weakness of this procedure is that under the provision for review of election orders employers have a means of holding up the election for months by an application to the circuit court of appeals. ... At the present time 10 cases for review of the Board's election orders are pending in circuit courts of appeals. Only three have been argued and none have been decided.' House Rep., No. 1147, Committee on Labor, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 6. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] 'There is no more reason for court review prior to an election than for court review prior to a hearing. But if subsequently the Board makes an order predicated upon the election, such as an order to bargain collectively with elected representatives, then the entire election procedure becomes part of the record upon which the order of the Board is based, and is fully reviewable by an aggrieved party in the Federal courts in the manner provided in section 10. And this review would include within its scope the action of the Board in determining the appropriate unit for purposes of the election. This provides a complete guarantee against arbitrary action by the Board.' Sen.Rep. 573, Committee on Education and Labor, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 14.\n'As previously stated in this report, the efficacy of Public Resolution 44 has been substantially impaired by the provision for court review of election orders prior to the holding of the election. Section 9( d) of the bill makes clear that there is to be no court review prior to the holding of the election, and provides an exclusive, complete, and adequate remedy whenever an order of the Board made pursuant to section 10( c) is based in whole or in part upon facts certified following an election or other investigation pursuant to section 9(c). The hearing required to be held in any such investigation provides an appropriate safeguard and opportunity to be heard. Since the certification and the record of the investigation are required to be included in the transcript of the entire record filed pursuant to section 10(e) or (f), the Board's actions and determinations of fact and law in regard thereto will be subject to the same court review as is provided for its other determinations under sections 10(b) and 10(c).' House Rep., No. 1147, Committee on Labor, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 23. \n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Congress apparently recognized that representation proceedings under  9(c) might involve rival unions. The House Committee said: 'Section 9(c) makes provisions for elections to be conducted by the Board or its agents or agencies to ascertain the representatives of employees. The question will ordinarily arise as between two or more bona fide organizations competing to represent the employees, but the authority granted here is broad enough to take in the not infrequent case where only one such organized group is pressing for recognition, and its claim of representation is challenged.'

Pleus, of Orlando, Fla., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The District Court confirmed a plan for the composition of the debts of respondent under Ch. IX of the Bankruptcy Act, 50 Stat. 653, 52 Stat. 939, 940, 11 U.S.C.A.  401 et seq. \n1\n The \n\n[311 \nU.S. 138, 141]\n\u00a0\n Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that order. 5 Cir., 108 F.2d 1010. Petitioner, a creditor of the city, having objected to the confirmation in the courts below, brought the case here on a petition for certiorari, which we granted in view of the importance of the problems in the administration of the composition and reorganization provisions of the Act.\n The city's composition was a refunding plan worked out by it and its fiscal agent,2 R. E. Crummer & Co. Pursuant to the fiscal agency contract both parties were to use their best efforts to induce the creditors to participate in the plan. The city was not to pay any of the costs of the refunding as Crummer was to defray all expenses incident to assembling the bonds, printing the refunding bonds, representing the city in proceedings to validate the new bonds, obtaining a legal opinion approving the bonds, etc. The fiscal agency contract provided that Crummer was to be compensated for its services and reimbursed for its expenses by assessing charges against the participating bondholders. This charge was $40 for each $1,000 bond; or in case the bondholders elected to sell Crummer the interest coupons, accrued to July 1, 1937, at one-third of their face amount,3 the charge was to be $20 per $1,000 bond. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 138, 142]\n\u00a0\n Crummer solicited assents to the plan. Approximately 69% of the bondholders accepted. But for the claims held by the Crummer interests,4 and voted in favor of the plan, the requisite two-thirds statutory vote, however, would not have been obtained. Some of these claims had been purchased prior to the fiscal agency contract, some later. The average price was apparently about 53\u00f5 on the dollar. The inference seems clear that some of them were acquired in order to facilitate consummation of the composition by placing them in friendly hands. But the record does not show whether or not Crummer disclosed to the bondholders when their assents were solicited that it was a creditor as well as the city's fiscal agent, the extent of the claims held by it and its affiliate, the circumstances surrounding their acquisi- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 138, 143]\n\u00a0\n tion, and its intent to vote those claims in favor of the plan. No such disclosure was made in the plan.\n The District Court, however, found that the two-thirds of the aggregate amount of claims affected by the plan, required by  83, sub. d, 11 U.S.C.  403(d), 11 U.S.C.A.  403, sub. d, for confirmation, had assented. It also found that Crummer's compensation was fair and reasonable, that the plan and its acceptance were in good faith, and that the plan was fair, equitable and for the best interests of the creditors, and did not discriminate unfairly in favor of any creditor.\n We disagree. The order of confirmation must be set aside. It cannot be said that the plan does not discriminate unfairly in favor of any creditor, that the acceptances were in good faith, that the requisite two- thirds vote of approval had been obtained.\n Crummer had at least5 three financial stakes in this composition: (1) the fee to be collected from the bondholders; (2) its speculative position in such of the interest accruals as it might acquire from the bondholders at a third of their face amount; (3) the profit which might accrue to it or its affiliate, as a result of the refunding, on bonds acquired at default prices.\n The court found that the first of these items was reasonable. But it apparently deemed the others irrelevant to the inquiry. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 138, 144]\n\u00a0\n Clearly, however, no finding could be made under  83, sub. b, 11 U.S. C.  403(b), 11 U.S.C.A  403, sub. b, that the compensation to be received by the fiscal agent was reasonable without passing on the worth of the aggregate of all the emoluments accruing to the Crummer interests as a result of consummation of the plan. Since that inquiry would necessitate an appraisal of the fiscal agent's speculative position in the plan, perhaps the definitive finding demanded by the Act could not be made. Yet that is a chance which the fiscal agent, not the bondholders, must take; for it is the agent who is seeking the aid of the court in obtaining one of the benefits of the Act. Moreover, to the extent that the aggregate benefits flowing to the Crummer interests, exceeded reasonable compensation for services rendered, their reward would exceed what the court could authorize under  83(b), 11 U.S.C.  403(b), 11 U.S.C.A.  403, sub. b. Furthermore, if any such excess benefits would accrue to them, then the plan would run afoul of  83, sub. e(1), 11 U.S.C.  403(e)(1), 11 U.S.C.A.  403, sub. e(1). For in that event the plan would discriminate unfairly in favor of the Crummer interests as creditors.\n Hence the lack of that essential finding would be fatal in any case. It is especially serious here in view of the fact that without the vote of the fiscal agent the requisite two-thirds acceptance would not have been obtained. Where it does not affirmatively appear that full and complete disclosure of the fiscal agent's interests was made to the bondholders when their assents were solicited, it cannot be said that those assents were fairly obtained. Cf. Rogers v. Guaranty Trust Co., \n288 \nU.S. 123, 143\n, 53 S.Ct. 295, 302, 89 A.L.R. 720. And where without such disclosure the fiscal agent's vote was cast for acceptance of the plan, it cannot be said that such acceptance was in 'good faith' within the meaning of  83, sub. e (5), 11 U.S.C.  403(e)(5), 11 U.S.C.A.  403, sub. e(5). Here the fiscal agent was acting in a dual capacity. While \n\n[311 \nU.S. 138, 145]\n\u00a0\n it was representing the city, it likewise purported to represent the interests of bondholders. The very minimum requirement for fair dealing was the elementary obligation of full disclosure of all its interests, and the burden was on it to show at least that such disclosure was made. Equity and good conscience obviously will not permit a finding that an acceptance of of a plan by a person acting in a representative capacity is in 'good faith' where that person is obtaining an undisclosed benefit from the plan.\n We have emphasized that full disclosure is the minimum requirement in order not to imply that it is the limit of the power and duty of the bankruptcy court in these situations. As this court stated in Securities and Exchange Commission v. United States Realty & Improvement Co., \n310 \nU.S. 434, 455\n, 60 S.Ct. 1044, 1053: 'A bankruptcy court is a court of equity,  2, 11 U.S.C.  11, 11 U.S.C.A.  11, and is guided by equitable doctrines and principles except in so far as they are inconsistent with the Act. ... A court of equity may in its discretion in the exercise of the jurisdiction committed to it grant or deny relief upon performance of a condition which will safeguard the public interest.' And see Papper v. Litton, \n308 \nU.S. 295\n, 304 et seq., 60 S.Ct. 238, 244. These principles are a part of the control which the court has over the whole process of formulation and approval of plans of composition or reorganization, and the obtaining of assents thereto. As we said in Case v. Los Angeles Lumber Products Co., \n308 \nU.S. 106, 114\n, 60 S.Ct. 1, 6, 'The court is not merely a ministerial register of the vote of the several classes of security holders.' The responsibility of the court entails scrutiny of the circumstances surrounding the acceptances, the special or ulterior motives which may have induced them, the time of acquiring the claims so voting, the amount paid therefor, and the like. See Continental Insurance Co. v. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 138, 146]\n\u00a0\n Louisiana Oil Refining Corp., 5 Cir., 89 F.2d 333. Only after such investigation can the court exercise the 'informed, independent judgment' ( National Surety Co. v. Coriell, \n289 \nU.S. 426, 436\n, 53 S.Ct. 678, 682, 88 A.L.R. 1231; Case v. Los Angeles Lumber Products Co., supra, 308 U.S. page 115, 60 S.Ct. 7) which is an essential prerequisite for confirmation of a plan. And that is true whether the assents to the plan have been obtained prior to the filing of the petition or subsequent thereto.\n Where such investigation discloses the existence of unfair dealing, a breach of fiduciary obligations, profiting from a trust, special benefits for the reorganizers, or the need for protection of investors against an inside few or of one class of investors from the encroachments of another, the court has ample power to adjust the remedy to meet the need. The requirement of full, unequivocal disclosure; the limitation of the vote to the amount paid for the securities (In re McEwen's Laundry, Inc., 6 Cir., 90 F.2d 872); the separate classification of claimants (see First National Bank v. Poland Union, 2 Cir., 109 F.2d 54, 55); the complete subordination of some claims (Taylor v. Standard Gas & Electric Co., \n306 \nU.S. 307\n, 59 S. Ct. 543; Pepper v. Litton, supra), indicate the range and type of the power which a court of bankruptcy may exercise in these proceedings. That power is ample for the exigencies of varying situations. It is not dependent on express statutory provisions. It inheres in the jurisdiction of a court of bankruptcy. The necessity for its exercise ( Pepper v. Litton, supra, 308 U.S. page 308, 60 S.Ct. 246) is based on the responsibility of the court before entering an order of confirmation to be satisfied that the plan in its practical incidence embodies a fair and equitable bargain openly arrived at and devoid of overreaching, however subtle. Neglect of that duty is apparent here by inclusion of the vote of the claims held by the Crummer interests in computing the requisite statutory assents, without protection of the public investors through the \n\n[311 \nU.S. 138, 147]\n\u00a0\n requirement of full disclosure and of other appropriate safeguards. By the same token allowance of compensation to Crummer without scrutiny of Crummer's speculation in the securities does not comport with the standards for surveillance required of courts of bankruptcy before confirming plans of composition or reorganization or before making such allowances.\n The scope of the power of the court embraces denial of compensation to those who have purchased or sold securities during or in contemplation of the proceedings. As in case of reorganizations under former  77B, 11 U. S.C.A.  207, the provision in  83, sub. b, 11 U.S.C.  403(b), 11 U.S.C. A.  403, sub. b, for allowance of 'reasonable compensation' for 'services rendered' necessarily implies 'loyal and disinterested service in the interest of the persons' for whom the claimant purported to act. In re Paramount-Publix Corp., D.C., 12 F.Supp. 823, 828.\n Beyond that is the question of unfair discrimination to which we have adverted. Compositions under Ch. IX, like compositions under the old  12, 11 U.S.C.A.  30, envisage equality of treatment of creditors. Under that section and its antecedents, a composition would not be confirmed where one creditor was obtaining some special favor or inducement not accorded the others, whether that consideration moved from the debtor or from another. In re Sawyer, Fed.Cas.No.12,395; In re Weintrob, D.C., 240 F. 532; In re M. & H. Gordon, D.C., 245 F. 905. As stated by Judge Lowell in Re Sawyer, supra, 'if a vote is influenced by the expectation of advantage, though without any positive promise, it cannot be considered an honest and unbiased vote.' That rule of compositions is but part of the general rule of 'equality between creditors' (Clarke v. Rogers, \n228 \nU.S. 534, 548\n, 33 S. Ct. 587, 591) applicable in all bankruptcy proceedings. That principle has been imbedded by Congress in Ch. IX by the express provision against unfair discrimination. That principle as applied \n\n[311 \nU.S. 138, 148]\n\u00a0\n to this case necessitates a reversal. In absence of a finding that the aggregate emoluments receivable by the Crummer interests were reasonable, measured by the services rendered, it cannot be said that the consideration accruing to them, under or as a consequence of the adoption of the plan, likewise accrued to all other creditors of the same class. Accordingly, the imprimatur of the federal court should not have been placed on this plan. The fact that the vast majority of security holders may have approved a plan is not the test of whether that plan satisfies the statutory standard. The former is not a substitute for the latter. They are independent. See Case v. Los Angeles Lumber Products Co., supra, 308 U.S. pages 114, 115, 60 S.Ct. 6, 7.\n Since the cause must be remanded there are two other matters which should be mentioned. Sec. 83, sub. d, 11 U.S.C.  403(d), 11 U.S.C.A.  403, sub. d, provides that in computing the statutory two-thirds vote necessary for confirmation of a plan all claims 'owned, held, or controlled' by the city shall be excluded. So far as appears, the claims held by the Crummer interests were not owned by or held for the city. Yet it is by no means clear that they were not 'controlled' by the city within the meaning of the Act. Claims held by a city's fiscal agent presumptively would seem to fall in that prohibited category. The abuse at which the Act is aimed is not confined to those cases where the holder of the claims is an agent of the city within the strict rules of respondeat superior. Rather, the test is whether or not there is such close identity of interests between the claimant and the city that the claimant's assent to the plan may fairly be said to be more the product of the city's influence and to reflect more the city's desires than an expression of an investor's independent, business judgment. Here there was such a close identity of interests between Crummer and the city \n\n[311 \nU.S. 138, 149]\n\u00a0\n vis-a -vis the refunding as to raise grave doubts as to the propriety of allowing those claims to vote in any event. That, however, is a question for appropriate findings by the court should another plan be presented.\n Petitioner also urges that the fiscal agency contract between Crummer and the city was illegal under the decisions of the Supreme Court of Florida in Taylor v. Williams, 142 Fla. 402, 195 So. 175; 142 Fla. 562, 195 So. 184; 142 Fla. 756, 196 So. 214, and W. J. Howey Co. v. Williams, 142 Fla. 415, 195 So. 181. Under  83, sub. e (6), 11 U.S.C.  403(e)(6), 11 U.S.C.A.  403, sub. e(6), the court must be satisfied that the city 'is authorized by law to take all action necessary to be taken by it to carry out the plan' before it may enter a decree of confirmation. Plainly that finding could not be made if it was clear, for example, that a taxpayer could enjoin the issuance of the new bonds or the levy of assessments therefor. The courts below did not pass on the applicability of these recent Florida decisions to this fiscal agency contract since they were decided after the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the order of confirmation. Nor do we undertake to decide the question in view of our disposition of the case. It is, however, a relevant inquiry to be made by the District Court as, if and when another plan of composition is presented, which directly or indirectly involves any such fiscal agency contract.\n For the reasons stated, we reverse the judgment below and remand the cause to the District Court for proceedings in conformity with this opinion. It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Act of August 16, 1937, 50 Stat. 653, under which the petition was filed expired June 30, 1940, except in respect to proceedings initiated on or prior to that date. That Act, however, was amended by the Act of June 28, 1940, No. 669, 76th Cong., c. 438, 3d Sess., 11 U.S.C.A.  401, 403, 404, which, inter alia, extended for another two years the time for filing petitions. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] R. E. Crummer & Co. is a Delaware corporation organized primarily to represent clients of an affiliate (see infra, note 4) who had purchased bonds in Florida. Beginning in 1931, it had handled the debt problems of over 200 taxing units. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Under the original plan all such accrued interest coupons were to be acquired by Crummer at 33 1\/3% of the face amount, which when refunded into new bonds, would be held by it subject to purchase by the City at not exceeding 50% of the face thereof for the first six months, 60% for the succeeding six months, 70% for the next six months, and 75% for the following six months. Due to fears of illegality, the plan was modified. As modified it provided that compensation of the fiscal agent was to be 4% of the principal debt with the right of any creditor to sell to Crummer the interest accruals at 33 1\/3% of their face amount. In the latter event the charge against him was reduced to 2% and Crummer held the securities so obtained subject to the right of the city to acquire them at the rates above indicated. The fiscal agent estimated that it would get substantially the same amount of money out of the plan whichever option the bondholders elected.\n Interest accruals were to be escrowed. Proceeds of the collection of delinquent taxes were to be remitted to the escrow agent who would reduce the amount owed by the city under the escrow by such amount as would result in the particular proceeds constituting a pro tanto payment and discharge at 50% of par during the first six months, 60% during the next six months, 70% during the next six months, and 75% during the following six months.\n Thus in effect the interest accruals could be offset against delinquent taxes, the city being able to retire some of its debt at less than par if it could stimulate tax collections. The proceeds received by the escrow agent were to be held for the benefit of the depositors. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] R. E. Crummer & Co. and Brown-Crummer Investment Co. R. E. Crummer was president of both. A majority of the boards of both corporations was identical. The Crummer interests had acquired over a third of the claims. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] There were other emoluments for Crummer. It was granted 'exclusive authority' to act for and on behalf of the city for a period of three years 'in all matters connected with, or relating to, the exchange.' And in case any bonds or coupons were presented for payment or suit instituted thereon the city agreed to give Crummer notice before any terms of settlement were agreed upon. These provisions, the fact that the Crummer interests hold large blocks of claims acquired at default prices, the likely interest of Crummer in the accrued coupons and its strategic position all point towards future speculative possibilities which are not inconsiderable, whatever may be said of their unhealthy impact on the city and the public investors alike. \n\n\n\n\n","3":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nANDERSON v. HELVERING(1940)\nNo. 682\nArgued: April 2, 1940Decided: May 20, 1940\n\n\n\n\n[310 \nU.S. 404, 405]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles H. Garnett, of Oklahoma City, for petitioners.\n Mr. J. Louis Monarch, Sp. Asst. to Atty. Gen., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Oklahoma City Company in 1931 owned certain royalty interests, fee interests, and deferred oil payments in properties in Oklahoma. During that year it entered into a written contract with petitioner Prichard providing for the conveyance to him of these interests for the agreed consideration of one hundred sixty thousand dollars, payable fifty thousand in cash and one hundred ten thousand from one-half of the proceeds received by him which might be derived from oil and gas produced from the properties and from the sale of fee title to any or all of \n\n[310 \nU.S. 404, 406]\n\u00a0\n the land conveyed. Interest at the rate of 6% per annum was to be paid from the proceeds of production and of sales upon the unpaid balance. Oklahoma Company was to have in addition a first lien and claim against 'that one half of all oil and gas production and fee interest ... from which the $110,000 is payable', the lien and claim 'not in any way (to) affect the one-half interest in all oil and gas production and fee interest or the revenue therefrom which ... (it) is to have and receive under this agreement.' The proceeds derived from the oil and gas produced and from sales of the fee interests were to be paid directly to Prichard who was to deposit one-half of them at a designated bank, at intervals of 90 days, to the credit of Oklahoma Company. The agreement recited that Oklahoma Company desired 'to sell all of its right, title and interest of whatsoever nature' in the described properties, and provided that a copy of the agreement and a release be placed in escrow for delivery to Prichard upon payment in full of the one hundred ten thousand dollars and interest. Immediately upon the execution of the contract the properties were conveyed to Prichard without reservation. \n1\n In entering into the agreement Prichard acted not only for himself but also for petitioner Anderson, each of them having a 45% interest. \n 2\n\u00a0\n\n The gross proceeds derived from the production and sale of oil from the properties3 during 1932 amounted to \n\n[310 \nU.S. 404, 407]\n\u00a0\n some eighty-one thousand dollars. Prichard, upon receiving this sum, distributed one-half to Oklahoma Company pursuant to the contract. The question for decision is whether the proceeds thus paid over to Oklahoma Company should be included in the gross income of petitioner for the tax year 1932.4 The ruling of the Board of Tax Appeals against petitioners was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 10 Cir., 107 F.2d 459. Because of an asserted conflict with the applicable decisions of this Court, we granted certiorari. 60 S.Ct. 609, 84 L.Ed. --. March 4, 1940\n\n\n It is settled that the same basis issue determines both to whom income derived from the production of oil and gas is taxable and to whom a deduction for depletion is allowable. That issue is, who has a capital investment in the oil and gas in place and what is the extent of his interest. Helvering v. Bankline Oil Co., \n303 \nU.S. 362, 367\n, 58 S.Ct. 616, 618; Helvering v.

No. 383, October Term, 1939\n\n\n\n Oil and gas reserves like other minerals in place, are recognized as wasting assets. The production of oil and gas, like the mining of ore, is treated as an incomeproducing operation, not as a conversion of capital investment as upon a sale, and is said to resemble a manufac- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 404, 408]\n\u00a0\n turing business carried on by the use of the soil.

Howbert, \n231 \nU.S. 399, 414\n, 34 S.Ct. 136, 139. The depletion effected by production is likened to the depreciation of machinery or the using up of raw materials in manufacturing. United States v. Ludey, \n274 \nU.S. 295, 302\n, 303 S., 47 S.Ct. 608, 610, 611; Lynch v. Alworth-Stephens Co., \n267 \nU.S. 364, 370\n, 45 S.Ct. 274, 275. Compare Von Baumbach v. Sargent Land Co., supra, 242 U.S. at pages 524, 525, 37 S.Ct. 201, 208, 209. The deduction is therefore permitted as an act of grace and is intended as compensation for the capital assets consumed in the production of income through the severance of the minerals. Helvering v. Bankline Oil Co., \n303 \nU.S. 362\n, 366-367, 58 S.Ct. 616, 617, 618. The granting of an arbitrary deduction, in the interests of convenience, of a percentage of the gross income derived from the severance of oil and gas, merely emphasizes the underlying theory of the allowance as a tax-free return of the capital consumed in the production of gross income through severance. Helvering v. Twin Bell Oil Syndicate, \n293 \nU.S. 312, 321\n, 55 S. Ct. 174, 178; United States v. Dakota-Montana Oil Co., \n288 \nU.S. 459, 467\n, 53 S.Ct. 435, 438.\n The sole owner and operator of oil properties clearly has a capital investment in the oil in place, if anyone has, and so is taxable on the gross proceeds of production and is granted a deduction from gross income as compensation for the consumption of his capital. See Burnet v. Harmel, supra, 287 U.S. at pages 107, 108, 53 S.Ct. 75, 76; Helvering v. Clifford, \n309 \nU.S. 331\n, 60 S.Ct. 554, 84 L.Ed. --, No. 383, October Term, 1939. By an outright sale of his interest for cash, such an owner converts the form of his capital investment, severs his connection with the production of oil and gas and the income derived from production, and thus renders inapplicable to his situation the reasons for the depletion allowance. 'The words 'gross income from the property,' as used in the statute governing the allowance for deple- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 404, 409]\n\u00a0\n tion, mean gross income received from the operation of the oil and gas wells by one who has a capital investment therein,-not income from the sale of the oil and gas properties themselves.' Helvering v. Elbe Oil Land Co., \n303 \nU.S. 372, 375\n, 376 S., 58 S.Ct. 621, 622.\n Other situations, falling between the two mentioned, have been put on one side or the other as the cases arose. The holder of a royalty interest- that is, a right to receive a specified percentage of all oil and gas produced during the term of the lease-is deemed to have 'an economic interest' in the oil in place which is depleted by severance.

A share in the net profits derived from development and operation, on the contrary, does not entitle the holder of such interest to a depletion allowance even though continued production is essential to the realization of such profits.

Similarly, the holder of a favorable contract to purchase wet gas at the mouth of the well is denied a depletion allowance on the difference between the contract price and the fair market value. Helvering v. Bankline Oil Co., \n303 \nU.S. 362\n, 58 S.Ct. 616. Such an interest has been characterized by us as a 'mere economic advantage derived from production, through a contractual relation to the owner.' Helvering v. Bankline Oil Co., supra, 303 U.S. at page 367, 58 S.Ct. at page 618.\n Thomas v. Perkins, \n301 \nU.S. 655\n, 57 S.Ct. 911, relied upon by petitioners, presented the issue whether the right to oil pay- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 404, 410]\n\u00a0\n ments-that is, the right to a specified sum of money, payable out of a specified percentage of the oil, or the proceeds received from the sale of such oil, if, as and when produced-should be treated for tax purposes like the right to oil royalties or like the right to cash payments upon a sale. In that case, the assignment of lease provided for payments in oil only without the reservation of a royalty interest. The question was whether the assignees' gross income should include moneys paid to the assignors by purchasers of the oil. We stated (301 U.S. page 659, 57 S.Ct. page 912): 'The granting clause in the assignment would be sufficient, if standing alone, to transfer all the oil to the assignee. It does not specifically except or exclude any part of the oil. But it is qualified by other parts of the instrument. The provisions for payment to assignors in oil only, the absence of any obligation of the assignee to pay in oil or in money, and the failure of assignors to take any security by way of lien or otherwise unmistakably show that they intended to withhold from the operation of the grant one-fourth of the oil to be produced and saved up to an amount sufficient when sold to yield $395,000.' Under these circumstances, the money received by the assignors from the sale of the oil were deemed not to be income to the assignees. See also Palmer v. Bender, \n287 \nU.S. 551\n, 53 S.Ct. 225.\n The holder of an oil payment right, as an original proposition, might be regarded as having no capital investment in the oil and gas in place. The value of the right, even though dependent upon the extent of the oil reserves, is fixed at the moment of creation and does not vary directly with the severance of the mineral from the soil. In this sense it resembles the right to cash payments more closely than the right to royalty payments. Yet it does depend upon the production of oil, ordinarily can be realized upon only over a period of years, and permits of a simple and \n\n[310 \nU.S. 404, 411]\n\u00a0\n convenient allocation between lessor and lessee of both the gross income derived from production and the allowance for depletion. Compare Burnet v. Harmel, \n287 \nU.S. 103, 106\n, 107 S., 53 S.Ct. 74, 75. Accordingly, this Court in Thomas v. Perkins decided that the provision in the lease for payments solely out of oil production should be regarded as a reservation from the granting clause of an amount of oil sufficient to make the agreed payments, and should be given the same tax consequences as a provision for oil royalties. The decision did not turn upon the particular instrument involved, or upon the formalities of the conveyancer's art, but rested upon the practical consequences of the provision for payments of that type. See Palmer v. Bender, \n287 \nU.S. 551\n, 555-557, 53 S.Ct. 225, 226; Burnet v. Harmel, \n287 \nU.S. 103, 111\n, 53 S.Ct. 74, 77.\n The Government maintains that the present case is distinguishable from Thomas v. Perkins for the reason that the basis for decision there was that ownership of sufficient oil to make the payments had not been conveyed to the assignee but remained in the assignor. It asserts that the terms of the contract and the instruments of conveyance here negative any intention on the part of the parties to withhold from the operation of the grant an amount of oil equal to the oil payments. The following factors, among others, are relied upon as supporting this contention: (1) the contract contains no qualifying language reserving from the grant any interest in the oil and gas in place; (2) the deferred payments of one hundred ten thousand dollars were payable in cash and not directly in oil; ( 3) the deferred payments drew interest until paid; (4) Oklahoma Company had a first lien and claim against one-half of the oil and gas production and fee interest; (5) petitioner Prichard had the right to sell the fee interest covered by the contract and discharge the deferred payments out of the proceeds of such sale rather than out of the proceeds of the oil and gas production. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 404, 412]\n\u00a0\n Several of the distinctions urged upon us by the Government are without substance. The economic consequences of the transaction are not materially affected by the circumstance that the provision for oil payments is not phrased in terms of a reservation from the conveyance to Oklahoma Company of an interest in the oil and gas in place. And the fact that the payments to Oklahoma Company are in cash rather than directly in oil is of no moment in determining the issues presented for decision. Compare, however, General Utilities Co. v. Helvering, \n296 \nU.S. 200\n, 56 S. Ct. 185. Similarly, the retention of a lien, if it were construed as a lien only upon the oil and gas production, and nothing more, 5 would not make Oklahoma Company any the less dependent upon such production for payment of the amounts reserved.\n The reservation of an interest in the fee, in addition to the interest in the oil production, however, materially affects the transaction. Oklahoma Company is not dependent entirely upon the production of oil for the deferred payments; they may be derived from sales of the fee title to the land conveyed. It is clear that payments derived from such sales would not be subject to an allowance for depletion of the oil reserves, for no oil would thereby have been severed from the ground; an allowance for depletion upon the proceeds of such a sale would result, contrary to the purpose of Congress, in a double deduction-first, to Oklahoma Company; second, to the vendee-owner upon the production of oil. Helvering v. Twin Bell Oil Syndicate, \n293 \nU.S. 312, 321\n, 55 S.Ct. 174, 178. We are of opinion that the reservation of this additional type of security for the deferred payments serves to distinguish \n\n[310 \nU.S. 404, 413]\n\u00a0\n this case from Thomas v. Perkins. It is similar to the reservation in a lease of oil payment rights together with a personal guarantee by the lessee that such payments shall at all events equal the specified sum. In either case, it is true, some of the payments received may come directly out of the oil produced. But our decision in Thomas v. Perkins does not require that payments reserved to the transferor of oil properties shall for tax purposes be treated distributively, and not as a whole, depending upon the source from which each dollar is derived. An extension of that decision to cover the case at bar would create additional, and in our opinion unnecessary, difficulties to the allocation for income tax purposes of such payments and of the allowance for depletion between transferor and transferee. In the interests of a workable rule, Thomas v. Perkins must not be extended beyond the situation in which, as a matter of substance, without regard to formalities of conveyancing, the reserved payments are to be derived solely from the production of oil and gas. The deferred payments reserved by Oklahoma Company, accordingly, must be treated as payments received upon a sale to petitioners, not as income derived from the consumption of its capital investment in the reserves through severance of oil and gas.\n Petitioners, as purchasers and owners of the properties, are therefore taxable upon the gross proceeds derived from the oil production, notwithstanding the arrangement to pay over such proceeds to Oklahoma Company. See Helvering v. Clifford, \n309 \nU.S. 331\n, 60 S.Ct. 554, 84 L.Ed . --, No. 383, October Term, 1939; Reinecke v. Smith, \n289 \nU.S. 172, 177\n, 53 S.Ct. 570, 572; Old Colony Trust Co. v.

The Commissioner in determining deficiencies against petitioners, however, added $11,276.39 to the gross income of each with the explanation that this amount represented 'In-oil payments received in connection with the Patterson (Oklahoma Company) Deal' not reported by petitioners. Respondent, in view of this explanation by the Commissioner and the omission from the record of any disclosure of the method of computing the $11,276.39 addition to gross income, accepts petitioners' statement that 'the only income from the properties here in dispute is from oil production'. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Revenue Act of 1932, c. 209, 47 Stat. 169, 26 U.S.C.A.

LEADER(1940)\nNo. 638\nArgued: Decided: May 27, 1940\n\n\n\n\n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 472]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Sylvan H. Hirsch, of Philadelphia, Pa., for petitioner.\n\n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 477]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Isadore Katz, of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondents.\n\n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 480]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner, a Pennsylvania corporation, is engaged in the manufacture, at its factory in Philadelphia, of hosiery, a substantial part of which is shipped in interstate commerce. It brought the present suit in the federal district court for Eastern Pennsylvania against respondent Federation, a labor organization, and its officers, to recover treble the amount of damage inflicted on it by respondents in conducting a strike at petitioner's factory alleged \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 481]\n\u00a0\n to be a conspiracy in violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. 26 Stat. 209, 15 U.S.C.  1, 15 U.S.C.A.  1. The trial to a jury resulted in a verdict for petitioner in the sum of $237,310, respondents saving by proper motions and exceptions the question whether the evidence was sufficient to establish a violation of the Sherman Act. The trial judge trebled the verdict of $711,932.55, in conformity to the provision of the Sherman Act as amended by  4 of the Clayton Act, 1914, 38 Stat. 731, 15 U. S.C.  15, 15 U.S.C.A.  15, and gave judgment accordingly. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, 108 F.2d 71, on the ground that the interstate commerce restrained or affected by respondents' acts was unsubstantial, the total shipment of merchandise from petitioner's factory being less than three per cent. of the total value of the output in the entire industry of the country, and on the further ground that the evidence failed to show an intent on the part of respondents to restrain interstate commerce. We granted certiorari February 26, 1940, the questions presented being of importance in the administration of the Sherman Act. \n309 \nU.S. 644\n, 60 S.Ct. 589, 84 L.Ed. --.\n The facts are undisputed. There was evidence from which the jury could have found as follows. Petitioner employs at its Philadelphia factory about twenty-five hundred persons in the manufacture of hosiery, and manufactures annually merchandise of the value of about $5,000,000. Its principal raw materials are silk and cotton, which are shipped to it from points outside the state. It ships interstate more than 80 per cent. of its finished product, and in the last eight months of 1937 it shipped in all 274,791 dozen pairs of stockings. In April, 1937, petitioner was operating a nonunion shop. A demand of the respondent Federation at that time for a closed shop agreement came to nothing. On May 4, 1937, when only eight of petitioner's employees were members of the Federation, it ordered a strike. Shortly after midday on \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 482]\n\u00a0\n May 6, 1937, when petitioner's factory was shut down members of the union, employed by other factories in Philadelphia who had stopped work gathered at petitioner's plant. Respondent Leader, president of the Federation, then made a further demand for a closed shop agreement. When this was refused Leader declared a 'sit down strike'. Immediately, acts of violence against petitioner's plant and the employees in charge of it were committed by the assembled mob. It forcibly seized the plant, whereupon, under union leadership, its members were organized to maintain themselves as sit-down strikers in possession of the plant, and it remained in possession until June 23, 1937, when the strikers were forcibly ejected pursuant to an injunction ordered by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 90 F.2d 155, 159; reversed and dismissal ordered as moot in Leader v. Apex Hosiery Co., \n302 \nU.S. 656\n, 58 S.Ct. 362.\n The locks on all gates and entrances of petitioner's plant were changed; only strikers were given keys. No others were allowed to leave or enter the plant without permission of the strikers. During the period of their occupancy, the union supplied them with food, blankets, cots, medical care, and paid them strike benefits. While occupying the factory, the strikers wilfully wrecked machinery of great value, and did extensive damage to other property and equipment of the company. All manufacturing operations by petitioner ceased on May 6th. As the result of the destruction of the company's machinery and plant, it did not resume even partial manufacturing operations until August 19, 1937. The record discloses a lawless invasion of petitioner's plant and destruction of its property by force and violence of the most brutal and wanton character, under leadership and direction of respondents, and without interference by the local authorities.\n For more than three months, by reason of respondents' acts, manufacture was suspended at petitioner's plant \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 483]\n\u00a0\n and the flow of petitioner's product into interstate commerce was stopped. When the plant was seized there were on hand 130,000 dozen pairs of finished hosiery, of a value of about $800,000, ready for shipment on unfilled orders, 80 per cent. of which were to be shipped to points outside the state. Shipment was prevented by the occupation of the factory by the strikers. Three times in the course of the strike respondents refused requests made by petitioner to be allowed to remove the merchandise for the purpose of shipment in filling the orders.\n Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides: 'Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal.' Only a single question is presented by the record for our decision, whether the evidence which we have detailed, whose verity must be taken to be established by the jury's verdict, establishes a restraint of trade or commerce which the Sherman Act condemns.\n It is not denied, and we assume for present purposes, that respondents by substituting the primitive method of trial by combat,1 for the ordinary processes of justice and more civilized means of deciding an industrial dispute, violated the civil and penal laws of Pennsylvania which authorize the recovery of full compensation and impose criminal penalties for the wrongs done. But in this suit, in which no diversity of citizenship of the parties is alleged or shown, the federal courts are without authority to enforce state laws. Their only jurisdiction is to vindicate such federal right as Congress has conferred on petitioner by the Sherman Act and violence, \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 484]\n\u00a0\n as will appear hereafter, however reprehensible, does not give the federal courts jurisdiction.\n At the outset, and before considering the more substantial issues which we regard as decisive of this cause, it is desirable to remove from the field of controversy certain questions which have been much argued here and below, but which we think, in the circumstances of the present case, are irrelevant to decision. We find abundant support for petitioner's contention that the effect of the sit down strike was to restrict substantially the interstate transportation of its manufactured product, so as to bring the acts of respondents by which the restriction was effected within the reach of the commerce power if Congress has seen fit to exercise it. Cessation of petitioner's manufacturing operations, which respondents compelled, indubitably meant the cessation of shipment interstate. The effect upon the commerce resulted naturally and inevitably from the cause. The occupancy of petitioner's factory by the strikers prevented the shipment of the substantial amount of merchandise on hand when the strike was called. In point of the immediacy of the effect of the strikers' acts upon the interstate transportation involved and of its volume, the case does not differ from many others in which we have sustained the Congressional exercise of the commerce power. The national power to regulate commerce is not restricted to that which is nationwide in its scope. Here the strikers' activities were as closely related to interstate commerce and affected it as substantially as numerous other activities not in themselves interstate commerce which have nevertheless been held to be subject to federal statutes enacted in the exercise of the commerce power. \n2\n More recently, \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 485]\n\u00a0\n where the statute was by its term applicable and the question was of Congressional power, we have sustained the application of the Wagner Act, 49 Stat. 449, 29 U.S.C.  151-166, 29 U.S.C.A.  151-166, regulating labor relations 'affecting' interstate commerce to situations no more closely related to the commerce than these, and where the interstate commerce affected was no greater in volume. \n3\n And in the application of the Sherman Act, as we have recently had occasion to point out, it is the nature of the restraint and its effect on interstate commerce and not the amount of the commerce which are the tests of violation. See United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., Inc., \n310 \nU.S. 150\n, 60 S.Ct. 811, 84 L.Ed. --, note 59. Cf. National Labor Relations Board v. Fainblatt, \n306 \nU.S. 601, 606\n, 59 S.Ct. 668, 671\n\n\n We think also, as petitioner contends, that the jury's verdict must be taken as a finding supported by evidence that respondents intended to prevent petitioner's shipments in interstate commerce in the sense that respondents must be taken to have intended the natural and probable consequences of their acts. The trial court left it to the jury to say whether the respondents intended to restrain petitioner's interstate shipments, and charged that in a suit to recover damages for violation of the Sherman Act it was necessary for it to find an intent on the part of respondents to cause the prohibited restraint of commerce,4 but that such intent might be inferred \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 486]\n\u00a0\n from their acts in stopping petitioner's manufacture of a product largely and regularly shipped in interstate commerce. Concededly the purpose of the strikers and their principal objective was to compel petitioner to yield to their demands for a union shop, but it is a matter of common knowledge and experience that the stoppage of a large manufacturing plant, which the strikers did intend, whose product is distributed generally to consumers throughout the country, would prevent its shipments in interstate commerce. We must take it from the jury's verdict that this was known to the strikers as well as to others. In addition there was specific testimony that the strikers refused to permit the withdrawal of the finished merchandise from petitioner's factory for shipment.\n But the Sherman Act admittedly does not condemn all combinations and conspiracies which interrup interstate transportation. United Mine Workers v. Coronado Coal Co., 259 U.S 344, 42 S.Ct. 570, 27 A.L.R. 762 (First Coronado case); United Leather Workers v. Herkert & Meisel Trunk Co., \n265 \nU.S. 457\n, 44 S.Ct. 623, 33 A.L.R. 566 ( Leather Workers case). In re Debs, \n158 \nU.S. 564, 600\n, 15 S.Ct. 900, 912, this Court declined to consider whether the stoppage of trains on an interstate railroad resulting from a strike, was a violation of the Sherman Act-a question which it has not since been called on to decide. \n5\n It is not seriously \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 487]\n\u00a0\n contended here that a conspiracy to derail and rob an interstate train, even though it were laden with 100,000 dozen pairs of stockings, necessarily would involve a violation of the Sherman Act. This Court has never applied the Act to laborers or to others as a means of policing interstate transportation, and so the question to which we must address ourselves is whether a conspiracy of strikers in a labor dispute to stop the operation of the employer's factory in order to enforce their demands against the employer is the kind of restraint of trade or commerce at which the Act is aimed, even though a natural and probable consequence of their acts and the only effect on trade or commerce was to prevent substantial shipments interstate by the employer.\n A point strongly urged in behalf of respondents in brief and argument before us is that Congress intended to exclude labor organizations and their activities wholly from the operation of the Sherman Act. To this the short answer must be made that for the thirty-two years which have elapsed since the decision of Loewe v. Lawlor, \n208 \nU.S. 274\n, 28 S.Ct. 301, 13 Ann.Cas. 815, this Court, in its efforts to determine the true meaning and application of the Sherman Act has repeatedly held that the words of the act, 'Every contract, combination ... or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce' do embrace to some extent and in some circumstances labor unions and their activities;6 and that during that period Congress, although often asked to do so, has passed no act purporting to exclude labor unions \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 488]\n\u00a0\n wholly from the operation of the Act. \n7\n On the contrary Congress has repeatedly enacted laws restricting or purporting to curtail the application of the Act to labor organizations and their activities, thus recognizing that to some extent not defined they remain subject to it. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n Whether labor organizations and their activities are wholly excluded from the Sherman Act is a question of statutory construction, not constitutional power. 9 The long time failure of Congress to alter the Act after it had been judicially construed, and the enactment by Congress of legislation which implicitly recognizes the judicial construction as effective, is persuasive of legislative recognition that the judicial construction is the correct one. This is the more so where, as here, the application of the statute \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 489]\n\u00a0\n to labor unions has brought forth sharply conflicting views both on the Court and in Congress, and where after the matter has been fully brought to the attention of the public and the Congress, the latter has not seen fit to change the statute.\n While we must regard the question whether labor unions are to some extent and in some circumstances subject to the Act as settled in the affirmative, it is equally plain that this Court has never thought the Act to apply to all labor union activities affecting interstate commerce. The prohibitions of the Sherman Act were not stated in terms of precision or of crystal clarity and the Act itself did not define them. In consequence of the vagueness of its language, perhaps not uncalculated,10 the courts have been left to give content to the statute, and in the performance of that function it is appropriate that courts should interpret its words in the light of its legislative history and of the particular evils at which the legislation was aimed. Cf. Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 1\n, 31 S.Ct. 502, 34 L.R.A.,N.S., 834, Ann.Cas.1912D, 734; Nash v. United States, \n229 \nU.S. 373\n, 33 S.Ct. 780; Appalachian Coals, Inc., v. United States, \n288 \nU.S. 344, 359\n, 360 S., 53 S.Ct. 471, 473, 474. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 490]\n\u00a0\n The critical words which circumscribe the judicial performance of this function so far as the present case is concerned are 'Every ... combination ... or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce.' Since in the present case, as we have seen, the natural and predictable consequence of the strike was the restraint of interstate transportation the precise question which we are called upon to decide is whether that restraint resulting from the strike maintained to enforce union demands by compelling a shutdown of petitioner's factory is the kind of 'restraint of trade or commerce' which the Act condemns.\n In considering whether union activities like the present may fairly be deemed to be embraced within this phrase, three circumstances relating to the history and application of the Act which are of striking significance must first be taken into account. The legislative history of the Sherman Act as well as the decisions of this Court interpreting it, show that it was not aimed at policing interstate transportation or movement of goods and property. The legislative history and the voluminous literature which was generated in the course of the enactment and during fifty years of litigation of the Sherman Act give no hint that such was its purpose. \n11\n They do not suggest \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 491]\n\u00a0\n that, in general, state laws or law enforcement machinery were inadequate to prevent local obstructions or interferences with interstate transportation, or presented any problem requiring the interposition of federal authority. \n12\n In 1890 when the Sherman Act was adopted there were only a few federal statutes imposing penalties for obstructing or misusing interstate transportation. \n13\n With an expanding commerce, many others have since been enacted safeguarding transportation in interstate commerce as the need was seen, including statutes declaring conspiracies to interfere or actual interference with interstate commerce by violence or threats of violence to be felonies. \n14\n It was another and quite a different evil at \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 492]\n\u00a0\n which the Sherman Act was aimed. It was enacted in the era of 'trusts' and of 'combinations' of businesses\n__________ shipment of intoxicating liquors, 35 Stat. 1136 (1909), 18 U.S.C.  388- 390, 18 U.S.C.A.  388-390; white slave traffic, 36 Stat. 825 (1910), 18 U.S.C.  397-404, 18 U.S.C.A.  397-404; transportation of prize-fight films, 37 Stat. 240 (1912), 18 U.S.C.  405-407, 18 U.S.C.A.  405-407; larceny of goods moving in interstate commerce, 37 Stat. 670 (1913), 18 U.

The denial by employers of the right of employees to organize and the refusal by employers to accept the procedure of collective bargaining lead to strikes and other forms of industrial strife or unrest, which have the intent or the necessary effect of burdening or obstructing commerce ....'\n The Anti-Racketeering Act, 48 Stat. 979, 18 U.S.C.  420a-420e (1934 ), 18 U.S.C.A.  420a-420e, is designed to protect trade and commerce against interference by violence and threats.  420a provides that 'any person who, in connection with or in relation to any act in any way or in any degree affecting trade or commerce or any article or commodity moving or about to move in trade or commerce-\n'(a) Obtains or attempts to obtain, by the use of or attempt to use or threat to use force, violence, or coercion, the payment of money or other valuable considerations ... not including, however, the payment of wages by a bonafide employer to a bona-fide employee; or\n\n'(b) Obtains the property of another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of force or fear, or under color of official right; or\n\n'(c) Commits or threatens to commit an act of physical violence or physical injury to a person or property in furtherance of a plan or purpose to violate subsections (a) or (b); or\n\n'(d) Conspires or acts concertedly with any other person or persons to commit any of the foregoing acts; shall, upon conviction \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 493]\n\u00a0\n and of capital organized and directed to control of the market by suppression of competition in the marketing of goods and services, the monopolistic tendency of which had become a matter of public concern. The end sought was the prevention of restraints to free competition in business and commercial transactions which tended to restrict production, raise prices or otherwise control the market to the detriment of purchasers or consumers of goods and services, all of which had come to be regarded as a special form of public injury. \n15\n\u00a0\n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 494]\n\u00a0\n For that reason the phrase 'restraint of trade' which, as will presently appear, had a well-understood meaning at\n\n__________ which tend to prevent free and full competition ... with such penalties and provisions ... as will tend to preserve freedom of trade and production, the natural competition of increasing production, the lowering of prices by such competition ...' (19 Cong.Rec. 6041).\n This resolution explicitly presented the economic theory of the proponents of such legislation. The various bills introduced between 1888 and 1890 follow the theory of this resolution. Many bills sought to make void all arrangements 'made with a view, or which tend, to prevent full and free competition in the production, manufacture, or sale of articles of domestic growth or production', S. 3445; S. 3510; H.R. 11339, all of the 50th Cong., 1st Sess. (1888) were bills of this type. In the 51st Cong . (1889) the bills were in a similar vein. See S. 1, sec. 1 (this bill as redrafted by the Judiciary Committee ultimately became the Sherman Law); H. R. 202, sec. 3; H.R. 270; H.R. 286; H.R. 402; H.R. 509; H.R. 826; H.R. 3819. See Bills and Debates in Congress relating to Trusts (1909), Vol. 1, pp. 1025-1031.\n Only one, which was never enacted, S. 1268 in the 52d Cong., 1st Sess . (1892), introduced by Senator Peffer, sought to prohibit 'every wilful act ... which shall have the effect to in anyway interfere with the freedom of transit of articles in interstate commerce, ...'\n When the antitrust bill (S. 1, 51st Cong., 1st Sess.), came before Congress for debate, the debates point to a similar purpose. Senator Sherman asserted the bill prevented only 'business combinations' 'made with a view to prevent competition', 21 Cong.Rec. 2457, 2562; see also ibid at 2459, 2461.\n Senator Allison spoke of combinations which 'control prices,' ibid 2471; Senator Pugh of combinations 'to limit production' for 'the purpose of destroying competition', ibid 2558; Senator Morgan of combinations 'that affect the price of commodities', ibid, 2609; Senator Platt, a critic of the bill, said this bill proceeds on the assumption that 'competition is beneficent to the country', ibid 2729; Senator George denounced trusts which crush out competition 'and that is the great evil at which all this legislation ought to be directed', ibid 3147.\n In the House, Representative Culberson, who was in charge of the bill, interpreted the bill to prohibit various arrangements which tend to drive out competition, ibid 4089; Representative Wilson spoke in favor of the bill against combinations among 'competing producers to control the supply of their product, in order that they may dictate \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 495]\n\u00a0\n common law, was made the means of defining the activities prohibited. The addition of the words 'or commerce among the several States' was not an additional kind of restraint to be prohibited by the Sherman Act but was the means used to relate the prohibited restraint of trade to interstate commerce for constitutional purposes, Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers v. United States, \n286 \nU.S. 427, 434\n, 52 S.Ct. 607, 609, so that Congress, through its commerce power, might suppress and penalize restraints on the competitive system which involved or affected interstate commerce. Because many forms of restraint upon commercial competition extended across state lines so as to make regulation by state action difficult or impossible, Congress enacted the Sherman Act, 21 Cong.Rec. 2456. It was in this sense of preventing restraints on commercial competition that Congress exercised 'all the power it possessed.' Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers v. United States, supra, \n286 \nU.S. 435\n, 52 S.Ct. 609.\n A second significant circumstance is that this Court has never applied the Sherman Act in any case, whether or not involving labor organizations or activities unless the Court was of opinion that there was some form of restraint upon commercial competition in the marketing of goods or services16 and finally this Court has refused \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 496]\n\u00a0\n to apply the Sherman Act in cases like the present in which local strikes conducted by illegal means in a \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 497]\n\u00a0\n production industry prevented interstate shipment of substantial amounts of the product but in which it was not shown that the restrictions on shipments had operated to restrain commercial competition in some substantial way. First Coronado case, supra; Leather Workers case, supra. Levering & G. Co. v. Morrin, \n289 \nU.S. 103\n, 53 S.Ct. 549.\n The common law doctrines relating to contracts and combinations in restraint of trade were well understood long before the enactment of the Sherman law. 17 They were contracts for the restriction or suppression of competition in the market, agreements to fix prices, divide marketing territories, apportion customers, restrict production and the like practices, which tend to raise prices or otherwise take from buyers or consumers the advantages which accrue to them from free competition in the market. Such contracts were deemed illegal and were unenforcible at common law. But the resulting restraints of trade were not penalized and gave rise to no actionable wrong. Certain classes of restraints were not outlawed when deemed reasonable, usually because they served to preserve or protect legitimate interests, previously existing, of one or more parties to the contract. \n18\n\u00a0\n\n In seeking more effective protection of the public from the growing evils of restraints on the competitive system \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 498]\n\u00a0\n effected by the concentrated commercial power of 'trusts' and 'combinations' at the close of the nineteenth century, the legislators found ready at their hand the common law concept of illegal restraints of trade or commerce. In enacting the Sherman law they took over that concept by condemning such restraints whereever they occur in or affect commerce between the states. They extended the condemnation of the statute to restraints effected by any combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, as well as by contract or agreement, having those effects on the competitive system and on purchasers and consumers of goods or services which were characteristic of restraints deemed illegal at common law, and they gave both private and public remedies for the injuries flowing from such restraints.\n That such is the scope and effect of the Sherman Act was first judicially recognized and expounded in the classic opinion in United States v. Addyston Pipe & Steel Co., 6 Cir., 85 F. 271, 46 L.R.A. 122, affirmed \n175 \nU.S. 211\n, 20 S.Ct. 96, written by Judge, later Chief Justice Taft, and concurred in by Justice Harlan and Judge, later Justice Lurton, of this Court. This Court has since repeatedly recognized that the restraints at which the Sherman law is aimed, and which are described by its terms are only those which are comparable to restraints deemed illegal at common law, although accomplished by means other than contract and which, for constitutional reasons, are confined to transactions in or which affect interstate commerce. 19 \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 499]\n\u00a0\n In Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 1, 54\n, 55 S., 58, 31 S.Ct. 502, 513, 515, 34 L.R.A.,N.S., 834, Ann.Cas.1912D, 734, decided in 1911, this Court, speaking through Chief Justice White, pointed out that the restraint of trade contemplated by  1 of the Act took its origin from the common law, and that the Sherman Act was adapted to the prevention, in modern conditions, of conduct or dealing effecting the wrong, at which the common law doctrine was aimed. This, it was said, is 'the dread of enhancement of prices and of other wrongs which it was thought would flow from the undue limitation on competitive conditions caused by contracts or other acts of individuals or corporations ....'20 The Court declared, 221 U.S. at page 59, 31 S.Ct. at page 515, 34 L.R.A.,N.S., 834, Ann.Cas.1912D, 734, that 'the statute was drawn in the light of the existing practical conception of the law of restraint of trade', and drew the conclusion that the restraints which were condemned by the statute are those which-following the common law analogy are 'unreasonable or undue'. This view was followed and more explicitly stated in United States v. American Tobacco Co., \n221 \nU.S. 106\n, \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 500]\n\u00a0\n 179, 31 S.Ct. 632, 648, where it was said: '... it was held in The Standard Oil case that ... as the words 'restraint of trade' at common law and in the law of this country at the time of the adoption of the antitrust act only embraced acts or contracts or agreements or combinations which operated to the prejudice of the public interests by unduly restricting competition, or unduly obstructing the due course of trade, or which, either because of their inherent nature or effect, or because of the evident purpose of the acts, etc., injuriously restrained trade, that the words as used in the statute were designed to have and did have but a like significance.' In thus grounding the 'rule of reason' upon the analogy of the common law doctrines applicable to illegal restraints of trade the Court gave a content and meaning to the statute in harmony with its history and plainly indicated by its legislative purpose. Labor cases apart, which will presently be discussed, this Court has not departed from the conception of the Sherman Act as affording a remedy, public and private, for the public wrongs which flow from restraints of trade in the common law sense of restriction or suppression of commercial competition. In the cases considered by this Court since the Standard Oil case in 1911 some form of restraint of commercial competition has been the sine qua non to the condemnation of contracts, combinations or conspiracies under the Sherman Act, and in general restraints upon competition have been condemned only when their purpose or effect was to raise or fix the market price. \n21\n It is in this sense that it is said that the restraint, actual or intended, prohibited by the Sherman Act are only those which are so substantial as to affect market prices. Restraints on competition or on the course of trade in the merchandising of articles moving in interstate com- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 501]\n\u00a0\n merce is not enough, unless the restraint is shown to have or is intended to have an effect upon prices in the market or otherwise to deprive purchasers or consumers of the advantages which they derive from free competition. Chicago Board of Trade v. United States, \n246 \nU.S. 231, 238\n, 38 S.Ct. 242, 243; United States v. United States Steel Corp ., \n251 \nU.S. 417\n, 40 S.Ct. 293, 8 A.L.R. 1121; Cement Mfrs.' Protective Ass'n v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 588\n, 45 S.Ct. 586; United States v. International Harvester Co., \n274 \nU.S. 693\n, 47 S.Ct. 748; Appalachian Coals, Inc., v. United States, \n288 \nU.S. 344\n, 375, et seq., 53 S.Ct. 471, 479, et seq..22\n The question remains whether the effect of the combination or conspiracy among respondents was a restraint of trade within the meaning of the Sherman Act. This is not a case of a labor organization being used by combinations of those engaged in an industry as the means or instrument for suppressing competition or fixing prices. See United States v. Brims, \n272 \nU.S. 549\n, 47 S.Ct. 169; Local 167 v. United States, \n291 \nU.S. 293\n, 54 S.Ct. 396. Here it is plain that the combination or conspiracy did not have as its purpose restraint upon competition in the market for petitioner's product. Its object was to compel petitioner to accede to the union demands and an effect of it, in consequence of the strikers' tortious acts, was the prevention of the removal of petitioner's product for interstate shipment. So far as appears the delay of these shipments was not intended to have and had no effect on prices of hosiery in the market, and so was in that respect no more a restraint forbidden by the Sherman Act than the restriction upon competition and the course of trade held lawful in Appalachian Coals, Inc., v. United States, supra, because notwithstanding its effect upon the marketing of the coal \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 502]\n\u00a0\n it nevertheless was not intended to and did not affect market price.\n A combination of employees necessarily restrains competition among themselves in the sale of their services to the employer; yet such a combination was not considered an illegal restraint of trade at common law when the Sherman Act was adopted, either because it was not thought to be unreasonable or because it was not deemed a 'restraint of trade.' \n23\n Since the enactment of the \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 503]\n\u00a0\n declaration in  6 of the Clayton Act that 'the labor of a human being is not a commodity or article of commerce ... nor shall such (labor) organizations, or the members thereof, be held or construed to be illegal combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade, under the anti-trust laws', it would seem plain that restraints on the sale of the employee's services to the employer, however, much they curtail the competition among employees, are not in themselves combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce under the Sherman Act.\n Strikes or agreements not to work, entered into by laborers to compel employers to yield to their demands, may restrict to some extent the power of employers who are parties to the dispute to compete in the market with those not subject to such demands. But under the doctrine applied to non- labor cases, the mere fact of such restrictions on competition does not in itself bring the parties to the agreement within the condemnation of the Sherman Act. Appalachian Coals, Inc., v. United States, supra, \n288 \nU.S. 360\n, 53 S.Ct. 474, supra. Furthermore, successful union activity, as for example consummation of a wage agreement with employers, may have some influence on price competition by eliminating that part of such competition which is based on differences in labor standards. Since, in order to render a labor combination effective it must eliminate the competition from non-union made goods, see American Steel Foundries v. Tri- City Central Trades Council, \n257 \nU.S. 184, 209\n, 42 S.Ct. 72, 78, 27 A.L.R. 360, an elimination of price competition based on differences in labor standards is the objective of any national labor organization. But this effect on competition has not been \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 504]\n\u00a0\n considered to be the kind of curtailment of price competition prohibited by the Sherman Act. See Levering & G. Co. v. Morrin, supra; cf. American Foundries case, supra, \n257 \nU.S. 209\n, 42 S.Ct. 78, 27 A.L.R. 360, supra; National Ass'n of Window Glass Manufacturers v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 403\n, 44 S.Ct. 148.24 And in any case, the restraint here is, as we have seen, of a different kind and has not been shown to have any actual or intended effect on price of price competition. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 505]\n\u00a0\n This Court first applied the Sherman Act to a labor organization in Loewe v. Lawlor, \n208 \nU.S. 274\n, 28 S.Ct. 301, 13 Ann.Cas. 815, in 1908, holding that the trial court had erroneously sustained a demurrer to the declaration in a suit for damages for violation of the Sherman Act on the ground that the combination alleged was not within the Act. The combination or conspiracy charged was that of a nation-wide labor organization to force all manufacturers of fur hats in the United States to organize their workers by maintaining a boycott against the purchase of the product of non-union manufacturers shipped in interstate commerce. The restraint alleged was not a strike or refusal to work in the complainants' plant, but a secondary boycott by which, through threats to the manufacturer's wholesale customers and their customers, the Union sought to compel or induce them not to deal in the product of the complainants, and to purchase the competing products of other unionized manufacturers. This Court pointed out that the restraint was precisely like that in Eastern States Retail Lumber Dealers' Ass'n v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 600, 610\n, 614 S., 34 S.Ct. 951, in which a conspiracy to circulate a 'black list', intended to persuade retailers not to deal with specified wholesalers, was held to violate the Act because of its restraint upon competition with unlisted wholesalers. The Court in the Loewe case held that the boycott operated as a restraint of trade or commerce within the meaning of the Sherman Act, and that the language of the Act, 'every combination, etc.' was broad enough to include a labor union imposing such a restraint. Like problems found a like solution in Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, \n254 \nU.S. 443\n, 41 S.Ct. 172, 16 A.L.R. 196, and in Bedford Cut Stone Company v. Journeyman Stone Cutters' Ass'n, \n274 \nU.S. 37\n, 47 S.Ct. 522, 525, 54 A.L.R. 791; where in the one case, a secondary boycott, and in the other, the refusal of the union to work on a product in the hands of the purchaser were carried on on a country-wide scale by a national labor organization, in order to \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 506]\n\u00a0\n induce the purchasers of a manufactured product shipped in interstate commerce to withdraw their patronage from the producer. In both, as in the Loewe case, the effort of the union was to compel unionization of an employer's factory, not by a strike in his factory but by restraining by the boycott or refusal to work on the manufactured product purchases of his product in interstate commerce in competition with the like product of union shops.\n In the Bedford Stone case it was pointed out that, as in the Duplex Printing Press Co. case, the strike was directed against the use of the manufactured product by consumers 'with the immediate purpose and necessary effect of restraining future sales and shipments in interstate commerce' and 'with the plain design of suppressing or narrowing the interstate market', and that in this respect the case differed from those in which a factory strike, directed at the prevention of production with consequent cessation of interstate shipments, had been held not to be a violation of the Sherman law. See First Coronado case, supra; Leather Workers case, supra; cf. The Second Coronado case, supra, \n268 \nU.S. 310\n, 45 S.Ct. 556, supra.\n It will be observed that in each of these cases where the Act was held applicable to labor unions, the activities affecting interstate commerce were directed at control of the market and were so widespread as substantially to affect it. There was thus a suppression of competition in the market by methods which were deemed analogous to those found to be violations in the non-labor cases. See Montague & Co. v. Lowry, \n193 \nU.S. 38, 45\n, 46 S., 24 S.Ct. 307, 309, supra; Eastern States Retail Lumber Dealers' Co. v. United States, supra; Paramount Famous Lasky Corp. v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 30\n, 51 S.Ct. 42; United States v. First National Pictures, Inc., \n282 \nU.S. 44\n, 51 S.Ct. 45. That the objective of the restraint in the boycott cases was the strengthening of the bargaining position of the union and not the elimination of business competition-which was the end in the non-labor cases-was \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 507]\n\u00a0\n thought to be immaterial because the Court viewed the restraint itself, in contrast to the interference with shipments caused by a local factory strike, to be of a kind regarded as offensive at common law because of its effect in curtailing a free market and it was held to offend against the Sherman Act because it effected and was aimed at suppression of competition with union made goods in the interstate market.\n Both the Duplex Printing Co. and Bedford Stone cases followed the enactment of the Clayton Act and the recognition of the 'rule of reason' in the Standard Oil case supra. The applicability of that rule to restraints upon commerce affected by a labor union in order to promote and consolidate the interests of its union was not considered. \n25\n But an important point considered and decided by the Court in both cases was that nothing in the Clayton Act precluded the relief granted. We are not now concerned with the merits of either point. \n26\n The only \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 508]\n\u00a0\n significance of the two cases for present purposes is that in each the Court considered it necessary, in order to support its decision, to find that the restraint operated to suppress competition in the market.\n This Court was first called on to consider a case like the present in the First Coronado case, supra. There a local branch of a national labor union sought to unionize a coal mine which was shipping its product interstate to the extent of more than 5,000 tons a week. Members of the union compelled the mine to shut down, by force and violence, including murder and arson. By reason of their forcible action all work at the mine was prevented, it filled with water, shipments of coal which were regularly moving in interstate commerce as mined, ceased, and \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 509]\n\u00a0\n the strikers burned more than ten cars, three of them loaded with coal and some billed for movement interstate. This Court, notwithstanding the admittedly substantial effect of the strike on the interstate movement of the coal, and the admittedly illegal and outrageous acts of the strikers, held that it was not a restraint of trade or commerce prohibited by the Sherman Act. It rested its decision specifically on two grounds (\n259 \nU.S. 344\n, 42 S.Ct. 582, 27 A.L.R. 762): that 'obstruction to coal mining is not a direct obstruction to interstate commerce in coal',27 and that the intent to obstruct the mining of coal and to burn the loaded cars, did not necessarily imply an intent to restrain the commerce, although concededly interstate shipments and the filling of interstate orders for coal were necessarily ended by the stoppage of mining operations and the destruction of the loaded cars. It perhaps suffices for present purposes to say that if the strike in the Coronado case was not within the Sherman Act because its effect upon the commerce was 'indirect' and because the 'intention' to shut down the mine and destroy the cars of coal destined for an interstate shipment, did not imply an 'intention to obstruct interstate commerce', then the like tests require the like decision here.\n But we are not relegated to so mechanical an application of these cryptic phrases in the application of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, for the Court has since so in- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 510]\n\u00a0\n terpreted them as to give to the phrase 'restraint of trade or commerce' a meaning and content consonant with the legislative and judicial history of the Act to which we have referred. In the Leather Workers case, supra, the Court was again called on to determine whether a local strike in a factory which prevented shipment of its product in filling interstate orders of substantial volume violated the Sherman Act. As in the First Coronado case the Court held that the restraint was not one prohibited by the Sherman Act. It pointed out, 265 U.S. at page 469, 44 S.Ct. at page 626, 33 A.L.R. 566, that there has been no attempt, as in Loewe v. Lawlor, to boycott the sale of complainant's products in other states, and that if the interruption of interstate shipments resulting from a local factory strike aimed at compelling the employer to yield to union demands were deemed within the sweep of the Sherman Act, 'The natural, logical and inevitable result will be that every strike in any industry or even in any single factory will be within the Sherman Act and subject to federal jurisdiction provided any appreciable amount of its product enters into interstate commerce', 265 U.S. at page 471, 44 S.Ct. at page 627, 33 A.L.R. 566. After discussing the cases which had given currency to the notion that the Sherman Act, where the combination or conspiracy is not formed with the 'intent to restrain trade or commerce', is to be applied only to those restraints characterized as 'direct', the Court said, 265 U.S. at page 471, 44 S.Ct. at page 627, 33 A.L.R. 566:\n'This review of the cases makes it clear that the mere reduction in the supply of an article to be shipped in interstate commerce by the illegal or tortious prevention of its manufacture, is ordinarily an indirect and remote obstruction to that commerce. It is only when the intent or the necessary effect upon such commerce in the article is to enable those preventing the manufacture to monopolize its supply or control its price, or discriminate as between its would-be purchasers, that the unlawful interference \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 511]\n\u00a0\n with its manufacture can be said directly to burden interstate commerce.'\n\n And the Court added,\n'The record is entirely without evidence or circumstances to show that the defendants in their conspiracy to deprive the complainants of their workers were thus directing their scheme against interstate commerce.'\n\n It was thus made apparent that in saying that 'indirect obstructions' to commerce were not condemned by the Sherman Act where the conspiracy is not directed at that commerce, the Court was not seeking to apply a purely mechanical test of liability, but was using a shorthand expression to signify that the Sherman Act was directed only at those restraints whose evil consequences are derived from the suppression of competition in the interstate market, so as 'to monopolize the supply, control its price or discriminate between its would-be purchasers.' And in speaking of intent as a prerequisite to liability under the Act where the restraint to interstate commerce is 'indirect' it meant no more than that the conspiracy or combination must be aimed or directed at the kind of restraint which the Act prohibits or that such restraint is the natural and probable consequences of the conspiracy.\n This was again pointed out in the Second Coronado case, supra, \n268 \nU.S. 310\n, 45 S.Ct. 556, where upon a retrial of the case on amended pleadings it appeared that 'the purpose of the destruction of the mines was to stop the production of nonunion coal and prevent its shipment to markets of other states than Arkansas, where it would by competition tend to reduce the price of the commodity and affect injuriously the maintenance of wages for union labor in competing mines, ....' The Court declared such a restraint to be a 'direct violation of the (Sherman) Act'. The like distinction was taken and explanation made in the Bedford Stone \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 512]\n\u00a0\n case, supra, 274 U.S. at pages 46, 49, 47 S.Ct. at pages 524, 525, 54 A.L.R. 791, where the restraint consisted in the refusal of the unions to work on stone shipped interstate from an open shop quarry after its interstate journey to the purchaser had ended, and where it appeared that the purpose of the strike was to prevent the interstate sale of the stone in competition with the product of unionized producers. Cf. Levering & G. Co. v. Morrin, supra.\n These cases show that activities of labor organizations not immunized by the Clayton Act are not necessarily violations of the Sherman Act. Underlying and implicit in all of them is recognition that the Sherman Act was not enacted to police interstate transportation, or to afford a remedy for wrongs, which are actionable under state law, and result from combinations and conspiracies which fall short, both in their purpose and effect, of any form of market control of a commodity, such as to 'monopolize the supply, control its price, or discriminate between its would-be purchasers'. These elements of restraint of trade, found to be present in the Second Coronado case and alone to distinguish it from the First Coronado case and the Leather Workers case, are wholly lacking here. We do not hold that conspiracies to obstruct or prevent transportation in interstate commerce can in no circumstances be violations of the Sherman Act. Apart from the Clayton Act it makes no distinction between labor and non-labor cases. We only hold now, as we have previously held both in labor and non-labor cases, that such restraints are not within the Sherman Act unless they are intended to have, or in fact have, the effects on the market on which the Court relied to establish violation in the Second Coronado case. Unless the principle of these cases is now to be discarded, an impartial application of the Sherman Act to the activities of industry and labor alike would seem to require that the Act be held inapplicable to the activities of respondents which had an even less substantial effect \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 513]\n\u00a0\n on the competitive conditions in the industry than the combination of producers upheld in the Appalachian Coal case and in others on which it relied. \n28\n\u00a0\n\n If, without such effects on the market, we were to hold that a local factory strike, stopping production and shipment of its product interstate, violates the Sherman law, practically every strike in modern industry would be brought within the jurisdiction of the federal courts, under the Sherman Act, to remedy local law violations. The Act was plainly not intended to reach such a result, its language does not require it, and the course of our decisions precludes it. The maintenance in our federal system of a proper distribution between state and national governments of police authority and of remedies private and public for public wrongs is of far-reaching importance. An intention to disturb the balance is not lightly to be imputed to Congress. The Sherman Act is concerned with the character of the prohibited restraints and with their effect on interstate commerce. It draws no distinction between the restraints effected by violence and those achieved by peaceful but oftentimes quite as effective means. Restraints not within the Act, when achieved by peaceful means, are not brought within its sweep merely because, without other differences, they are attended by violence.\n Affirmed. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 514]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES (dissenting).\n The undisputed facts will bear a brief repetition, for upon an appreciation of their true import hinges the application of the Sherman Act.\n As the Circuit Court of Appeals said, the evidence disclosed a 'sit- down strike in its most aggravated and illegal form'. (108 F.2d 74). When the Union demanded a closed shop agreement and, on its refusal, declared the strike, only eight of the Company's twenty-five hundred employees were members of the Union. The Company's plant was seized and held for several weeks. Its machinery and equipment were 'wantonly demolished or damaged to the extent of many thousands of dollars'.\n There was not merely a stoppage of production, but there was also a deliberate prevention of the shipment of finished goods to customers outside the State. This was not simply the result of the occupation of the plant but was due to the repeated and explicit refusals of the Union to permit the shipment. These goods amounted to 134,000 dozens of finished hosiery, of the value of about $800,000, of which 80 per cent, as respondents well know, were ready for shipment in interstate commerce. The evidence is that the Company's representative thus besought the Union's president: 'We have orders on hand from customers all over the country which we can fill with merchandise which we have on hand at the plant. Will you permit us to go into the plant for the sole purpose of removing that finished merchandise so that we can ship it against orders?' The Union's president emphatically answered: 'No, not until this strike is settled'.\n There was thus a direct and intentional prevention of interstate commerce in the furtherance of an illegal conspiracy. This, I take it, the opinion of the Court concedes. Whatever vistas of new uncertainties in the application of the Sherman Act the present decision may open, \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 515]\n\u00a0\n it seems to be definitely determined that a conspiracy of workers, or for that matter of others, to obstruct or prevent the shipment or delivery of goods in interstate commerce to fill orders of the customers of a manufacturer or dealer is not a violation of the Sherman Act. With that conclusion I cannot agree.\n The argument has been pressed in this case, and in other recent cases, that the Sherman Act does not apply to labor unions. The Court finds that argument untenable, referring to our decisions to the contrary and to the failure of repeated attempts to persuade Congress to exclude labor organizations from the operation of the Act. Respondents' argument for immunity under the terms of Sections 6 and 20 of the Clayton Act1 has also been found unavailing. Section 6 declares that 'the labor of a human being is not a commodity or article of commerce' and that nothing in the antitrust laws shall be construed to forbid the existence and operation of labor organizations instituted for the purpose of mutual help, 'or to forbid or restrain individual members of such organizations from lawfully carrying out the legitimate objects thereof; nor shall such organizations, or the members thereof, be held or construed to be illegal combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade, under the antitrust laws'. The reference in the last clause to 'such organizations' has manifest reference to what precedes, and the immunity conferred is only with respect to the 'lawfully carrying out' of their 'legitimate objects'. Section 20 forbids the granting of injunctions prohibiting persons 'singly or in concert' from 'terminating any relation of employment', or from engaging in described activities of persuasion, etc., when these are 'peaceful and lawful'; or 'from peaceably assembling in a lawful manner, and \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 516]\n\u00a0\n for lawful purposes'. The inapplicability of these provisions is apparent.\n But while the Clayton Act does not give the immunity desired by respondents, and labor unions are found by the Court to be within the purview of the Sherman Act 'to some extent and in some circumstances', the Act is construed as not embracing the direct and deliberate interference with interstate commerce that is here disclosed. I think that this construction of the statute is too narrow.\n Section 1 of the Sherman Act2 condemns as illegal every 'combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations'. 'Conspiracy' is a familiar term of art and means a combination of two or more persons by concerted action to accomplish an unlawful purpose, or some purpose not in itself unlawful by unlawful means. There was plainly a conspiracy here. To 'restrain' is to hold back, repress, obstruct,-to hinder from liberty of action. Manifestly there was restraint in this case. What then is the significance of the term 'commerce' as used in the Act' Adopting the language of the Constitution, Congress evidently used the term in its constitutional sense. 'Commerce' is intercourse; in its most limited meaning it embraces traffic. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 189. 'Commerce' manifestly covers the shipment and transportation of commodities across state lines to execute contracts of sale. The term 'commerce', we said in Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 \nU.S. 1, 46\n, 32 S.Ct. 169, 173, 38 L.R.A., N.S., 44, 'embraces commercial intercourse in all its branches, including transportation of passengers and property by common carriers, whether carried on by water or by land'. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 517]\n\u00a0\n As the instant case falls directly within the language of the Sherman Act in its natural import, the question is whether that language has been, or should be, so narrowed by judicial construction as to exclude from its application the conspiracy and restraint here found. The scope of this question is not only limited by the conclusion of the Court that labor unions are not excepted from the Act but also by the Court's rejection of the bases of the decision of the court below. Thus the immediacy of the effect of respondents' action upon interstate commerce is admitted, and the argument that the interdicted shipments constituted but a small part of the 'total national output in the industry' is dismissed as irrelevant. This ruling necessarily follows from the reasoning of our decisions under the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  151-166. In National Labor Relations Board v. Fainblatt, \n306 \nU.S. 601, 606\n, 59 S.Ct. 668, 671, we said that 'The exercise of Congressional power under the Sherman Act ... has never been thought to be constitutionally restricted because in any particular case the volume of the commerce affected may be small'. Here, the volume affected was very substantial although it was but a small proportion of the entire traffic in similar commodities. Again, the Court rejects the conclusion of the court below that the evidence did not sustain a finding that respondents intended to prevent the shipment of the goods. The contrary, as we have seen, was clearly shown.\n Nor does the 'rule of reason' aid respondents. \n3\n The test of reasonableness under that rule is the effect of the agreement or combination, not the motives which inspire it. Leaders of industry have been taught in striking fashion that when the Court finds that they have combined to impose a direct restraint upon interstate com- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 518]\n\u00a0\n merce, their benevolent purposes to promote the interest of the industry, or to rescue it from a distressful condition, will not save them even from criminal prosecution for violation of the Sherman Act. See United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., Inc., \n310 \nU.S. 150\n, 60 S.Ct. 811, 84 L.Ed. --, decided May 6, 1940. If labor unions are not excepted from the Act, and they have acted outside the legitimate field contemplated by the Clayton Act, the impartial enforcement of the law would seem to require that the same doctrine be applied to them. In that view, the purpose of respondents to promote the interests of labor organization cannot be deemed to justify the direct and intentional restraint they imposed upon interstate commerce. The opinion of the Court does not appear to hold otherwise. From no point of view, as it seems to me, can the restraint be regarded as reasonable.\n Why then should the Sherman Act be construed to be inapplicable? It is said that the Act was not aimed at 'policing' interstate transportation. But this would seem to be a statement of result rather than a justification for reaching it. If 'policing' means the protection of interstate transportation from unlawful conspiracies to restrain it, it would seem that the Sherman Act provides that protection. The fact that various statutes have been passed by Congress to prevent the transportation of articles deemed to be injurious does not indicate the contrary, for these are statutes restricting the right of transportation in order to protect the public, while the Sherman Act is aimed at securing the freedom of transportation in lawful commerce.\n The question whether a conspiracy to prevent transportation in interstate commerce was within the Sherman Act came before the circuit courts not long after the Act was passed. In United States v. Workingmen's Amalgamated Council, C.C., 54 F. 994, 999, 26 L.R.A. 158, it appeared that in consequence of a difference between the warehousemen in New Orleans and their employees and the principal draymen and \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 519]\n\u00a0\n their subordinates, a strike was called by labor associations which enforced 'a discontinuance of labor in all kinds of business, including the business of transportation of goods and merchandise which were in transit through the city of New Orleans, from state to state, and to and from foreign countries'. By the intended effect of the defendants' actions, 'not a bale of goods constituting the commerce of the country could be moved'. District Judge Billings, sitting in the Circuit Court, concluded that there was no question 'but that the combination of the defendants was in restraint of commerce' and hence a violation of the Sherman Act. Id., C. C., 54 F. at pages 999, 1000, 26 L.R.A. 158. An injunction was granted and the order was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 5 Cir., 57 F. 85.\n A similar view was apparently entertained by Circuit Judge Taft and Circuit Judge Lurton. See Thomas v. Cincinnati, N.O. & T.P.R. Co., C.C., 62 F. 803, 821. It was noted in that case that a conspiracy to prevent transportation might result in the paralysis of interstate commerce. Id., C.C., 62 F. at page 822.\n In the case of United States v. Debs, C.C., 64 F. 724, the United States brought suit to enjoin those engaged in a conspiracy to interfere with transportation upon several railroads, and an injunction having been issued and disobeyed, contempt proceedings were instituted. The question was whether the federal court had jurisdiction to issue the injunction. Circuit Judge Woods found that it had and based his decision upon the Sherman Act. After stating that the original design of the Act to suppress trusts and monopolies created by contract or combination in the form of trust, which would be of a contractual character, was adhered to, the court thought it equally clear that 'a further and more comprehensive purpose' came to be entertained and was embodied in the final form of the enactment. The Act extended to conspiracies in the sense of the law and, citing the decisions showing the \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 520]\n\u00a0\n constitutional scope of the term 'commerce' and its application to transportation, the court found no reason for thinking that the term as used in the Sherman Act was 'less comprehensive'. Id., C.C., 64 F. at pages 747-751.\n It is true that when the Debs case came to this Court on a petition for habeas corpus, the decision sustaining the jurisdiction of the federal court to entertain the suit by the United States was placed upon the ground that the United States, having the full attributes of sovereignty within the limits of its granted powers, had among those the power over interstate commerce and over the transmission of the mails and was entitled to remove everything put upon highways, natural or artificial, to obstruct the passage of interstate commerce or the carrying of the mails. \n158 \nU.S. 564\n, 15 S.Ct. 900. But while the Court chose that broad ground for sustaining jurisdiction, it was careful not to intimate disagreement with the basis of the decision in the Circuit Court as to the application of the Sherman Act. Referring to that decision, and to the Sherman Act, the Court said: 'We enter into no examination of the act of July 2, 1890 (c. 647) (26 Stat. 209), upon which the circuit court relied mainly to sustain its jurisdiction. It must not be understood from this that we dissent from the conclusions of that court in reference to the scope of the act, but simply that we prefer to rest our judgment on the broader ground which has been discussed in this opinion, believing it of importance that the principles underlying it should be fully stated and affirmed'. Id., 158 U.S. at page 600, 15 S.Ct. at page 912.\n In Loewe v. Lawlor, \n208 \nU.S. 274\n, 28 S.Ct. 301, 310, 13 Ann.Cas. 815, in holding that the Sherman Act applied to labor unions, the Court cited in support of its reasoning the case of United States v. Workingmen's Amalgamated Council, supra, quoting the statement of District Judge Billings in describing the New Orleans conspiracy: 'One of the intended results of their combined action was the forced stagnation of \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 521]\n\u00a0\n all the commerce which flowed through New Orleans. This intent and combined action are none the less unlawful because they included in their scope the paralysis of all other business within the city as well'. That 'forced stagnation' was the obstruction of interstate transportation. The Court in the Loewe case also quoted in full the observation in the Debs case that the Court should not be understood as dissenting from the conclusions of the circuit court as to the scope of the Sherman Act. And this Court, still considering the application of that Act to labor unions, then quoted what had been said by Mr. Justice Brewer in the Debs case, 158 U.S. at page 581, 15 S.Ct. at page 905, supra, with respect to obstructions to interstate commerce, as follows: 'It is curious to note the fact that in a large proportion of the cases in respect to interstate commerce brought to this court the question presented was of the validity of state legislation in its bearings upon interstate commerce, and the uniform course of decision has been to declare that it is not within the competency of a state to legislate in such a manner as to obstruct interstate commerce. If a state, with its recognized powers of sovereignty, is impotent to obstruct interstate commerce, can it be that any mere voluntary association of individuals within the limits of that State has a power which the State itself does not possess?' Loewe v. Lawlor, supra, 208 U.S. at pages 303, 304, 28 S.Ct. at page 311, 13 Ann.Cas. 815.\n In the light of these decisions of the circuit courts and of the significant and unanimous expressions by this Court, the argument seems to be untenable that the Sherman Act has been regarded as not extending to conspiracies to obstruct or prevent transportation in interstate or foreign commerce. On the contrary, I think that hitherto it has not been supposed that such conspiracies lay outside the Act.\n With this background we come to the question whether the application of the Sherman Act in the instant case, \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 522]\n\u00a0\n which would otherwise appear to be required by its comprehensive terms, has been precluded by our decisions in labor cases. The view is announced that the Sherman Act was not directed at those restraints which fall short of any form of market control of a commodity, such as to monopolize the supply, control its price, or discriminate between its would-be purchasers. That is, in short, that it does not apply to the direct and intentional obstruction or prevention of the shipment or transportation of goods to fill the orders of customers in interstate commerce such as we have here. I do not read our decisions as either requiring or justifying such a judicial limitation of the provisions of the Act. Rather, I believe, they point to a contrary conclusion.\n While Loewe v. Lawlor, supra, was the case of a boycott, the principle applied was not limited to that sort of restraint but was as broad as the terms of the Act. The Court not only did not exclude obstruction of interstate shipments from being regarded as a violation of the statute but drew upon the decisions which had involved such obstruction to support its general conclusion. The Court considered the means employed in the Loewe case as constituting a direct restraint, but plainly those means were not deemed to be exclusive of other means including those which had been employed in the cases which the Court cited. The same may be said of other boycott cases. See Duplex Printing Press Company v. Deering, \n254 \nU.S. 443\n, 41 S.Ct. 172, 16 A.L.R. 196; Bedford Cut Stone Company v. Journeyman Stone Cutters' Association, \n274 \nU.S. 37\n, 47 S.Ct. 522, 54 A.L.R. 791.\n In Gompers v. Buck's Stove & Range Co., \n221 \nU.S. 418, 438\n, 31 S.Ct. 492, 496, 497, 34 L.R.A.,N.S., 874, the Court, referring to Loewe v. Lawlor, emphasized the comprehensiveness of the Sherman Act, saying:\n'In Loewe v. Lawlor, 208 U.S. (274) 306, 28 S.Ct. 301, 52 L.Ed. (488) 505, 13 Ann.Cas. 815, the statute was held to apply to any unlawful combination resulting in restraint of interstate commerce. In that case the damages sued for were occasioned by acts which, among other \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 523]\n\u00a0\n things, did include the circulation of advertisements. But the principle announced by the court was general. It covered any illegal means by which interstate commerce is restrained, whether by unlawful combinations of capital, or unlawful combinations of labor; and we think, also, whether the restraint be occasioned by unlawful contracts, trusts, pooling arrangements, black lists, boycotts, coercion, threats, intimidation, and whether these be made effective, in whole or in part, by acts, words, or printed matter'.\n\n Moreover, of what avail is it to interdict boycotts or to assure a free market, that is, to secure freedom in obtaining customers, and yet to leave unprotected the right to ship goods to the customers who are thus obtained? Of what advantage is it to solicit orders freely in interstate commerce if they cannot be filled? The freedom of interstate movement- immunity from conspiracies directly to restrain shipment and delivery-lies at the very base of a free market and the untrammeled making of sales.\n The First Coronado Company case, \n259 \nU.S. 344\n, 42 S.Ct. 570, 27 A.L.R. 762, chiefly relied upon, does not seem to afford an adequate basis for the broader ruling now made. That decision was centered upon the point that production, as such,-in that case, coal mining,-was not interstate commerce, and that obstruction to coal mining through a strike was not in itself a direct obstruction to interstate commerce. Id., 259 U.S. at pages 407, 408, 42 S.Ct. at pages 581, 582, 27 A. L.R. 762. And it was deemed to be necessary to go further and find an 'intent to injure, obstruct or restrain interstate commerce' in order to bring the case within the Sherman Act. The evidence was found insufficient to show such an intent. Thus, the Court did not decide that a direct and intentional obstruction of interstate commerce was not a violation of the Act. In the Second Coronado Company case (\n268 \nU.S. 295\n, 45 S.Ct. 551), evidence of that intent was supplied and the Court ac- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 524]\n\u00a0\n cordingly set aside a judgment in favor of the local union. It is true that the Court, in dealing with the purpose of the local union, found that it was to stop the production of nonunion coal and prevent its shipment to markets of other States, where by competition it would tend to reduce the price of the commodity and affect injuriously the maintenance of wages for union labor in competing mines. But the interstate commerce that was thus found to be directly and intentionally obstructed was the shipment of the coal, and whether the purpose was to maintain unionization in other States, or within the same State, would not seem to be material, so long as the interstate commerce in either case is directly and intentionally prevented.\n The Court in the Second Coronado Company case not only decided the particular case but laid down the general principle as follows: 'But when the intent of those unlawfully preventing the manufacture or production is shown to be to restrain or control the supply entering and moving in interstate commerce, or the price of it in interstate markets, their action is a direct violation of the Anti-Trust Act'. Id., 268 U.S. at page 310, 45 S.Ct. at page 556. The use of the disjunctive is significant.\n The ruling of the First Coronado Company case as to a mere stoppage of production, in the absence of proof of a direct and intentional obstruction of interstate commerce, was repeated in the case of United Leather Workers v. Herkert & Meisel Trunk Company, \n265 \nU.S. 457\n, 44 S.Ct. 623, 627, 33 A.L.R. 566. But the dictum from the opinion in that case, which the Court quotes in its present opinion, must be read in connection with what immediately follows where the Court pointed out that there was no direct interference by the defendants in the Herkert case 'with the interstate transportation' of the goods of the plaintiff company. Any doubt as to the true import of the Coronado and Herkert cases is set at rest by this Court's construction of these decisions in the \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 525]\n\u00a0\n case of Bedford Cut Stone Company v. Journeyman Stone Cutters' Association, supra. There the Court emphasized the point as to the absence of direct interference with interstate transportation in the earlier cases, saying ( 274 U.S. at pages 47, 48, 47 S.Ct. at page 525, 54 A.L.R. 791):\n'The case, therefore, is controlled, not by United Mine Workers v. Coronado Coal Co., supra (\n259 \nU.S. 344\n, 42 S.Ct. 570, 27 A.L. R. 762), and United Leather Workers v. Herkert & Meisel Trunk Co., \n265 \nU.S. 457\n, 44 S.Ct. 523, 33 A.L.R. 566, as respondents contend, but by others presently to be discussed. In the United Leather Workers Case, it appeared that the strikes were leveled only against production, and that the strikers (page 471 (of 265 U.S.), 44 S.Ct. 627 (68 L.Ed. 1104, 33 A.L.R. 566)) 'did nothing which in any way directly interfered with the interstate transportation or sales of the complainants' product'; and the decision rests upon the ground that there was an entire absence of evidence or circumstances to show that the defendants, in their conspiracy to coerce complainants, were directing their scheme against interstate commerce. United Mine Workers v. Coronado Coal Co., supra, pages 408, 409 ( of 259 U.S.) (42 S.Ct. 570(582)), (66 L.Ed. 975, 27 A.L.R. 762), is to the same effect'.\n\n And the general principle set forth in the Second Coronado Company case, as above quoted, was reiterated.\n In Levering & Garrigues Company v. Morrin, \n289 \nU.S. 103, 107\n, 53 S.Ct. 549, 550, there was no showing of a direct or intentional restraint of interstate commerce. But in Local 167 v. United States, \n291 \nU.S. 293\n, 54 S.Ct. 396, 398, the evidence showed a conspiracy 'to burden the free movement of live poultry into the metropolitan area' in New York. The Court said: 'The interference by appellants and others with the unloading, the transportation, the sales by marketmen to retailers, the prices charged, and the amount of profits exacted operates substantially and directly to restrain and burden the untrammelled shipment and movement of the poultry while unquestionably it is in interstate commerce'. Id., 291 U.S. at page 297, 54 S.Ct. 398. Thus it was 'the untrammelled shipment and movement' which, when found to be di- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 526]\n\u00a0\n rectly and intentionally restrained, was held to constitute violation of the Sherman Act.\n Suppose, for example, there should be a conspiracy among the teamsters and truck drivers in New York City to prevent the hauling of goods and their transportation in interstate commerce, can it be doubted that the Sherman Act would apply? Would it not be essentially the same sort of obstruction of interstate commerce as was found to have been effected in United States v. Workingmen's Amalgamated Council, supra, where the transportation of goods in New Orleans in interstate commerce was tied up? There the defendants paralyzed local business and their object was to benefit themselves in their dealings with their employers, but to attain that end they directly and intentionally obstructed the movement of goods in interstate commerce and thus came within the interdiction of the Act. The fact that the defendants in the instant case are not teamsters can make no difference as it is the direct and intentional prevention of interstate commerce that turns the scales.\n Our decisions have said much of the 'free flow' of interstate commerce. What is this metaphor of an interstate stream protected in its flow by the Sherman Act but a striking way of describing the movement of goods by untrammeled shipments in pursuance of freely negotiated sales?\n It was to protect this free movement from being obstructed by industrial strife through the denial of collective bargaining that Congress passed the National Labor Relations Act. In sustaining the validity of that Act we referred to our decisions with respect to the conduct of employees engaged in production, summing up the matter in this way: 'And in the second Coronado Case the Court ruled that, while the mere reduction in the supply of an article to be shipped in interstate commerce by the illegal or tortious prevention of its manufacture or production \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 527]\n\u00a0\n is ordinarily an indirect and remote obstruction to that commerce, nevertheless when the 'intent of those unlawfully preventing the manufacture or production is shown to be to restrain or control the supply entering and moving in interstate commerce, or the price of it in interstate markets, their action is a direct violation of the (Sherman) Act.\" National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, \n301 \nU.S. 1, 40\n, 57 S.Ct. 615, 625, 626, 108 A.L.R. 1352. It is true that in that case we were considering the power of Congress over interstate commerce, but we were pointing to the exercise of that power in the Sherman Act, with respect to which we had previously said 'that Congress meant to deal comprehensively and effectively with the evils resulting from contracts, combinations, and conspiracies in restraint of trade, and to that end to exercise all the power it possessed'. Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers v. United States, \n286 \nU.S. 427, 435\n, 52 S.Ct. 607, 609. That power, and its exercise, should not be deemed to fall short of the protection of the interstate shipment of goods from conspiracies to impose a direct restraint upon it.\n The attempt in the court below to distinguish between the use of the word 'affect' in the National Labor Relations Act and the word 'restraint' in the Sherman Act is ineffectual as it fails to take note of the fact that the word 'affect' was construed as purporting 'to reach only what may be deemed to burden or obstruct' interstate or foreign commerce, and hence under the familiar principle 'that acts which directly burden or obstruct interstate or foreign commerce, or its free flow, are within the reach of the congressional power', the statute was upheld. National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, supra, 301 U.S. at pages 31, 32, 57 S.Ct. at page 621, 108 A.L.R. 1352, supra.\n The evil sought to be remedied by the National Labor Relations Act was the interruption of interstate commerce primarily by the prevention of the free shipment and delivery of goods in that commerce, and hence it has \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 528]\n\u00a0\n been applied to those cases where industries are of such a character that the prohibited unfair labor practices would naturally have the effect of interrupting the movement of commodities between the States. See, e.g., National Labor Relations Board v. Fruehauf Trailer Co., \n301 \nU.S. 49, 53\n, 54 S., 57 S.Ct. 642, 643, 108 A.L.R. 1352; National Labor Relations Board v. Friedman-Harry Marks Co., \n301 \nU.S. 58, 72\n, 73 S., 57 S.Ct. 645, 646, 108 A.L.R. 1352; Santa Cruz Fruit Packing Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, \n303 \nU.S. 453, 468\n, 58 S.Ct. 656, 661; Consolidated Edison Company v. National Labor Relations Board, \n305 \nU.S. 197, 221\n, 59 S.Ct. 206, 213. In National Labor Relations Board v. Fainblatt, supra, 306 U.S. at pages 605, 606, 59 S.Ct. at page 671, we found that 'interstate commerce was involved in the transportation of the materials to be processed across state lines to the factory of respondents and in the transportation of the finished product to points outside the state for distribution to purchasers and ultimate consumers', and that 'transportation alone across state lines is commerce within the constitutional control of the national government'; and, having said that, we pointed to the protective exercise of congressional power under the Sherman Act as not in any way restricted because the volume of the commerce involved in such transportation was small. Id.\n It would indeed be anomalous if, while employers are bound by the Labor Act because their unfair labor practices may lead to conduct which would prevent the shipment of their goods in interstate commerce, at the same time the direct and intentional obstruction or prevention of such shipments by the employees were not deemed to be a restraint of interstate commerce under the broad terms of the Sherman Act.\n This Court has never heretofore decided that a direct and intentional obstruction or prevention of the shipment of goods in interstate commerce was not a violation of the Sherman Act. In my opinion it should not so \n\n[310 \nU.S. 469, 529]\n\u00a0\n decide now. It finds no warrant for such a decision in the terms of the statute. I am unable to find any compulsion of judicial decision requiring the Court so to limit those terms. Restraints may be of various sorts. Some may be imposed by employers, others by employees. But when they are found to be unreasonable and directly imposed upon interstate commerce, both employers and employees are subject to the sanctions of the Act.\n It is said that such a view would bring practically every strike in modern industry within the application of the statute. I do not agree. The right to quite work, the right peaceably to persuade others to quit work, the right to proceed by lawful measures within the contemplation of the Clayton Act to attain the legitimate objects of labor organization, is to my mind quite a different matter from a conspiracy directly and intentionally to prevent the shipment of goods in interstate commerce either by their illegal seizure for that purpose, or by the direct and intentional obstruction of their transportation or by blocking the highways of interstate intercourse.\n Once it is decided, as this Court does decide, that the Sherman Act does not except labor unions from its purview,-once it is decided, as this Court does decide, that the conduct here shown is not within the immunity conferred by the Clayton Act,-the Court, as it seems to me, has no option but to apply the Sherman Act in accordance with its express provisions.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice ROBERTS join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This Court has recently characterized the encouraging, aiding and abetting the strikers in similar unlawful acts as a 'high-handed proceeding without shadow of legal right', see National Labor Relations Board v.

They are H.R. 6640, in the 52nd Congress; H.R. 10539 in the 56th Congress; H.R. 11667 in the 56th Congress; S. 649 and H.R. 14947 in the 57th Congress; S. 1728, H.R. 89, H. R. 166, and H.R. 2636 in the 52nd Congress; H.R. 7938 in the 55th Congress and H.R. 11988 in the 57th Congress. The sole purpose of another bill, S. 1546, 55th Congress, was to amend the act so as to exempt all labor organizations from its prohibitions. Copies of these bills are printed in Bills and Debates Relating to Trusts, Sen.Doc. 147, 57th Cong., 2d Sess., 1902-1903, pp. 465 and 411, 469 and 449, 473 and 431, 477 and 417, 481, 581, 949, 953, 987 and 999. \n[\nFootnote 8\n] See e.g.  6 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731, (1914), 15 U.S.C.A.  17; restrictions on appropriations, 38 Stat. 53 (1913); 44 Stat. 1194 ( 1927).\n For detailed account of the Congressional history see Frankfurter and Greene, The Labor Injunction (1930), pp. 139-144. \n[\nFootnote 9\n] Cf. comment on the labor anti-trust cases in A.L.A.

Jones & Laughlin S. Co., \n301 \nU.S. 1, 40\n, 57 S.Ct. 615, 625, 108 A.L.R. 1352, in discussing the First Coronado Case, it was said 'that it had not been shown that the activities there involved-a local strike-brought them within the provisions of the Anti-Trust Act, ....' (Italics supplied.) \n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] See Debates, 21 Cong.Rec. 2460, 3148; 2 Hoar, Autobiography of Seventy Years 364; Senator Edmunds, The Interstate Trust and Commerce Act of 1890, 194 No.Am.Rev. 801, 813, 'after most careful and earnest consideration by the Judiciary Committee of the Senate it was agreed by every member that it was quite impracticable to include by specific description all the acts which should come within the meaning and purpose of the words 'trade' and 'commerce' or 'trust', or the words 'restraint' or 'monopolize', by precise and all-inclusive definitions; and that these were truly matters for judicial consideration.'\n See, also, Senator Hoar who with Senator Edmunds probably drafted the bill (see A. H. Walker, History of the Sherman Law (1910), p. 27-28) in 36 Cong.Rec. 522, Jan. 6, 1903: 'We undertook by law to clothe the courts with the power and impose on them and the Department of Justice the duty of preventing all combinations in restraint of trade. It was believed that the phrase 'in restraint of trade' had a technical and well-understood meaning in the law'. \n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] See the Bibliography on Trusts (1913) prepared by the Library of Congress. Cf. Homan, 'Industrial Combination as Surveyed in Recent Literature', 44 Quart.J.Econ., 345 (1930). With few exceptions the articles, scientific and popular, reflected the popular idea that the Act was aimed at the prevention of monopolistic practices and restraints upon trade injurious to purchasers and consumers of goods and services by preservation of business competition. See e.g. Seager and Gulick, Trusts and Corporation Problems (1929), 367 et seq., 42 Ann.Am.Acad., Industrial Competition and Combination (July, 1912); P. L. Anderson, Combination v.

II, V; Homan, Trusts, 15 Ency.Soc. Sciences 111, 113, 'clearly the law was inspired by the predatory competitive tactics of the great trusts and its primary purpose was the maintenance of the competitive system in industry.'

Legislative and judicial action of both a criminal and civil nature already restrained concerted action by labor. See e.g. the kinds of strikes which were declared illegal in Pennsylvania, including a strike accompanied by force or threat of harm to persons or property, Brightly's Purdon's Digest of 1885, pp. 426, 1172.\n For collection of state statutes on labor activities, see Report of the Commissioner of Labor, Labor Laws of the Various States (1892); Bull. 370, Labor Laws of the United States with Decisions Relating Thereto, United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (1925); Witte, The Government in Labor Disputes (1932), 12-45, 61-81. \n[\nFootnote 13\n] Three statutes covered in 1890 the Congressional action in relation to obstructions to interstate commerce. A penalty was imposed for the refusal to transmit a telegraph message (R.S.  5269, 17 Stat. 366 ( 1872), 47 U.S.C.A.  8) for transporting nitroglycerine and other explosives without proper safeguards (R.S.  5353, 14 Stat. 81 (1866) and for combining to prevent the continuous carriage of freight, 24 Stat. 382, 49 U.S.C.  7, 49 U.S.C.A.  7. \n[\nFootnote 14\n] See e.g. regulation of; interstate carriage of lottery tickets, 28 Stat. 963 (1895), 18 U.S.C.  387, 18 U.S.C.A.  387; Transportation of obscene books, 29 Stat. 512 (1897), 18 U.S.C.  396, 18 U.S.C.A.  396; transportation of illegally killed game, 31 Stat. 188 (1900), 18 U.S.C.  392-395, 18 U.S.C.A.  392-395; interstate \n thereof, be guilty of a felony and shall be punished by imprisonment from one to ten years or by a fine of $10,000 or both.'\n But the application of the provisions of  420a to labor unions is restricted by  420d, which provides: 'Jurisdiction of offenses. Any person charged with violating section 420a of this title may be prosecuted in any district in which any part of the offense has been committed by him or by his actual associates participating with him in the offense or by his fellow conspirators: Provided, That no court of the United States shall construe or apply any of the provisions of sections 420a to 420e of this title in such manner as to impair, diminish, or in any manner affect the rights of bona-fide labor organizations in lawfully carrying out the legitimate objects thereof, as such rights are expressed in existing statutes of the United States.'\n It is significant that Chapter 9 of the Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C.A.  381 et seq., dealing with 'Offenses Against Foreign And Interstate Commerce', and relating specifically to acts of interstate transportation or its obstruction, makes no mention of the Sherman Act, which is made a part of the Code which deals with social, economic and commercial results of interstate activity, notwithstanding its criminal penalty. \n[\nFootnote 15\n] The history of the Sherman Act as contained in the legislative proceedings is emphatic in its support for the conclusion that 'business competition' was the problem considered and that the act was designed to prevent restraints of trade which had a significant effect on such competition.\n On July 10, 1888, the Senate adopted without discussion a resolution offered by Senator Sherman which directed the Committee on Finance to inquire into and report in connection with revenue bills,\n'such measures as it may deem expedient to set aside, control, restrain or prohibit all arrangements, contracts, agreements, trusts, or combinations between persons or corporations, made with a view, or \n\n the terms on which they shall sell in the market, and may secure release from the stress of competition among themselves', ibid 4090.\n The unanimity with which foes and supporters of the bill spoke of its aims as the protection of free competition, permit use of the debates in interpreting the purpose of the act. See White, C.J. in Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 1, 50\n, 31 S.Ct. 502, 511, 34 L.R.A., N.S., 834, Ann.Cas.1912D 734; United States v.

(1929), pp. 343-345. \n[\nFootnote 16\n] While it is impossible to consider all the anti-trust cases in this Court with reference to the question whether the acts condemned \n or condoned had a substantial effect on competition in the industry, nevertheless in most of them, particularly in the cases arising since the development of the 'rule of reason' in 1912, emphasis was placed on the 'competitive conditions in the industry'.\n In Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. v. United States, \n175 \nU.S. 211\n, 20 S.Ct. 96, arising before the 'rule of reason', Justice Peckham adopted Judge Taft's statement of the case in his opinion in the Circuit Court of Appeals, 6 Cir., 85 F. 271, 46 L.R.A. 122, pointing out that within substantial parts of the United States, price competition had been practically eliminated. See 175 U.S. at page 236, 20 S.Ct. at page 105. Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 1\n, 31 S.Ct. 502, 34 L.R.A.,N.S., 834, Ann.Cas.1912D, 734, which heralded the 'rule of reason' stressed intent to eliminate competition and the predatory practices by which competition had actually been eliminated. United States v. American Tobacco Co., \n221 \nU.S. 106\n, 31 S.Ct. 632, decided the same day, involved a trust which dominated the whole industry and exercised its power in securing price control. In both the Oil case and the Tobacco case, decisions were specifically rested on the ground that the condemned combinations 'unduly restricted competition.'\n A combination of two great railroads resulting in 'destroying or greatly abridging the free operation of competition theretofore existing' was enjoined in United States v. Union Pacific R. Co., \n226 \nU.S. 61\n, 33 S. Ct. 53, 58. But where the majority of the Court was of opinion that the evidence did not show that the combination 'ever possessed or exerted sufficient power when acting alone to control prices of the products of the industry', the Sherman Act was held not to apply to the combination, United States v. United States Steel Corporation, \n251 \nU.S. 417\n, 40 S.Ct. 293, 295, 8 A.L.R. 1121. On finding such a power to control the output, supply of the market and the transportation facilities of potential competitors, in the anthracite coal market, the arrangement was held void in United States v. Reading Co., \n253 \nU.S. 26, 47\n, 48 S., 40 S.Ct. 425, 428, 429.\n The belief that 'competitive conditions in the trade in harvesting machines have been established', compelled the court to find compliance with an earlier consent decree in United States v. International Harvester Co., \n274 \nU.S. 693, 704\n, 47 S.Ct. 748, 752.\n'It has been repeatedly held by this court that the purpose of the statute is to maintain free competition in interstate commerce ...', American Column & Lumber Co. v.

United States, \n288 \nU.S. 344, 360\n, 53 S.Ct. 471, 474. \n\n[\nFootnote 23\n] Combinations of capital and labor have seldom been treated as phases of a general movement to suppress competition. See Taft, Anti-Trust Act and the Supreme Court (1914), p. 21; Seager, The Attitude of the State Towards Trade Unions and Trusts, 22 Pol.Sci.Q. 385 (1907); Commons and Andrews, Principles of Labor Legislation (1927), pp. 125-129.\n In England prior to 1824 the two types of combinations were treated as substantially the same, the Combinations Acts (39 Geo. III, c. 81; 39 & 40 Geo. III, c. 106), preventing combinations of wage earners even for the more obvious purpose of securing higher wages or shorter hours. These restrictions have been removed by various Acts (e.g. 5 Geo. IV, c. 95, s. 2; 22 Vict., c. 34; 34 & 35 Vict., c. 31, s.c.; 38 & 39 Vict. 36) until the Trade Disputes Act of 1906 (6 Edw. VII, c. 47) which clearly encourages the combinations of workmen. See Henderson, Trade Unions and the Law (1927). Compare the English treatment of capital combinations, see, The Anti-Trust Laws of the British Commonwealth of Nations, 32 Col.L.Rev. 324.\n The experience in the United States has paralleled that in England. In a few early cases all labor combinations were regarded as unlawful, Groat, Attitude of American Courts in Labor Cases, 42 Col.Univ.Studies ( 1911), pp. 36-38, but since Commonwealth v. Hunt, 1842, 4 Metc., Mass., 111, 38 Am.Dec. 346, the legitimate scope of labor combinations has steadily expanded, see Frankfurter and Greene, The Labor Injunction (1930), c. I; Landis, Cases on Labor Law (1934), pp. 32-34. In addition to this difference in treatment reflected in judicial decisions, many states have by legislation accorded favorable treatment to unions on other matters. See collection of legislation favorable to unionism foun in United Mine Workers v. Coronado Coal Co., \n259 \nU.S. 344, 386\n, 42 S.Ct. 570, 574, 27 A.L.R. 762, note 1; Bull. No. 370, Labor Laws of the United States, Bureau of Labor Statistics, United States Department of Labor ( 1925); Witte, The Government and Labor Disputes (1932), 17 et seq. \n\n[\nFootnote 24\n] Federal legislation aimed at protecting and favoring labor organizations and eliminating the competition of employers and employees based on labor conditions regarded as substandard, through the establishment of industry-wide standards both by collective bargaining and by legislation setting up minimum wage and hour standards, supports the conclusion that Congress does not regard the effects upon competition from such combinations and standards as against public policy or condemned by the Sherman Act.\n The Norris-LaGuardia Act, 47 Stat. 70, 29 U.S.C.  101-115, 29 U.S.C. A.  101-115, limiting the use of injunctions in labor disputes, is predicated on the policy that 'under prevailing economic conditions', it is necessary that the worker 'have full freedom of association ... to negotiate the terms and conditions of his employment.' The Railway Labor Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 1185, 45 U.S.C.  151-164, 45 U.S.C.A.  151-164, provided for independence of railroad employees in the matter of self- organization. The National Labor Relations Act, 49 Stat. 449, 29 U.S.C.  151-166, 29 U.S.C.A.  151-166, was passed to protect the workers in the 'exercise ... of full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of their own choosing, for the purpose of negotiating the terms and conditions of their employment ...' and expressly protects the right of self-organization, recognizes the strike as a proper union weapon and permits closed-shop contracts.\n The Public Contracts Act, 49 Stat. 2036, 41 U.S.C.  35-48, 41 U.S.C. A.  35-48, and aimed at preventing price competition in government bidding based on wage cutting and authorizes the establishment of minimum wage standards. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 1060, 29 U. S.C.  201-219, 29 U.S.C.A.  201-219, likewise seeks to eliminate competition which thrived upon low wages and substandard working conditions.\n This series of acts clearly recognizes that combinations of workers eliminating competition among themselves and restricting competition among their employers based on wage cutting are not contrary to the public policy. \n\n[\nFootnote 25\n] Whether the interest of the labor unions in these cases in maintaining and extending their respective organizations, rendered the restraint reasonable as a means of attaining that end within the common law rule, or brought the restraints within the rule of reason developed and announced in the Standard Oil case, was not discussed and we need not consider it here. Restraints upon the competitive marketing of a manufacturer's product brought about by an agreement between the employer and his employees in order to secure continuous employment of the employees was held to be within the rule of reason and therefore not an unreasonable restraint of trade in National Ass'n of Window Glass Manufacturers v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 403\n, 44 S.Ct. 148. \n[\nFootnote 26\n] Section 6 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.A.  17, declared that 'nothing contained in the antitrust laws shall be construed ... to forbid or restrain individual members of such organizations from lawfully carrying out the legitimate objects thereof; nor shall such organizations, or the members thereof, be held or construed to be illegal combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade, under the antitrust laws'. And  20 of the Clayton Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  52, provided, 'No restraining order or injunction shall be granted by any court of the United States, or a judge or the judges thereof, in any case between an employer and employees, or between employers and employees ... involving, or growing out of, a dispute concerning terms or conditions of employment, unless necessary to prevent irreparable injury to property, or to a property right .... \n'And no such restraining order or injunction shall prohibit any person or persons, whether singly or in concert, from terminating any relation of employment, or from ceasing to perform any work or labor, or from recommending, advising, or persuading others by peaceful means so to do; ... or from ceasing to patronize or to employ any party to such dispute, or from recommending, advising, or persuading others by peaceful and lawful means so to do; ... nor shall any of the acts specified in this paragraph be considered or held to be violations of any law of the United States.'\n\n In both the Duplex Printing Press Co. and the Bedford Stone Cutters cases, it was held that the prohibition of  6 of the Clayton Act did not extend to illegal combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade, which the concerted action taken by the labor unions in these cases was held to be, and that the restrictions of  20 of the Clayton Act upon the injunction applied only to actual disputes between an employer and his employees, with respect to the terms or conditions of their own employment, and did not extend to acts of labor unions, boycotting the product of an employer by whom they were not employed. Cf. New Negro Alliance v. Sanitary Grocery Co., \n303 \nU.S. 552\n, 58 S.Ct. 703. \n\n[\nFootnote 27\n] The assertion that the decision in the First Coronado case rests on the ground that 'production, as such-in that case, coal mining-was not interstate commerce' is neither supported by the opinion in that case nor by its subsequent interpretation by this Court. See A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 495, 548\n, 55 S.Ct. 837, 851, 97 A.L.R. 947; National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin S. Co., \n301 \nU.S. 40\n, 57 S.Ct. 625, 108 A.L.R. 1352. See note 9, supra. Cf. Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, \n310 \nU.S. 381\n, 60 S.Ct. 907, 84 L.Ed. --, decided May 20, 1940. The opinion recognized that the cessation of production of the coal prevented interstate commerce in the coal but held that it did not violate the Sherman Act because the effect on the commerce was 'indirect', to which it was thought the Sherman Act did not apply. \n\n[\nFootnote 28\n] It is said to be anomalous to hold employers subject to the Labor Act because their unfair practices would prevent the shipment of their goods in interstate commerce, and at the same time to hold the activities of employees which amount to a 'direct and intentional obstruction' to interstate movement of goods, not to be within the meaning of 'restraint of trade or commerce', under the Sherman Act. If any other answer than a comparison of the legislative history and objectives of the two acts, and our decisions under them, were needed, it seems obvious that the Sherman Act cannot be said to subject employees to a liability which it does not impose on employers or others. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 15 U.S.C.,  17, 15 U.S.C.A.  17; 29 U.S.C.  52, 29 U.S.C.A.  52. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 15 U.S.C.  1, 15 U.S.C.A.  1. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Standard Oil Co. v.

STATE OF ALABAMA(1940)\nNo. 124\nArgued: December 7, 1939Decided: January 2, 1940\n\n\n\n\n[308 \nU.S. 444, 445]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. L. S. Moore and John Foshee, both of Centerville, Ala., and Edward H. Saunders, of Bessemer, Ala., for petitioner.\n Mr. Thomas Seay Lawson, of Montgomery, Ala., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner was convicted of murder in the Circuit Court of Bibb County, Alabama; he was sentenced to death and the State Supreme Court affirmed. \n1\n The sole question presented is whether in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S.C.A.Const., 'petitioner was denied the right of counsel, with the accustomed incidents of consultation and opportunity of preparation for trial', because after competent counsel were duly appointed their motion for continuance was denied. Vigilant concern for the maintenance of the constitutional right of an accused to assistance of counsel led us to grant certiorari. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Had petitioner been denied any representation of counsel at all, such a clear violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of assistance of counsel would have required reversal of his conviction. \n3\n But counsel were duly appointed for petitioner by the trial court as \n\n[308 \nU.S. 444, 446]\n\u00a0\n required both by Alabama law4 and the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Since the Constitution nowhere specifies any period which must intervene between the required appointment of counsel and trial, the fact, standing alone, that a continuance has been denied, does not constitute a denial of the constitutional right to assistance of counsel. In the course of trial, after due appointment of competent counsel, many procedural questions necessarily arise which must be decided by the trial judge in the light of facts then presented and conditions then existing. Disposition of a request for continuance is of this nature and is made in the discretion of the trial judge, the exercise of which will ordinarily not be reviewed. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n But the denial of opportunity for appointed counsel to confer, to consult with the accused and to prepare his defense, could convert the appointment of counsel into a sham and nothing more than a formal compliance with the Constitution's requirement that an accused be given the assistance of counsel. 6 The Constitution's guarantee of assistance of counsel cannot be satisfied by mere formal appointment.\n In determining whether petitioner has been denied his constitutional right to assistance of counsel, we must remember that the Fourteenth Amendment does not limit the power of the States to try and deal with crimes committed within their borders,7 and was not intended to bring to the test of a decision of this Court every ruling \n\n[308 \nU.S. 444, 447]\n\u00a0\n made in the course of a State trial. \n8\n Consistently with the preservation of constitutional balance between State and Federal sovereignty, this Court must respect and is reluctant to interfere with the States' determination of local social policy. \n9\n But where denial of the constitutional right to assistance of counsel is asserted, its peculiar sacredness10 demands that we scrupulously review the record. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n The record shows-\n Petitioner was convicted on an indictment filed in the Bibb County Circuit Court for murder alleged to have occurred in 1932. He was found and arrested in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, shortly before March 21, 1938. On that date, Monday, he was arraigned at a regular term of the Court; two practicing attorneys of the local bar were appointed to defend him; pleas of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity were entered and the presiding judge set his trial for Wednesday, March 23. The case was not reached Wednesday, but was called Thursday, the 24th, at which time his attorneys filed a motion for continuance, on the ground that they had not had sufficient time and opportunity since their appointment to investigate and prepare his defense. Affidavits of both attorneys accompanied the motion.\n One attorney's affidavit alleged that he had not had time to investigate and prepare the defense because he had been actually engaged in another trial from the time of his appointment at 2 P.M., Monday, until 9 P.M. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 444, 448]\n\u00a0\n that evening; his presence had been required in the court room on Tuesday, March 22, due to employment in other cases set, but not actually tried; he had been detained in court Wednesday, March 23, waiting for petitioner's case to be called; but after his appointment he had talked with petitioner and 'had serious doubts as to his sanity.'\n The affidavit by the other attorney stated that he too had not had proper time and opportunity to investigate petitioner's case because of his employment in other pending cases, some of which were not disposed of until Tuesday at 4:30 P.M.\n No ruling on the motion for continuance appears in the record, but on Thursday, the 24th, the trial proceeded before a jury.\n The foster parents of the person whose murder was charged and another witness testified that on the day of the killing deceased petitioner's wife from whom he was then separated, had started to a nearby neighbor's house to get a washtub when petitioenr approached her with a pistol in his right hand; words ensued; she turned and ran and he shot her twice in the back; she fell and he shot her three more times. Petitioner denied that these witnesses were at the time in a position to see what occurred. Admitting he had come some three miles from his home to see his wife, he insisted that he had no pistol but that when he spoke to her she had a bucket of water and something else; they quarrelled; she then drew a pistol from under her sweater and he 'got to tussling with her over the pistol, trying to take it away from her'; 'shot her, behind the shoulder, and through the back, tussling with her,' and then ran away. There is no suggestion in the record that there were any witnesses to the killing other than those who testified. The plea of insanity apparently was withdrawn. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n[308 \nU.S. 444, 449]\n\u00a0\n The jury returned a verdict of guilty with the death penalty. On the same day, the 24th, petitioner's counsel moved for new trial, setting up error in the failure to grant the requested continuance. This motion for new trial was continued from time to time until June 30. In the interim, a third attorney had been employed by petitioner's sister, and on June 30, petitioner's three lawyers filed an amendment to the motion for new trial, specifically setting out that the denial of a continuance had deprived petitioner of the equal protection of the laws and due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, by denying him 'the right of counsel, with the accustomed incidents of consultation and opportunity of preparation for trial.'\n When the motion for new trial was heard the only witnesses were petitioner's three attorneys. The third attorney, employed by petitioner's sister, testified only that he had been employed after the trial and verdict. The two attorneys who had represented petitioner at the trial substantially repeated what they had set out in their original affidavits. In some detail they testified that: they had conferred with petitioner after their appointment on Monday, March 21, but he gave them no helpful information available as a defense or names of any witnesses; between their appointment and the trial they made inquiries of people who lived in the community in which the petitioner had lived prior to the crime with which he was charged and in which the killing occurred and none of those questioned, including a brother of petitioner, could offer information or assistance helpful to the defense; they (the attorneys) had not prior to the trial conferred with local doctors, of whom there were four, as to petitioner's mental condition, had neither summoned any medical experts or other witnesses nor asked for compulsory process guaranteed an accused by the Alabama Constitution, Art. 1, Sec. 6. And in response to inquiries \n\n[308 \nU.S. 444, 450]\n\u00a0\n made by the trial judge they stated that they had not made any request for leave of absence from the court to make further inquiry or investigation.\n The motion for new trial was overruled.\n Upon appeal, the Alabama Supreme Court gave full consideration to the motion for continuance although no ruling upon it was contained in the record and concluded that the trial court had not abused its discretion in failing to continue the case. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n Under the particular circumstances appearing in this record, we do not think petitioner has been denied the benefit of assistance of counsel guaranteed to him by the Fourteenth Amendment. His appointed counsel, as the Supreme Court of Alabama recognized, have performed their 'full duty intelligently and well.' Not only did they present petitioner's defense in the trial court, but in conjunction with counsel later employed, they carried an appeal to the State Supreme Court, and then Const. of Ala. ( 1901) Art. VI, Sec. 144. Their appointment and the representation rendered under it were not mere formalities, but petitioner's counsel have-as was their solemn duty-contested every step of statute, entertain causes at substantially case. Petitioner has thus been afforded the assistance of zealous and earnest counsel from arraignment to final argument in this Court.\n The offense for which petitioner was convicted occurred in a County largely rural. The County seat, where court was held, has a population of less than a thousand. \n14\n Indictments in the Bibb County Circuit Court, as in most rural Counties throughout the Nation, are most frequently returned and trials had during fixed terms or sessions of \n\n[308 \nU.S. 444, 451]\n\u00a0\n court. \n15\n And these rural 'Court Weeks' traditionally bring grand and petit jurors, witnesses, interested per- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 444, 452]\n\u00a0\n sons and spectators from every part of the County into the County seat for court. \n16\n court terms; Idaho Code Ann. (1932) 1-706 rural Counties know each other, and information concerning witnesses and events is more widespread and more generally known than in large cities. Because this was so, petitioner's attorneys were able to make the inquiries during Court Week at the County seat, to which they testified, and that they apparently withdrew the plea of insanity after this inquiry is significant. That the examination and preparation of the case, in the time permitted by the trial judge, had been adequate for counsel to exhaust its every angle is illuminated by the absence of any indication, on the motion and hearing for new trial, that they could have done more had additional time been granted.\n See \n309 \nU.S. 694\n, 60 S.Ct. 465, 84 L.Ed. --. specific terms of district courts, and Sec. 5734-5766, fixing specific dates of county court terms; Idaho Code Ann.

In Pennsylvania, courts of quarter sessions, 'of oyer and terminer and ... jail delivery shall be holden four times, annually, in every county.' 17 Purdon's Penn.Stat.,  331, 351, 371. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 444, 453]\n\u00a0\n Under the circumstances of this case we cannot say that the trial judge, who concluded a fairly conducted trial by carefully safeguarding petitioner's rights in a clear and fair charge, deprived petitioner of his constitutional right to assistance of counsel. The Supreme Court of Alabama having found that petitioner was afforded that right, its judgment is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 237 Ala. 616, 188 So. 391. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] \n308 \nU.S. 540\n, 60 S.Ct. 119, 84 L.Ed. --. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Powell v.

While in recognition of modern social needs (see Pound, Criminal Justice in America, 1930, pp. 152, 88, 150, 163, 164, 178, 183, 189, 190) circuit courts now, by statute, entertain causes at substantially all times (Code, 1923, Sec. 6667) the holding of formal court at specific terms or sessions is emphasized in the requirement that each cause be called at least twice a year and as often as is necessary to secure prompt trials.

Buckley, Jr., of Washington, D.C., for intervenor- respondent Destileria Serralles, Inc.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents the question of the validity of legislation of Puerto Rico prohibiting the use of trade marks, brands, or trade names, on distilled spirits manufactured \n\n[311 \nU.S. 150, 152]\n\u00a0\n in Puerto Rico if the marks, brands, or names had previously been used anywhere outside Puerto Rico, unless they had been used on spirits manufactured in Puerto Rico on or before February 1, 1936, or in the case of trade marks they had been used exclusively in continental United States prior to that date.\n Petitioner, Bacardi Corporation of America, brought this suit in the District Court of the United States for Puerto Rico against the Treasurer of Puerto Rico to have this legislation declared invalid and its enforcement enjoined. The complaint charged invalidity under the Fifth Amendment and the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States, the Organic Act of Puerto Rico, 39 Stat. 151, the Federal Alcohol Administration Act, 27 U.S.C.A.  201-211, and the General Inter-American Trade-Mark Convention of 1929. The Destileria Serralles, Inc., a Puerto Rican corporation, was permitted to intervene as a defendant.\n The District Court held the legislation invalid and issued a permanent injunction. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decree and directed the dismissal of the complaint. Sancho v. Bacardi Corporation of America, 1 Cir., 109 F.2d 57. In view of the importance of the questions, we granted certiorari. \n309 \nU.S. 652\n, 60 S.Ct. 888\n\n\n The findings of the District Court, which were not disturbed by the rulings of the Circuit Court of Appeals, show the following:\n Petitioner, Bacardi Corporation of America, is a Pennsylvania corporation authorized to manufacture distilled spirits. By agreement, petitioner became entitled to manufacture and sell rum in Puerto Rico under the trade marks and labels of Compania Ron Bacardi, S.A., a Cuban corporation. For more than twenty years, save for the period during national prohibition, the Cuban corporation and its predecessors had sold rum in Puerto Rico and throughout the United States under trade marks \n\n[311 \nU.S. 150, 153]\n\u00a0\n which included the word 'Bacardi', 'Bacardi y Cia', the representation of a bat in a circular frame, and certain distinctive labels. These trade marks were duly registered in the United States Patent Office and in the Office of the Executive Secretary of Puerto Rico prior to the legislation here in question.\n Bacardi rum has always been made according to definite secret processes, has been extensively advertised and enjoys an excellent reputation. Under petitioner's agreement with the Cuban corporation, all rum designated by the described trade marks and labels was to be manufactured under the supervision of representatives of the Cuban corporation and to be the same kind and quality as the rum that the latter manufactured and sold.\n In March, 1936, petitioner arranged for the installation of a plant in Puerto Rico. Since March 31, 1936, petitioner has been duly licensed to do business in Puerto Rico under its laws relating to foreign corporations. Petitioner's basic permits from the Federal Alcohol Administration were amended so as to enable petitioner to operate in Puerto Rico and its labels were approved. Petitioner rented a building in Puerto Rico and spent large sums in installing its plant.\n On May 15, 1936, the legislature of Puerto Rico passed Act No. 115 known as the 'Alcoholic Beverage Law' which, after providing for permits, prohibited the holder of a permit from manufacturing any distilled spirits which were 'locally or nationally known under a brand, trade name or trade- mark previously used on similar products manufactured in a foreign country, or in any other place outside Puerto Rico', with a proviso excepting brands, trade names or trade-marks used on spirits 'manufactured in Puerto Rico on February 1, 1936', and also 'any new brand, trade name or trade- mark which \n\n[311 \nU.S. 150, 154]\n\u00a0\n may in the future be used in Puerto Rico'.1 This Act was declared to be of an experimental nature. It was repealed by Act No. 6 of June 30, 1936, which contained a similar provision and added a prohibition against exports in bulk. \n2\n That Act was to be in force until September 30, 1937. It was, however, converted into permanent legislation by the provisions of Act No. 149 of May 15, 1937, known as the 'Spirits and Alcoholic Beverages Act'.3\n Declaring it to be the policy of the legislature 'to protect the renascent liquor industry of Puerto Rico from all competition by foreign capital',4 and Act of 1937 provided in Sections 44 and 44(b) as follows: \n\n[311 \nU.S. 150, 155]\n\u00a0\n 'Section 44.-No holder of a permit granted in accordance with the provisions of this or of any other Act shall distill, rectify, manufacture, bottle, or can any distilled spirits, rectified spirits, or alcoholic beverages on which there appears, whether on the container, label, stopper, or elsewhere, any trade mark, brand, trade name, commercial name, corporation name or any other designation, if said trade mark, brand, trade name, commercial name, corporation name, or any other designation, design, or drawing has been used previously, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, or in any other manner, anywhere outside the Island of Puerto Rico; Provided, That this limitation shall not apply to the designations used by a distiller, rectifier, manufacturer, bottler, or canner of distilled spirits manufactured in Puerto Rico on or before February 1, 1936.'\n'Section 44(b).-Distilled spirits, with the exception of ethylic alcohol, 180 proof or more, industrial alcohol, alcohol denatured according to authorized formulas, and denatured rum for industrial purposes, may be shipped or exported from Puerto Rico to foreign countries, to the continental United States, or to any of its territories or possessions, or imported into Puerto Rico, only in containers holding not more than one gallon, and each container shall bear the corresponding label containing the information prescribed by law and by the regulations of the Treasurer; ....'5\n\n It is these sections which petitioner attacks. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 150, 156]\n\u00a0\n Section 7 of the Act of 1937 amended the proviso of Section 44 so as to make its limitation applicable, in regard to trade marks only, to such 'as shall have been used exclusively in the continental United States ... prior to February 1, 1936.6 Petitioner asserts that in the absence of this last provision, there would have been two distillers whose trade marks would be subject to the prohibition of Section 44, that is, petitioner and one other; and that Section 7 protected the other manufacturer, leaving petitioner, whose marks had been used in foreign countries and not exclusively in continental United States, the only concern affected by the prohibition. The District Court said that the Act had the appearance of being framed so as to exclude only the plaintiff and that it was difficult to conceive of 'a more glaring discrimination'. In this relation petitioner cites the critical reference in McFarland v. American Sugar Refining Company, \n241 \nU.S. 79, 86\n, 36 S.Ct. 498, 501, to a statute which 'bristles with severities that touch the plaintiff alone'. The Circuit Court of Appeals while recognizing the immediate bearing of the provision as thus challenged sustained it 'as applying to all who might later engage in the business'.\n That construction, however, does not touch the essential character of the discrimination which the statute seeks to effect in the use of trade marks. The statute does not deal with the admission of corporations, foreign to Puerto Rico, for the purpose of transacting business in the Island. Petitioner received its local license. Nor \n\n[311 \nU.S. 150, 157]\n\u00a0\n does the statute prohibit the manufacture of rum in Puerto Rico. That is allowed. Petitioner received permits from Puerto Rico for that manufacture as well as the basic permits from the Federal Alcohol Administration. The statutory restriction is not on doing business or manufacturing apart from the use of petitioner's trade marks and labels to designate its product. As to these trade marks and labels, the prohibition does not rest on lack of proper registration under the local law. Petitioner's trade marks have been duly registered in the United States and Puerto Rico. Nor does the prohibition of use proceed on the ground that the trade marks, as such, are invalid. The Cuban corporation which licensed petitioner to manufacture and sell Bacardi products and to use Bacardi trade marks had for many years sold its rum in Puerto Rico, although the rum was not manufactured there. There is no question of deception or unfair methods of competition. Petitioner is prohibited from the use of its trade marks, although valid and duly registered and although the product to which they are applied is otherwise lawfully made and the subject of lawful sale, solely because the marks had previously been used outside Puerto Rico and had not been used on spirits manufactured in Puerto Rico, or exclusively in continental United States, prior to February 1, 1936.\n The first question thus presented is whether this discriminatory enactment conflicts with the General Inter-American Convention for Trade Mark and Commercial Protection signed at Washington on February 20, 1929.7\n This treaty was the culmination of the efforts of many years to secure the cooperation of the American States in \n\n[311 \nU.S. 150, 158]\n\u00a0\n uniform trade mark protection. As previous Conventions had not proved satisfactory,8 the Sixth International Conference of American States, held at Havana in 1928, recommended to the Governing Board of the Pan American Union the calling of a special conference 'for the purpose of studying in its amplest scope the problem of the Inter-American protection of trade marks'. Delegates from the respective States were appointed accordingly and from their proceedings the Convention of 1929 resulted. There were obvious difficulties to be surmounted. These inhered in the differences between the principles of trade mark protection in the Latin American countries, where the civil law is followed, and the common law principles obtaining in the United States. The Convention states that the Contracting States were 'animated by the desire to reconcile the different juridical systems which prevail in the several American Republics' and resolved to negotiate the Convention 'for the protection of trade marks, trade names, and for the repression of unfair competition and false indications of geographical origin'.\n By Chapter I, entitled 'Equality Of Citizens And Aliens As To Trade Mark And Commercial Protection', the respective Contracting States bind themselves to grant to the nationals of the other Contracting States the same rights and remedies which their laws extend to their own nationals.\n By Chapter II, entitled 'Trade Mark Protection', provision is made for registration or deposit of trade marks in the proper offices of the Contracting States. Article 3 then specifically provides:\n'Every mark duly registered or legally protected in one of the Contracting States shall be admitted to registra- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 150, 159]\n\u00a0\n tion or deposit and legally protected in the other Contracting States, upon compliance with the formal provisions of the domestic law of such States'.\n\n The grounds upon which registration or deposit may be refused or canceled are then set forth, including those cases where the distinguishing elements of marks infringe rights already acquired by another person in the country where registration or deposit is claimed, or where they lack an appropriate distinctive character, or offend public morals, etc. (Art. 3). It is further provided that labels, industrial designs and slogans used to identify or to advertise goods shall receive the same protection accorded to trade marks in countries where they are considered as such, upon compliance with the requirements of the domestic trade mark law (Art. 5). The owner of a mark protected in one of the Contracting States is permitted to oppose registration or deposit of an interfering mark (Art. 7); and the owner of a mark refused registration because of an interfering mark has the right to apply for and obtain the cancellation of the interfering mark on meeting stated requirements. (Art. 8.)\n There is another provision that 'the use and exploitation of trade marks may be transferred separately for each country' and properly recorded. (Art. 11).\n Chapter III provides for the 'Protection Of Commercial Names', Chapter IV for the 'Repression Of Unfair Competition', and Chapter V for the 'Repression Of False Indications Of Geographical Origin Or Source'. The remaining chapters relate to remedies and contain general provisions. Among the latter is one to the effect that the provisions of the Convention 'shall have the force of law in those States in which international treaties possess that character, as soon as they are ratified by their constitutional organs'. Article 35. An accompanying Protocol establishes an Inter-American Trade Mark Bureau where marks may be registered. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 150, 160]\n\u00a0\n The text of the provisions above mentioned relating to the protection of trade marks is set forth in the margin. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n[311 \nU.S. 150, 161]\n\u00a0\n This treaty on ratification became a part of our law.

When the owner of a mark seeks the registration or deposit of the mark in a Contracting State other than that of origin of the mark and such registration or deposit is refused because of the previous registration or deposit of an interfering mark, he shall have the right to apply for and obtain the cancellation or annulment of the interfering mark upon proving, in accordance with the legal procedure of the country in which cancellation is sought, the stipulations in Paragraph ( a) and those of either Paragraph (b) or (c) below:\n\n'(a) That he enjoined legal protection for his mark in another of the Contracting States prior to the date of the application for the registration or deposit which he seeks to cancel; and\n\n'(b) that the claimant of the interfering mark, the cancellation of which is sought, had knowledge of the use, employment, registration or deposit in any of the Contracting States of the mark for the specific goods to which said interfering mark is applied, prior to adoption and use thereof or prior to the filing of the application or deposit of the mark which is sought to be cancelled; or\n\n'(c) that the owner of the mark who seeks cancellation based on a prior right to the ownership and use of such mark, has traded or trades with or in the country in which cancellation is sought, and that goods designated by his mark have circulated and circulate in said country from a date prior to the filing of the application for registration or deposit for the mark, the cancellation which is claimed, or prior to the adoption and use of the same. ...\n\n'Article 11. The transfer of the ownership of a registered or deposited mark in the country of its original registration shall be effective and shall be recognized in the other Contracting States, provided that reliable proof be furnished that such transfer has been executed and registered in accordance with the internal law of the State in which such transfer took place. Such transfer shall be recorded in accordance with the legislation of the country in which it is to be effective.\n\n'The use and exploitation of trade marks may be transferred separately for each country, and such transfer shall be recorded upon the production of reliable proof that such transfer has been \n\n[311 \nU.S. 150, 163]\n\u00a0\n Nielsen v. Johnson, \n279 \nU.S. 47, 52\n, 49 S.Ct. 223, 224; United States v. Belmont, \n301 \nU.S. 324, 331\n, 57 S.Ct. 758, 761. According to the accepted canon, we should construe the treaty liberally to give effect to the purpose which animates it. Even where a provision of a treaty fairly admits of who constructions, one restricting, the other enlarging rights which may be claimed under it, the more liberal interpretation is to be preferred. Jordan v. K. Tashiro, \n278 \nU.S. 123, 127\n, 49 S.Ct. 47, 48; Nielsen v. Johnson, supra; Factor v. Laubenheimer, \n290 \nU.S. 276, 293\n, 294 S., 54 S.Ct. 191, 195, 196.\n\n Here, the clear purpose of the treaty is to protect the foreign trade marks which fall within the treaty's purview. The basic condition of that protection, as set forth in Article 3, is that the mark shall have been 'duly registered or legally protected' in one of the Contracting States. This phrase shows the endeavor to reconcile the conflicting juridical principles of these States,-the words 'or legally protected' being added to the words 'duly registered' with the apparent intent to cover trade marks which were entitled under the common law to protection by reason of appropriation and use. \n10\n If duly registered or legally protected in one of the Contracting States, the mark is to be admitted to registration or deposit and is to be legally protected in the other Contracting States. The condition of that protection in the other States is compliance 'with the formal provisions' of the domestic law. This clearly indicates that formalities or procedural requisites are envisaged and that, when these have been met, it is the intent of the treaty to confer a substantive right to the protection of the foreign mark. The intent to give this right of protection if the mark is entitled to registration under the treaty, is shown with \n\n[311 \nU.S. 150, 164]\n\u00a0\n abundant clarity by the provisions of the same article setting forth the grounds, relating to infringement of previously acquired rights or lack of distinctive character, etc., upon which registration may be refused or canceled in the country where protection is sought. Also by the provisions as to the right of the owner of a mark protected in one of the Contracting States to oppose registration in another State of an interfering mark (Art. 7); and by the provisions as to the right of the owner of a mark, having its origin in one State and seeking registration in another, to obtain cancellation or annulment of an interfering mark which stands in the way of the registration sought, upon proving priority of right as stated. (Art. 8). Then there is the additional recognition of the right to transfer the ownership of a registered mark and also to transfer separately for each country the use and exploitation of trade marks when the transfer is executed in accordance with the law of the place where it is made and is duly recorded. It will be observed that the right of protection of the foreign marks, on compliance with the prescribed formalities, is accorded in each of the ratifying States irrespective of citizenship or domicile. \n11\n When the foreign mark is entitled by virtue of the treaty to registration in a ratifying State, and is duly registered there, the substantive right to its protection in that State attaches.\n In this view, the contention that a ratifying State, on due registration of a foreign mark in accordance with the treaty, is not bound to protect the owner in the use of that mark provided it refuses that protection to its own nationals necessarily fails. Undoubtedly the Contracting States are bound respectively to give to the nationals of the other Contracting States the same rights and remedies that are extended to their own nationals. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 150, 165]\n\u00a0\n That is provided in Article 1. But that provision does not exhaust the rights given by the treaty. These rights under Article 3 extend to the legal protection of the foreign marks when duly registered. When protection is sought for such marks a ratifying State cannot escape the obligations of the treaty and deny protection by the simple device of embracing its own nationals in that denial. That would make a mockery of the treaty. It is its plain purpose to prevent a ratifying State from denying protection to the foreign mark because of its origin or previous registration in a foreign country. It is said that the object of the treaty is to prevent piracy. That is true, but the argument does not meet the issue. Protection against piracy necessarily presupposes the right to use the marks thus protected.\n We are here concerned with the construction of the treaty only as it involves the determination of the validity of the statutory discrimination against the foreign marks which have been duly registered in the United States and Puerto Rico. The Bacardi marks are of Cuban origin. We must assume upon this record that they were duly registered and were valid in Cuba. Both the United States and Cuba have ratified the treaty. \n12\n The right of the Cuban corporation which owned the marks to make a separate transfer to petitioner of the right to use and exploit them in Puerto Rico is recognized by the treaty. Despite this, Puerto Rico has attempted to deny the right to use these marks on rum manufactured in Puerto Rico for the sole reason that the marks had been used outside Puerto Rico and had not been used on spirits made there, or exclusively in continental United States, before the given date. That is, the very fact of \n\n[311 \nU.S. 150, 166]\n\u00a0\n origin in Cuba, which makes the treaty applicable, is asserted as a ground for denying the right to use the trade marks, duly registered, on a product otherwise lawfully manufactured in Puerto Rico.\n That Puerto Rico makes its rule applicable to its own citizens who may possess such foreign marks cannot avail to purge the discrimination of its hostility to the treaty. The same reasoning, if admitted to sustain this particular discrimination, would justify as against the treaty a local statute denying the right to use in Puerto Rico any foreign trade mark in any circumstances.\n The exigencies of local trade and manufacture which prompted the enactment of the state cannot save it, as the United States in exercising its treaty making power dominates local policy.\n We are not impressed by the argument that petitioner is estopped by acts of acquiescence to challenge the validity of the Puerto Rican legislation. It is said that petitioner, having accepted the privilege to engage in the local business, is bound by the prescribed conditions. The basis of the contention fails. It does not appear that petitioner applied for a permit under the Act of 1937 which is the subject of attack. Petitioner did apply, on March 31, 1936, for a permit to engage in the business of rectifying distilled spirits. At that time the legislation of Puerto Rico did not discriminate against petitioner's trade marks, and the legislation of May 15, 1936, was of a temporary character. Apart from that, it is not the right to manufacture, aside from the use of trade marks, that is in dispute here but the right to use petitioner's trade marks upon its product. Nothing has been shown to warrant a finding of estoppel to assert the invalidity of the discrimination thus attempted in violation of the treaty. W. W. Cargill Co. v. Minnesota, \n180 \nU.S. 452, 468\n, 21 S.Ct. 423, 429; Hanover Fire Insurance Co. v. Harding, 272 U.S. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 150, 167]\n\u00a0\n 494, 507, 47 S.Ct. 179, 182, 49 A.L.R. 713; Power Manufacturing Co. v. Saunders, \n274 \nU.S. 490, 497\n, 47 S.Ct. 678, 680; Frost v. Corporation Commission, \n278 \nU.S. 515, 527\n, 528 S., 49 S.Ct. 235, 239, 240.\n We conclude that, upon this ground of repugnance to the treaty, the decree of the District Court insofar as it enjoined the enforcement of Section 44 of Act No. 6 of June 30, 1936, as amended by Act No. 149 of May 15, 1937 (including the amendment made by Section 7 of that Act), with respect to petitioner's trade marks, was right, and that the reversal in that relation by the Circuit Court of Appeals was erroneous.\n We have no occasion to consider the other grounds of objection to Section 44 which have been urged under the Constitution and laws of the United States and the Organic Act of Puerto Rico.\n A different situation is presented with respect to Section 44(b) of Act No. 149 of 1937, prohibiting bulk shipments of distilled spirits. This prohibition does not appear to offend any right conferred by the treaty and we think an adequate basis for it is found in the police power of Puerto Rico as applied to traffic in intoxicating liquors. We have recently said that 'The aim of the Foraker Act and the Organic Act was to give Puerto Rico full power of local self-determination, with an autonomy similar to that of the states and incorporated territories'. Puerto Rico v. Shell Company, \n302 \nU.S. 253, 261\n, 262 S., 58 S.Ct. 167, 171. See, also, Puerto Rico v. Rubert Hermanos, \n309 \nU.S. 543, 547\n, 60 S.Ct. 699, 701. As the grant of legislative power in respect of local matters was 'as broad and comprehensive as language could make it' (Puerto Rico v. Shell Company, supra), we think the legislature of Puerto Rico in the exercise of its police power had full authority to deal with the manufacture of, and traffic in, intoxicating liquors, so far as the Island was affected, in the absence of a treaty violation such as we have found in the prohibition of the use of \n\n[311 \nU.S. 150, 168]\n\u00a0\n valid trade marks upon liquors which were otherwise permitted to be manufactured and sold. The legislature of Puerto Rico could thus have absolutely interdicted the manufacture or sale (Mugler v. Kansas, \n123 \nU.S. 623\n, 8 S.Ct. 273), the importation into the Island (State Board of Equalization of California v. Young's Market Co., \n299 \nU.S. 59, 62\n, 57 S.Ct. 77, 78; Mahoney v. Joseph Triner Corporation, \n304 \nU.S. 401, 404\n, 58 S.Ct. 952, 953) and the exportation from the Island. Ziffrin v. Reeves, \n308 \nU.S. 132, 139\n, 60 S.Ct. 163, 167. Having this power, the legislature of Puerto Rico could adopt measures reasonably appropriate to carry out its inhibitions. That broad power necessarily embraced the limited exercise which we find in Section 44(b) with respect to shipments in bulk. Nor do we find anything in the Federal Alcohol Administration Act which militates against that provision. The Circuit Court of Appeals did not err in its decision in this respect.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals in relation to Section 44 is reversed and the decree of the District Court is modified so as to eliminate the injunction against the enforcement of Section 4013 and Section 44(b) of Act No. 149 of May 15, 1937, and as thus modified is affirmed. It is so ordered.\n Reversed in part. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] These provisions were as follows (Laws of Puerto Rico, 1936, pp. 610, 644, 646):\n'(g) No holder of a permit under this title shall manufacture, distill, rectify, of bottle, either for himself or for others, any distilled spirit locally or nationally known under a brand, trade name, or trade-mark previously used on similar products manufactured in a foreign country, or in any other place outside Puerto Rico: Provided, (1) That such limitation, aimed at protecting the industry already existing in Puerto Rico, shall not apply to any brand, trade name, or trade-mark used by a manufacturer, rectifier, distiller, or bottler of distilled spirits manufactured in Puerto Rico on February 1, 1936; and (2) such restriction shall not apply to any new brand, trade name, or trade-mark which may in the future be used in Puerto Rico.'\n\n'(h) If any kind, type, or brand of distilled spirits of a foreign origin becomes nationally or internationally known by reason of its bearing or showing as its brand, trade name, or trade-mark, the proper name of the manufacturer thereof, such name shall not, in any manner or form whatever, appear on the labels for any distilled spirit of said kind or type manufactured, distilled, rectified, or bottled in Puerto Rico'. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Laws of Puerto Rico, Third Special Session, 1936, p. 78. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Laws of Puerto Rico, 1937, p. 392. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] This declaration is as follows:\n'Section 1(b).

OF PENNSYLVANIA v. PENNSYLVANIA PUBLIC UTILITY(1940)\nNo. 252\nArgued: January 10, 1940Decided: January 29, 1940\n\n\n\n Messrs. Benjamin O. Frick, of Philadelphia, Pa., and E. Everett Mather, Jr., of Harrisburg, Pa., for appellant.\n Mr. A. Jere Creskoff, of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondent. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 30, 31]\n\u00a0\n\n PER CURIAM.\n The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, by order of March 15, 1938, required appellant, The Bell Telephone Company of Pennsylvania, to revise its intrastate toll rates for distances exceeding 36 miles so as to conform to rates charged by the American Telephone & Telegraph Company for comparable distances for interstate services. The Commission found, after full hearing, that the rates charged for long distance service in Pennsylvania were higher than the interstate rates for the same facilities for a like or greater distance, and constituted an unreasonable discrimination against intrastate patrons in violation of section 304 of the Public Utility Law of Pennsylvania of May 28, 1937, P.L. 1053, 66 P.S. Pa.  1144. On appeal, the Superior Court of Pennsylvania affirmed the order. 135 Pa.Super. 218, 5 A.2d 410. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania refused appeal. The case comes here on appeal from the judgment of the Superior Court. See Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n250 \nU.S. 566\n, 40 S.Ct. 36\n\n\n Appellant expressly disclaimed below, and also here, raising the question of confiscation. Its contentions are (1) that the Commission's order is wholly without support in the evidence and thus constitutes a denial of due process contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment, Const.U.S.C.A .; (2) that the order based on discrimination only, and prescribing rates not found to be reasonable and depriving appellant of considerable revenue, is arbitrary and hence a denial of due process; and (3) that the order is a regulation of \n\n[309 \nU.S. 30, 32]\n\u00a0\n interstate rates and imposes a direct burden upon interstate commerce.\n As to the first contention, it appears that the state court heard the appeal judicially and decided that there was evidence justifying the finding of the Commission of unreasonable discrimination in the transaction of its intrastate business. In the absence of other constitutional objections, it cannot be said that a state court denies due process when on appropriate hearing it determines that there is evidence to sustain a finding of the violation of state law with respect to the conduct of local affairs. The contention that such a decision is erroneous does not present a federal question. Arrowsmith v. Harmoning, \n118 \nU.S. 194, 196\n, 6 S.Ct. 1023, 1024; Bonner v. Gorman, \n213 \nU.S. 86, 91\n, 29 S.Ct. 483, 484; American Railway Express Co. v. Kentucky, \n273 \nU.S. 269, 273\n, 47 S.Ct. 353, 354.\n As to the second contention, where there is no claim of confiscation, the state authority is competent to establish intrastate rates and in so doing to decide what constitutes an unreasonable discrimination with respect to intrastate traffic. See Stone v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n116 \nU.S. 307, 325\n, 6 S.Ct. 334, 341, 388, 1191; Portland Railway, Light & Power Co. v. Railroad Commission, \n229 \nU.S. 397, 410\n, 33 S.Ct. 820, 826; Los Angeles Gas & Electric Corp. v. Railroad Commission, \n289 \nU.S. 287, 304\n, 305 S., 53 S.Ct. 637, 643; West Ohio Gas Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n294 \nU.S. 63, 70\n, 55 S.Ct. 316, 320.\n Finally, it appears that the Commission's order related exclusively to intrastate traffic and that there was no attempt to regulate interstate rates.\n The appeal is dismissed for want of a substantial federal question.\n Appeal dismissed. \n\n\n\n","8":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBEST & CO. v. MAXWELL(1940)\nNo. 61\nArgued: November 22, 1940Decided: December 23, 1940\n\n\n\n Mr. Lorenz Reich, Jr., of New York City, for appellant.\n Messrs. I. M. Bailey and Harry McMullan, both of Raleigh, N.C., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant, a New York retail merchandise establishment, rented a display room in a North Carolina hotel for several days during February, 1938, and took orders \n\n[311 \nU.S. 454, 455]\n\u00a0\n for goods corresponding to samples; it filled the orders by shipping direct to the customers from New York City. Before using the room appellant paid under protest the tax required by chapter 127, section 121( e), of the North Carolina Laws of 1937, which levies an annual privilege tax of $250 on every person or corporation, not a regular retail merchant in the state, who displays samples in any hotel room rented or occupied temporarily for the purpose of securing retail orders. \n1\n Appellant not being a regular retail merchant of North Carolina admittedly comes within the statute. Asserting, however, that the tax was unconstitutional, especially in view of the commerce clause, art. 1,  8, cl. 3, it brought this suit for a refund and succeeded in the trial court. The Supreme Court of North Carolina reversed and then, being evenly divided on rehearing, allowed the reversal to stand. \n2\n The prevailing opinion characterized the tax as one on the commercial use of temporary quarters, which in its operation did not discriminate against interstate commerce and therefore did not come into conflict with the commerce clause.\n The commerce clause forbids discrimination, whether forthright or ingenious. 3 In each case it is our duty to \n\n[311 \nU.S. 454, 456]\n\u00a0\n determine whether the statute under attack, whatever its name may be, will in its practical operation work discrimination against interstate commerce. This standard we think condemns the tax at bar. Nominally the statute taxes all who are not regular retail merchants in North Carolina, regardless of whether they are residents or nonresidents. We must assume, however, on this record that those North Carolina residents competing with appellant for the sale of similar merchandise will normally be regular retail merchants. The retail stores of the state are the natural outlets for merchandise, not those who sell only by sample. Some of these local shops may, like appellant, rent temporary display rooms in sections of North Carolina where they have no permanent store, but even these escape the tax at bar because the location of their central retail store somewhere within the state will qualify them as 'regular retail merchants in the State of North Carolina.' The only corresponding fixed-sum license tax to which appellant's real competitors are subject is a tax of $1 per annum for the privilege of doing business. \n4\n Nonresidents wishing to display their wares must either establish themselves as regular North Carolina retail merchants at prohibitive expense, or else pay this $250 tax that bears no relation to actual or probable sales but must be paid in advance no matter how small the sales turn out to be. Interstate commerce can hardly survive in so hostile an atmosphere. A $250 investment in advance, required of out-of-state retailers but not of \n\n[311 \nU.S. 454, 457]\n\u00a0\n their real local competitors, can operate only to discourage and hinder the appearance of interstate commerce in the North Carolina retail market. Extrastate merchants would be compelled to turn over their North Carolina trade to regular local merchants selling by sample. North Carolina regular retail merchants would benefit, but to the same extent the commerce of the Nation would suffer discrimination.\n The freedom of commerce which allows the merchants of each state a regional or national market for their goods is not to be fettered by legislation, the actual effect of which is to discriminate in favor of intrastate businesses, whatever may be the ostensible reach of the language. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] '(e) Every person, firm, or corporation, not being a regular retail merchant in the State of North Carolina, who shall display samples, goods, wares, or merchandise in any hotel room, or in any house rented or occupied temporarily, for the purpose of securing orders for the retail sale of such goods, wares, or merchandise so displayed, shall apply for in advance and procure a State license from the Commissioner of Revenue for the privilege of displaying such samples, goods, wares, or merchandise, and shall pay an annual privilege tax of two hundred fifty dollars ($250. 00), which license shall entitle such person, firm or corporation to display such samples, goods, wares, or merchandise in any county in this State.' \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 216 N.C. 114, 3 S.E.2d 292; 217 N.C. 134, 6 S.E.2d 893. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Welton v.

CALIFORNIA BANK(1940)\nNo. 752\nArgued: April 30, 1940Decided: May 20, 1940\n\n\n\n\n[310 \nU.S. 311, 312]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Lloyd S. Nix, of Los Angeles, Cal., and William Lemke, of Fargo, N.D., for petitioner.\n Mr. Thomas W. Henderson, of Los Angeles, Cal., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We granted certiorari in this case, \n309 \nU.S. 648\n, 60 S.Ct. 721, 84 L. Ed. --, for the reason that it presents important questions with respect to the procedure required by  75, sub. s, of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The precise matter in controversy is whether the bankruptcy court may permit foreclosure of mortgage liens where the procedure prescribed by  75, sub. s, has not been followed.\n The petitioners, husband and wife, are farmers. Over the period January 24, 1927 to June 19, 1933, they borrowed from the respondent, the California Bank, a total of $87,566.93, in varying amounts, executing to the bank their promissory notes for the respective loans together with deeds of trust2 on their farm real estate as security. From time to time they made payments which reduced the principal of the indebtedness to s53, 919.20. The lender, in the meantime, had made some advances towards the payment of taxes on the property. Further to secure their indebtedness they executed, on January 30, 1934, a mortgage on all the crops standing or growing, or \n\n[310 \nU.S. 311, 313]\n\u00a0\n which should thereafter be planted, grown, cultivated, cut, gathered, packed, or harvested, during the life of the mortgage on certain of their farm real estate.\n November 17, 1934, they filed their petition under  75 of the Bankruptcy Act, which was approved and referred to a Conciliation Commissioner. In January 1935 the respondent bank declared defaults, and recorded notices thereof and of its election to cause the property to be sold pursuant to the deeds of trust, and the law of California.\n March 25, 1935, the Conciliation Commissioner appointed appraisers who filed an appraisal on May 1 valuing the debtors real estate at $68,550. It is to be noted that  75 contains no provision for appraisal during the course of the conciliation proceedings covered by subsections a to r; nor do we find any rule of the District Court providing for appraisal at this stage of the cause. The transcript of record does not disclose whether this appraisal was asked by any creditor or by the debtors. So far as appears, the order for the appointment of appraisers was made by the Conciliation Commissioner of his own motion.\n The debtors were unable to obtain the requisite acceptance of creditors to the composition and extension proposal they submitted. As a consequence, they amended their petitions and prayed to be adjudicated bankrupts in accordance with the provisions of  75, sub. s. The petition was granted and an adjudication entered May 6, 1935. Apparently no further proceedings were taken until June 26, 1935, when the bankruptcy cause was dismissed on the ground that this court had held  75, sub. s, unconstitutional. \n3\n On the same day the debtors petitioned a local court for relief under a State moratorium act and obtained an order granting a moratorium, which \n\n[310 \nU.S. 311, 314]\n\u00a0\n remained in effect until September 20, 1935, when the debtors filed a petition for reinstatement of the bankruptcy cause in accordance with the amendment of  75, sub. s, adopted to meet the decision in the Radford case. \n4\n On the same date the District Court approved the petition, ordered the proceedings reinstated, and referred the case to a Conciliation Commissioner in accordance with the provisions of  75, sub. s. The court restrained the respondents from selling, or proceeding with a sale of, the real estate covered by the deeds of trust and also enjoined them from collecting from packers or processors the proceeds of crops covered by mortgage, until the further order of the court.\n October 18, 1935, the petitioner Franz J. Borchard presented his petition to the conciliation Commissioner praying that appraisers be appointed; that his exempt property be set aside to him, and that he be allowed to retain possession, under the supervision and control of the court, of all of the remainder of his property, and for such further order as might be just and proper in the premises, as authorized by  75, sub. s. Shortly thereafter the debtors filed a petition for an order on the bank to compel it to release its asserted claim to the crop of oranges grown on their property in 1935. In opposition the bank not only asserted the validity of its lien, but urged that the proceedings be dismissed because  75, sub. s, as amended, was unconstitutional. The District Judge held that the bank had a lien on the 1935 orange crop but refrained from passing upon the validity of  75, sub. s, stating that he would decide that question at a later date if the parties so desired. Apparently the parties requested a ruling, and, on May 15, 1936, the Judge overruled the contention of the bank and refused to dismiss the proceedings. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 311, 315]\n\u00a0\n Nothing having been done pursuant to the petition for appraisal and award of possession to Franz J. Borchard, the petitioners and respondents, on May 27, 1936, filed in the District Court a stipulation by the terms of which $3,900, held by third parties, being the proceeds of 1935 crops harvested from the premises, was to be paid to the bank and by it expended for the cultivation and improvement of the land. The District Court accordingly ordered the sum paid to the bank. June 10, 1937, the parties stipulated that $2,494, like proceeds of crops harvested, be paid to the bank, to be expended for the cultivation of the farm. The court so ordered. December 20, 1937, a stipulation was filed and an order made that $2,000 be paid to the bank, $1,500 to the debtors, and $946 applied to taxes. Finally, on March 7, 1938, pursuant to stipulation, $1,763 was released from the hands of third parties to be expended for the cultivation and preservation of the mortgaged real estate. The stipulation further provided that the bank should receive the monies realized from the sale of then growing crops and should apply them, so far as necessary, to maintain and protect the orange grove on the property.\n All of the stipulations reserved the rights of the parties and were to be without prejudice to such rights.\n May 24, 1938, the debtors petitioned the Conciliation Commissioner for an appraisal and the setting aside of the property to them. June 22, 1938, appraisers were appointed and they reported the value of the real estate as $87,300. It does not appear what, if any, proceedings were had before the Conciliation Commissioner upon the coming in of the appraisers' report. The petitioners assert that the Commissioner was considering the terms of an order for a stay and the conditions to be inserted in that order. On November 10, 1938, however, the bank filed its petition in the District Court for leave to sell under its trust deeds. The petition recited the facts as \n\n[310 \nU.S. 311, 316]\n\u00a0\n above outlined, stated the principal and interest due under the various notes; set forth the amount of the advances the bank had made for taxes and other accounts, and showed an existing indebtedness, secured by deeds of trust and mortgage, totaling $89,246.82. It alleged that the mortgaged premises would not bring more than $65,000; that the bank had already suffered a serious loss; and that further delay in the sale of the property would entail a greater one. The court took testimony as to value and concluded that the real estate was not worth more than $65,000. It found that, as the debtors had had several years within which to arrange an adjustment of their obligations and had been unable so to do, it was fair and equitable that the bank be allowed to proceed so as to save itself further loss. The petition was granted and the outstanding restraining order was dissolved.\n On appeal by the debtors the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decree, 5 holding that the District Court's action was justified by our decision in Wright v. Vinton Branch of Mountain Trust Bank, \n300 \nU.S. 440\n, 57 S.ct. 556, 112 A.L.R. 1455\n\n\n We are of opinion that the action of the District Court in permitting the creditor to proceed to a sale for the enforcement of its liens at this stage of the proceeding was contrary to the provisions of  75, sub. s. That this is so is made plain by our decisions in Wright v. Vinton Branch of Mountain Trust Bank, supra, and John Hancock Ins. Co. v. Bartels, \n308 \nU.S. 180\n, 60 S.Ct. 221. As was said in the latter case (308 U. S. at page 187, 60 S.Ct. at page 224): 'The scheme of the statute is designed to provide an orderly procedure so as to give whatever relief may properly be afforded to the distressed farmer-debtor, while protecting the interests of his creditors by assuring th fair application of whatever property the debtor has to \n\n[310 \nU.S. 311, 317]\n\u00a0\n the payment of their claims, the priorities and liens of secured creditors being preserved.'\n That orderly procedure includes an application by the debtor, such as was made in the present case, for an appraisal of the property, an order that the debtor remain in possession upon terms fair and equitable to him and to secured creditors, and the entry of a stay which will assure him of his possession for three years from the date of the order, upon the conditions mentioned in the Act. As a prerequisite to an intelligent determination of the terms under which the debtor is to remain in possession, the statute requires that the court and the parties shall be informed of the fair value of the property. As pointed out in the Wright case, supra, the secured creditors' rights are protected to the extent of the value of the property. The court may order rent to be paid by the debtor, may order him to make payments on account of principal, and, in its continuing control over the property, may enter any other orders for the protection of the debtor and secured creditors which the situation requires. Failure of the debtor to comply with any such orders may eventuate in a sale.\n Instead of prosecuting the cause before the Conciliation Commissioner pursuant to the debtors' petition, the bank resorted to a procedure not contemplated by the statute, evidently on the theory that it could obtain some advantage by that course. By written stipulations the bank consented to the retention of possession by the debtors and arranged that they should cooperate in the cultivation of the farm, proceeds of the crops being used for further cultivation and conservation of the real estate, for payment of taxes, and for payments to the debtors. For more than thirty-one months after the petition for appraisal was filed no action was taken. An appraisal was thereafter made. No stay order has been \n\n[310 \nU.S. 311, 318]\n\u00a0\n entered fixing terms on which the debtors are to remain in possession. The petitioners were entitled to compliance with the procedure required by the statute. The bank, at any time, could have obtained action by the Conciliation Commissioner and the court, in accordance with the statute. It cannot now maintain that the disorderly and unauthorized procedure followed by the parties is the equivalent of that prescribed by the statute and that, as the petitioners have not been able to rehabilitate themselves, it is entitled to enforce its liens.\n The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. So ordered.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of March 3, 1933, c. 204, 47 Stat. 1467; Act of June 28, 1934, c. 869, 48 Stat. 1289; Act of August 28, 1935, c. 792, 49 Stat. 942.

Luce, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n No appearance for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The sole question for decision is whether the Circuit Court of Appeals property dismissed as untimely an appeal from an order made by a District Court sitting in bankruptcy.\n The proceeding was initiated by the petitioner, hereinafter spoken of as the debtor, in the District Court, for \n\n[311 \nU.S. 262, 263]\n\u00a0\n an extension under  74 of the Bankruptcy Act as amended. \n1\n The petition, filed May 23, 1935, was referred to a referee, who denied it July 26, 1935. May 15, 1936, the court, on petition for review, re-referred the cause to a referee, who, on August 19, 1936, filed his certificate with the court in which he concluded: 'I therefore recommend that the proposal or proposals of the debtor for an extension under  74 of the Bankruptcy Act be not confirmed, and that the debtor be adjudicated a bankrupt.'\n August 21, 1936, the District Court, reciting the referee's recommendation, made an order adjudicating the debtor a bankrupt and again referring the cause to the referee for further proceedings in bankruptcy.\n August 28, 1936, the debtor prayed a review and the referee certified the matter to the court. In the petition for review both the action of the referee in reporting his recommendations instead of granting or dismissing the petition for extension, and the action of the court on the referee's report adjudicating the debtor a bankrupt, were challenged. September 10, 1936, the debtor filed a petition for rehearing of the order of adjudication, praying that it be vacated and the cause reheard. October 14, 1936, motion was filed by the debtor, after due notice to the parties in interest, praying that the order of adjudication be vacated and the proceeding dismissed without prejudice.\n October 16, 1936, a district judge heard the motion for rehearing and the motion to vacate the adjudication and entered an order that the entire matter of the debtor's petition for extension which was re-referred to the referee May 15, 1936, be again re-referred to him with direction to hear and consider the petition for extension and any supplemental petition, and to make an order or orders \n\n[311 \nU.S. 262, 264]\n\u00a0\n thereon as provided by the Act and the General Orders, and continuing: 'it is further ordered that all proceedings herein, other than those hereinabove ordered, and particularly any further proceedings under the Adjudication and Order of Reference under Section 74 entered on August 21st, 1936, be stayed until the further order of this Court made by a Judge thereof.' It will be observed that the court did not finally dispose of the petition and motion so far as they were directed to the adjudication of the debtor.\n Proceedings on a supplemental proposal of extension were had before the referee from time to time and eventuated, on June 14, 1937, in an order denying the petition for extension. The debtor presented a petition for review to the referee July 15, 1937, and thereupon the latter made and forwarded to the court his certificate reciting the proceedings and certifying the evidence. The matter came on for hearing before the District Court and, on October 25, 1937, a judge of that court confirmed the order of the referee and ordered that the stay of proceedings under the order of adjudication of August 21, 1936, should be vacated and that the referee should proceed to perform his duties under the adjudication and order of reference.\n November 15, 1937, the debtor filed a petition for rehearing in which he asked, inter alia, that the adjudication in bankruptcy be vacated and set aside. On the same day a judge of the District Court endorsed upon the petition: 'This petition having been 'seasonally presented' and 'entertained' by the above entitled court, permission to file same is hereby granted.'\n The petition for rehearing was heard by a judge of the District Court and, on February 17, 1938, he rendered his opinion and made an order thereon. In re Bowman, 24 F.Supp. 381, 382. In the opinion he said: \n\n[311 \nU.S. 262, 265]\n\u00a0\n 'This matter is before the Court (a) on a petition to review an order of this court denying review of an order to set aside adjudication; (b) on a petition to review an order of the Referee calling a meeting of creditors for electing, and electing a trustee, in the above entitled estate.'\n His order was: 'The petition for review is denied.'\n March 18, 1938, an appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals was allowed by the District Court. In his petition for appeal the debtor stated that he 'does hereby appeal ... from such order or orders, judgment or judgments, and particularly from the order of adjudication, made and entered August 21, 1936, ...'. His first assignment of error was to the order of adjudication.\n The court below dismissed the appeal2 in the view that, while it was taken within thirty days of the order denying the petition for rehearing, it came too late because the adjudication was entered August 21, 1936, and the time for appeal therefrom expired thirty days thereafter unless the running of time for taking appeal was suspended by application for rehearing. The court construed the petition for rehearing of September 10, 1936, as directed rather to the action of the referee than to the order of adjudication, but that petition, as we have seen, recited the adjudication, alleged that it was erroneous, and prayed that it be vacated. This position was reiterated in the motion of October 14, 1936, and both the petition and the motion were heard together and were the basis of the order of October 16, 1936, re-referring the case and staying the effective date of the adjudication until the further order of the court.\n As appears from the order of October 25, 1937, the District Judge understood that the question of the propriety of the adjudication was before him and dealt \n\n[311 \nU.S. 262, 266]\n\u00a0\n with it in his denial of the petition. Treating the petition of September 10, 1936, and the motion of October 14, 1936, as petitions for rehearing of the order of adjudication, and the petition of November 15, 1937, as a second petition for rehearing filed out of time, the endorsement upon the latter by a judge of the court, and the hearing held and opinion announced upon it, show that it was entertained by the court and dealt with upon its merits. Until the order of February 17, 1938, no final decision was rendered sustaining the adjudication as against the debtor's attack.\n These circumstances enlarged the time for taking appeal from the order of adjudication. The filing of an untimely petition for rehearing which is not entertained or considered on its merits, or a motion for leave to file such a petition out of time, if not acted on or if denied by the trial court, cannot operate to extend the time for appeal. \n3\n But where the court allows the filing and, after considering the merits, denies the petition, the judgment of the court as originally entered does not become final until such denial, and the time for appeal runs from the date thereof. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n We hold that the court below should have entertained the appeal.\n The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the Circuit Court of Appeals for further proceedings in conformity to this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of March 3, 1933, c. 204, Sec. 1, 47 Stat. 1467; Act of June 7, 1934, c. 424, Sec. 2, 48 Stat. 922, 923, 11 U.S.C.

FOSTER & KLEISER CO.(1940)\nNo. 41\nArgued: Decided: December 9, 1940\n\n\n\n\n[311 \nU.S. 255, 256]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. H. B. Jones and Wheeler Grey, both of Seattle, Wash., for petitioners.\n Mr. Herbert W. Clark, of San Francisco, Cal., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In this case the petitioners filed a complaint1 in the District Court for Western Washington under  7 of the \n\n[311 \nU.S. 255, 257]\n\u00a0\n Sherman Act,2 for triple damages for alleged violation by the respondents of  1 and 2 of the Act. \n3\n The respondents demurred to the amended complaint for failure to state a cause of action. The District Court treated the demurrer as a motion to dismiss and dismissed the complaint. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment. \n 4\n\u00a0\n\n The question presented is whether the complaint alleges damage to the petitioners consequent upon a conspiracy to create a monopoly in the business of bill posting in the Pacific Coast region and to accomplish that monopoly by restraining interstate commerce in the transportation of posters.\n The relevant allegations of the complaint may be summarized.\n The petitioner C. E. Stevens Company is engaged in the business of outdoor advertising, which is the business of procuring locations and erecting structures thereon for the posting of bills and the painting of signs. Its business is conducted in Washington and other states. More specifically, the petitioner's activities are the soliciting, entering into, and execution of contract for poster service for the display of posters, painted bulletins and wall displays. These contracts are secured from advertisers, their representatives, and advertising agencies located throughout the United States and constitute agreements whereby the parties are to ship posters, lithographs, designs, stencils, etc., interstate with the purpose that the posters or lithographs shall be placed upon billboards and the other material used for painting signs on locations controlled by the bill posting \n\n[311 \nU.S. 255, 258]\n\u00a0\n company. Foster & Kleiser Co., one of the respondents, is engaged in the same business in the Pacific Coast states and elsewhere. The other respondents are connected with and controlled by Foster & Kleiser Co. or its subsidiary, Restop Realty Co., the latter being in the business of owning, holding, and leasing property for outdoor advertising sites on the Pacific Coast.\n The usual routine of the business is that the advertiser, directly or through an agency, contracts with a lithographer for making posters. The advertiser, either personally or through an agency, contracts with a bill posting company in the desired locality for the placing of the posters. The advertiser then forwards the posters to the bill poster or orders the lithographer to forward them. Foster & Kleiser Co. is operating under numerous contracts thus made.\n Foster & Kleiser Co. formulated and entered into a plan, scheme, and conspiracy with others for the purpose of monopolizing all branches of the outdoor advertising business in the Pacific Coast area and preventing petitioner and other independents, so-called, from engaging in that business and securing and executing contracts therefor and from securing posters for use therein. The purpose of the conspirators was to prevent lithographers from supplying posters to independents, including petitioner, or to advertisers who were customers of petitioner and to prevent independents from securing adequate sites for the display of posters.\n The bill asserts that there is an association of paint plant5 operators and poster plant operators, known as 'Outdoor Advertising Association of America, Inc.', of which the owners of separate plants located in separate cities are members. There is one membership for each \n\n[311 \nU.S. 255, 259]\n\u00a0\n municipality. Voting rights are according to the number of separate plants owned and operated by each voting member. Foster & Kleiser Co. has some six hundred plants with concomitant voting rights. By virtue of its voice in the management of the association, and pursuant to the conspiracy, it caused the association to threaten to refuse, and to refuse, to post lithographs if the manufacturers thereof sold or furnished them for posting by independent plants or furnished samples of posters to independent plants, with the aim and effect of coercing and intimidating the lithographers so as to prevent and hamper the petitioner and other competitors of the association's plants, and of the respondents, from securing samples or lithographs. Actual obstruction and hindrance of the independents, including the petitioner, resulted. Pursuant to the conspiracy, the association and the conspirators threatened to refuse, and have refused, to post posters and lithographs for advertisers if they patronized or made contracts with independent plants. In addition, the conspirators refused to execute any portion of national contracts for outdoor advertising if any part of the work had been executed, or was to be executed, by an independent plant. The movement in interstate commerce of posters, lithographs, and designs for outdoor advertising was thus attempted to be monopolized, was monopolized, and was unreasonably restrained by the respondents.\n Other allegations are made with respect to agreements brought about by the Foster & Kleiser Co. and other bill posting concerns to exclude the petitioner and other independents from participation in the national business of advertising. It is also alleged that the respondents resorted to various other illegal and unfair acts and means in the petitioner's locality in an effort to prevent petitioner from obtaining sites for posting lithographs \n\n[311 \nU.S. 255, 260]\n\u00a0\n and displaying advertising signs, as part of the same general conspiracy and for the same ultimate purpose. We do not further set out these allegations because enough has been said to indicate the question on which the case turns.\n The respondents conceded in the court below, and here, that the complaint charges a conspiracy in restraint of interstate commerce, within the purview of the Sherman Act, in view of the decision in Ramsay Co. v. Associated Bill Posters of United States and Canada, \n260 \nU.S. 501\n, 43 S.Ct. 167.\n The court below, however, agreed with the respondents that the complaint fails to allege that the conspiracy, so far as it affected interstate commerce, was effective to injure petitioner, since there was no allegation that respondents' conduct prevented the petitioner from obtaining or receiving any posters. It thought the allegations of damage to petitioner's business were directed to the local acts of the respondents rather than to any restraint of interstate commerce in posters; and, as purely local activities were the gravamen of the complaint, no violation of the Sherman Act was sufficiently charged. This, upon the principle that local activities pursued without intent to hinder or restrain interstate commerce, although they indirectly affect it, cannot flow from or sustain a finding of conspiracy to interfere with or restrain such commerce.\n The petitioner urges that the complaint charges a general conspiracy to monopolize the bill posting business on the Pacific Coast and, as one of the means of such monopoly, to restrain interstate commerce in posters contributing to the resulting injury of the petitioner. It insists that the court below was wrong in construing the complaint as charging a monopoly of local business not intended to affect interstate commerce.\n We hold that the complaint alleges a conspiracy in violation of  1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. The object \n\n[311 \nU.S. 255, 261]\n\u00a0\n of it is to monopolize or to restrain trade in the bill posting business on the Pacific Coast, and in aid of that purpose, to restrain interstate commerce in posters; and the complaint sufficiently alleges that such monopoly and restraint inflicted damage upon the petitioner.\n As we have said, the complaint alleges that the petitioner solicits contracts for poster advertising as does the respondent, Foster & Kleiser Co. The petitioner is thus in competition with Foster & Kleiser Co. in the effort to obtain contracts which call for the interstate shipment of posters for their execution. The complaint adequately charges a conspiracy to restrain the transportation of posters in interstate commerce, in aid of the attempted monopoly. It also charges other means and acts, local in character, with the same aim. The conspiracy, with its effect on interstate commerce, is alleged to have caused the petitioner great expense and loss of profits; to have restrained and prevented petitioner from establishing a business in San Francisco, 'all to the great injury and damage of plaintiff'. The pleading further alleges that the respondents' acts were injurious to the petitioner, excluded petitioner from fair competition, and charges that because of petitioner's inability to compete with respondents, petitioner 'has been damaged in that its business was rendered unprofitable, and the profits of its said trade and commerce have diminished, and the plaintiff company has suffered loss and been damaged thereby.'\n While these allegations are general, we cannot say that they are inadequate nor are we able to agree with the court below that they are coupled with and treated solely as the consequence of local activities of the respondents.\n We think that, in order to state a cause of action, the petitioner was not bound to aver that it had been wholly unable to obtain posters. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 255, 262]\n\u00a0\n The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformity to this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The suit was brought by the C. E. Stevens Company and two subsidiaries. The complaint is in three counts, the first setting forth the claim of the parent company, and each of the others the claim of one of the subsidiaries, against the respondents. Save as to the locale of the plaintiffs' business, and the amount of damages demanded, the counts are substantially alike. We shall refer to the first count as the complaint.

STATE OF CONNECTICUT(1940)\nNo. 632\nArgued: March 29, 1940Decided: May 20, 1940\n\n\n\n\n[310 \nU.S. 296, 297]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Hayden C. Covington, of New York City, for appellants and petitioners.\n Messrs. Edwin S. Pickett, of New Haven, Conn., and Francis A. Pallotti, of Hartford, Conn, for appellee and respondent.\n\n\n\n[310 \nU.S. 296, 300]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Newton Cantwell and his two sons, Jesse and Russell, members of a group known as Jehovah's witnesses, and claiming to be ordained ministers, were arrested in New Haven, Connecticut, and each was charged by information in five counts, with statutory and common law offenses. After trial in the Court of Common Pleas of New Haven County each of them was convicted on the third count, which charged a violation of  6294 of the General Statutes of Connecticut,1 and on the fifth count, which charged commission of the common law offense of inciting a breach of the peace. On appeal to the Supreme Court the conviction of all three on the third count was affirmed. The conviction of Jesse Cantwell, on the fifth count, was also affirmed, but the conviction of Newton and Russell on that count was reversed and a new trial ordered as to them. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n By demurrers to the information, by requests for rulings of law at the trial, and by their assignments of error in the State Supreme Court, the appellants pressed the contention that the statute under which the third count was drawn was offensive to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because, on its face and as construed and applied, it denied them freedom of speech and prohibited their free exercise of religion. In like manner \n\n[310 \nU.S. 296, 301]\n\u00a0\n they made the point that they could not be found guilty on the fifth count, without violation of the Amendment.\n We have jurisdiction on appeal from the judgments on the third count, as there was drawn in question the validity of a state statute under the federal Constitution, and the decision was in favor of validity. Since the conviction on the fifth count was not based upon a statute, but presents a substantial question under the federal Constitution, we granted the writ of certiorari in respect of it.\n The facts adduced to sustain the convictions on the third count follow. On the day of their arrest the appellants were engaged in going singly from house to house on Cassius Street in New Haven. They were individually equipped with a bag containing books and pamphlets on religious subjects, a portable phonograph and a set of records, each of which, when played, introduced, and was a description of, one of the books. Each appellant asked the person who responded to his call for permission to play one of the records. If permission was granted he asked the person to buy the book described and, upon refusal, he solicited such contribution towards the publication of the pamphlets as the listener was willing to make. If a contribution was received a pamphlet was delivered upon condition that it would be read.\n Cassius Street is in a thickly populated neighborhood, where about ninety per cent of the residents are Roman Catholics. A phonograph record, describing a book entitled 'Enemies', included an attack on the Catholic religion. None of the persons interviewed were members of Jehovah's witnesses.\n The statute under which the appellants were charged provides:\n'No person shall solicit money, services, subscriptions or any valuable thing for any alleged religious, charitable \n\n[310 \nU.S. 296, 302]\n\u00a0\n or philanthropic cause, from other than a member of the organization for whose benefit such person is soliciting or within the county in which such person or organization is located unless such cause shall have been approved by the secretary of the public welfare council. Upon application of any person in behalf of such cause, the secretary shall determine whether such cause is a religious one or is a bona fide object of charity or philanthropy and conforms to reasonable standards of efficiency and integrity, and, if he shall so find, shall approve the same and issue to the authority in charge a certificate to that effect. Such certificate may be revoked at any time. Any person violating any provision of this section shall be fined not more than one hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than thirty days or both.'\n\n The appellants claimed that their activities were not within the statute but consisted only of distribution of books, pamphlets, and periodicals. The State Supreme Court construed the finding of the trial court to be that 'in addition to the sale of the books and the distribution of the pamphlets the defendants were also soliciting contributions or donations of money for an alleged religious cause, and thereby came within the purview of the statute.' (126 Conn. 1, 8 A.2d 535.) It overruled the contention that the Act, as applied to the appellants, offends the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, because it abridges or denies religious freedom and liberty of speech and press. The court stated that it was the solicitation that brought the appellants within the sweep of the Act and not their other activities in the dissemination of literature. It declared the legislation constitutional as an effort by the State to protect the public against fraud and imposition in the solicitation of funds for what purported to be religious, charitable, or philanthropic causes.\n The facts which were held to support the conviction of Jesse Cantwell on the fifth count were that he stopped \n\n[310 \nU.S. 296, 303]\n\u00a0\n two men in the street, asked, and received, permission to play a phonograph record, and played the record 'Enemies', which attacked the religion and church of the two men, who were Catholics. Both were incensed by the contents of the record and were tempted to strike Cantwell unless he went away. On being told to be on his way he left their presence. There was no evidence that he was personally offensive or entered into any argument with those he interviewed.\n The court held that the charge was not assault or breach of the peace or threats on Cantwell's part, but invoking or inciting others to breach of the peace, and that the facts supported the conviction of that offense.\n First. We hold that the statute, as construed and applied to the appellants, deprives them of their liberty without due process of law in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment. The fundamental concept of liberty embodied in that Amendment embraces the liberties guaranteed by the First Amendment. \n3\n The First Amendment declares that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. The Fourteenth Amendment has rendered the legislatures of the states as incompetent as Congress to enact such laws. The constitutional inhibition of legislation on the subject of religion has a double aspect. On the one hand, it forestalls compulsion by law of the acceptance of any creed or the practice of any form of worship. Freedom of conscience and freedom to adhere to such religious organization or form of worship as the individual may choose cannot be restricted by law. On the other hand, it safeguards the free exercise of the chosen form of religion. Thus the Amendment embraces two concepts,-freedom to believe and freedom to act. The first is absolute but, in the nature of things, the \n\n[310 \nU.S. 296, 304]\n\u00a0\n second cannot be. Conduct remains subject to regulation for the protection of society. \n4\n The freedom to act must have appropriate definition to preserve the enforcement of that protection. In every case the power to regulate must be so exercised as not, in attaining a permissible end, unduly to infringe the protected freedom. No one would contest the proposition that a state may not, be statute, wholly deny the right to preach or to disseminate religious views. Plainly such a previous and absolute restraint would violate the terms of the guarantee. \n5\n It is equally clear that a state may by general and non-discriminatory legislation regulate the times, the places, and the manner of soliciting upon its streets, and of holding meetings thereon; and may in other respects safeguard the peace, good order and comfort of the community, without unconstitutionally invading the liberties protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. The appellants are right in their insistence that the Act in question is not such a regulation. If a certificate is procured, solicitation is permitted without restraint but, in the absence of a certificate, solicitation is altogether prohibited.\n The appellants urge that to require them to obtain a certificate as a condition of soliciting support for their views amounts to a prior restraint on the exercise of their religion within the meaning of the Constitution. The State insists that the Act, as construed by the Supreme Court of Connecticut, imposes no previous restraint upon the dissemination of religious views or teaching but merely safeguards against the perpetration of frauds under the cloak of religion. Conceding that this is so, the question remains whether the method adopted by Connecticut to \n\n[310 \nU.S. 296, 305]\n\u00a0\n that end transgresses the liberty safeguarded by the Constitution.\n The general regulation, in the public interest, of solicitation, which does not involve any religious test and does not unreasonably obstruct or delay the collection of funds, is not open to any constitutional objection, even though the collection be for a religious purpose. Such regulation would not constitute a prohibited previous restraint on the free exercise of religion or interpose an inadmissible obstacle to its exercise.\n It will be noted, However, that the Act requires an application to the secretary of the public welfare council of the State; that he is empowered to determine whether the cause is a religious one, and that the issue of a certificate depends upon his affirmative action. If he finds that the cause is not that of religion, to solicit for it becomes a crime. He is not to issue a certificate as a matter of course. His decision to issue or refuse it involves appraisal of facts, the exercise of judgment, and the formation of an opinion. He is authorized to withhold his approval if he determines that the cause is not a religious one. Such a censorship of religion as the means of determining its right to survive is a denial of liberty protected by the First Amendment and included in the liberty which is within the protection of the Fourteenth.\n The State asserts that if the licensing officer acts arbitrarily, capriciously, or corruptly, his action is subject to judicial correction. Counsel refer to the rule prevailing in Connecticut that the decision of a commission or an administrative official will be reviewed upon a claim that 'it works material damage to individual or corporate rights, or invades or threatens such rights, or is so unreasonable as to justify judicial intervention, or is not consonant with justice, or that a legal duty has not \n\n[310 \nU.S. 296, 306]\n\u00a0\n been performed.' \n6\n It is suggested that the statute is to be read as requiring the officer to issue a certificate unless the cause in question is clearly not a religious one; and that if he violates his duty his action will be corrected by a court.\n To this suggestion there are several sufficient answers. The line between a discretionary and a ministerial act is not always easy to mark and the statute has not been construed by the State court to impose a mere ministerial duty on the secretary of the welfare council. Upon his decision as to the nature of the cause, the right to solicit depends. Moreover, the availability of a judicial remedy for abuses in the system of licensing still leaves that system one of previous restraint which, in the field of free speech and press, we have held inadmissible. A statute authorizing previous restraint upon the exercise of the guaranteed freedom by judicial decision after trial is as obnoxious to the Constitution as one providing for like restraint by administrative action. \n 7\n\u00a0\n\n Nothing we have said is intended even remotely to imply that, under the cloak of religion, persons may, with impunity, commit frauds upon the public. Certainly penal laws are available to punish such conduct. Even the exercise of religion may be at some slight inconvenience in order that the state may protect its citizens from injury. Without doubt a state may protect its citizens from fraudulent solicitation by requiring a stranger in the community, before permitting him publicly to solicit funds for any purpose, to establish his identity and his authority to act for the cause which he purports to represent. \n8\n The state is likewise free to regulate the time \n\n[310 \nU.S. 296, 307]\n\u00a0\n and manner of solicitation generally, in the interest of public safety, peace, comfort or convenience. But to condition the solicitation of aid for the perpetuation of religious views or systems upon a license, the grant of which rests in the exercise of a determination by state authority as to what is a religious cause, is to lay a forbidden burden upon the exercise of liberty protected by the Constitution.\n Second. We hold that, in the circumstances disclosed, the conviction of Jesse Cantwell on the fifth count must be set aside. Decision as to the lawfulness of the conviction demands the weighing of two conflicting interests. The fundamental law declares the interest of the United States that the free exercise of religion be not prohibited and that freedom to communicate information and opinion be not abridged. The state of Connecticut has an obvious interest in the preservation and protection of peace and good order within her borders. We must determine whether the alleged protection of the State's interest, means to which end would, in the absence of limitation by the federal Constitution, lie wholly within the State's discretion, has been pressed, in this instance, to a point where it has come into fatal collision with the overriding interest protected by the federal compact.\n Conviction on the fifth count was not pursuant to a statute evincing a legislative judgment that street discussion of religious affairs, because of its tendency to provoke disorder, should be regulated, or a judgment that the playing of a phonograph on the streets should in the interest of comfort or privacy be limited or prevented. Violation of an Act exhibiting such a legislative judgment and narrowly drawn to prevent the supposed evil, would pose a question differing from that we must here answer. \n9\n Such a declaration of the State's policy \n\n[310 \nU.S. 296, 308]\n\u00a0\n would weigh heavily in any challenge of the law as infringing constitutional limitations. Here, however, the judgment is based on a common law concept of the most general and undefined nature. The court below has held that the petitioner's conduct constituted the commission of an offense under the State law, and we accept its decision as binding upon us to that extent.\n The offense known as breach of the peace embraces a great variety of conduct destroying or menacing public order and tranquility. It includes not only violent acts but acts and words likely to produce violence in others. No one would have the hardihood to suggest that the principle of freedom of speech sanctions incitement to riot or that religious liberty connotes the privilege to exhort others to physical attack upon those belonging to another sect. When clear and present danger of riot, disorder, interference with traffic upon the public streets, or other immediate threat to public safety, peace, or order, appears, the power of the state to prevent or punish is obvious. Equally obvious is it that a state may not unduly suppress free communication of views, religious or other, under the guise of conserving desirable conditions. Here we have a situation analogous to a conviction under a statute sweeping in a great variety of conduct under a general and indefinite characterization, and leaving to the executive and judicial branches too wide a discretion in its application.\n Having these considerations in mind, we note that Jesse Cantwell, on April 26, 1938, was upon a public street, where he had a right to be, and where he had a right peacefully to impart his views to others. There is no showing that his deportment was noisy, truculent, overbearing or offensive. He requested of two pedestrians permission to play to them a phonograph record. The permission was granted. It is not claimed that he \n\n[310 \nU.S. 296, 309]\n\u00a0\n intended to insult or affront the hearers by playing the record. It is plain that he wished only to interest them in his propaganda. The sound of the phonograph is not shown to have disturbed residents of the street, to have drawn a crowd, or to have impeded traffic. Thus far he had invaded no right or interest of the public or of the men accosted.\n The record played by Cantwell embodies a general attack on all organized religious systems as instruments of Satan and injurious to man; it then singles out the Roman Catholic Church for strictures couched in terms which naturally would offend not only persons of that persuasion, but all others who respect the honestly held religious faith of their fellows. The hearers were in fact highly offended. One of them said he felt like hitting Cantwell and the other that he was tempted to throw Cantwell off the street. The one who testified he felt like hitting Cantwell said, in answer to the question 'Did you do anything else or have any other reaction?' 'No, sir, because he said he would take the victrola and he went.' The other witness testified that he told Cantwell he had better get off the street before something happened to him and that was the end of the matter as Cantwell picked up his books and walked up the street.\n Cantwell's conduct, in the view of the court below, considered apart from the effect of his communication upon his hearers, did not amount to a breach of the peace. One may, however, be guilty of the offense if he commit acts or make statements likely to provoke violence and disturbance of good order, even though no such eventuality be intended. Decisions to this effect are many, but examination discloses that, in practically all, the provocative language which was held to amount to a breach of the peace consisted of profane, indecent, or abusive remarks directed to the person of the hearer. Resort to epithets or \n\n[310 \nU.S. 296, 310]\n\u00a0\n personal abuse is not in any proper sense communication of information or opinion safeguarded by the Constitution, and its punishment as a criminal act would raise no question under that instrument.\n We find in the instant case no assault or threatening of bodily harm, no truculent bearing, no intentional discourtesy, no personal abuse. On the contrary, we find only an effort to persuade a willing listener to buy a book or to contribute money in the interest of what Cantwell, however misguided others may think him, conceived to be true religion.\n In the realm of religious faith, and in that of political belief, sharp differences arise. In both fields the tenets of one man may seem the rankest error to his neighbor. To persuade others to his own point of view, the pleader, as we know, at times, resorts to exaggeration, to vilification of men who have been, or are, prominent in church or state, and even to false statement. But the people of this nation have ordained in the light of history, that, in spite of the probability of excesses and abuses, these liberties are, in the long view, essential to enlightened opinion and right conduct on the part of the citizens of a democracy.\n The essential characteristic of these liberties is, that under their shield many types of life, character, opinion and belief can develop unmolested and unobstructed. Nowhere is this shield more necessary than in our own country for a people composed of many races and of many creeds. There are limits to the exercise of these liberties. The danger in these times from the coercive activities of those who in the delusion of racial or religious conceit would incite violence and breaches of the peace in order to deprive others of their equal right to the exercise of their liberties, is emphasized by events familiar to all. These and other transgressions of those limits the states appropriately may punish. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 296, 311]\n\u00a0\n Although the contents of the record not unnaturally aroused animosity, we think that, in the absence of a statute narrowly drawn to define and punish specific conduct as constituting a clear and present danger to a substantial interest of the State, the petitioner's communication, considered in the light of the constitutional guarantees, raised no such clear and present menace to public peace and order as to render him liable to conviction of the common law offense in question. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n The judgment affirming the convictions on the third and fifth counts is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. So ordered.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] General Statutes  6294 as amended by  860d of the 1937 supplement. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 126 Conn. 1, 8 A.2d 533. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Schneider v.

Carr, of Redding, Cal., for appellee, pro bac vice by special leave of Court.\n\n\n\n[310 \nU.S. 106, 109]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents the question whether regulations embodied in a municipal ordinance abridge the freedom of speech or of the press secured against state invasion by the Fourteenth Amendment. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Section 2 of an ordinance of Shasta County, California, provides: 'It shall be unlawful for any person, in or upon any public street, highway, sidewalk, alley or other public place in the County of Shasta, State of California, to loiter in front of, or in the vicinity of, or to picket in front of, or in the vicinity of, or to carry, show or display any banner, transparency, badge or sign in front of, or in the vicinity of, any works, or factory, or any place of business or employment, for the purpose of inducing or influencing, or attempting to induce or influence, any person to refrain from entering any such works, or factory, or place of business, or employment, or for the purpose of inducing or influencing, or attempting to induce or influence, any person to refrain from purchasing or using any goods, wares, merchandise, or other articles, manufactured, made or kept for sale therein, or for the purpose of inducing or influencing, or attempting to induce or influence, any person to refrain from doing or performing any service or labor in any works, factory, place of business or employment, or for the purpose of intimidating, threatening or coercing, or attempting to intimidate, threaten or coerce any person who is performing, seeking or obtaining service or labor in any such works, factory, place of business or employment.' \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[310 \nU.S. 106, 110]\n\u00a0\n Appellant was one of a group of twenty-nine men engaged in 'picketing' on U.S. Highway 99 in front of the Delta Tunnel Project in Shasta County. 'The picketing consisted of walking (on the edge of the highway nearest the project) a distance of 50 to 100 feet in a general northerly direction, then turning around and retracing steps and continuing as before ... all of the walking in connection with the picketing ... was done off the paved portion of the highway and on the gravelled portion of the right-of-way, that is, on public property.' Some of the pickets carried signs, similar to those described in the margin,3 in such a manner that workers on the project and persons going along the highway in either direction could read them. The sign carried by appellant bore the legend: 'This job is unfair to CIO.' These activities occurred between the hours of 7:30 and 9:00 a.m. During this period vehicles and persons passed freely without any molestation or interference through the picket line from the highway to the project and from the project to the highway, and the traffic of persons and automobiles along the highway was not obstructed. Appellant did not threaten or intimidate or coerce anyone, did not make any loud noises at any time, and was peaceful and orderly in his demeanor. The \n\n[310 \nU.S. 106, 111]\n\u00a0\n pickets committed no acts of violence, and there was no breach of the peace.\n The County officers arrested appellant and charged that he did 'loiter, picket, and display signs and banners in a public place and in and upon a public highway in front of, and in the vicinity of the Delta Tunnel Project ... for the purpose of inducing and influencing persons to refrain from doing and performing services and labor' at the project in violation of the ordinance. The Justice's Court of Township Number Nine found him 'guilty of violating the Shasta County Anti-Picketing Law', rendered judgment accordingly, and imposed sentence. The Superior Court of Shasta County affirmed the judgment. That court upheld the ordinance, over appellant's claim of unconstitutionality, on the authority of a prior decision. \n4\n The case comes here on appeal. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n Our decision in Thornhill v. Alabama, \n310 \nU.S. 88\n, 60 S.Ct. 736, 84 L. Ed. --, decided this day, goes far toward settling the issues presented here. Under that decision, Section 2 of the ordinance in question is to be judged upon its face. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n Section 2 on its face declares it unlawful for any person to carry or display any sign or banner or badge in the vicinity of any place of business for the purpose of inducing or attempting to induce any person to refrain from purchasing merchandise or performing services or labor. It likewise makes it unlawful for any person to loiter or \n\n[310 \nU.S. 106, 112]\n\u00a0\n picket in the vicinity of any place of business for a similar purpose. The terms 'loiter' and 'picket' are not defined either in the ordinance or in authoritative State decisions. Therefore, they must be judged as covering all the activities embraced by the prohibition against the carrying of signs in the vicinity of a labor dispute for the purpose mentioned. \n7\n The ordinance does not proscribe the carrying of signs in other places or for the purpose of inducing or attempting to induce others to adopt courses of action not related to labor disputes. It contains no exceptions with respect to the truthfulness and restraint of the information conveyed or the number of persons engaged in the activity. It is true that the ordinance requires proof of a purpose to persuade others not to buy merchandise or perform services. Such a purpose could be found in the case of nearly every person engaged in publicizing the facts of a labor dispute; every employee or member of a union who engaged in such activity in the vicinity of a place of business could be found desirous of accomplishing such objectives; disinterested persons (who might be hired to carry signs) appear to be a possible, but unlikely, exception. \n8\n In brief, the ordinance does not regulate all carrying of signs, but, on the contrary, proscribes the carrying of signs only if by persons directly interested who approach the vicinity of a labor dispute to convey information about the dispute.\n The sweeping and inexact terms of the ordinance disclose the threat to freedom of speech inherent in its existence. It cannot be thought to differ in any material respect from the statute held void in Thornhill's case. The carrying of signs and banners, no less than the raising of a flag, is a natural and appropriate means of convey- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 106, 113]\n\u00a0\n ing information on matters of public concern. Stromberg v. California, 283 U.S 359, 51 S.Ct. 532, 73 A.L.R. 1484. For the reasons set forth in our opinion in Thornhill v. Alabama, supra, publicizing the facts of a labor dispute in a peaceful way through appropriate means, whether by pamphlet, by word of mouth or by banner, must now be regarded as within that liberty of communication which is secured to every person by the Fourteenth Amendment against abridgment by a state.\n The power and duty of the State to take adequate steps to preserve the peace and protect the privacy, the lives, and the property of its residents cannot be doubted. But the ordinance in question here abridges liberty of discussion under circumstances presenting no clear and present danger of substantive evils within the allowable area of State control.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS is of opinion that the judgment below should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'It is also well settled that municipal ordinances adopted under state authority constitute state action and are within the prohibition of the amendment.'

The State did not charge that this section was violated. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Four signs were admitted in evidence as typical. They were of white card board, approximately 14 X 22 inches in size, and were tacked upon a stick some 34 inches long, 1 1\/2 inches wide and 1\/4 inch thick. Black painted letters, ranging in size from 1 1\/2 inches to 5 inches in heighth, spelled out one of the following legends on each sign: 'Don't be a scab', 'Shasta Tunnel and Construction Workers Local #260', 'CIO Picket Line', 'This job unfair to CIO'. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Appellant, prior to trial, moved to dismiss the complaint upon a number of grounds, among which was the contention that Section 2 of the ordinance violated the Fourteenth Amendment in abridging his 'freedom of speech, freedom of press, and freedom of assembly'. The same objections were raised by demurrer, by further motions to dismiss the complaint, and by motion in arrest of judgment. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] There is no further appeal allowed in the State courts. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] We do not decide whether, in view of the separability provision ( 3), the State courts might cull out from Section 2 particular clauses which, standing alone, could be sustained. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] See Thornhill v.

CO.(1940)\nNo. 230\nArgued: January 9, 1940Decided: January 29, 1940\n\n\n\n Rehearing Denied Feb. 26, 1940\n\n\n See \n309 \nU.S. 695\n, 60 S.Ct. 585, 84 L.Ed. --. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 23, 24]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Hyman G. Stein and Mark D. Eagleton, both of St. Louis, Mo., for petitioner.\n Mr. Arthur A. Gammell, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In February, 1931, petitioner recovered a judgment in the state court of Missouri for $15,000 against the Wabash Railway Company for personal injuries sustained in \n\n[309 \nU.S. 23, 25]\n\u00a0\n the course of his employment by that Company. On appeal, the judgment reduced to $10,000 was affirmed.\n In December, 1931, on a complaint in equity brought by a creditor of the Wabash Railway Company in the federal court in Missouri, setting forth its financial difficulties and that its undisputed liabilities exceeded the actual value of its assets, receivers were appointed. Suits brought by mortgage trustees were consolidated with the first suit. A special master was appointed to take proof of claims and it appears that in January, 1936, the master allowed petitioner's claim as an unsecured claim without lien or priority.\n In January, 1938, petitioner asked leave to file a petition seeking termination of the receivership on various grounds not important here. Among oher things, petitioner then alleged that the master's ruling was erroneous and that the claim was entitled to priority. In denying that petition, the District Court considered this contention and held that the 'status and classification of petitioner's claim as an unsecured claim which is not entitled to any lien or priority of payment over any other unsecured claim' had been 'correctly and finally determined in this cause' and that petitioner was 'estopped from asserting a claim for preference and priority of payment.' The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decree of the District Court and in doing so passed upon that question. The court said that no statute of Missouri and no decisions of its courts had been shown which provided or held that claims for personal injuries by employees were entitled to priority as operating expenses. Considering the contention of petitioner that the Wabash Railway Company was an Indiana corporation operating in that State and in Ohio and that the laws of those States accorded priority to his claim, the court thought that, even if so, 'that situation can have no effect upon the operation and effect of this Missouri judgment'. The court \n\n[309 \nU.S. 23, 26]\n\u00a0\n also observed that while by subsection n of Section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A.  205 sub. n, claims for personal injuries to employees of a railroad corporation are entitled to priority, that provision applied expressly to proceedings in bankruptcy and the present case at this stage is an equity receivership. And, apart from that, the court considered petitioner foreclosed from asserting such rights in this suit, approving the ruling of the District Court in that respect. 8 Cir., 103 F.2d 996, 1000.\n Petition for certiorari was filed on July 26, 1939. Subsequently, by Act of Congress approved August 11, 1939, subsection n of Section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act was amended, 11 U.S.C.A.  205, sub. n, so as to apply to equity receiverships and thus to read as follows: 'In proceedings under this section, and in equity receiverships of railroad corporations now or hereafter pending in any court of the United States, claims for personal injuries to employees of a railroad corporation, claims of personal representatives of deceased employees of a railroad corporation, arising under State or Federal laws, and claims now or hereafter payable by sureties upon supersedeas, appeal, attachment, or garnishment bonds, executed by sureties without security, for and in any action brought against such railroad corporation or trustees appointed pursuant to this section, shall be preferred and paid out of the assets of such railroad corporation as operating expenses of such railroad'.\n Petitioner then presented a supplemental brief in support of his application for certiorari, directing our attention to this statute, and in view of the importance of the question raised by the amendment, we granted certiorari, limited to the question of the right of the petitioner to intervene in order to assert priority. October 9, 1939, \n308 \nU.S. 539\n, 60 S.Ct. 102, 84 L.Ed. --.\n For the present purpose, we may assume, without deciding, that the determination of the court below was \n\n[309 \nU.S. 23, 27]\n\u00a0\n correct upon the record before it and in the light of the law as it then stood. But it is our duty to consider the amended statute and to decide the question in harmony with its provisions, if found to be applicable. The controlling rule was thus stated by Chief Justice Marshall in United States v. Schooner Peggy, 1 Cranch 103, 110: 'It is in the general true that the province of an appellate court is only to inquire whether a judgment when rendered was erroneous or not. But if, subsequent to the judgment, and before the decision of the appellate court, a law intervenes and positively changes the rule which governs, the law must be obeyed, or its obligation denied. ... In such a case the court must decide according to existing laws, and if it be necessary to set aside a judgment, rightful when rendered, but which cannot be affirmed but in violation of law, the judgment must be set aside'.\n See, also, Dinsmore v. Southern Express Co., \n183 \nU.S. 115, 120\n, 22 S. Ct. 45, 46; Crozier v. Fried, Krupp Aktiengesellschaft, \n224 \nU.S. 290, 302\n, 32 S.Ct. 488, 490; Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe R. Co. v. Dennis, \n224 \nU.S. 503, 506\n, 32 S.Ct. 542, 543; Watts, Watts & Co. v. Unione Austriaca di Navigazione, \n248 \nU.S. 9, 21\n, 39 S.Ct. 1, 2, 3 A.L.R. 323.\n We are of the opinion that the amended statute is applicable to this proceeding. The statute applies to 'equity receiverships of railroad corporations now ... pending in any court of the United States'. This is such a case. The statute applies to 'claims for personal injuries to employees of a railroad corporation'. This is such a claim. The statute says that a claim of that sort 'shall be preferred and paid out of the assets of such railroad corporation as operating expenses of such railroad'. This is a direct requirement governing the action of the court in this cause.\n We have no doubt that Congress has constitutional power to impose this requirement. We have held that earnings, while a railroad is in possession of the court and \n\n[309 \nU.S. 23, 28]\n\u00a0\n operated by its receivers, 'are not necessarily and exclusively the property of the mortgagees' but are subject to the payment of claims which have superior equities as these may be found to exist. Fosdick v. Schall, \n99 \nU.S. 235\n; Hale v. Frost, \n99 \nU.S. 389\n, 392. Claims having such equities may be accorded priority in payment although they arose prior to the receivership. Miltenberger v. Logansport, C. & S.W. Railway Co., \n106 \nU.S. 286\n, 1 S.Ct. 140; Burnham v. Bowen, \n111 \nU.S. 776\n, 4 S.Ct. 675; Union Trust Co. v. Illinois Midland R. Co., \n117 \nU.S. 434\n, 6 S.Ct. 809. It is manifest that the reasonable classification of claims as entitled to priority because of superior equities may be the subject of determination by Congress in providing for the distribution of assets in bankruptcy proceedings. See Kuehner v. Irving Trust Co., \n299 \nU.S. 445, 451\n, 452 S., 57 S. Ct. 298, 301. In this view, the provision of subsection n of Section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act, as it stood prior to the amendment of August 11, 1939, was sustained by the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit in Wise v. Chicago, R.I. & P.R. Co., 90 F.2d 312, 113 A.L. R. 487, with respect to certain unsecured surety bonds, and by the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Eighth Circuit with respect to claims for injuries to railroad employees. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co. v. Williams, 95 F. 2d 210; Thompson v. Siratt, 95 F.2d 214.\n We see no ground for a different conclusion with respect to the power of Congress to enact the amendment in relation to the distribution of assets in the case of an equity receivership. And the fact that the provision as to the latter is included in a section of the bankruptcy statute does not derogate from its controlling authority as an expression of the will of Congress. The Circuit Court of Appeals of the Eighth Circuit has recently held this provision as to equity receiverships to be applicable and valid in relation to claims for personal injuries sustained by employees of this railroad corporation. Ameri- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 23, 29]\n\u00a0\n can Surety Co. v. Wabash Railway Co., 107 F.2d 685. We think the conclusion is sound.\n It is urged in opposition to petitioner's contention that unless and until the District Court upon proper application has passed upon the question as to extending the time for filing petitioner's claim under the amended statute, the question of its priority is not properly before this Court; that petitioner has not asked the District Court to pass upon that question in the light of the amended statute. But when the Act of August 11, 1939, was passed, the case was before this Court upon petition for certiorari, which has been granted, and in order properly to dispose of the case we are bound, as already stated, to consider and apply the amended statute. Then, the argument is pressed that, at least, we should remand the case to the District Court in order that it may determine whether the claim for preference and payment under the amendment should be entertained. It is said that such applications may be considered in the light of existing circumstances, or of the stage which the proceedings have reached, as, for example, in relation to steps which may have been taken in carrying out plans for reorganization.\n We find no provision in the statute for the exercise of such a discretion by the District Court where the proceedings to which the statute refers are pending and the claims are within the statute. There is no suggestion that the present proceeding had been terminated prior to the enactment of the amendment or that it is not now pending. The statute is explicit and mandatory and the District Court has no discretion to act contrary to its terms. The statute says that the described claims 'shall be preferred and paid out of the assets of such railroad corporation as operating expenses of such railroad'. Petitioner's claim is within the class described and should be preferred and paid accordingly. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 23, 30]\n\u00a0\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is vacated and the cause is remanded to the District Court with directions to allow petitioner's claim in accordance with the statutory provision.\n It is so ordered.\n Judgment vacated. \n\n\n\n","15":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHAMBERS v. STATE OF FLORIDA(1940)\nNo. 195\nArgued: January 4, 1940Decided: February 12, 1940\n\n\n\n Messrs. Leon A. Ransom, of Washington, D.C., and S. D. McGill, of Jacksonville, Fla., for petitioners.\n Mr. Tyrus A. Norwood, of Tallahassee, Fla., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The grave question presented by the petition for certiorari, granted in forma pauperis,1 is whether proceedings in which confessions were utilized, and which culminated in sentences of death upon four young negro men in the State of Florida, failed to afford the safeguard of that due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment U.S.C.A.Const. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[309 \nU.S. 227, 228]\n\u00a0\n First. The State of Florida challenges our jurisdiction to look behind the judgments below claiming that the issues of fact upon which petitioners base their claim that due process was denied them have been finally determined because passed upon by a jury. However, use by a State of an improperly obtained confession may constitute a denial of due process of law as guaranteed in the Fourteenth Amendment. \n3\n Since petitioners have seasonably asserted the right under the Federal Constitution to have their guilt or innocence of a capital crime determined without reliance upon confessions obtained by means \n\n[309 \nU.S. 227, 229]\n\u00a0\n proscribed by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, we must determine independently whether petitioners' confessions were so obtained, by review of the facts upon which that issue necessarily turns. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n Second. The record shows-\n About nine o'clock on the night of Saturday, May 13, 1933, Robert Darcy, an elderly white man, was robbed and murdered in Pompano, Florida, a small town in Broward County about twelve miles from Fort Lauderdale, the County seat. The opinion of the Supreme Court of Florida affirming petitioners' conviction for this crime stated that 'It was one of those crimes that induced an enraged community ....'5 And, as the dissenting judge pointed out, 'The murder and robbery of the elderly Mr. Darcy ... was a most dastardly and atrocious crime. It naturally aroused great and well justified public indignation.' \n6\n\u00a0\n\n Between 9:30 and 10 o'clock after the murder, petitioner Charlie Davis was arrested, and within the next twenty-four hours from twenty-five to forty negroes living in the community, including petitioners Williamson, Chambers and Woodward, were arrested without warrants and confined in the Broward County jail, at Fort Lauderdale. On the night of the crime, attempts to trail the murderers by bloodhounds brought J. T. Williams, a convict guard, into the proceedings. From then until confessions were obtained and petitioners were sentenced, he took a prominent part. About 11 P.M. on the following Monday, May 15, the sheriff and Williams took several of the imprisoned negroes, including Williamson and Chambers, to the Dade County jail at Miami. The \n\n[309 \nU.S. 227, 230]\n\u00a0\n sheriff testified that they were taken there because he felt a possibility of mob violence and 'wanted to give protection to every prisoner ... in jail.' Evidence of petitioners was that on the way to Miami a motorcycle patrolman drew up to the car in which the men were riding and the sheriff 'told the cop that he had some negroes that he ... taking down to Miami to escape a mob.' This statement was not denied by the sheriff in his testimony and Williams did not testify at all; Williams apparently has now disappeared. Upon order of Williams, petitioner Williamson was kept in the death cell of the Dade County jail. The prisoners thus spirited to Miami were returned to the Fort Lauderdale jail the next day, Tuesday.\n It is clear from the evidence of both the State and petitioners that from Sunday, May 14, to Saturday, May 20, the thirty to forty negro suspects were subjected to questioning and cross questioning (with the exception that several of the suspects were in Dade County jail over one night). From the afternoon of Saturday, May 20, until sunrise of the 21st, petitioners and possibly one or two others underwent persistent and repeated questioning. The Supreme Court of Florida said the questioning 'was in progress several days and all night before the confessions were secured' and referred to the last night as an 'all night vigil.' The sheriff who supervised the procedure of continued interrogation testified that he questioned the prisoners 'in the day time all the week,' but did not question them during any night before the all night vigil of Saturday, May 20, because after having 'questioned them all day ... (he) was tired.' Other evidence of the State was 'that the officers of Broward County were in that jail almost continually during the whole week questioning these boys, and other boys, in connection with this' case. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 227, 231]\n\u00a0\n The process of repeated questioning took place in the jailer's quarters on the fourth floor of the jail. During the week following their arrests and until their confessions were finally acceptable to the State's attorney in the early dawn of Sunday, May 21st, petitioners and their fellow prisoners were led one at a time from their cells to the questioning room, quizzed, and returned to their cells to await another turn. So far as appears, the prisoners at no time during the week were permitted to see or confer with counsel or a single friend or relative. When carried singly from his cell and subjected to questioning, each found himself, a single prisoner, surrounded in a fourth floor jail room by four to ten men, the county sheriff, his deputies, a convict guard, and other white officers and citizens of the community.\n The testimony is in conflict as to whether all four petitioners were continually threatened and physically mistreated until they finally, in hopeless desperation and fear of their lives, agreed to confess on Sunday morning just after daylight. Be that as it may, it is certain that by Saturday, May 20th, five days of continued questioning had elicited no confession. Admittedly, a concentration of effort-directed against a small number of prisoners including petitioners-on the part of the questioners, principally the sheriff and Williams, the convict guard, began about 3:30 that Saturday afternoon. From that hour on, with only short intervals for food and rest for the questioners-'They all stayed up all night.' 'They bring one of them at a time backwards and forwards ... until they confessed.' And Williams was present and participating that night, during the whole of which the jail cook served coffee and sandwiches to the men who 'grilled' the prisoners.\n Sometime in the early hours of Sunday, the 21st, probably about 2:30 A.M., Woodward apparently 'broke'- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 227, 232]\n\u00a0\n as one of the State's witnesses put it-after a fifteen or twenty minute period of questioning by Williams, the sheriff and the constable 'one right after the other.' The State's attorney was awakened at his home, and called to the jail. He came, but was dissatisfied with the confession of Woodward which he took down in writing at that time, and said something like 'tear this paper up, that isn't what I want, when you get something worth while call me.' \n7\n This same State's attorney conducted the State's case in the circuit court below and also made himself a witness, but did not testify as to why Woodward's \n\n[309 \nU.S. 227, 233]\n\u00a0\n first alleged confession was unsatisfactory to him. The sheriff did, however:\n'A. No, it wasn't false, part of it was true and part of it wasn't; Mr. Maire (the State's attorney) said there wasn't enough. It wasn't clear enough.\n\n'. . . \n\n'Q. ... Was that voluntarily made at that time? A. Yes, sir.\n\n'Q. It was voluntarily made that time. A. Yes, sir.\n\n__________ when you get something worth while call me,' or words to that effect? \n A. Something similar to that.\n'Q. That did happen that night? A. Yes, sir.\n\n'Q. That was in the presence of Walter Woodward? A. Yes, sir.'\n\n And petitioner Woodward testified on this subject as follows:\n'A. ... I was taken out several times on the night of the 20th ... So I still denied it. ...\n\n'... * *\n\n'A. He said I had told lies and kept him sitting up all the week and he was tired and if I didn't come across I would never see the sun rise.\n\n'... \n\n'A. ... then I was taken back to the private cell. ... and shortly after that they come back, shortly after that, twenty or twenty- five minutes, and bring me out. ... I (told Williams) if he would send for the State attorney he could take down what I said, I said send for him and I will tell him what I know. So he sent for Mr. Maire some time during Saturday night, must have been around one or two o'clock in the night, it was after midnight, and so he sent for Mr. Maire, I didn't know Mr. Maire then, but I know him now by his face.\n\n'... \n\n'A. Well he come in and said 'this boy got something to tell me' and Captain Williams says 'yes, he is ready to tell you.' ...\n\n'... \n\n'... Mr. Maire had a pen and a book to take down what I told him, which he said had to be on the typewriter, but I didn't see any typewriter, I saw him with a pen and book, so whether it was short- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 227, 234]\n\u00a0\n 'Q. You didn't consider it sufficient? A. Mr. Maire.\n\n'Q. Mr. Maire told you that it wasn't sufficient, so you kept on questioning him until the time you got him to make a free and voluntary confession of other matters that he hadn't included in the first? A. No, sir, we questioned him there and we caught him in lies.\n\n'Q. Caught all of them telling lies? A. Caught every one of them lying to us that night, yes, sir.\n\n'Q. Did you tell them they were lying? A. Yes, sir.\n\n'Q. Just how would you tell them that? A. Just like I am talking to you.\n\n__________ hand or regular writing I don't know, but he took it down with pen. After I told him my story he said it was no good, and he tore it up. ...\n'... \n\n'Q. What was it Mr. Maire said? A. He told them it wasn't no good, when they got something out of me he would be back. It was late he had to go back and go to bed.\n\n'... \n\n'A. ... I wasn't in the cell long before they come back. ...\n\n'... *\n\n'Q. How long was that from the time you was brought into that room until Mr. Maire left there? A. Something like two or three hours, I guess, because it was around sunrise when I went into the room.\n\n'Q. Had you slept any that night, Walter? A. No, sir. I was walked all night, not continually, but I didn't have no time to sleep except in short spaces of the night.\n\n'... \n\n'Q. When Mr. Maire got there it was after daylight? A. Yes, sir.\n\n'... \n\n'Q. Why did you say to them that morning anything after you were brought into the room? A. Because I was scared, ....' \n\n[309 \nU.S. 227, 235]\n\u00a0\n 'Q. You said 'Jack, you told me a lie'? A. Yes, sir.'\n\n After one week's constant denial of all guilt, petitioners 'broke.'\n Just before sunrise, the State officials got something 'worthwhile' from petitioners which the State's attorney would 'want'; again he was called; he came; in the presence of those who had carried on and witnessed the all night questioning, he caused his questions and petitioners' answers to be stenographically reported. These are the confessions utilized by the State to obtain the judgments upon which petitioners were sentenced to death. No formal charges had been brought before the confessions. Two days thereafter, petitioners were indicted, were arraigned and Williamson and Woodward pleaded guilty; Chambers and Davis pleaded not guilty. Later the sheriff, accompanied by Williams, informed an attorney who presumably had been appointed to defend Davis that Davis wanted his plea of not guilty withdrawn. This was done, and Davis then pleaded guilty. When Chambers was tried, his conviction rested upon his confession and testimony of the other three confessors. The convict guard and the sheriff 'were in the Court room sitting down in a seat.' And from arrest until sentenced to death, petitioners were never-either in jail or in court-wholly removed from the constant observation, influence, custody and control of those whose persistent pressure brought about the sunrise confessions.\n Third. The scope and operation of the Fourteenth Amendment have been fruitful sources of controversy in our constitutional history. \n8\n However, in view of its his- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 227, 236]\n\u00a0\n torical setting and the wrongs which called it into being, the due process provision of the Fourteenth Amendment-just as that in the Fifth-has led few to doubt that it was intended to guarantee procedural standards adequate and appropriate, then and thereafter,9 to protect, at all times, people charged with or suspected of crime by those holding positions of power and authority. Tyrannical governments had immemorially utilized dictatorial criminal procedure and punishment to make scape goats of the weak, or of helpless political, religious, or racial minorities and those who differed, who would not conform and who resisted tyranny. The instruments of such governments were in the main, two. Conduct, innocent when engaged in, was subsequently made by fiat criminally punishable without legislation. And a liberty loving people won the principle that criminal punishments could not be inflicted save for that which proper legislative action had already by 'the law of the land' forbidden when done. But even more was needed. From the popular hatred and abhorrence of illegal confinement, torture and extortion of confessions of violations of the 'law of the land' evolved the fundamental idea that no man's life, liberty or property be forfeited as criminal punishment for violation of that law until there had been a charge fairly made and fairly tried in a pub- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 227, 237]\n\u00a0\n lic tribunal free of prejudice, passion, excitement and tyrannical power. Thus, as assurance against ancient evils, our country, in order to preserve 'the blessings of liberty', wrote into its basic law the requirement, among others, that the forfeiture of the lives, liberties or property of people accused of crime can only follow if procedural safeguards of due process have been obeyed. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n The determination to preserve an accused's right to procedural due process sprang in large part from knowledge of the historical truth that the rights and liberties of people accused of crime could not be safely entrusted to secret inquisitorial processes. The testimony of centuries, in governments of varying kinds over populations of different races and beliefs, stood as proof that physical and mental torture and coercion had brought about the tragically unjust sacrifices of some who were the noblest and most useful of their generations. The rack, the thumbscrew, the wheel, solitary confinement, protracted questioning and cross questioning, and other ingenious forms of entrapment of the helpless or unpopular had left their wake of mutilated bodies and shattered minds along the way to the cross, the guillotine, the stake and \n\n[309 \nU.S. 227, 238]\n\u00a0\n the hangman's noose. And they who have suffered most from secret and dictatorial proceedings have almost always been the poor, the ignorant, the numerically weak, the friendless, and the powerless. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n This requirement-of conforming to fundamental standards of procedure in criminal trials-was made operative against the States by the Fourteenth Amendment. Where one of several accused had limped into the trial court as a result of admitted physical mistreatment inflicted to obtain confessions upon which a jury had returned a verdict of guilty of murder, this Court recently declared, Brown v. State of Mississippi, that 'It would be difficult to conceive of methods more revolting to the sense of justice than those taken to procure the confessions of these petitioners, and the use of the confessions thus obtained as the basis for conviction and sentence was a clear denial of due process. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n Here, the record develops a sharp conflict upon the issue of physical violence and mistreatment, but shows, without conflict, the drag net methods of arrest on suspicion without warrant, and the protracted questioning and cross questioning of these ignorant young colored tenant farmers by State officers and other white citizens, in a fourth floor jail room, where as prisoners they were without friends, advisers or counselors, and under circumstances calculated to break the strongest nerves and \n\n[309 \nU.S. 227, 239]\n\u00a0\n the stoutest resistance. Just as our decision in Brown v. State of Mississippi was based upon the fact that the confessions were the result of compulsion, so in the present case, the admitted practices were such as to justify the statement that 'The undisputed facts showed that compulsion was applied.' \n13\n\u00a0\n\n For five days petitioners were subjected to interrogations culminating in Saturday's (May 20th) all night examination. Over a period of five days they steadily refused to confess and disclaimed any guilt. The very circumstances surrounding their confinement and their questioning without any formal charges having been brought, were such as to fill petitioners with terror and frightful misgivings. \n14\n Some were practical strangers in \n\n[309 \nU.S. 227, 240]\n\u00a0\n the community; three were arrested in a one-room farm tenant house which was their home; the haunting fear of mob violence was around them in an atmosphere charged with excitement and public indignation. From virtually the moment of their arrest until their eventual confessions, they never knew just when any one would be called back to the fourth floor room, and there, surrounded by his accusers and others, interrogated by men who held their very lives-so far as these ignorant petitioners could know-in the balance. The rejection of petitioner Woodward's first 'confession', given in the early hours of Sunday morning, because it was found wanting, demonstrates the relentless tenacity which 'broke' petitioners' will and rendered them helpless to resist their accusers further. To permit human lives to be forfeited upon confessions thus obtained would make of the constitutional requirement of due process of law a meaningless symbol.\n We are not impressed by the argument that law enforcement methods such as those under review are necessary to uphold our laws. \n15\n The Constitution proscribes \n\n[309 \nU.S. 227, 241]\n\u00a0\n such lawless means irrespective of the end. And this argument flouts the basic principle that all people must stand on an equality before the bar of justice in every American court. Today, as in ages past, we are not without tragic proof that the exalted power of some governments to punish manufactured crime dictatorially is the handmaid of tyranny. Under our constitutional system, courts stand against any winds that blow as havens of refuge for those who might otherwise suffer because they are helpless, weak, outnumbered, or because they are non-conforming victims of prejudice and public excitement. Due process of law, preserved for all by our Constitution, commands that no such practice as that disclosed by this record shall send any accused to his death. No higher duty, no more solemn responsibility, rests upon this Court, than that of translating into living law and maintaining this constitutional shield deliberately planned and inscribed for the benefit of every human being subject to our Constitution-of whatever race, creed or persuasion. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 227, 242]\n\u00a0\n The Supreme Court of Florida was in error and its judgment is\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice MURPHY took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \n308 \nU.S. 541\n, 60 S.Ct. 127, 84 L.Ed. --. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Petitioners Williamson, Woodward and Davis pleaded guilty of murder and petitioner Chambers was found guilty by a jury; all were sentenced to death, and the Supreme Court of Florida affirmed. 111 Fla. 707, 151 So. 499, 152 So. 437. Upon the allegation that, unknown to the trial judge, the confessions on which the judgments and sentences of death were based were not voluntary and had been obtained by coercion and duress, the State Supreme Court granted leave to present a petition for writ of error coram nobis to the Broward County Circuit Court, 111 Fla. 707, 152 So. 437. The Circuit Court denied the petition without trial of the issues raised by it and the State Supreme Court reversed and ordered the issues submitted to a jury. 117 Fla. 642, 158 So. 153. Upon a verdict adverse to petitioners, the Circuit Court re-affirmed the original judgments and sentences. \n Again, the State Supreme Court reversed, holding that the issue of force, fear of personal violence and duress had been properly submitted to the jury, but the issue raised by the assignment of error alleging that the confessions and pleas 'were not in fact freely and voluntarily made' had not been clearly submitted to the jury. 123 Fla. 734, 737, 167 So. 697, 700. A change of venue, to Palm Beach County, was granted, a jury again found against petitioners and the Broward Circuit Court once more re- affirmed the judgments and sentences of death. The Supreme Court of Florida, one judge dissenting, affirmed, 136 Fla. 568, 187 So. 156. While the petition thus seeks review of the judgments and sentences of death rendered in the Broward Circuit Court and reaffirmed in the Palm Beach Circuit Court, the evidence before us consists solely of the transcript of proceedings (on writ of error coram nobis) in Palm Beach County Court wherein the circumstances surrounding the obtaining of petitioners' alleged confessions were passed on by a jury. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Brown v.

T. Williams, a convict guard, at frequent intervals while they were in jail, over a period of about a week, and culminating in an all night questioning of the petitioners separately in succession, throughout practically all of Saturday night, until confessions had been obtained from all of them, when they were all brought into a room in the jailer's quarters at 6:30 on Sunday morning and made their confessions before the state attorney, the officers, said J.

It has even been suggested that the use of the 'third degree' has lowered the esteem in which administration of justice is held by the public and has engendered an attitude of hostility to and unwillingness to cooperate with the police on the part of many people. See, IV National Commission, etc., supra, p. 190.

The decree provided for the application of the amount paid into court to the remaining old obligations of petitioner, that such obligations might be presented within one year, and that unless so presented they should be forever barred from participating in the plan of readjustment or in the fund paid into court. Except for the provision for such presentation, the decree canceled the old bonds and the holders were enjoined from thereafter asserting any claim thereon.\n Petitioner pleaded this decree, which was entered in March, 1936, as res judicata. Respondents demurred to the answer. Thereupon the parties stipulated for trial without a jury.\n The evidence showed respondents' ownership of the bonds in suit and that respondents had notice of the proceeding for debt readjustment. The record of that proceeding, including the final decree, was introduced. The District Court ruled in favor of respondents and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 8 Cir., 103 F.2d 847. The decision was placed upon the ground that the decree was void because, subsequent to its entry, this Court in a \n\n[308 \nU.S. 371, 374]\n\u00a0\n proceeding relating to a municipal district in Texas had declared the statute under which the District Court had acted to be unconstitutional. Ashton v. Cameron County District, \n298 \nU.S. 513\n, 56 S.Ct. 892. In view of the importance of the question we granted certiorari. October 9, 1939. \n308 \nU.S. 532\n, 60 S.Ct. 84, 84 L.Ed. --.\n The courts below have proceeded on the theory that the Act of Congress, having been found to be unconstitutional, was not a law; that it was inoperative, conferring no rights and imposing no duties, and hence affording no basis for the challenged decree. Norton v. Shelby County, \n118 \nU.S. 425, 442\n, 6 S.Ct. 1121, 1125; Chicago, Indianapolis & Louisville Rwy. Co. v. Hackett, \n228 \nU.S. 559, 566\n, 33 S.Ct. 581, 584. It is quite clear, however, that such broad statements as to the effect of a determination of unconstitutionality must be taken with qualifications. The actual existence of a statute, prior to such a determination, is an operative fact and may have consequences which cannot justly be ignored. The past cannot always be erased by a new judicial declaration. The effect of the subsequent ruling as to invalidity may have to be considered in various aspects,-with respect to particular relations, individual and corporate, and particular conduct, private and official. Questions of rights claimed to have become vested, of status, of prior determinations deemed to have finality and acted upon accordingly, of public policy in the light of the nature both of the statute and of its previous application, demand examination. These questions are among the most difficult of those which have engaged the attention of courts, state and federal, and it is manifest from numerous decisions that an all- inclusive statement of a principle of absolute retroactive invalidity cannot be justified. \n3\n Without attempting \n\n[308 \nU.S. 371, 375]\n\u00a0\n to review the different classes of cases in which the consequences of a ruling against validity have been determined in relation to the particular circumstances of past transactions, we appropriately confine our consideration to the question of res judicata as it now comes before us.\n First. Apart from the contention as to the effect of the later decision as to constitutionality, all the elements necessary to constitute the defense of res judicata are present. It appears that the proceedings in the District Court to bring about a plan of readjustment were conducted in complete conformity to the statute. The Circuit Court of Appeals observed that no question had been raised as to the regularity of the court's action. The answer in the present suit alleged that the plaintiffs ( respondents here) had notice of the proceeding and were parties, and the evidence was to the same effect, showing compliance with the statute in that respect. As parties, these bondholders had full opportunity to present any objections to the proceeding, not only as to its regularity, or the fairness of the proposed plan of readjustment, or the propriety of the terms of the decree, but also as to the validity of the statute under which the proceeding was brought and the plan put into effect. Apparently no question of validity was raised and the cause proceeded to decree on the assumption by all parties and the court itself that the statute was valid. There was no attempt to review the decree. If the general principles governing the defense of res judicata are applicable, these bondholders, having the opportunity to raise the question of invalidity, were not the less bound by the decree because they failed to raise it. Cromwell v. County of Sac, \n94 \nU.S. 351\n, 352; Case v. Beauregard, \n101 \nU.S. 688\n, 692; Baltimore Steamship Co. v. Phillips, \n274 \nU.S. 316, 319\n, 325 S., 47 S.Ct. 600, 601, 604; Grubb v. Public Utilities Commission, \n281 \nU.S. 470, 479\n, 50 S.Ct. 374, 378. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 371, 376]\n\u00a0\n Second. The argument is pressed that the District Court was sitting as a court of bankruptcy, with the limited jurisdiction conferred by statute, and that, as the statute was later declared to be invalid, the District Court was without jurisdiction to entertain the proceeding and hence its decree is open to collateral attack. We think the argument untenable. The lower federal courts are all courts of limited jurisdiction, that is, with only the jurisdiction which Congress has prescribed. But none the less they are courts with authority, when parties are brought before them in accordance with the requirements of due process, to determine whether or not they have jurisdiction to entertain the cause and for this purpose to construe and apply the statute under which they are asked to act. Their determinations of such questions, while open to direct review, may not be assailed collaterally.\n In the early case of McCormick v. Sullivant, 10 Wheat. 192, where it was contended that the decree of the federal district court did not show that the parties to the proceedings were citizens of different States and hence that the suit was coram non judice and the decree void, this Court said: 'But this reason proceeds upon an incorrect view of the character and jurisdiction of the inferior courts of the United States. They are all of limited jurisdiction; but they are not, on that account, inferior courts, in the technical sense of those words, whose judgments, taken alone, are to be disregarded. If the jurisdiction be not alleged in the proceedings, their judgments and decrees are erroneous, and may, upon a writ of error or appeal, be reversed for that cause. But they are not absolute nullities'. Id., 10 Wheat. page 199. See, also, Skillern's Executors v. May's Executors, 6 Cranch 267; Des Moines Navigation Co. v. Iowa Homestead Co., \n123 \nU.S. 552, 557\n, 559 S., 8 S.Ct. 217, 219, 220; Dowell v. Applegate, \n152 \nU.S. 327, 340\n, 14 S.Ct. 611, 616; Evers v. Watson, \n156 \nU.S. 527, 533\n, 15 S.Ct. 430, 432; Cutler v. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 371, 377]\n\u00a0\n Huston, \n158 \nU.S. 423, 430\n, 431 S., 15 S.Ct. 868, 870, 871. This rule applies equally to the decrees of the District Court sitting in bankruptcy, that is, purporting to act under a statute of Congress passed in the exercise of the bankruptcy power. The court has the authority to pass upon its own jurisdiction and its decree sustaining jurisdiction against attack, while open to direct review, is res judicata in a collateral action. Stoll v. Gottlieb, \n305 \nU.S. 165, 171\n, 172 S., 59 S.Ct. 134, 137.\n Whatever the contention as to jurisdiction may be, whether it is that the boundaries of a valid statute have been transgressed, or that the statute itself is invalid, the question of jurisdiction is still one for judicial determination. If the contention is one as to validity, the question is to be considered in the light of the standing of the party who seeks to raise the question and of its particular application. In the present instance it is suggested that the situation of petitioner, Chicot County Drainage District, is different from that of the municipal district before the court in the Ashton case. Petitioner contends that it is not a political subdivision of the State of Arkansas but an agent of the property owners within the District. See Drainage District No. 7 of Poinsett County v. Hutchins, 184 Ark. 521, 42 S.W.2d 996.4 We do not refer to that phase of the case as now determinative but merely as illustrating the sort of question which the District Court might have been called upon to resolve had the validity of the Act of Congress in the present application been raised. As the question of validity was one which had to be determined by a judicial decision, if determined at all, no reason appears why it should not be regarded as determinable by the District Court like any other question affecting its jurisdiction. There can be no doubt that if the question of the constitutionality of the statute had actually been raised and decided by the District Court in the proceed- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 371, 378]\n\u00a0\n ing to effect a plan of debt readjustment in accordance with the statute, that determination would have been final save as it was open to direct review upon appeal. Stoll v. Gottlieb, supra. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n The remaining question is simply whether respondents having failed to raise the question in the proceeding to which they were parties and in which they could have raised it and had it finally determined, were privileged to remain quiet and raise it in a subsequent suit. Such a view is contrary to the well-settled principle that res judicata may be pleaded as a bar, not only as respects matters actually presented to sustain or defeat the right asserted in the earlier proceeding, 'but also as respects any other available matter which might have been presented to that end'. Grubb v. Public Utilities Commission, supra (\n281 \nU.S. 470\n, 50 S.Ct. 378); Cromwell v. County of Sac, supra.\n The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the District Court with direction to dismiss the complaint.\n It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act No. 405, Extra.Sess., p. 3742, General Assembly of Arkansas, approved February 25, 1920, as amended by Act No. 432 of Sp.Acts 1921, p. 896, and General Drainage Law of Arkansas, Gen.Acts 1909, p. 829, approved May 27, 1909. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 48 Stat. 798, 11 U.S.C.A.  301-303.

McAneny, of Yonkers, N.Y., and E. J. Dimock, of New York City, for petitioners.\n\n\n[309 \nU.S. 590, 592]\n\u00a0\n Mr. George P. Barse, of Washington, D.C., for respondent. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 590, 593]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By these companion suits, begun during 1936, the Receiver of The First National Bank and Trust Company of Yonkers ('The Bank'), seeks to recover fifty per centum of deposits withdrawn by petitioners from the association while insolvent. Thus, it is said, they obtained unlawful preferences within the meaning of the National Banking Act. \n1\n From corporate assets, general creditors have been paid dividends amounting to fifty per centum of their claims-forty, December, 1933; ten, November, 1937. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 590, 594]\n\u00a0\n The Bank was located in New York. In each cause the points of law and fact are substantially alike. It will suffice to consider them as presented by the Record in No. 542.\n Petitioner's deposits with The Bank, March 4, 1933, amounted to $277, 000. To secure this and other smaller public ones, bonds of the association totalling $535,000 were in pledge.\n The Governor of New York proclaimed Saturday, March 4th and Monday, March 6th, 1933, bank holidays. Later the President and the Governor extended such holidays through March 9th. The Bank was not opened for unrestricted business after March 3rd. A Conservator, appointed March 20th, remained in control until January 23, 1934, when a Receiver took charge.\n Between March 9th and 20th, 1933, petitioner withdrew deposits amounting to $89,000; between March 20th and 28th, $67,000. On the latter day, under direction of the Conservator, petitioner's remaining deposits were paid and The Bank retook the pledged bonds.\n A jury having been waived the cause was tried to the court upon pleadings and evidence. Among other things it found-\n'The pledge of assets by The Bank to secure the deposits was ultra vires and unlawful.\n\n'The Bank was insolvent March 6th, 1933, and as of that day the rights of creditors became fixed.\n\n'The payments of deposits to petitioner were not allowed by any Presidential Proclamation or Executive Order. They were made voluntarily under mistake of law by an officer of the United States and are recoverable. Also they were made with intent to give petitioner preference over other creditors.\n\n'No statute of New York confers upon state banks general power to pledge assets to secure deposits. They have no such power under the common law of New York.' \n\n[309 \nU.S. 590, 595]\n\u00a0\n Judgment went for the Receiver for fifty per centum of the amounts withdrawn by the petitioner after March 9, 1933, with interest, etc.\n\n The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this action, 2 Cir., 106 F.2d 69. It held all withdrawals after March 9th occurred when the facts indicated The Bank would be unable to pay depositors in due course and that adequate evidence supported the trial court's finding of an intent to prefer. We find no reason to disregard these findings by two courts and accept them as correct.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals further held national banks have no implied power to pledge assets to secure deposits; that here The Bank was not empowered so to do by the Act June 25, 19302; that the pledge might \n\n[309 \nU.S. 590, 596]\n\u00a0\n be rescinded without return by the Receiver of the sums withdrawn. With these conclusions we agree.\n Unless empowered by the Act June 25, 1930 or concerning federal funds ( not here claimed) as in Inland Waterways Corp. v. Frederick J. Young, Receiver, \n309 \nU.S. 517\n, 60 S.Ct. 646, 84 L.Ed. --, March 25, 1940, national banks may not secure deposits by pledge of assets.\n Texas & Pacific Ry. v. Pottorff, \n291 \nU.S. 245\n, 253-255, 54 S.Ct. 416, 417, 418, and Marion v. Sneeden, \n291 \nU.S. 262\n, 54 S.Ct. 421, authoritatively interpreted the National Banking Act and approved the view that under this, a national bank possesses no inherent power to secure deposits, public or private, by pledging assets, and that such a pledge is both ultra vires and contrary to public policy. 'The measure of their powers is the statutory grant; and powers not conferred by Congress are denied.' Also, that in case of insolvency, assets so pledged, may be reclaimed without payment of the deposits. 'To permit the pledge would be inconsistent with many provisions of the National Bank Act which are designed to ensure, in case of disaster, uniformity in the treatment of depostors and a ratable distribution of assets.' The results in these causes was not influenced by consideration of local law.\n We cannot accept the suggestion of counsel for petitioner that the cited opinions merely declare a pledge of assets ultra vires and leave the consequences to be determined by the law of the state where it occurs. This view is not in harmony with the language of the opinions nor with the general purposes of the National Banking Act there pointed out.\n Under the common law as interpreted in New York, pledge of securities by a state bank to secure deposits is 'contrary to law and beyond the power and authority \n\n[309 \nU.S. 590, 597]\n\u00a0\n vested in the officers.' Although forbidden, such a pledge will not be set aside unless deposits made in reliance upon it are first repaid. State Bank of Commerce v. Stone, 261 N.Y. 175, 187, 188, 184 N.E. 750, 87 A.L.R. 1449; City of Mount Vernon v. Mount Vernon Trust Co., 270 N.Y. 400, 406, 1 N.E.2d 825.\n The Act of June 25, 1930 permits national banks to give security for public deposits 'of the same kind as is authorized by the law of the State in which such association is located in the case of other banking institutions in the State'. Counsel maintain that within the fair intendment of this, state banks in New York are 'authorized' to pledge bonds to secure public deposits. They rely upon the rulings of the local courts, in the causes last cited, concerning conditions which must be met before an ultra vires act will be set aside.\n They submit that corporations have capacity to accept the result of their actions. 'That the capacity to accept the consequences of an ultra vires act is itself a power.' Further, that \"giving' a power is but another word for 'authorizing' its exercise.' Hence, the argument seems to run, as a state bank may hold the fruit of a pledge until return of the thing pledged, therefore, it is 'authorized by law' to make a pledge thus conditioned.\n In this procession, obviously, different meanings are attributed to the word 'power' and it is confused with 'capacity' and 'authority.' In one sense, every corporation has 'power' to do wrong, also 'capacity' to suffer the consequences of wrongdoing. But no corporation has authority to violate an inhibition or go beyond the limits of its charter. Authorization to do a forbidden thing cannot be inferred from capacity to accept the prescribed consequences. The law forbade local institutions to make pledges such as the one here in question.\n The challenged judgments must be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Title 12 U.S.C.A.-\n's 91.

UNITED STATES(1940)\nNo. 571\nArgued: January 30, 1940Decided: February 26, 1940\n\n\n\n Messrs. Donald R. Richberg, of Washington, D.C., and Felix T. Smith and Chalmers G. Graham, both of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioners.\n Mr. Wendell Berge, of Washington, D.C., for respondent. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 323, 324]\n\u00a0\n\n Opinion of the Court by Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER announced by the CHIEF JUSTICE.\n The District Court for the Northern District of California denied motions to quash subpoenas duces tecum addressed to the petitioners and directing them to appear and produce documents before a United States grand jury at the July, 1939, term of that court. From the denial of these motions petitioners sought review by way of appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, 107 F.2d 975. That court found itself to be without jurisdiction and dismissed the appeals. We brought the cases here, \n308 \nU.S. 547\n, 60 S.Ct. 299, 84 L.Ed. --, because of conflict between the decision below and that of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, In re Cudahy Packing Co., 104 F.2d 658. The matter in controversy- and the sole question raised in all three cases-vitally concerns the effective administration of the federal criminal law. The question is whether an order denying a motion to quash a subpoena duces tecum directing a witness to appear before a grand jury is included within those 'final decisions' in the district court which alone the circuit courts of appeal are authorized to review by  128(a) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C .  225(a), 28 U.S.C.A.  225(a).1\n Finality as a condition of review is an historic characteristic of federal appellate procedure. It was written into the first Judiciary Act2 and has been departed from only when observance of it would practically defeat the \n\n[309 \nU.S. 323, 325]\n\u00a0\n right to any review at all. \n3\n Since the right to a judgment from more than one court is a matter of grace and not a necessary ingredient of justice, Congress from the very beginning has, by forbidding piecemeal disposition on appeal of what for practical purposes is a single controversy, set itself against enfeebling judicial administration. Thereby is avoided the obstruction to just claims that would come from permitting the harassment and cost of a succession of separate appeals from the various rulings to which a litigation may give rise, from its initiation to entry of judgment. To be effective, judicial administration must not be leaden-footed. Its momentum would be arrested by permitting separate reviews of the component elements in a unified cause. These considerations of policy are especially compelling in the administration of criminal justice. Not until 1889 was there review as of right in criminal cases. \n4\n An accused is entitled to scrupulous observance of constitutional safeguards. But encouragement of delay is fatal to the vindication of the criminal law. Bearing the discomfiture and cost of a prosecution for crime even by an innocent person is one of the painful obligations of citizenship. The correctness of a trial court's rejection even of a constitutional claim made by the accused in the process of prosecution must await his conviction \n\n[309 \nU.S. 323, 326]\n\u00a0\n before its reconsideration by an appellate tribunal. Cogen v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 221\n, 49 S.Ct. 118.\n In thus denying to the appellate courts the power to review rulings at nisi prius, generally, until after the entire controversy has been concluded, Congress has sought to achieve the effective conduct of litigation. For purposes of appellate procedure, finality-the idea underlying 'final judgments and decrees' in the Judiciary Act of 1789 and now expressed by 'final decisions' in  128 of the Judicial Code-is not a technical concept of temporal or physical termination. It is the means for achieving a healthy legal system. As an instrument of such policy the requirement of finality will be enforced not only against a party to the litigation but against a witness who is a stranger to the main proceeding. Neither a party nor a non-party witness will be allowed to take to the upper court a ruling where the result of review will be 'to halt in the orderly progress of a cause and consider incidentally a question which has happened to cross the path of such litigation ....' Mr. Chief Justice Taft, in Segurola v. United States, \n275 \nU.S. 106, 112\n, 48 S.Ct. 77, 79. This is so despite the fact that a witness who is a stranger to the litigation could not be party to an appeal taken at the conclusion of the main cause. Such was the ruling in Alexander v. United States, \n201 \nU.S. 117\n, 26 S.Ct. 356. In that case, witnesses were directed to appear and produce documents before a special examiner designated by the circuit court to hear testimony in a suit brought by the United States to enforce the Sherman Law. Upon refusal to submit the documents called for in the subpoena, the United States petitioned the circuit court for an order requiring compliance. The petition was granted, and appeals were then allowed to this Court. These appeals were dismissed for want of jurisdiction. The grounds of the decision are best indicated in the language of the opinion: \n\n[309 \nU.S. 323, 327]\n\u00a0\n 'In a certain sense finality can be asserted of the orders under review; so, in a certain sense, finality can be asserted of any order of a court. And such an order may coerce a witness, leaving him no alternative but to obey or be punished. It may have the effect and the same characteristic of finality as the orders under review, but from such a ruling it will not be contended there is an appeal. Let the court go farther, and punish the witness for contempt of its order,-then arrives a right of review; and this is adequate for his protection without unduly impeding the progress of the case. ... This power to punish being exercised, the matter becomes personal to the witness and a judgment as to him. Prior to that the proceedings are interlocutory in the original suit.' 201 U.S. at pages 121, 122, 26 S.Ct. at page 358.\n We must now decide whether the situation of a witness summoned to produce documents before a grand jury is so different from that of the witness in the Alexander case that the sound considerations of policy controlling there should not govern here. The Constitution itself makes the grand jury a part of the judicial process. It must initiate prosecution for the most important federal crimes. It does so under general instructions from the court to which it is attached and to which, from time to time, it reports its findings. The proceeding before a grand jury constitutes 'a judicial inquiry', Hale v. Henkel, \n201 \nU.S. 43, 66\n, 26 S.Ct. 370, 375, of the most ancient lineage. See Wilson v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 361\n, 31 S.Ct. 538, Ann.Cas.1912D, 558. The duration of its life, frequently short, is limited by statute. It is no less important to safeguard against undue interruption the inquiry instituted by a grand jury than to protect from delay the progress of the trial after an indictment has been found. Opportunity for obstructing the 'orderly progress' of investigation should no more be encouraged in one case than in the other. That a grand jury proceeding has no defined litigants and that none \n\n[309 \nU.S. 323, 328]\n\u00a0\n may emerge from it, is irrelevant to the issue. The witness' relation to the inquiry is no different in a grand jury proceeding than it was in the Alexander case. Whatever right he may have requires no further protection in either case than that afforded by the district court until the witness chooses to disobey and is committed for contempt. See Hale v. Henkel, supra, and Wilson v. United States, supra. At that point the witness' situation becomes so severed from the main proceeding as to permit an appeal. To be sure, this too may involve an interruption of the trial or of the investigation. But not to allow this interruption would forever preclude review of the witness' claim, for his alternatives are to abandon the claim or languish in jail.\n This analysis of finality is illustrated by Perlman v. United States, \n247 \nU.S. 7\n, 38 S.Ct. 417.5 There, exhibits owned by Perlman and impounded in court during a patent suit were, on motion of the United States attorney, directed to be produced before a grand jury. Perlman petitioned the district court to prohibit this use, invoking a constitutional privilege. This petition was denied and Perlman sought review here. The United States claimed that the action of the district court was 'not final' but merely interlocutory and therefore not reviewable by this Court. We rejected the Government's contention. To have held otherwise would have rendered Perlman 'powerless to avert the mischief of the order ....' 247 U.S. at page 12, 38 S.Ct. page 419. Perlman's exhibits were already in the court's possession. If their production before the grand jury violated Perlman's constitutional right then he could protect that right only by a separate proceeding to prohibit the forbidden use. To have denied him opportunity for review on the theory that the district court's order was interlocutory would have made the doctrine of finality a \n\n[309 \nU.S. 323, 329]\n\u00a0\n means of denying Perlman any appellate review of his constitutional claim. Due regard for efficiency in litigation must not be carried so far as to deny all opportunity for the appeal contemplated by the statutes. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n One class of cases dealing with the duty of witnesses to testify presents differentiating circumstances. These cases have arisen under  12 of the Interstate Commerce Act, whereby a proceeding may be brought in the district court to compel testimony from persons who have refused to make disclosures before the Interstate Commerce Commission. \n7\n In these cases the orders of the district court directing the witness to answer have been held final and reviewable. Interstate Commerce Comm. v. Brimson, \n154 \nU.S. 447\n, 14 S.Ct. 1125; Harriman v. Interstate Commerce Comm., \n211 \nU.S. 407\n, 29 S.Ct. 115; Ellis v. Int. Com. Comm., \n237 \nU.S. 434\n, 35 S.Ct. 645. Such cases were duly considered in the Alexander case, and deemed to rest 'on statutory provisions which do not apply to the proceedings at bar, and, while there may be resemblances to the latter, there are also differences.' 201 U.S. at page 121, 26 S.Ct. at page 358. The differences were thought controlling. Appeal from an order under  12 was again here in the Ellis case, supra, fully argued in the briefs, and again differentiated from a situation like that in the Alexander case. 'No doubt' was felt that an appeal lay from the district court's direction to testify. 'It \n\n[309 \nU.S. 323, 330]\n\u00a0\n is the end of a proceeding begun against the witness'-was the pithy expression for this type of case. 237 U.S. at page 442, 35 S.Ct. at page 646. And it is a sufficient justification for treating these controversies differently from those arising out of court proceedings unrelated to any administrative agency. The doctrine of finality is a phase of the distribution of authority within the judicial hierarchy. But a proceeding like that under  12 of the Interstate Commerce Act may be deemed self-contained, so far as the judiciary is concerned-as much so as an independent suit in equity in which appeal will lie from an injunction without the necessity of waiting for disobedience. After the court has ordered a recusant witness to testify before the Commission, there remains nothing for it to do. Not only is this true with respect to the particular witness whose testimony is sought; there is not, as in the case of a grand jury or trial, any further judicial inquiry which would be halted were the offending witness permitted to appeal. The proceeding before the district court is not ancillary to any judicial proceeding. So far as the court is concerned, it is complete in itself.\n We deem it unnecessary to say more in sustaining the Circuit Court of Appeals. The challenged judgment is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice MURPHY did not participate in the consideration or decision of these cases. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 128(a) provides that, 'The circuit courts of appeal shall have appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal final decisions ....'

In that case proceedings were commenced in the district court for the recovery of documents held by the Government for use before a grand jury. The district court granted the relief sought, and the Government appealed. In this Court the action of the district court was treated as final, and hence subject to review. But the practical considerations there involved were entirely different from those which must govern here. In Burdeau v. McDowell the action of the district court was itself an interruption of the grand jury's inquiry; appeal by the Government did not halt the 'orderly progress' of the inquiry. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] 25 Stat. 858; 49 U.S.C.  12, 49 U.S.C.A.  12. \n\n\n\n\n","19":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOLORADO NAT. BANK OF DENVER v. BEDFORD(1940)\nNo. 719\nArgued: Decided: April 22, 1940\n\n\n\n\n[310 \nU.S. 41, 42]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Walter W. Blood and Frank N. Bancroft, both of Denver, Colo., for appellant.\n\n\n\n[310 \nU.S. 41, 43]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George K. Thomas, of Cripple Creek, Colo., and Henry E. Lutz and Byron G. Rogers, both of Denver, Colo., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This appeal involves the validity of the Public Revenue Service Tax Act of Colorado.1 The act, section 5, imposes upon the services specified in the act, a percentage tax based upon the value of the services rendered or performed by any person subject to its provisions. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 41, 44]\n\u00a0\n Section 5(c) imposes a tax equivalent to two per cent of the value of services rendered by 'banks, finance companies, trust companies and depositories ....' The person rendering the services 'shall be liable and responsible for the payment of the entire amount ....' Section 6. He is required to remit all taxes collected and due the state from him to the treasurer less three per cent to cover the expense of the service. Under section 6(b) persons rendering or performing the services are required 'as far as practicable, (to) add the tax imposed ... to the value of services or charges showing such tax as a separate and distinct item and when added such tax shall constitute a part of such value of service or charge, shall be a debt from the user to the person rendering or performing service until paid, and shall be recoverable at law in the same manner as other debts.' By subsection (d) the person rendering the service is forbidden to hold out directly or indirectly that he will assume or absorb the tax. By section 7 the user may recover illegally collected taxes. Where services are rendered which become a part of an article subject to a sales tax, the services are exempt and the person performing the service recovers where they are illegally assessed. Section 3. By section 12, all sums paid by the user as taxes are public money and trust funds of the State of Colorado. It is made a misdemeanor, section 17, for any person rendering or performing services to refuse to make the returns required. The state treasurer is made administrator of the act and given authority to issue regulations. Section 19. The usual separability clause is contained in the act. Section 22.\n The definitions of the act appear in section 2. By its subsection (c) the term 'services rendered or performed' is defined as those rendered for a valuable consideration by a person covered by the act for the ultimate user thereof. 'The term 'user' shall mean the person for whom or for whose benefit services are rendered or performed.' \n\n[310 \nU.S. 41, 45]\n\u00a0\n By subsection (e) taxpayer is defined as 'any person obligated to account to the state treasurer for taxes collected or to be collected or due the state under the terms of this act.' Subsection (h) provides for a credit on future taxes of a tax paid on accounts eventually found worthless.\n Under the rules and regulations issued by the treasurer on the Public Revenue Service Tax Act, the service tax is construed as invalid as applied to so-called banking services. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Under rule 27, however, such service as the furnishing of safety vaults by depositories or banks is held to come within the act, and the two per cent tax applies to the charges made for this service. These regulations were approved by the judgment and decree of the trial court and that judgment was affirmed in all particulars by the Supreme Court of Colorado. 98 P.2d 1120\n\n\n While section 4(a) makes it unlawful for any person to render the defined services without 'first having obtained a license therefor,' the treasurer demands no license fees from a national bank. Such exception was held proper by the lower court. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The appellant here, the Colorado National Bank, was a national banking corporation duly organized and existing under the national banking act. The bank operated a safe-deposit service under its own name and in the building and vaults used for its other banking activities. The rentals received for the use of that portion of its vaults utilized for safe- deposit boxes were reported to the Comtroller of the Currency as income in the bank; the fixtures employed in the business are part of the assets of the bank and are supervised by the Comptroller of the Currency. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 41, 46]\n\u00a0\n The appellee Bedford, as treasurer of the State of Colorado and administrator of the Service Tax Act, demanded payment from appellant bank of two per cent of the value of the services rendered by the bank to its safe deposit box customers. The bank refused payment and the treasurer brought this action under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, Colorado Stat.Ann.1935, c. 93,  78, 79, for a declaration of rights to the effect that the services performed by the bank are taxable pursuant to the Service Tax Act. The bank answered claiming the state statute as applied to it was repugnant to the Constitution and laws of the United States; setting up the immunity of national banks from state taxation except as permitted by R.S. section 5219;4 claiming that the safe-deposit business of national banks was authorized by Congress and therefore was part of its federally authorized business, immune from taxation whether the bank or the user of its services is the taxpayer. The bank further contended that even though it is not the taxpayer and the tax burden as such is not unlawful, the burden of collection, report and visitation materially interfere with the performance of its national banking functions. A general demurrer to the answer was filed.\n The trial court sustained the bank. The supreme court first affirmed by an equally divided court and then on re- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 41, 47]\n\u00a0\n hearing reversed5 and remanded the case to the district court. The trial court entered a second judgment declaring as prayed by the treasurer, which judgment was affirmed by the supreme court on the authority of the former decision.\n This appeal is here under section 237(a) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S. C.A.  344(a). The treasurer makes the point that as the federal question raised was the immunity to the exaction of the bank as a federal instrumentality withdrawn from state taxation by congressional action, the determination that the tax was on a non-banking activity foreign to its federal character and on the user of the services eliminated the necessity of a decision on the federal question. As the statute was held valid after the conclusion of the Supreme Court of Colorado that the manner of state taxation of national banks must accord with R.S. section 5219 and must not intefere with federal functions, 6 it seems clear the federal question as to the validity of the statute as tested by the Constitution and laws of the United States was necessarily involved and decided. This gives this Court jurisdiction of the appeal. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n Gully v. First National Bank,8 relied upon by the treasurer, dealt with the right to remove to a federal court9 because the cause of action arose under the federal laws,10 but the issue here is the right to appeal where a state statute is held valid against a defense of repugnancy to the same laws. 11 The difference is brought out \n\n[310 \nU.S. 41, 48]\n\u00a0\n in the Gully case, where it is said: 'If there were no federal law permitting the taxation of shares in national banks, a suit to recover such a tax would not be one arising under the Constitution of the United States, though the bank would have the aid of the Constitution when it came to its defense.' \n12\n\u00a0\n\n The genesis of the present system of national banks is the National Bank Act of June 3, 1864.13 It was called 'An Act to provide a National Currency, secured by a Pledge of United States Bonds, and to provide for the Circulation and Redemption thereof.' From this act, correlated with the Federal Reserve Act,14 there has developed the present nationwide banking facilities. R.S. section 5153, 12 U.S.C.A.  90, makes these associations the depositories of public money. Though the national banks' usefulness as an agency to provide for currency has diminished markedly, their importance as general bankers shows a constant growth. \n15\n We may assume that national banks possess only the powers conferred by Congress. 16 These are set out in R.S., section 5136, as frequently amended, and include 'all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking,' with the proviso 'that in carrying on the business commonly known as the safe- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 41, 49]\n\u00a0\n deposit business the association shall not invest in the capital stock of a corporation organized under the law of any State to conduct a safe- deposit business in an amount in excess of 15 per centum of the capital stock of the association actually paid in and unimpaired and 15 per centum of its unimpaired surplus.' 17 We have recently found the authority to secure federal funds within these incidental powers, coupled with a long- continued practice recognized by the Comptroller of the Currency. \n18\n The right to accept special deposits is recognized by the banking act. \n19\n These are monies and other valuables the identical deposits of which are kept, preserved and returned in kind. It differs little if at all from a safe- deposit business. The language of the proviso of section 24, just quoted, is the language suitable to impose restrictions on a recognized power, not the language that would be used in creating a new power. As the limitation on the power to invest in real estate protected in a measure customers and stockholders from risky investments,20 the banks own investment in safety deposit facilities evidently did not seem to Congress to require the same regulation as the purchase of stock in a safedeposit corporation. A subsidiary safedeposit corporation would give priority to the creditors of the subsidiary over the depositors and other creditors of the bank itself. The obvious fact, known to all, is that national banks do and for many years have carried on a safe-deposit business. State banks, quite usually, are given the power to \n\n[310 \nU.S. 41, 50]\n\u00a0\n conduct a safe-deposit business. 21 We agree with the appellant bank that such a generally adopted method of safeguarding valuables must be considered a banking function authorized by Congress. \n22\n\u00a0\n\n We may assume, as did the Supreme Court of Colorado, that the tax is invalid, if laid upon the bank as an instrumentality of government in the incidents referred to in the preceding section;23 that its banking operations are free from state taxation except as Congress may permit;24 that Congress permits the taxation only of shares and real estate;25 and that Congress may inter- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 41, 51]\n\u00a0\n vene to protect its instrumentalities from any other tax which threatens their usefulness. \n26\n\u00a0\n\n Congress has not legislated against taxation of the cusomers of national banks. This court has approved a tax assessed upon the deposits of customers of national banks. \n27\n By section 6 of the Colorado act the 'person rendering or performing services shall be liable' for the payment of the tax imposed. But as subsection (b) of that same section requires the tax paid to be added to the charges for service 'as a separate and distinct item' and makes it a debt from the user of the services until paid, the tax is upon the user of the safe deposit boxes, not upon the bank. Furthermore, as by section 2(h) credit is given to the bank for taxes paid on accounts subsequently found worthless and the bank is in a position to require payment of box rentals and taxes in advance, there is no occasion for a bank ever to have saddled upon it any part of the tax burden.\n In First National Bank v. Commonwealth of Kentucky,28 this Court determined a similar question in favor of the validity of the state tax. The case was decided in 1869. At that time the applicable federal statute 29 read: 'Sec. 41. ... Provided, That nothing in this act shall be construed to prevent all the shares in any of the said associations, held by any person ..., from being included in the valuation of the personal property of such person ... in the assessment of taxes imposed by or under state authority at the place where such bank is located, and not elsewhere ....'\n The statute of Kentucky laid a tax of fifty cents on each share. The same statute enacted: 'The cashier of \n\n[310 \nU.S. 41, 52]\n\u00a0\n a bank ... whose stock is taxed, shall, on the first day in July of each year, pay into the Treasury the amount of tax due. If such tax be not paid, the cashier and his sureties shall be liable for the same, and twenty per cent. upon the amount; and the said bank or corporation shall thereby forfeit the privilege of its charter.' Gen.St.Ky.1883, c. 92, art. 10,  1.\n A national bank refused payment on the ground that it as a bank was not subject to state taxation. It was decided that this was a tax on shares, that the state in a legal proceeding against the shareholder could have garnisheed the bank and that because the bank was a federal instrumentality was no reason for not requiring it to collect and pay over the money from the shareholder. A similar tax was upheld in Des Moines Nat. Bank v. Fairweather. \n30\n\u00a0\n\n The person liable for the tax, primarily, cannot always be said to be the real taxpayer. The taxpayer is the person ultimately liable for the tax itself. 31 The funds which were received by the State came from the assets of the user, not from those of the federal instrumentality, the bank. \n32\n The Colorado Supreme Court holds the user is the taxpayer. \n33\n The determination of the state court as to the incidence of the tax has great weight with us and, when it follows logically the language of the act, as here, is controlling. 34 As the user directly furnishes the funds for the tax, not as an ultimate consumer with a transferred burden but by section 12 of the act as the responsible obligor, we conclude the tax is upon \n\n[310 \nU.S. 41, 53]\n\u00a0\n him not upon the bank. The Constitution or laws of the United States do not forbid such a tax.\n The tax being a permissible tax on customers of the bank, it is settled by our prior decisions that the statutory provisions requiring collection and remission of the taxes do not impose an unconstituional burden on a federal instrumentality. \n35\n Especially is this true since the bank under the Colorado act is allowed three per cent of the tax for the financial burden put upon it by the obligation to collect.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Session Laws of Colorado, 1937, c. 240, p. 1144.

TENNESSEE(1940)\nNo. 117\nArgued: Decided: October 21, 1940\n\n\n\n Mr. Charles C. Trabue, Jr., of Nashville, Tenn., for appellant. [ Continental Assur. Co. v. Tennessee \n311 \nU.S. 5\n (1940) \n\n PER CURIAM.\n The State of Tennessee brought this suit to enforce payment of privilege taxes measured by premiums on policies of insurance issued while appellant was doing business within the State, but upon which the premiums were paid after its withdrawal from the State. Appellant contended that since its withdrawal it had transacted no business within the State; that the policyholders there had mailed their premiums on unmatured policies to the home office of appellant in another State; and that to hold it liable for the taxes demanded would deprive it of its property in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n The Supreme Court of Tennessee sustained the tax. It construed the statutory provisions to mean 'that the tax is levied upon the right to do business in the state, measured by a percentage of annual premiums to the exclusion of all other taxes, the tax on the annual premiums to be paid throughout the life of policies issued'; that though 'measured by two and a half per cent of premiums received on policies issued by the company while exercising its license from the state, the tax was levied upon the privilege of entering the state and engaging in the insurance business, and not upon the annual premiums'; and that the appellant 'by its compliance with the statute adopted and agreed to the construction we have given it, and cannot now repudiate its provisions'. 137 S.W.2d 277, 278.\n This construction of the statute distinguishes the case from that of Provident Savings Life Assurance Society v. Kentucky, \n239 \nU.S. 103\n, 36 S. Ct. 34, L.R.A.1916C, 572. There the question under the statute, as it had been construed by the state court, was whether the insurance company continued to do business within the State for the period under consideration, despite the fact that it had withdrawn from the State, merely because of the receipt of premiums after withdrawal. The \n\n[311 \nU.S. 5, 7]\n\u00a0\n tax was not laid upon the privilege of doing business during the period that the company was actually within the State, the tax on that privilege being measured by the premiums received during the life of the policies. Id., 239 U.S. pages 110, 111, 36 S.Ct. page 36, L.R.A.1916C, 572. The Supreme Court of Tennessee emphasized the point of this distinction in its opinion on rehearing. 138 S.W.2d 447. Compare State v. Connecticut Mut.

Fairbrook, of Seattle, Wash., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question is whether the respondent is entitled to maritime liens for fuel oil delivered to petitioners' vessels.\n In September, 1932, respondent, Signal Oil and Gas Company, made a contract with the Anglo Canadian Shipping Company, Limited, agreeing to sell fuel oil to any vessel which the Anglo Canadian Company might own, charter or operate. In May, 1933, the parties modified the contract so as to include the fuel oil requirements of vessels owned, chartered or operated by W. L. Comyn & Sons. Later, the respective owners of the two vessels here in question, the 'Stjerneborg' and the 'Brand', chartered them to W. L. Comyn & Sons.\n The charters were time charters on the so-called 'Government form'. The owners agreed 'to let' and the charterers 'to hire' the vessel 'from the time of delivery' for a specified period, the vessel to be placed 'at the disposal of the charterers' at such place as the charterers may direct, being on her delivery ready to receive cargo and to be employed in carrying merchandise as stated. The owners agreed to provide and pay for all provisions, wages and shipping and discharging fees of the captain, officers, engineers, firemen and crew; to pay for the insurance of the vessel, and to maintain her in a thoroughly efficient state in hull, machinery and equipment The charterers agreed to 'provide and pay for' coals and fuel oil, port charges, pilotages, etc., and all other usual ex- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 268, 270]\n\u00a0\n penses except as before stated. The charterers were to pay 'for the use and hire' of the vessel a stipulated amount commencing 'on and from the day of her delivery' and to continue until 'the day of her redelivery in like good order and condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted, to the owners (unless lost) at a safe port' as designated. It was provided that the captain, although appointed by the owners, should be 'under the orders and direction of the charterers as regards employment of agency'; and the charterers were to load, stow and trim the cargo at their expense under the supervision of the captain. If the charterers should have reason to be dissatisfied with the conduct of the captain, officers or engineers, the owners if necessary should make a change in the appointments. The charterers were allowed to appoint a supercargo to accompany the vessel and 'see that voyages are prosecuted with the utmost despatch'. It was further provided that nothing in the charter should be construed as a 'demise' and that the owners were to remain responsible for the navigation of the vessel. The charters contained no prohibition against the creation of liens for necessary supplies ordered by the charterers.\n Respondent libeled the vessels for fuel oil supplied to the vessels respectively on the charterers' order, and the owners appeared and filed answers alleging that the oil was furnished upon the charterers' credit and not upon that of the vessel.\n The District Court sustained the liens (25 F.Supp. 594) and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decrees. 9 Cir., 106 F.2d 896. Because of an alleged conflict with decisions of the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit in The Cratheus, 263 F. 693, and Pensacola Shipping Company v. United States Shipping Board, 277 F. 889, certiorari was granted. \n309 \nU.S. 644\n, 60 S.Ct. 592, 84 L.Ed. --, February 26, 1940\n\n\n The Circuit Court of Appeals in the instant case followed its decisions in The Portland, 9 Cir., 273 F. 401, and The \n\n[310 \nU.S. 268, 271]\n\u00a0\n Golden Gate, 9 Cir., 52 F.2d 397. The Golden Gate was a case of a time charter which required the charterer to provide and pay for fuel oil but contained no provision denying the right of the charterer to bind the ship for necessary supplies. The court said that in the absence of such a prohibition the ship was bound whether the supplies were ordered by the charterer or by the master. The ruling was reiterated by the same court in The Luddco, 41, 9 Cir., 66 F.2d 997, 998. In further support of its position, respondent cites the following cases from other circuits: The Everosa, 1 Cir., 93 F.2d 732, 735; The J. W. Hennessy, 2 Cir., 57 F.2d 77, 79, 80; The Anna E. Morse, 3 Cir., 286 F. 794, 798; Munson Inland Water Lines v. Seidl, 7 Cir., 71 F.2d 791, 793.\n Petitioners ruly upon our decisions in The Kate, \n164 \nU.S. 458, 464\n, 17 S.Ct. 135, 137, and The Valencia v. Zeigler, \n165 \nU.S. 264\n, 17 S.Ct. 323, to the effect that where the charter party requires the charterer to provide and pay for supplies, the supplier being charged with knowledge of the provisions of the charter party was not entitled to a maritime lien for supplies furnished to the vessel upon the order of the charterer.\n These decisions, however, were prior to the passage of the Act of June 23, 1910, 36 Stat. 604, which governs the present case. The text of the Act, as amended, is set forth in the margin. \n1\n Its purpose was to simplify and \n\n[310 \nU.S. 268, 272]\n\u00a0\n clarify the rules as to maritime liens as to which there had been much confusion. The Act did away with the artificial distinction between repairs, supplies etc., furnished in home ports and those furnished in foreign ports. It did away with the doctrine that when the owner of a vessel contracted in person for necessaries or was present in the port when they were ordered, it was presumed that the material-man did not intend to rely upon the vessel's credit. It substituted a federal statute for numerous state statutes purporting to confer liens. Piedmont & George's Creek Coal Company v. Seaboard Fisheries Company, \n254 \nU.S. 1, 11\n, 41 S.Ct. 1, 4.2\n In so doing, the statute provided a series of simple and comprehensive rules. While it was said not to be intended to change the general principles of the law of maritime \n\n[310 \nU.S. 268, 273]\n\u00a0\n liens,3 it was intended to operate in aid of those who supply necessaries to ships and it correspondingly restricted the rights of the owners of the vessels. Any person furnishing repairs, supplies, etc., to a vessel whether foreign or domestic, 'upon the order of the owner' or 'of a person authorized by the owner', is to have a maritime lien which may be enforced by suit in rem. It is not necessary to allege or prove that credit was given to the vessel. The 'managing owner, ship's husband, master, or any person to whom the management of the vessel at the port of supply is intrusted', is presumed to have authority to procure the necessaries. The officers and agents thus specified include those appointed 'by a charterer, by an owner pro hac vice, or by an agreed purchaser in possession of the vessel'. These broad provisions are then subjected to the qualification that nothing in the Act should be construed to confer a lien 'when the furnisher knew, or by exercise of reasonable diligence could have ascertained, that because of the terms of a charter party, agreement for sale of the vessel, or for any other reason, the person ordering the repairs, supplies, or other necessaries was without authority to bind the vessel therefor'.\n Despite the aim thus to provide simple and clear rules, there has been no little contrariety of opinion in the application of the statute,- well illustrated by the conflicting decisions to which we have referred with respect to the existence of maritime liens where supplies have been ordered by a charterer who has agreed with the owner to provide and pay for them. As, in such a case, the supplies are furnished on the charterer's order, there is no question that the supplier is charged with knowledge of the provisions of the charter when he either knows them \n\n[310 \nU.S. 268, 274]\n\u00a0\n or by reasonable diligence could have ascertained them. So far, the principle of The Kate and The Valencia, supra, is embodied in the statute. But it does not follow that, in the light of the statute, The Kate and The Valencia can still be regarded as authority for the view that the mere fact that the charterer is bound to provide and pay for the supplies excludes the supplier from having a maritime lien when the charter party contains no prohibition against its creation.\n We think that our decision in The South Coast, \n251 \nU.S. 519\n, 40 S.Ct. 233,4 negatives such a conclusion. That was a case of a bare- boat charter which provided that the charterer should pay for all supplies and all other charges and save the owner harmless from all liens. The supplies were ordered by the master, but, though appointed by the owner, the master was under the orders of the charterer and thus the master's orders were the charterer's orders. When the supplies were ordered, representatives of the owner at the port of supply warned the supplier that the vessel was under charter and that he must not furnish the supplies on the credit of the vessel. If the owner had power to prevent the attaching of a lien by this warning, the owner had done so. But while under the terms of the charter party it was clearly the duty of the charterer to provide and pay for the supplies and to save the owner harmless, this was held not to preclude the creation of a maritime lien. The Kate and The Valencia were cited unavailingly. When the charter party was examined to see if it prohibited liens it was found that it did not do so; it recognized the possibility of liens. It provided that the owner might retake the vessel in case of the failure of the charterer to discharge within thirty days any debt which was a lien upon it and also for a surrender of the \n\n[310 \nU.S. 268, 275]\n\u00a0\n vessel free of liens upon the charterer's failure to make certain payments.\n We think that the fair import of our decision in The South Coast is that when the charterer has the direction and control of the vessel and it is his business to provide necessary supplies, and the charter party does not prohibit the creation of a maritime lien therefor, the material-man is entitled to furnish the supplies upon the credit of the vessel as well as upon that of the charterer and the lien is not defeated by the fact that the charterer has promised the owner to pay.\n When, however, the charter party, with knowledge of which the material-man is charged, prohibits the creation of a lien for supplies ordered by the charterer or the charterer's representative, no lien will attach. This was decided in United States v. Carver, \n260 \nU.S. 482\n, 43 S.Ct. 181, 182. That was a case of vessels owned by the United States. The charterer, whose representative had ordered the supplies, had agreed that it would 'not suffer nor permit ... any lien' which might have priority over the title and interest of the owner. The question was whether a maritime lien would have arisen against the vessels if they had been privately owned. The court, quoting the provision of the Act of 1910 as to the duty of the material-man to make inquiry, said that he was not entitled 'to rest upon presumptions until he is put upon inquiry'; he must inquire. 'If by investigation with reasonable diligence the material man could have found out that the vessel was under charter, he was chargeable with notice that there was a charter; if in the same way he could have found out its terms he was chargeable with notice of its terms'. The court added that there would have been no difficulty in finding out both. The court found a difference between the language of the charter party in the Carver case and that used in The South \n\n[310 \nU.S. 268, 276]\n\u00a0\n Coast. In the Carver case 'the primary undertaking' was that 'a lien shall not be imposed.' The lien was denied, not because the charterer was bound to provide and pay for supplies but because the charter party prohibited the lien. To the same effect is the decision in the case of the St. John's, Colonial Beach Company v. Quemahoning Coal Company, \n260 \nU.S. 707\n, 43 S.Ct. 246.\n As in the instant case, the charter parties contained no provision prohibiting the creation of a maritime lien, we are of the opinion that the mere fact that they required the charterers to provide and pay for the supplies did not prevent the liens from attaching.\n The argument is pressed that respondent was under a general contract to supply 'the fuel oil requirements of any and all vessels owned, chartered, or operated' by W. L. Comyn & Sons. But this contract did not provide that the oil should be supplied on the sole credit of Comyn as the owner or charterer of the vessels or negative the creation of maritime liens for supplies actually furnished to the vessels in satisfying their requirements. The decisions which petitioner cites are not apposite. In Piedmont & George's Creek Coal Company v. Seaboard Fisheries Company, supra, the Coal Company had made a contract with a corporation, which owned both steamers and factories, to furnish such coal as should be required. The court observed that the difficulty which confronted the Coal Company in seeking to enforce a maritime lien did not lie in the fact that a contract had been made for the supply of coal. 'A vessel', said the court, 'may be ... liable in rem for supplies, although the owner can be made liable therefor in personam, since the dealer may rely upon the credit of both'. So, the court recognized that if in that case 'the coal had been furnished to the several vessels by the libelant, maritime liens would have arisen and could have been established under the statute without \n\n[310 \nU.S. 268, 277]\n\u00a0\n proof that credit was given to the vessels'. The difficulty which blocked recovery by the Coal Company was 'solely that it did not furnish coal to the vessels'. There 'was no understanding when the contract was made, or when the coal was delivered by the libelant, that any part of it was for any particular vessel or even for the vessels then composing the fleet. And it was clearly understood that the purchasing corporation would apply part of the coal to a nonmaritime use'. Id., 254 U.S. at pages 10, 11, 13, 41 S.Ct. at pages 3, 4. In the instant case, the oil was supplied exclusively for the vessels in question, was delivered directly to the vessels and was so invoiced; and there was nothing in the general contract to the effect that the supplies were to be furnished upon the exclusive credit of W. L. Comyn & Sons and not also upon the credit of the vessels.\n In the other case relied upon, Marshall & Company v. The President Arthur, \n279 \nU.S. 564\n, 49 S.Ct. 420, the point was that the maritime lien had been waived by the libelant under an agreement by which trade acceptances endorsed by designated persons had been received; that 'by taking other and different security, upon which it relied, and which it still retains, without stipulating for the retention of the lien, it has waived the lien which it otherwise would have had'. Id., 279 U.S. at page 572, 49 S.Ct. at page 422, 423. It may be noted that in the instant case there was a contention that the liens had been waived by the respondent by entering into a certain creditor's agreement and by accepting certain security. But it appeared that in those transactions the right to the liens on the vessels had been expressly reserved. The court below accordingly ruled that there had been no waiver and its decision in that relation has not been challenged here.\n There remains the contention that, apart from any prohibition of the creation of liens, the vessels could not be bound for supplies ordered by the charterers because of \n\n[310 \nU.S. 268, 278]\n\u00a0\n the nature of the charter parties. There is a plain distinction between a case of a bare-boat charter, where the charterer mans the vessel, and a case where the charter party is a mere contract for the carriage of goods. In the former there is a clear demise; in the latter, the charterer is in substance only a shipper. \n5\n There is an intermediate class of charters which has given rise to many questions in various situations. Time charters of the sort now before us are in this class. The owner provides the master and crew and undertakes the navigation of the vessel and to maintain her in an efficient condition. But the master although appointed by the owner, is placed 'under the orders and direction of the charterers as regards employment or agency'. The owners agree 'to let' the vessel and the charterers 'to hire' her 'from the time of delivery' until the date set for 'her re-delivery'. The charterers are to provide and pay for fuel supplies, port charges, pilotages, etc. and all other expenses except those pertaining to the captain, officers or crew.\n There is thus a distribution of responsibility, and liability or the legal consequences of particular conduct would be determined accordingly. While the owners assumed responsibility for the navigation of the vessels and their maintenance in an efficient state, we are not concerned with any questions relating to faults in navigation or failure in maintenance. The mere fact that the owners furnished the master and crew cannot be regarded as decisive of the question before us. See United States v. Shea, \n152 \nU.S. 178, 190\n, 191 S., 14 S.Ct. 519, 522, 523; United States v. Cornell Steamboat Company, \n267 \nU.S. 281\n, 45 S.Ct. 239. Aside from the navigation of the vessels, they were placed under the control of the \n\n[310 \nU.S. 268, 279]\n\u00a0\n charterers and the master and crew were under their directions. The vessels by the terms of the charters were delivered to the charterers, and where the vessels were to go and what they were to carry, within the broad limits described in the charters, were determined by the charterers.\n The question whether under a charter, containing these or similar provisions, the material-man may have a lien for supplies furnished on the order of the charterer has given rise to conflicting views6 and no little confusion has resulted.\n We think that this conflict may be resolved by having due regard to the manifest purpose of the governing statute. The Act says nothing about types of charters. In speaking of those who shall be presumed to have authority to procure supplies, the statute expressly includes not only the 'ship's husband' and the 'master' but 'any person to whom the management of the vessel at the port of supply is intrusted', and these persons are to be taken to include such officers and agents 'when appointed by a charterer, by an owner pro hac vice, or by an agreed purchaser in possession of the vessel'. We think that the purpose of the statute is not properly served by construing the term 'management of the vessel' as referring to her 'navigation'. Management is a broader term connoting direction and control for the purposes for which the vessel is used. Where as in this \n\n[310 \nU.S. 268, 280]\n\u00a0\n case, apart from mere navigation, the vessel is placed under the direction and control of the charterer as the hirer of the vessel, who as such may determine to what port she shall go and what she shall carry, subject only to specified exceptions, we think the charterer must be deemed to be intrusted with the vessel's management for the purpose of applying the statutory test of authority to obtain necessary supplies upon the credit of the vessel, in the absence of a provision to the contrary.\n The origin of the maritime lien is the need of the ship. Piedmont & George's Creek Coal Company v. Seaboard Fisheries Company, supra. The lien is given for supplies which are necessary to keep the ship going. The material-man when furnishing such supplies on the order of the charterer is charged with knowledge of the terms of the charter party when he can ascertain them, but when it appears that by these terms the charterer has direction and control of the vessel and that he is the one to obtain the essential supplies, and that there is no prohibition of the creation of a maritime lien, the material-man is protected by the terms of the statute. He furnishes the supplies on the order of the person authorized to obtain them and he is entitled to rely on the credit of the vessel as well as upon the credit of the one who gives the order.\n We are of the opinion that it would thwart the purpose of the statute to compel the material-man furnishing supplies to the vessel to resolve the ambiguities which may be found in such charters as those here involved. The statute was intended to afford the material-man a reasonably certain criterion. The owner has a simple and ready means of protection. All that it is necessary for him to do, as the material-man in dealing with the charterer is charged with notice of the charter, is to provide therein that the creation of maritime liens is prohibited. When the owner does not do so, he should not be heard to complain when it appears that it is the \n\n[310 \nU.S. 268, 281]\n\u00a0\n charterer's business to obtain supplies to keep the vessel on her way and the charter has not prohibited reliance upon the credit of the vessel.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Act of June 23, 1910, 36 Stat. 604, as amended by the Act of June 5, 1920,  30, 41 Stat. 1005, 46 U.S.C. 971-973, provides, 46 U.S.C.A .  971-973:\n' 971.

INDEPENDENCE SHARES CORPORATION(1940)\nNo. 17\nArgued: October 18, 1940Decided: December 9, 1940\n\n\n\n\n\n[311 \nU.S. 282, 284]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Harry Shapiro, of Philadelphia, Pa., for petitioners.\n Messrs. Robert F. Irwin, Jr., George M. Kevlin, and Frank R. Donahue, all of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondents Independence Shares Corporation and others.\n Walter Biddle Saul, of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondent Pennsylvania Co. for Insurances on Lives and Granting Annuities.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Two important questions are presented by these petitions. The first is whether the Securities Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 74, 15 U.S.C.A.  77a et seq., authorizes purchasers of securities to maintain a suit in equity to rescind a fraudulent sale and secure restitution of the consideration paid, and to enforce the right to restitution against a third party where the vendor is insolvent and the third party has assets in its possession belonging to the vendor. The second question is whether such purchasers must show that the amount in controversy exceeds $3,000 exclusive of interest and costs as required by Section 24 of the Judicial Code, as amended, 28 U.S.C.  41, 28 U.S.C.A.  41.\n Petitioners, with one exception residents of Pennsylvania, are owners and holders of Capital Savings Plan Contract Certificates purchased from Capital Savings Plan, Inc., since merged with and now Independence Shares Corporation, a Pennsylvania corporation. These certificates required the holders to make certain installment payments to The Pennsylvania Company for Insurances on Lives and Granting Annuities, also a Pennsylvania corporation. \n1\n Pennsylvania, after deducting \n\n[311 \nU.S. 282, 285]\n\u00a0\n certain fixed charges, used the balance of these installment payments to purchase Independence Trust Shares for the benefit of the certificate holders. Independence Trust Shares, issued by Pennsylvania, represented interests in a trust of common stocks of 42 American corporations deposited by Independence with Pennsylvania. Pursuant to trust agreement and indenture between Pennsylvania and Independence, Pennsylvania collected dividends and profits from the stocks and administered the trust.\n Petitioners brought this suit in the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against Pennsylvania, Independence, two affiliated companies, and certain officers and directors of Independence whose residence does not appear. The action against the affiliated companies has been dismissed.\n The bill alleges that Independence and its predecessor Capital were guilty of fraudulent misrepresentations and concealments in their sale and advertisement of contract certificates to petitioners and others similarly situated in violation of the Securities Act of 1933. It alleges that Independence is insolvent and threatened with many lawsuits, that its business is virtually at a standstill because of unfavorable publicity, that preferences to creditors are probable, and that its assets are in danger of dissipation and depletion. Petitioners therefore pray the appointment of a receiver for Independence with power to collect and take possession of the assets of Independence and the trust assets held by Pennsylvania, liquidate the assets, determine the claims of petitioners and other certificate holders and pay them, and wind up and dissolve the corporations. They also seek relief incidental to the above and an injunction restraining Pennsylvania from transferring or disposing of any of the assets of the corporations or of the trust. There is the usual prayer for general relief. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 282, 286]\n\u00a0\n None of the original petitioners' claims exceeds $3,000 and respondents contend that the aggregate of all of them will not exceed $3, 000. It is conceded that the assets sought to be reached are greatly in excess of $3,000.\n Respondents answered the bill and thereafter moved to dismiss it. The motions were heard with petitioners' motions for a temporary injunction and the addition of two plaintiffs. The trial judge denied the motions to dismiss, approved the addition of two plaintiffs, but reserved decision on the application for a receiver. He directed the appointment of a master to take testimony and file a report on the question of the insolvency of Independence, and enjoined Pennsylvania from transferring or otherwise disposing of the sum of $38,258.85 representing certain charges, income, and proceeds received in administration of the trust. D.C., 27 F.Supp. 763.\n Pennsylvania, Independence, and the individual defendants appealed from these orders. The Circuit Court of Appeals did not expressly consider whether the appeals were premature. It thought that the Securities Act did not authorize a bill seeking equitable relief against a third party which has assets belonging to the vendor, and therefore, that Pennsylvania was not a proper party to the suit since no cause of action under the Securities Act was stated against it. It reversed all of the orders appealed from and remanded the cause with directions to allow petitioners to amend their complaint to state a claim for a money judgment at law against Independence only. 3 Cir., 108 F.2d 51. We granted certiorari because of the importance of the questions presented. \n309 \nU.S. 648\n, 60 S. Ct. 715\n\n\n We believe that the appeals from the order granting the temporary injunction were not premature. It is true that Section 128 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  225, 28 U.S.C.A.  225, authorizes circuit courts of appeals to review only final decisions. But Section 129 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A.  227, \n\n[311 \nU.S. 282, 287]\n\u00a0\n expressly excepts from the general rule certain interlocutory orders and decrees. It provides in part: 'Where, upon a hearing in a district court ... an injunction is granted ... by an interlocutory order or decree ... an appeal may be taken from such interlocutory order or decree to the circuit court of appeals ....' Thus by the plain words of Section 129 the Circuit Court of Appeals was authorized to consider the appeals from the temporary injunction. Compare Enelow v. New York Life Insurance Co., \n293 \nU.S. 379\n, 55 S.Ct. 310; Shanferoke Coal & Supply Corp. v. Westchester Service Corp., \n293 \nU.S. 449\n, 55 S.Ct. 313.\n However, this power is not limited to mere consideration of, and action upon, the order appealed from. 'If insuperable objection to maintaining the bill clearly appears, it may be dismissed and the litigation terminated.' Meccano, Ltd., v. Wanamaker, \n253 \nU.S. 136, 141\n, 40 S.Ct. 463, 465. See, also, Eagle Glass & Mfg. Co. v. Rowe, \n245 \nU.S. 275\n, 38 S.Ct. 80; Metropolitan Water Co. v. Kaw Valley Drainage District, \n223 \nU.S. 519\n, 32 S.Ct. 246; Mast, Foos & Co. v. Stover Mfg. Co., \n177 \nU.S. 485\n, 20 S.Ct. 708; Smith v. Vulcan Iron Works, \n165 \nU.S. 518\n, 17 S.Ct. 407. Accordingly, the Circuit Court of Appeals properly examined the interlocutory order denying the motions to dismiss, although generally it could consider such an order only on appeal from a final decision. Reed v. Lehman, 2 Cir., 91 F.2d 919; Miller v. Pyrites Co., Inc., 4 Cir., 71 F.2d 804. Compare Gillespie v. Schram, 6 Cir., 108 F.2d 39; Rodriguez v. Arosemena, 5 Cir., 91 F.2d 219; Kneberg v. H. L. Green Co., Inc., 7 Cir., 89 F.2d 100; Satterlee v. Harris, 10 Cir., 60 F.2d 490.\n Respondents' motions sought to dismiss the bill because it failed to state any cause of action and because the District Court lacked jurisdiction. We hold that these motions were correctly denied.\n We think the Securities Act does not restrict purchasers seeking relief under its provisions to a money judgment. On the contrary, the Act as a whole indicates an intention to establish a statutory right which the litigant may en- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 282, 288]\n\u00a0\n force in designated courts by such legal or equitable actions or procedures as would normally be available to him. Undoubtedly any suit to establish the civil liability imposed by the Act must ultimately seek recovery of the consideration paid less income received or damages if the claimant no longer owns the security. Section 12(2), 15 U.S.C.  77(l)(2), 15 U.S.C.A.  77(l) (2). But Section 12(2) states the legal consequences of conduct proscribed by the Act; it does not purport to state the form of action or procedure the claimant is to employ.\n Moreover, in Section 22[a], 15 U.S.C.A.  77v(a), specified courts are given jurisdiction 'of all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by this subchapter'.2 The power to enforce implies the power to make effective the right of recovery afforded by the Act. And the power to make the right of recovery effective implies the power to utilize any of the procedures or actions normally available to the litigant according to the exigencies of the particular case. If petitioners' bill states a cause of action when tested by the customary rules governing suits of such character, the Securities Act authorizes maintenance of the suit, providing the bill contains the allegations the Act requires. That it does not authorize the bill in so many words is no more significant than the fact that it does not in terms authorize execution to issue on a judgment recovered under Section 12(2).\n We are of opinion that the bill states a cause for equitable relief. There are allegations that Independence is insolvent, that its business is practically halted, that it is threatened with many lawsuits, that its assets are endangered, and that preferences to creditors are probable. There are prayers for an accounting, appointment of a receiver, an injunction pendente lite, and for return of petitioners' payments. Other allegations show that \n\n[311 \nU.S. 282, 289]\n\u00a0\n although petitioners dealt with Independence their installments were paid to Pennsylvania and that the complicated arrangement between Pennsylvania and Independence might make it extremely difficult to obtain satisfaction of any claim established against Independence.\n The principal objects of the suit are rescission of the Savings Plan contracts and restitution of the consideration paid, including recovery of the balance, held by Pennsylvania for account of Independence, which consisted in part of the payments alleged to have been procured by the fraud of Independence. That a suit to rescind a contract induced by fraud and to recover the consideration paid may be maintained in equity, at least where there are circumstances making the legal remedy inadequate, is well established. Tyler v. Savage, \n143 \nU.S. 79\n, 12 S.Ct. 340; Montgomery v. Bucyrus Machine Works, \n92 \nU.S. 257\n; Boyce v. Grundy, 3 Pet. 210. See Black, Rescission and Cancellation, 2d Ed.,  643 et seq.; Williston, Contracts, 3d Ed.,  1525 et seq.; Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence, 4th Ed.,  881, 1092.3\n It is enough at this time to determine that the bill contains allegations which, if proved, entitle petitioners to some equitable relief. Whether or not they sufficiently allege or prove their right to all of the relief prayed in the bill we do not decide because the question is not before us. Hence, if the District Court had jurisdiction it was proper to consider whether injunctive relief should be given in aid of the recovery sought by the bill.\n We agree with the courts below that the Securities Act confers jurisdiction of the suit upon the District Court irrespective of the amount in controversy or the citizenship of the parties. Section 22(a) provides in part: \n\n[311 \nU.S. 282, 290]\n\u00a0\n 'The district courts of the United States ... shall have jurisdiction ... of all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by this subchapter.' This is plainly a suit to enforce a liability or duty created by the Act. That the District Court therefore has jurisdiction is evident from the provision quoted. Accordingly, the only remaining question is whether the injunction was proper.\n We hold that the injunction was a reasonable measure to preserve the status quo pending final determination of the questions raised by the bill. 'It is well settled that the granting of a temporary injunction, pending final hearing, is within the sound discretion of the trial court; and that, upon appeal, an order granting such an injunction will not be disturbed unless contrary to some rule of equity, or the result of improvident exercise of judicial discretion.' Prendergast v. New York Telephone Co., \n262 \nU.S. 43, 50\n, 51 S., 43 S.Ct. 466, 469; Meccano, Ltd., v. Wanamaker, \n253 \nU.S. 136, 141\n, 40 S.Ct. 463, 465. As already stated, there were allegations that Independence was insolvent and its assets in danger of dissipation or depletion. This being so, the legal remedy against Independence, without recourse to the fund in the hands of Pennsylvania, would be inadequate. The injunction was framed narrowly to restrain only the transfer of $38,258.85, and the trial judge required petitioners to furnish security for any losses respondents might suffer. In view of this we cannot say that the trial judge abused his discretion in granting the temporary injunction.\n We conclude that the orders granting the temporary injunction and denying the motions to dismiss were correct and should have been sustained. The orders allowing the addition of two plaintiffs and referring the issue of insolvency to a master were interlocutory and \n\n[311 \nU.S. 282, 291]\n\u00a0\n not appealable (28 U.S.C.  225, 28 U.S.C.A.  225),4 and should have been reversed only if petitioners were not entitled to any equitable relief. See Meccano, Ltd., v. Wanamaker, \n253 \nU.S. 136\n, 40 S.Ct. 463; Smith v. Vulcan Iron Works, \n165 \nU.S. 518\n, 17 S.Ct. 407. The Circuit Court of Appeals properly did not consider them on the merits, and if ultimately there is an appeal from a final decree the correctness of these orders may be examined.\n The decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] For convenience the three corporations just named will be referred to as Capital, Independence and Pennsylvania. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Emphasis added. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] In Falk v.

Barse, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. David Stoneman, of Boston, Mass., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question to be decided is whether a receiver of a national bank may compel payment of a promissory note knowingly given to the bank by one of its directors as a substitute, among its assets, for shares of its own stock \n\n[309 \nU.S. 190, 192]\n\u00a0\n illegally purchased and retained by the bank but with the understanding that it was to retain its interest in the stock and that the note was not to be paid.\n Petitioner, receiver appointed by the Comptroller of the Currency for the Boston-Continental Bank, a national banking association, brought suit against respondent, a director of the bank, and others, in the District Court for Massachusetts to collect an assessment upon shares of stock in the insolvent bank and to recover on respondent's promissory note, found by the receiver among its assets.\n The trial court found that the Boston National Bank, predecessor of the insolvent bank had acquired by purchase, 190 shares of its outstanding capital stock in violation of R.S.  5201, 12 U.S.C.  83, 12 U.S.C.A.  83, which declares that 'No association shall ... be the purchaser or holder of any such shares';1 that respondent as a means of concealing the illegal acquisition of the stock and of enabling the bank to retain its ownership of the stock, prevailed upon his co-defendant Karnow to execute an accommodation note, payable to the bank, the proceeds of which were deposited in another bank to the credit of respondent who then paid them to the Boston National Bank for the 190 shares of stock which were then transferred to the respondent on the books of the bank.\n Following a renewal of the Karnow note respondent transferred the shares to him on the books of the bank \n\n[309 \nU.S. 190, 193]\n\u00a0\n and upon consolidation of the Boston with the Continental National Bank, to form the Boston-Continental National Bank of which petitioner later became receiver, new shares of the consolidated bank were issued in exchange for the old. Part of them were sold and the proceeds used in reduction of the Karnow note. Respondent then gave to the bank his own note for the balance, in substitution for Karnow's note and caused the remaining shares to be transferred to the name of Mahoney also a defendant in the suit, without informing him of the transfer.\n The court found that the entire transaction was devised and carried out by respondent for the purpose of concealing the bank's ownership of the stock by ostensibly removing the shares of stock from its assets and carrying the successive notes in their stead as receivables on the books of the bank with a secret agreement that the stock should be held for the Boston and later for the Boston-Continental Bank without liability on the part of the maker of the note. The court found liability of respondent for the assessment upon the shares held by Mahoney for his account, concluded that he was estopped to deny liability on the note and decreed accordingly that respondent alone should pay the stock assessment and the amount due on the note, 23 Fed.Supp. 758.\n The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed so much of the decree as allowed recovery on the note. 103 F.2d 83. It confirmed the finding of the trial court. But it held that the circumstances which they detailed did not preclude the defense of want of consideration to the demand of the receiver, more than to that of the bank itself.\n We granted certiorari, October 9, 1939, on petition of the receiver because of the public importance of the question in the administration of the National Bank Act and of the conflict of the decision below with that of the \n\n[309 \nU.S. 190, 194]\n\u00a0\n Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Federal Reserve Bank v. Crothers, 289 F. 777 and that of the Fifth Circuit in Bohning v. Caldwell, 10 F.2d 298.\n The National Bank Act (12 U.S.C.A.)  21 et seq.) constitutes 'by itself a complete system for the establishment and government of national banks'. Cook County National Bank v. United States, \n107 \nU.S. 445, 448\n, 2 S. Ct. 561, 564. In addition to the sections of the Act conferring on national banking associations the authority to conduct a public banking business the Act contains numerous provisions designed for the protection of the bank's depositors and other creditors. It establishes minimum requirements for the amount of capital with which a bank may begin business, R.S.  5138, 12 U.S.C.  51, 12 U.S.C.A.  51, and makes special provisions for securing the payment into the bank of the authorized capital, R.S.  5140, 5141, 12 U.S.C.  53, 54, 12 U.S.C.A.  53, 54. It prohibits the purchase by a bank of its own shares of stock and their retention when purchased, R.S.  5201, 12 U.S.C.  83, 12 U.S.C.A.  83. Impairment of capital of an association through its withdrawal by payment of dividends or otherwise is prohibited, R.S.  5204, 12 U.S.C.  56, 12 U.S.C.A.  56. Any bank whose capital has become impaired is required under direction of the Comptroller to make up the deficiency by assessment of its shareholders and in the event of its failure to do so a receiver may be appointed to wind up its business, R.S.  5205, 12 U.S.C.  55, 12 U.S.C.A.  55.\n To insure performance of these duties and as a safeguard to creditors and the public, violation of the provisions of the Act by any director or officer of the bank or by any person aiding or abetting him, is made a criminal offense, R.S.  5209, 12 U.S.C.  592, 12 U.S.C.A.  592, and in the event of such a violation, the association may be required to forfeit all its rights and privileges, R.S.  5239, 12 U.S.C.  93, 12 U.S.C.A.  93. Further, by R.S.  5240, 12 U.S.C.  481, 484, 12 U.S.C.A.  481, 484, the Comptroller of the Currency is required to ap- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 190, 195]\n\u00a0\n point examiners who shall examine the affairs of every bank at least twice in each calendar year with power to administer oaths and examine officers and agents of the bank under oath and who 'shall make a full and detailed report' of the bank to him. By R.S.  5211, 12 U.S.C.  161, 12 U.S.C.A.  161, every association is required to meke to the Comptroller of the Currency not less than three reports each year exhibiting in detail and under appropriate heads the resources and liabilities of the association, and the Comptroller is given power to call for special reports whenever, in his judgment, the same are necessary in order to obtain a full and complete knowledge of the condition of the reporting bank.\n The obvious purpose of prohibiting the purchase by a bank of its own stock is to prevent the impairment of its capital resources and the consequent injury to its creditors in the event of insolvency. The provisions of the Act requiring periodic examinations and reports and the powers of the Comptroller are designed to insure prompt discovery of violations of the Act and in that event prompt remedial action by the Comptroller. These purposes would be defeated and the command of the statute nullified if a director or officer or any other by his connivance could place in the bank's portfolio his obligation good on its face, as a substitute for its stock illegally acquired, and if he remained free to set up that the obligation was, in effect, fictitious, intended only to aid in the accomplishment of the injury at which the statute is aimed.\n Here, respondent, with full knowledge of the unlawful purpose to conceal the presence of the stock among the bank's assets, gave in exchange for it, first another's note and then his own, knowing that it was to be availed of as an apparently valid and lawful asset so as to forestall the remedies available under the statute for the unlawful \n\n[309 \nU.S. 190, 196]\n\u00a0\n purchase. The notes were thus carried as receivables on the books of the bank for a period of more than two years, respondent's own note or renewals of it being lodged with the bank from May 4, 1931 until the bank closed its doors in December, 1931.\n If the matter were of importance we could not assume, in the absence of proof, that the bank examiners did not perform their statutory duty or that respondent's note was not as it was intended to be the effective means of concealing the impairment of the bank's capital structure and preventing resort to the remedies for it which the statute affords. But it is enough for present purposes that the respondent, after placing his note among the bank's receivables in substitution for the shares of stock, as the means of avoiding the consequences of violation of the statute, may not now take the benefit of the secret and illegal agreement that his note except for purposes of deceiving the bank examiners was to be regarded as a nullity. If respondent were free to set up the unlawful agreement as a defense and thus cast the loss from the unlawful stock purchase on the creditors of the bank in receivership, he would be enabled to defeat the purpose of the statute by taking advantage of an agreement which it condemns as unlawful. That, we think, the law does not allow.\n It is a principle of the widest application that equity will not permit one to rely on his own wrongful act, as against those affected by it but who have not participated in it, to support his own asserted legal title or to defeat a remedy which except for his misconduct would not be available. See United States v. Dunn, \n268 \nU.S. 121, 133\n, 45 S.Ct. 451, 454, Independent Coal & Coke Co. v. United States, \n274 \nU.S. 640, 648\n, 47 S.Ct. 714, 717. Applied in cases like the present, the rule that the illegal agreement may not be set up to defeat the obligation of the note is sometimes denominated an \n\n[309 \nU.S. 190, 197]\n\u00a0\n equitable estoppel. \n2\n Lyons v.

Smith, 132 Pa.Super. 73, 200 A. 215.\n In a strict and technical sense an estoppel arises only when a misrepresentation has prejudiced another who has relied upon it. For that reason courts have sometimes held that one in the position of respondent is not estopped to set up the agreement against the bank or the receiver either because it did not appear that the bank was deceived by the concealment and misrepresentation or because injury to creditors was not shown to have resulted from them, cf. Peterson v. Tillinghast, 6 Cir., 192 F. 287; Cutler v. Fry, D.C., 240 F. 238; First State Bank v. Morton, 146 Ky. 287, 293, 142 S.W. 694; Quincy Trust Co. v. Woodbury, Mass., 13 N.E.2d 377; Agricultural Credit Corp. v. Scandia American Bank, 184 Minn. 68, 237 N.W. 823. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 190, 198]\n\u00a0\n But stated more precisely, the doctrine with which we are now concerned is not strictly that of estoppel as thus defined. It is a principle which derives its force from the circumstances that respondent's act, apart from its possible injurious consequences to creditors, is itself a violation of the statute; and that the statute, read in the light of its purposes and policy, precludes resort to the very acts which it condemns, as the means of thwarting those purposes by visiting on the receiver and creditors whom he represents the burden of the bank's unlawful purchase.

Haines, 115 N.J.L. 271, 178 A. 801; Williston on Contracts (Rev. ed.)  1632; Zollman, Banks and Banking,  4783.\n Since it is by virtue of the statute that respondent's agreement is unlawful and that the benefit of it as a defense to the note is denied; and as the purpose of the statute is to protect creditors of the bank from the hazard of violations of the Act like the present, it is immaterial that the bank's officers were participants in the illegal transaction, Texas & Pacific Ry. v. Pottorff, \n291 \nU.S. 245\n, 54 S.Ct. 416; City of Marion, Ill., v. Sneeden, \n291 \nU.S. 262\n, 54 S.Ct. 421; Awotin v. Atlas Exchange National Bank, \n295 \nU.S. 209\n, 55 S.Ct. 674, or that the receiver has not shown that the creditors have been deceived or specifically injured as the result of the illegal contract. Cf. Mount Vernon Trust Co. v. Bergoff, supra, 272 N.Y. 192, 196, 5 N.E.2d 196. It is the evil tendency of the prohibited acts at \n\n[309 \nU.S. 190, 199]\n\u00a0\n which the statute is aimed and its aid, in condemnation of them, and in preventing the consequences which the Act was designed to prevent, may be invoked by the receiver representing the creditors for whose benefit the statute was enacted.\n Rankin v. City National Bank, \n208 \nU.S. 541\n, 28 S.Ct. 346, and Deitrick v. Standard Surety & Casualty Co., \n303 \nU.S. 471\n, 58 S.Ct. 696, on which respondent relies do not call for any different conclusion. Because of certain statements obiter in the opinion in the Rankin case, it has been taken as controlling in a number of cases resembling the present, by the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit,3 and in one case in the Sixth Circuit. \n4\n In cases already cited, Courts of Appeals in other circuits have reached a different conclusion. It was to resolve this conflict that we granted certiorari. The Rankin case was tried below and decided here upon the concession of counsel that the transaction involved was not illegal, \n208 \nU.S. 541, 547\n, 28 S.Ct. 346, 349. Here it is the reach of the statute making respondent's acts illegal and affording protection from them to the creditors which governs our decision.\n In the Deitrick case, suit was brought against a surety company, on its surety bonds, by a bank's receiver not alleged to represent any innocent creditors who were injured because of their reliance on the bond. The company's agent, as alleged and as found by the two courts below, had, to the knowledge of the bank's president, executed and delivered the bonds to the bank without consideration and without the company's knowledge or authority, all in collusion with the bank's officers in a fraudulent conspiracy to deceive the bank examiner. The \n\n[309 \nU.S. 190, 200]\n\u00a0\n company insisted that as it was the innocent victim of its agent's unauthorized acts in carrying out the conspiracy it could not be charged with responsibility for them on the theory of estoppel or of its own participation in the illegal transaction. Because of this state of the pleadings and of the record, the court found itself unable to hold that the National Bank Act imposed liability on the surety company. The decision of this Court was rested specifically, as was that of the Circuit Court of Appeals below, on the ground that the pleadings had limited the receiver's demand to the right of the bank to recover upon the bond procured by the fraud of its officers. This was shown, the Court declared, by the failure of the pleadings to allege any wrongful act for which the company was chargeable or which was injurious to creditors. It said, 303 U. S. at page 480, 58 S.Ct. at page 701, that the receiver 'makes no suggestion of a purpose attributable to the company to mislead creditors or others; makes no allegations of damage, except that sustained by the bank. He sets up no facts which could render unconscionable a denial of liability upon the bond because of the agent's fraud obviously induced by the president of the bank.' We did not decide that in an action against one who, like respondent, is alleged and proved to be a participant in the illegal transaction, he can be heard to set up the defense of his illegal action to defeat the statutory policy aimed at the protection of creditors.\n A point much discussed in brief and argument, upon the assumption that local law will guide our decision, see Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n, 58 S.Ct. 817, 114 A.L.R. 1487, is whether, by Massachusetts law respondent is precluded from setting up the illegality of the transaction as a defense to his note. But it is the federal statute which condemns as unlawful respondent's acts. The extent and nature of the legal consequences of this condemnation though left by \n\n[309 \nU.S. 190, 201]\n\u00a0\n the statute to judicial determination, are nevertheless to be derived from it and the federal policy which it has adopted, see, Board of Commissioners of Jackson County, Kan., v. United States, \n308 \nU.S. 343\n, 60 S.Ct. 285, decided December 18, 1939, and cases cited. We have recently held that the judicial determination of the legal consequences which flow from acts condemned as unlawful by the National Bank Act involves decision of a federal, not a state question. Awotin v. Atlas Exchange National Bank, supra.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice MURPHY took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS.\n I think the judgment should be affirmed on the authority of Deitrick v. Standard Surety & Casualty Co., \n303 \nU.S. 471\n, 58 S.Ct. 696, decided March 28, 1938. That case followed and reaffirmed the principle announced in Rankin v. City National Bank, \n208 \nU.S. 541\n, 28 S.Ct. 346, that where the receiver of a national bank sues to recover on a chose in action which was an asset of the bank, his rights rise no higher than those of the bank, even though the obligation was given to deceive creditors or the bank examiner. The doctrine of the Rankin case has been applied in suits by receivers of national banks for more than thirty years. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Deitrick v. Standard Surety & Casualty Company is on all fours with the present case. There the very argu- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 190, 202]\n\u00a0\n ments and authorities now relied upon and cited on behalf of this petitioner were pressed without avail.\n In the earlier case the same receiver brought actions at law to recover on surety bonds as assets of the bank. The facts were that the bank held worthless notes, known to its president to be such. To give a false appearance of worth to these assets he conspired with the agent of a surety company to procure surety bonds guaranteeing payment of the notes, to be used as 'window dressing' and to be shown to the bank examiners if they should ask to see the collateral for the notes. The bank was afterwards examined and, as a result of the examiners' report, additional capital was subscribed. We may assume they saw the bonds. The bank remained open for a period and deposits continued to be made. Later the Comptroller determined the bank was insolvent and a receiver was appointed.\n In his declaration in each action the receiver alleged his appointment, recited the execution and delivery of the surety bond to the bank and attached a copy of it. He alleged that the note or notes in question in each case was or were in default and that the surety was liable according to the terms of its bond. The surety company answered in each case setting up that no consideration was paid for the giving of the bond and that it was agreed and understood that no liability was to ensue from the execution and delivery. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The District Court entered judgment for the surety company and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. \n3\n That court, after stating that the knowledge of the president was the knowledge of the bank, held that the receiver \n\n[309 \nU.S. 190, 203]\n\u00a0\n was not an agent of the bank's creditors; that he stood in no better position than the bank; that all defenses open to the surety company as against the bank were open as against the receiver; that the suit was merely one to recover assets of the bank and that the declarations stated no cause of action other than that arising from the contract of suretyship. The court called attention to the fact that the pleadings contained no allegation that the receiver based his action on any alleged deception of, or injury to, creditors of the bank and no allegation that the receiver was suing on behalf of creditors, and held that, upon the pleadings, it was not open to the receiver to urge that he represented creditors. It refused to decide whether, on different pleadings, the receiver could recover if he alleged and proved injury resulting to creditors from the transaction.\n This court affirmed the judgment on the grounds stated by the court below, citing and relying on Rankin v. City National Bank, supra.\n The surety also pleaded that its agent had exceeded his authority in issuing the bonds, as the bank's president knew. The Circuit Court of Appeals did not pass upon this defense, since it held the receiver could not recover even if the surety company had authorized the giving of the bonds. In the opinion of this court, the surety's contention that it was not bound by its agent's unauthorized act was mentioned but was not considered or discussed as a ground of decision. The sole basis of the decision is stated as follows (\n303 \nU.S. 471\n, 58 S.Ct. 701):\n'An examination of the pleadings makes it quite clear that the receiver undertook to set up rights acquired by the insolvent bank through duly executed contracts between it and the surety company. He makes no suggestion of a purpose attributable to the company to mislead creditors or others; makes no allegations of damage, except that sustained by the bank. He sets up no facts \n\n[309 \nU.S. 190, 204]\n\u00a0\n which would render unconscionable a denial of liability upon the bond because of the agent's fraud obviously induced by the president of the bank. In this state of the pleadings the receiver may not have judgment; he cannot rely on something not complained of; nor can he have damages because of supposed deceptions which the pleadings fail to suggest.'\n\n After so stating the court refers to the Rankin case and says: 'We adhere to the doctrine there approved and regard it as decisive of the present cause.'\n Turning to the instant case, the facts are these: The bank had acquired shares of its own stock illegally. Such shares, so held, were inadmissible assets. The bank's president, knowing that such acquisition of its own stock was an illegal dissipation of its capital, worked out an ostensible sale of the stock for a note which it was understood was to be placed amongst the assets of the bank for the purpose of deceiving the examiners. The note was without consideration and the understanding was that it would not be collected. It was, of course, unenforceable by the bank. Subsequently deposits were made in the bank. It does not appear that the examiners saw the note. After the Comptroller had found the bank insolvent and appointed a receiver that officer filed a bill against the maker of the note, first, to collect an assessment from him as owner of the stock and, second, to recover the face amount of the note, with interest. In this bill he alleged his appointment as receiver, the acquisition of the stock by the bank, and the placing of it in straw names, the giving of the note for the purchase price of the stock and claimed 'the unpaid principal amount of said note ... together with interest thereon is due the plaintiff ....' His prayers were for a decree for the amount of the assessment and for the principal amount, with interest, of the note.\n The answer outlined the true transaction, asserted that the defendant's note was an accommodation note, that no \n\n[309 \nU.S. 190, 205]\n\u00a0\n consideration passed for it, and there could, therefore, be no recovery upon it.\n The District Court entered a decree for the amount of the assessment and for the principal of the note with interest. The Circuit Court affirmed as to the assessment but reversed the judgment upon the note.\n Here, as in the earlier case, there was no allegation that any creditors were deceived; none of any loss to the creditors resulting from the giving of the note; none that the receiver sued on behalf of creditors, and no cause of action asserted save one to recover upon the note as an asset of the bank. Here, as in the earlier case, the receiver has urged upon this court that he does represent creditors; that the public policy evidenced by the National Bank Act disables the defendant, in view of the intended deception, from asserting the lack of consideration for the note. Here, in contrast to the earlier case, the court accepts the view which was there rejected because not within the issues tendered.\n In Deitrick v. Standard Surety & Casualty Co., supra, the receiver urged upon this court the very contentions which he again advanced in the instant case; cited in support of those contentions numerous authorities which he now cites, which are relied upon in the opinion now announced; sought to have this court adopt the proposition, now affirmed by the opinion in the present case, that the defendant was liable on the surety bond because of the public policy evidenced in the National Bank Act which, broadly speaking, estopped the surety to set up, as against the receiver, appointed pursuant to the national banking law, a wrong against that law in which it had participated. \n4\n His contentions were held to be unavailing in view of the cause of action he had pleaded. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 190, 206]\n\u00a0\n In view of what has been said, it is apparent that, under the guise of distinguishing the earlier case, the court in fact overrules it.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS joins in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'No association shall make any loan or discount on the security of the shares of its own capital stock, nor be the purchaser or holder of any such shares, unless such security or purchase shall be necessary to prevent loss upon a debt previously contracted in good faith; and stock so purchased or acquired shall, within six months from the time of its purchase, be sold or disposed of at public or private sale; or, in default thereof, a receiver may be appointed to close up the business of the association, according to section fifty-two hundred and thirty-four (12 U. S.C.  192, 12 U.S.C.A.  192).' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] In a number of cases it has been held that the indirect benefit of the transaction to the obligor as a creditor or shareholder of the bank is sufficient consideration to support recovery. See New v. Page, 144 Md. 606, 125 A. 403; Hurd v. Kelly, 78 N.Y. 588, 34 Am.Rep. 567; State ex rel. Lattanner v. Hills, 94 Ohio St. 171, 113 N.E. 1045, L.R.A.1917B, 684; First National Bank v.

But whether the liability is sustained on this ground or that of estoppel it is apparent that the statutory policy of protection to creditors underlies both.

Stout, of Jersey City, N.J., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[310 \nU.S. 419, 423]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Egbert Rosecrans, of Blairstown, N.J., for respondents.\n\n\n\n[310 \nU.S. 419, 425]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question is of the right of respondents to recover consequential damages to their New Jersey land, due to interference with their access to the land and with their light, air and view caused by petitioner's construction of a bridge abutment on adjacent land. The answer turns on the question whether the Compact of 1934 between New Jersey and Pennsylvania authorizing the construction of the bridge and its approaches, excluded the application to petitioner of a New Jersey statute without which respondents would enjoy no right of recovery under New Jersey law.\n Petitioner, the Bridge Commission, is a 'body corporate and politic' created by the Compact adopted by the legislatures of the two states, N.J. P.L.1934, Ch. 215 (now N.J.R.S.1937, 32:8-1 et seq., N.J.S.A. 32:8-1 et seq.), 1931 Pa.P.L. 1352; 1933 Pa.P.L. 827, 36 P.S.Pa.  3401 and note, and consented to by Congress, 49 Stat. 1058 (1935). The Compact authorized the \n\n[310 \nU.S. 419, 426]\n\u00a0\n Commission to build bridges across the Delaware River between the two states, and for that purpose gave the Commission authority to acquire real property by purchase or by the exercise of eminent domain. The Commission, in the exercise of its authority in construction of a bridge between Phillipsburg, New Jersey, and Easton, Pennsylvania, acquired by purchase land in the town of Phillipsburg, upon which it has located and constructed a highway approach to the bridge, on an embankment or abutment leading to the New Jersey end of the bridge. The property thus acquired and used includes land adjoining the rear of property owned by respondents, having its front on a public street. The embankment and the land on which it rests also crosses certain streets in the neighborhood not immediately adjacent to respondents' land which have been permanently closed by the public authorities, in order to provide for the bridge approach.\n The present suit is a proceeding in mandamus, brought in the New Jersey Supreme Court to compel the Commission to take proceedings, which it is alleged are authorized and required by the Compact, to fix and award compensation to respondents for damages to their land, suffered by reason of the Commission's action in the construction of the abutment. The State Supreme Court sustained the special verdict of a jury which found that the Commission's action had damaged respondents by depriving them of access to their land and their enjoyment of light, air and view. The court found as a matter of law that as the abutment was located wholly on land acquired by the Commission, and as the streets in the neighborhood had been closed and grades changed by state authority, respondents were without right of recovery for the damages suffered, in the absence of some statute authorizing recovery. But it found such a statute in Ch. 297 of P.L.1912 as amended by Ch. 76 of P.L.1919 \n\n[310 \nU.S. 419, 427]\n\u00a0\n (now N.J.R.S.1937, 32:9-1 et seq., N.J.S.A. 32:9-1 et seq.), which it construed with the Compact as requiring the Commission to compensate for the damages which respondents had suffered. Klement v. Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Comm., 119 N.J.L. 600, 197 A. 896.\n Respondents, being without other adequate legal remedy, the court awarded a peremptory mandamus directing petitioner to compensate them for the damage or to take proceedings for the determination of the amount to be awarded as compensation pursuant to the provisions of Article III of the Compact, which it also held required the proceedings for that purpose to be taken according to Chapter 297 of P.L.1912 as amended by Ch. 76 of P. L.1919 (now N.J.R.S.1937, 32:9-1 et seq., N.J.S.A. 32:9-1 et seq). On appeal the New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals affirmed on the same grounds as those on which the Supreme Court rested its decision. 123 N.J.L. 197, 8 A.2d 563. We granted certiorari January 15, 1940, \n308 \nU.S. 549\n, 60 S.Ct. 386, 84 L.Ed. --, the questions of the construction of the Compact between states and of the jurisdiction of this Court being of public importance.\n In People of New York v. Central Railroad Co. of New Jersey, 12 Wall. 455, jurisdiction of this Court to review a judgment of a state court construing a compact between states was denied on the ground that the Compact was not a statute of the United States and that the construction of the Act of Congress giving consent was in no way drawn in question, nor was any right set up under it. This case has long been doubted, see Hinderlider v. La Plata Co., \n304 \nU.S. 92\n, 110, note 12, 58 S. Ct. 803, 811, and we now conclude that the construction of such a compact sanctioned by Congress by virtue of Article I,  10, Clause 3 of the Constitution, involves a federal 'title, right, privilege, or immunity' which when 'specially set up or claimed' in a state court may be reviewed here on certiorari under  237(b) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C .  344, 28 U.S.C.A.  344(b).

Hence we address ourselves to the language of the Compact on which respondents rely to sustain a right of recovery for injury to their lands, for which, apart from the New Jersey statute of 1912, referred to in the Compact, the New Jersey courts have held there is no support in state law.\n The Compact created the Commission as a 'public corporate instrumentality' of the two states, to perform state functions, among others, the location, construction, operation and maintenance of bridges extending between the two states and across a specified section of the Delaware River. To this end it conferred upon the Commission the power:\n'b. To sue and be sued. ...\n\n'h. To enter into contracts. ...\n\n'j. To acquire, own, use, lease, operate, and dispose of real property and interest in real property, and to make improvements thereon . ...\n\n'm. To exercise the power of eminent domain.' N.J.S.A. 32:8-3.\n\n In connection with the acquisition of any real property for any authorized purpose, Article III of the Compact provides: 'If the commission is unable to agree with the owner or owners thereof upon terms for the acquisition of any such real property, in the state of New Jersey, for any reason whatsoever, then the commission may acquire such property by the exercise of the right of eminent domain, in the manner provided by an act (of the State of New Jersey) entitled 'An act authorizing the acquisition and maintaining by the state of New Jersey, in conjunction with the state of Pennsylvania, of toll bridges across the Delaware river, and providing for free travel across the same,' approved the first day of April, one thousand \n\n[310 \nU.S. 419, 429]\n\u00a0\n nine hundred and twelve (chapter two hundred ninety-seven), and the various acts amendatory thereof and supplementary thereto, relating to the acquisition of interstate toll bridges over the Delaware river.'\n It further provides: 'The term 'real property' as used in this compact includes lands, ... and interests in land, ... and any and all things and rights usually included within the said term, and includes not only fees simple and absolute, but also any and all lesser interests, such as easements, rights of way, uses, leases, licenses, and all other incorporeal hereditaments and every estate, interest or right, legal or equitable, including terms of years and liens thereon by way of judgments, mortgages, or otherwise, and also claims for damage to real estate.' N.J.S. A. 32:8-4.\n It will be noted that the effect of these provisions is to authorize the Commission to acquire 'real property' by purchase or by eminent domain, and that by definition real property includes 'interests in land' which are so defined as to include 'claims for damage to real estate', and that, where resort to eminent domain is needful for the acquisition of such interests, the exercise of that power is to be 'in the manner provided' in the New Jersey statute of 1912 as amended. By its terms the Compact confers upon the Commission the power to acquire the specified interests in land or relating to land, conditioned upon payment for the interests acquired, an amount agreed upon or fixed by proceedings in eminent domain. Beyond this it imposes no duty or obligation on the Commission to compensate for damages inflicted by its acts, but leaves the Commission subject to such liability as is imposed by the law of the state within which the Commission acts.\n The New Jersey statute of 1912 which, as prescribed by Article III of the Compact, affords the procedure by which the Commission is to exercise its power of eminent \n\n[310 \nU.S. 419, 430]\n\u00a0\n domain, does not enlarge the duties or liability of the Commission as prescribed by the Compact. The amended statute of 1912 authorized a state commission, acting in cooperation with a like commission of Pennsylvania, to acquire the rights, franchises and property of bridge companies owning and operating existing toll bridges across the Delaware River within a specified territory and to operate and maintain them as free bridges.\n It authorized the Commission to acquire the bridges by purchase or by eminent domain and for that purpose 'to determine any compensation to be allowed, as of the time of entry upon and taking possession of the property, for the value of the property, franchises, easements or rights in the two states.' N.J.S.A. 32:9-4. It commands that after view of the premises and hearing the Commission, in determining the amount of compensation, 'shall estimate the value of the property taken, including any easements, rights or franchises incident thereto as well as the damages for property taken, injured or destroyed, and shall state to whom the damages are payable.' N.J.S.A. 32:9-7.\n Respondents insist that this direction that the commission created under the 1912 Act 'shall estimate ... damages for property taken, injured or destroyed' is, by the Compact, made a direction to petitioner for payment of consequential injuries to property to which the Compact makes no reference. Under the generally applicable decisions and statutes of New Jersey, as her courts have held in this case, the Commission is without liability to pay consequential damages. But it found a statutory creation of such liability in the Act of 1912 as amended in 1919. At the time of the adoption of the Compact there was no statute in New Jersey purporting to impose such a liability which was on its face applicable to the Commission. If the Act of 1912 as amended imposed such a liability, it appeared to be applicable only to a different corporate body from petitioner and then only in the case \n\n[310 \nU.S. 419, 431]\n\u00a0\n of the transfer of ownership of existing toll bridges to the commission the acquisition of which could inflict no consequential damages. In entering into a compact it was then competent for the states to provide by its terms the extent to which they were to take over and apply to the new Commission, performing a different function under different circumstances, the substantive rules governing compensation upon the acquisition of existing toll bridges under the 1912 Act. The Compact was explicit in its specification of what property interests should be taken and compensated for, and of the right and authority of the Commission to acquire them by purchase or by eminent domain. By its silence it left the Commission subject to such liability for consequential damages only as was imposed by the laws of the state, including the Act of 1912, except in so far as the Compact restricted the application of that Act. The Compact was equally explicit in its statement of the effect which was to be given to the 1912 Act and its amendments.\n It is plain that, under the Compact, without reference to that legislation, the Commission could have acquired land by purchase and built a bridge upon it without subjecting itself to liability for consequential damages. But it was necessary that a procedure should be adopted for the exercise of the power of eminent domain conferred on the Commission by the Compact, N.J.S.A. 32:8-4, and this was done by the provision of the Compact that 'the commission may acquire such property by the exercise of the right of eminent domain, in the manner provided' by the 1912 Act. Under the Compact that Act is given effect only to the extent that it affords a manner or procedure of exercising the right of eminent domain, which is called into operation only if the Commission is unable to acquire needed property by purchase and then only as a means of fixing the compensation which, under the Compact, the Commission is required to pay. The Compact can be given \n\n[310 \nU.S. 419, 432]\n\u00a0\n a more extensive effect only by disregarding its language and by attributing to its draftsmen an intention to adopt a rule of damages not generally applicable in the state and now for the first time adopted by a construction plainly inapplicable to the acquisition of existing toll bridges to which the Act of 1912 and its amendments alone referred.\n Only by reading into the words of the Compact such a strained and unnatural meaning, is it possible to find in it a modification of the settled law of the state defining the recoverable damages upon the construction of public works. Nothing in the history of the Compact has been brought to our attention to suggest any reason or purpose for such modification in the special case of bridges to be constructed between the two states. Both the New Jersey courts thought they discerned such a reason in Article XVI,  8 of the Pennsylvania constitution of 1874, P.S., which provides: 'Municipal and other corporations and individuals invested with the privilege of taking private property for public use shall make just compensation for property taken, injured or destroyed by the construction or enlargement of their works, highways or improvements ....' In passing upon this case they thought that this provision of the Pennsylvania constitution as construed by two decisions of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in 1888 and 1889, Chester County v. Brower, 117 Pa. 647, 12 A. 577, 2 Am.St.Rep. 713; Appeal of Delaware County, 119 Pa. 159, 13 A. 62, required compensation for consequential damages in eminent domain proceedings.\n From this they reasoned that by the provisions of the Compact for the acquisition of property by eminent domain proceedings 'in the manner' provided by the 1912 Act with its stipulation for payment of 'damages for property taken, injured or destroyed' it was intended by the Compact to make the rule of damage under the Pennsylvania constitution applicable to property similarly ac- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 419, 433]\n\u00a0\n quired by the Commission in New Jersey. But this reasoning overlooks the important circumstance that the Pennsylvania courts have consistently ruled that the constitutional provision is without application where there is no taking by eminent domain, and that municipal corporations or others, although possessed of the power of eminent domain, are not liable for consequential damages inflicted by the erection of structures wholly on their own land acquired by purchase. Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Lippincott, 116 Pa. 472, 9 A. 871, 2 Am.St.Rep. 618; Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Marchant, 119 Pa. 541, 13 A. 690, 4 Am.St.Rep. 659; Hartman v. Pittsburgh Incline Plane Co., 159 Pa. 442, 28 A. 145; Gillespie v. Buffalo, Rochester & Pittsburgh Ry. Co., 226 Pa. 31, 74 A. 738; Ridgway v. Philadelphia & Reading Ry. Co., 244 Pa. 282, 90 A. 652.\n Moreover, in 1928, six years before the Compact, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, in Westmoreland Chemical & Color Co. v. Public Service Commission, 294 Pa. 451, 144 A. 407, departed from its ruling in Chester County v. Brower, supra and Appeal of Delaware County, supra, and has since held that the constitutional provision in the absence of a statute requiring it gives no right of recovery from a landowner for consequential damages resulting from structures located wholly on his own land whether acquired by purchase or eminent domain. Hoffer v. Reading Co., 287 Pa. 120, 134 A. 415; In re Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Bridge, 308 Pa. 487, 491, 162 A. 309; McGarrity v. Commonwealth, 311 Pa. 436, 439, 166 A. 895.\n Even though it be thought that it was intended to adopt, by the 1912 Act, the then prevailing interpretation of the Pennsylvania constitutional provision, that fact could have no force here, both because the constitutional provision has never been regarded by the Pennsylvania courts as applicable to the use of land acquired by purchase and because the Compact by its terms excludes \n\n[310 \nU.S. 419, 434]\n\u00a0\n the 1912 Act from its operation except in so far as it affords a manner or method of procedure when the Commission resorts to eminent domain.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","26":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDEPUTY v. DU PONT(1940)\nNo. 151\nArgued: December 12, 1939Decided: January 8, 1940\n\n\n\n\n[308 \nU.S. 488, 489]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Robert K. McConnaughey, of Dayton, Ohio, for petitioners.\n Mr. George Wharton Pepper, of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents the question of whether respondent in computing his taxable net income for the year 1931 may deduct payments of $647,711. 56 made by him in that year to the Delaware Realty and Investment Co. ( hereinafter called the Delaware Company). The deduction is sought either under  23(a) of the Revenue Act of 1928, 45 Stat. 791, 26 U.S.C.A. Int. Rev.Code,  23(a)(1), as 'ordinary and necessary expenses paid \n\n[308 \nU.S. 488, 490]\n\u00a0\n or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on' the 'trade or business' of respondent; or under  23(b) as 'interest paid or accrued within the taxable year on indebtedness.' The Commissioner disallowed the deduction and determined a deficiency, which respondent paid and now seeks to recover. It is agreed that if the deduction is allowed, respondent is entitled to judgment for $172,351.64. The judgment of the District Court against respondent (22 F.Supp. 589) was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 3 Cir., 103 F.2d 257. We granted certiorari \n308 \nU.S. 533\n, 60 S.Ct. 89, 84 L.Ed. --, because of the asserted inconsistency of that ruling with Welch v. Helvering, \n290 \nU.S. 111\n, 54 S.Ct. 8, which construed the meaning of the words 'ordinary and necessary expenses'; and with Burnet v. Clark, \n287 \nU.S. 410\n, 53 S.Ct. 207, which limited such deductions to losses directly connected with the taxpayer's business.\n Respondent's claim to the deduction arose out of the following transactions, briefly summarized. Respondent was beneficial owner of about 16% of the stock of E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (hereinafter called the du Pont Company). In 1919 the du Pont Company constituted a new executive committee composed of nine young men. For business reasons, it thought it desirable that these men have a financial interest in the company. Alleged legal difficulties stood in the way of the du Pont Company selling them the 9,000 shares desired. 1 Accordingly, respondent undertook to sell them 1,000 shares each. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 488, 491]\n\u00a0\n But since he did not have readily available that amount from his own holdings,2 he borrowed 9,000 shares of the du Pont Company from Christiana Securities Company,3 under an agreement whereby he agreed to return the stock loaned in kind within ten years and in the interim to pay to the lender all dividends declared and paid on the shares so loaned. \n4\n Respondent thereupon sold the shares to the nine executives, the purchase price being furnished by the du Pont Company. \n5\n In October, 1929 when the ten-year \n\n[308 \nU.S. 488, 492]\n\u00a0\n period was about to expire, respondent did not have available the number of shares which he was obligated to return to Christiana Securities Company. \n6\n Therefore, he arranged for a loan from the Delaware Company of the number of shares necessary to discharge that obligation. \n7\n Under a contract with that company, respondent agreed to return in kind the number of shares loaned (plus any increase by stock dividend or otherwise) within ten years; to pay to the Delaware Company an amount equivalent to all dividends declared and paid on the borrowed shares until returned; and to reimburse the Delaware Company for all taxes accruing against it by reason of the agreement.\n Pursuant to that agreement respondent paid the Delaware Company in 1931, the sum of $567,648, being an amount equivalent to the dividends received by him during that period from the du Pont Company on the borrowed shares; and the sum of $80,063.56, being the amount of the federal income tax imposed upon the lender by reason of the foregoing payments which it had received from respondent. These are the expenditures claimed as a deduction in the present suit.\n The District Court concluded, on the basis of respondent's large and diversified investment holdings and his \n\n[308 \nU.S. 488, 493]\n\u00a0\n wide financial and business interests, that his business was primarily that of conserving and enhancing his estate. The petitioners challenge that conclusion, asserting that respondent's activities in connection with conserving and enhancing his estate did not constitute a 'trade or business' within the meaning of  23(a) of the Act.\n But as we view the case it is unnecessary for us to pass on that contention and to make the delicate dissection of administrative practice which that would entail. For we are of the opinion that the deductions are not permitted either within the rule of Burnet v. Clark or Welch v. Helvering, supra, even though we were to assume that the activities of respondent constituted a business, as found by the District Court.\n There is no intimation in the record that the transactions whereby the stock was borrowed were not in good faith or were entered into for any reason except a bona fide business purpose. Nor is there any suggestion that the transactions were cast in that form for purposes of tax avoidance. And it is true that as respects the dividends received by respondent and paid over to the Delaware Company, he was little more than a conduit. But allowance of deductions from gross income does not turn on general equitable considerations. It 'depends upon legislative grace; and only as there is clear provision therefor can any particular deduction be allowed.' New Colonial Ice Co., Inc. v. Helvering, \n292 \nU.S. 435, 440\n, 54 S.Ct. 788, 790. And when it comes to construction of the statutory provision under which the deduction is sought, the general rule that 'popular or received import of words furnishes the general rule for the interpretation of public laws,' Maillard v. Lawrence, 16 How. 251, 261, is applicable.\n By those standards the claimed deduction falls for two reasons. In the first place, the payments in question do not meet the test enunciated in Kornhauser v. United \n\n[308 \nU.S. 488, 494]\n\u00a0\n States, \n276 \nU.S. 145\n, 48 S.Ct. 219, since they proximately result not from the taxpayer's business but from the business of the du Pont Company. The original transactions had their origin in an effort by that company to increase the efficiency of its management by selling its stock to certain of its key executives. The respondent undertook to furnish the necessary stock only after the company had been advised that it could not legally do so. In that posture of the case these payments are no more deductible than were the payments made by the stockholder in Burnet v. Clark, supra, as a result of his endorsements of the obligations of his corporation. Those payments were disallowed as deductions from his gross income though they arose out of transactions which were intended to preserve his investment in the corporation. Similar payments were disallowed in Dalton v. Bowers, \n287 \nU.S. 404\n, 53 S.Ct. 205. Hence, the fact that the transaction out of which the carrying charges here in question arose might benefit respondent does not bring it within the ambit of his alleged business of conserving and enhancing his estate. The well established decisions of this Court do not permit any such blending of the corporation's business with the business of its stockholders. Accordingly, the payments made under the 1919 agreement would certainly not be deductible. And the fact that a new and different arrangement was made in 1929 with the Delaware Company does not alter the conclusion, for it is the origin of the liability out of which the expense accrues which is material. Otherwise carrying charges on any short sale whether or not related to the business of the taxpayer would be allowable as deductible expenses. That cannot be if the notion of proximate result implicit in the statutory words 'expenses paid or incurred ... in carrying on any trade or business' is to have any vitality.\n In the second place, these payments were not 'ordinary' ones for the conduct of the kind of business in which, we \n\n[308 \nU.S. 488, 495]\n\u00a0\n assume arguendo, respondent was engaged. The District Court held that they were 'beyond the norm of general and accepted business practice' and were in fact 'so extraordinary as to occur in the lives of ordinary business men not at all' and in the life of the respondent 'but once.' \n8\n Certainly there are no norms of conduct to which we have been referred or of which we are cognizant which would bring these payments within the meaning of ordinary expenses for conserving and enhancing an estate. We do not doubt the correctness of the District Court's finding that respondent embarked on this program to the end that his beneficial stock ownership in the du Pont Company might be conserved and enhanced. But that does not make the cost to him an 'ordinary' expense within the meaning of the Act. Ordinary has the connotation of normal, usual, or customary. To be sure, an expense may be ordinary though it happen but once in the taxpayer's lifetime. Cf. Kornhauser v. United States, supra. Yet the transaction which gives rise to it must be of common or frequent occurrence in the type of business involved. Welch v. Helvering, supra, 290 U.S. at page 114, 54 S.Ct. at page 9. Hence, the fact that a particular expense would be an ordinary or common one in the course of one business and so deductible under  23(a) does not necessarily make it such in connection with another business. Thus, it has been held that one who was an active trader in securities might take as deductions carrying charges on short sales since selling short was common in that business. \n9\n But the carrying charges on respondent's short sale in this \n\n[308 \nU.S. 488, 496]\n\u00a0\n case cannot be accorded the same privilege under  23(a). The record does not show that respondent was in the business of trading in securities. Nor does it show that a stockholder engaged in conserving and enhancing his estate ordinarily makes short sales or similarly assists his corporation in financing stock purchase plans for the benefit of its executives. As stated in Welch v. Helvering, supra, 290 U.S. at pages 113, 114, 54 S.Ct. at page 9 '... What is ordinary, though there must always be a strain of constancy within it, is none the less a variable affected by time and place and circumstance.' One of the extremely relevant circumstances is the nature and scope of the particular business out of which the expense in question accrued. The fact that an obligation to pay has arisen is not sufficient. It is the kind of transaction out of which the obligation arose and its normalcy in the particular business which are crucial and controlling.\n Review of the many decided cases is of little aid since each turns on its special facts. But the principle is clear. And on application of that principle to these facts, it seems evident that the payments in question cannot be placed in the category of those items of expense which a conservator of an estate, a custodian of a portfolio, a supervisor of a group of investments, a manager of wide financial and business interests, or a substantial stockholder in a corporation engaged in conserving and enchancing his estate would ordinarily incur. We cannot assume that they are embraced within the normal over-head or operating costs of such activities. There is no evidence that stockholders or investors, in furtherance of enhancing and conserving their estates, ordinarily or frequently lend such assistance to employee stock purchase plans of their corporations. And in absence of such evidence there is no basis for an assumption, in experience or common knowledge, that these payments are to be placed in the same category as typically ordinary expenses of such activ- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 488, 497]\n\u00a0\n ities, e.g., rental of safe deposit boxes, cost of investment counsel or of investment services, salaries of secretaries and the like. Rather these payments seem to us to represent most extraordinary expenses for that type of activity. Therefore, the claim for deduction falls, as did the claim of an officer of a corporation who paid its debts to strengthen his own standing and credit. Welch v. Helvering, supra. And the fact that the payments might have been necessary in the sense that consummation of the transaction with the Delaware Company was beneficial to respondent's estate is of no aid. For Congress has not decreed that all necessary expenses may be deducted. Though plainly necessary they cannot be allowed unless they are also ordinary. Welch v. Helvering, supra.\n We conclude then on this phase of the case that as the District Court, on a correct interpretation of the Act, found that these payments did not proximately result from, and were not ordinary expenses for the conduct of, respondent's alleged business, it was error for the Circuit Court of Appeals to reverse the judgment for petitioners. McCaughn v. Real Estate Land Title & Trust Co., \n297 \nU.S. 606\n, 56 S.Ct. 604.\n There remains respondent's contention that these payments are deductible under  23(b) as 'interest paid or accrued ... on indebtedness.' Clearly respondent owed an obligation to the Delaware Company. But although an indebtedness is an obligation, an obligation is not necessarily an 'indebtedness' within the meaning of  23(b). Nor are all carrying charges 'interest'. In Old Colony Railroad Co. v. Commissioner, \n284 \nU.S. 552\n, 52 S.Ct. 211, this Court had before it the meaning of the word 'interest' as used in the comparable provision of the 1921 Act, 42 Stat. 227. It said, 284 U.S. at page 560, 52 S.Ct. at page 214, '... as respects 'interest,' the usual import of the term is the amount which one has contracted to pay for the use of borrowed money.' \n\n[308 \nU.S. 488, 498]\n\u00a0\n It there rejected the contention that it meant 'effective interest' within the theory of accounting or that 'Congress used the word having in mind any concept other than the usual, ordinary, and everyday meaning of the term.' 284 U.S. at page 561, 52 S.Ct. at page 214. It refused to assume that the Congress used the term with reference to 'some esoteric concept derived from subtle and theoretic analysis.' 284 U.S. at page 561, 52 S.Ct. at page 214.\n We likewise refuse to make that assumption here. It is not enough, as urged by respondent, that 'interest' or 'indebtedness' in their original classical context may have permitted this broader meaning. \n10\n We are dealing with the context of a revenue act and words which have today a well-known meaning. In the business world 'interest on indebtedness' means compensation for the use or forbearance of money. \n11\n In absence of clear evidence to the contrary, we assume that Congress has used these words in that sense. In sum, we cannot sacrifice the 'plain, obvious and rational meaning' of the statute even for 'the exigency of a hard case.' See Lynch v. Alworth-Stephens Co., \n267 \nU.S. 364, 370\n, 45 S.Ct. 274, 276.\n Petitioners throughout have referred to these payments by respondent as being capital in nature. Cf. Bonwit Teller & Co. v. Commissioner, 2 Cir ., 53 F.2d 381, 82 A.L.R. 325; Hutton v. Commissioner, 5 Cir., 39 F.2d 459; Bing v. Helvering, 2 Cir., 76 F.2d 941. What appropriate treatment may be accorded \n\n[308 \nU.S. 488, 499]\n\u00a0\n these items of cost under other provisions of the Act we do not undertake to say, as that issue is not here.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and that of the District Court is affirmed. It is so ordered.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER (concurring).\n What the activities of a tax payer are is an issue for determination by triers of fact. Whether such activities constitute a 'trade or business' as conceived by  23(a) of the Revenue Act of 1928, 45 Stat. 791, 799, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  23(a), is open for determination here unfettered by findings and rulings below except for the weight of the intrinsic authority of all lower court opinions. To avail of the deductions allowed by  23(a), it is not enough to incur expenses in the active concern over one's own financial interest. '... carrying on any trade or business', within the contemplation of  23(a), involves holding one's self out to others as engaged in the selling of goods or services. This the taxpayer did not do. Expenses for transactions not connected with trade or business, such as an expense for handling personal investments, are not deductible. It is otherwise with losses.  23(e)(2). Without elaborating the reasons for this construction and not unmindful of opposing considerations, including appropriate regard for administrative practice, I prefer to make the conclusion explicit instead of making the hypothetical, litigation-breeding assumption that this tax payer's activities, for which expenses were sought to be deducted, did constitute a 'trade or business'.\n Mr. Justice REED joins in these views.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS (dissenting).\n I feel constrained to state my views, not because this case raises any important issue of law which should be \n\n[308 \nU.S. 488, 500]\n\u00a0\n settled by this court; but, on the contrary, because I think it presents a question the answer to which depends solely upon the facts disclosed by the record. Decision of the controversy cannot be helpful in the administration of the Revenue Acts or set any important precedent. I think the writ should not have been granted and that it now should be dismissed as improvidently granted. The amount of taxes involved or the insistence of the Government that the court below erred in its application of the law to the facts are not adequate reasons for review. There is no dispute as to principle and no conflict with any case in the application of any principle.\n The function of this court is to resolve conflicts of decision and to settle important principles of law. The discretionary power of this court to review judgments of lower federal courts was not intended to be exercised in every case where those courts have adjudicated the conflicting claims of the parties, which involves no important principle of law and no conflict of decision amongst the federal courts. Our rules adopted to carry out the policy of the statutes granting the power to bring cases here by certiorari have apprised the Bar and the public that we will not take cases fully heard and adjudicated below for the mere purpose of reexamining the correctness of the result. See Rule 38, par. 5, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 354.\n The dominant purpose evidenced by the income tax statutes is to tax net income. The policy is to credit against gross income the expenses of the business which begets earnings. The taxpayer is entitled to deduct that which he reasonably and in good faith expended in the effort to realize a profit. The revenue acts have always characterized deductible expenses as the ordinary and necessary expenses of the business, incurred and paid during the taxable year. The opinion assumes that the expenditure here in question was necessary in the conduct of the taxpayer's business but holds that it was not an \n\n[308 \nU.S. 488, 501]\n\u00a0\n ordinary expense of that business. Obviously what is an ordinary expense of a given business must depend upon the nature and scope of the business, the nature and occasion of the expenditure, and other considerations which will emerge in each specific case. Necessarily the decision of one case will have slight, if any, bearing upon the proper decision of another. If this court is to take under review every dispute in which the Government and a taxpayer differ as to whether a given expenditure is an ordinary or an extraordinary expense of the taxpayer's business we shall be involved in the decision of myriad cases, each turning upon its own facts, without furnishing any light to the taxpayers for their future guidance. I think this is the result of the court's opinion. It is admitted that the fact that the expenditure occurred but once in the taxpayer's experience does not render it extraordinary. It must be admitted that the fact that it is a large transaction does not render it extraordinary. What the opinion does, in the upshot, is to canvass all the circumstances and reach, as I think, a conclusion based solely upon the peculiar facts of this single case. We have repeatedly warned the Bar and the public that this we will not do because we do not sit for any such purpose.\n An added reason for refusing to decide the case is the admission that the Treasury and the Board of Tax Appeals in years past have held a similar expense incurred in earlier years an expense of the taxpayer's business. In a matter resting so much in judgment and discretion as the determination of what is ordinary and what extraordinary expenditure in a business the weight of a continued administrative construction is of peculiar importance; and we ought not now depart from the rule long observed that such practice is entitled to high consideration at the hands of the courts and should not be overturned unless clearly wrong and for the most cogent reasons. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 488, 502]\n\u00a0\n Since the case has been taken and considered on the merits I think the judgment below should be affirmed. I need add little to the opinion of Judge Maris of the Circuit Court of Appeals, 3 Cir., 103 F.2d 257, with which I agree. The taxpayer borrowed stock in order to sell it for cash to others. His contract obligated him either to return the stock or to pay the carrying charges to the lender. What he paid was not technically interest but it was an expense necessary to his obtaining and using the stock. He had several alternatives: to pay the annual carrying charges, or to default, and, in that case, to go into the market to buy the stock and return it to the lender or to pay the lender the value thereof.\n What was there extraordinary about this transaction as compared with the borrowing of any commodity other than stock for a business reason and with a business purpose? In the conduct of every business situations arise which must be met. The circumstance that such a situation had not theretofore arisen, or that the transaction was the first of its kind in the respondent's business experience, does not render it extraordinary in the sense in which the statute uses the term. The limitation placed by Congress upon the types of expenditures made deductible was intended to prevent evasion of payment of tax on true net income, which confessedly was not a motive in the present instance. I think that under the guise of enforcing the plain mandate of the statute the court is really reading into the law what is not there and what Congress did not intend to place there.\n To suggest, even by indirection, that perchance the taxpayer's expenditure may be treated as a capital expenditure is, in my judgment, to keep the word of promise to the ear and break it to the hope. In my view the carrying charge of the taxpayer's loan was either an ordinary expense of his business or it was nothing of consequence under any provision of the statute.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS joins in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] As stated by the District Court, counsel advised that the du Pont Company could issue stock only for money paid, labor performed, or real or personal property acquired; and that if the stock were to be issued for cash, it must first be offered to existing stockholders. According to the findings the du Pont Company did not have 9,000 shares of its stock, other that unissued stock; that stock was not then listed on the New York Stock Exchange; and the over-the-counter market was quite inactive. Nine thousand shares could not have been purchased on this market without substantially raising the price per share. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Respondent had available only 74 shares. He had a reversionary interest in two trusts which held 24,000 shares. And he was the owner of 29,125 shares of common stock of Christiana Securities Company out of a total of 75,000 shares issued and outstanding. That company was then the owner of 183,000 shares of common stock of the du Pont Company out of a total of 588,542 shares issued and outstanding. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Supra, note 2. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] As security respondent gave Christiana Securities Company 3,800 shares of its capital stock. All dividends on that stock were to be paid to respondent. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] These sales were made at the price of $320 a share, that being approximately their book value. The du Pont Company loaned to each of the nine executives the necessary funds to purchase his 1,000 shares. They paid respondent.$2,880,000 in cash for the 9,000 shares. According to respondent's brief, he turned over this sum through transactions in General Motors stock which ultimately yielded him a great profit. See du Pont v. Commissioner, 37 B.T.A. 1198.\n By March 1921, the stock of the du Pont Company had declined in value and the bargain made by the executives had become a disadvantageous one. Respondent thereupon offered to turn over 400 shares of the Christiana Securities Company (of a net value of $160,000) to be held by the du Pont Company as additional collateral on the loan made to these executives, respondent to have the right to redeem those 400 shares by payment of $160, 000 on maturity of the loan, that payment, if made, to be applied to the loan. If respondent failed to redeem those shares, they were to become the property of the executives on payment of their loans. Meanwhile dividends on the 400 shares up to $8,000 per annum were to go to the executives, the balance to respondent who was, however, to return his portion to the executives if he did not redeem the stock. This offer was accepted by the executives. Respondent when he proposed it, stated that he did so 'as a large stockholder, and perhaps, the one to be most benefited by the recovery in value of the Company's shares.' He also stated that he wanted the executives to be 'free of worry over the unexpected outcome' of the stock purchase plan. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Due to stock dividends and split-ups respondent was obligated to return to Christiana Securities Company 142,212 shares to replace the 9, 000 shares which he had borrowed. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] Respondent was not a stockholder of the Delaware Company, although it appears that his brother was one of its executive officers. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] 22 F.Supp. 589, 597. \n[\nFootnote 9\n] Dart v.

Benjamin Wham and Walter A. Wade, both of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n Mr. Julian H. Levi, of Chicago, Ill., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A plan of reorganization of petitioner under  77B of the Bankruptcy Act, 48 Stat. 912, 11 U.S.C.A.  207, was confirmed on Feb- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 382, 383]\n\u00a0\n ruary 23, 1938. Respondents are members of a bondholders' committee who sought an allowance in those proceedings. On October 26, 1938, they were awarded $2,000 for services rendered, $20,000 having been asked. On November 25, 1938, they petitioned the Circuit Court of Appeals for leave to appeal from that order. The appeal was allowed. Petitioner moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction to allow it, the argument being that respondent had an appeal as of right which could only be taken by filing a notice of appeal in the District Court. The Circuit Court of Appeals denied petitioner's motion to dismiss and modified the order by increasing the allowance to $10,000. In re Albert Dickinson Co., 7 Cir., 104 F.2d 771. We granted certiorari, \n308 \nU.S. 543\n, 60 S.Ct. 139, 84 L.Ed. --, because of a conflict of that ruling with London v. O'Dougherty, 2 Cir., 102 F.2d 524, which held that appeals from compensation orders involving $500 or more could be had as a matter of right under the Chandler Act, 52 Stat. 840, 11 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq.\n First. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the provisions of the Chandler Act, which became effective on September 22, 1938 ( 7, 11 U.S.C. A.  1 note), were applicable to this appeal. We think that follows from  6, sub. b of the Act, 11 U.S.C.A.  1 note, which states that 'Except as otherwise provided in this amendatory Act, the provisions of this amendatory Act shall govern proceedings so far as practicable in cases pending when it takes effect; ....' Where, as here, appeal is taken after the effective date of the act, it is clearly 'practicable' to apply the new appeal provisions. Contrary to respondents' contention,  276, sub. c(2), 11 U.S.C.A.  676, sub. c(2), is not applicable to appeals. It provides that the provisions of Ch. X (the successor to  77B) shall apply to pending proceedings 'to the extent that the judge shall deem their application practicable' where the petition in such proceedings was approved more than three months before the effective date of the amendatory act. But that relates solely to proceedings in the district court. The \n\n[309 \nU.S. 382, 384]\n\u00a0\n 'judge' referred to in that section means a 'judge of a court of bankruptcy'. Section 1(20), 11 U.S.C.A.  1(20). Such court does not include the Circuit Court of Appeals. Section 1(10). Hence the application of the new appeal provisions to this type of case is not dependent on a determination of practicability by the district judge under  276, sub. c( 2).\n Second. Petitioner's argument that the appeal in this case could be taken as a matter of right requires an analysis of  24 and  250 of the Chandler Act, 11 U.S.C.A.  47, 650. Sec. 24 provides in part:\n'a. The Circuit Courts of Appeals of the United States and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, in vacation, in chambers, and during their respective terms, as now or as they may be hereafter held, are hereby invested with appellate jurisdiction from the several courts of bankruptcy in their respective jurisdictions in proceedings in bankruptcy, either interlocutory or final, and in controversies arising in proceedings in bankruptcy, to review, affirm, revise, or reverse, both in matters of law and in matters of fact: Provided, however, That the jurisdiction upon appeal from a judgment on a verdict rendered by a jury, shall extend to matters of law only: Provided further, That when any order, decree, or judgment involves less than $500, an appeal therefrom may be taken only upon allowance of the appellate court.\n\n'b. Such appellate jurisdiction shall be exercised by appeal and in the form and manner of an appeal.'\n\n Sec. 250 provides:\n'Appeals may be taken in matters of law or fact from orders making or refusing to make allowances of compensation or reimbursement, and may, in the manner and within the time provided for appeals by this Act (title,), be taken to and allowed by the circuit court of appeals independently of other appeals in the proceeding, and shall be summarily heard upon the original papers.' \n\n[309 \nU.S. 382, 385]\n\u00a0\n Petitioner contends that Congress by  24 created a single test-the amount of the order appealed from-for determining whether leave to appeal was necessary and that the words 'allowed by' in  250 refer to appeals from orders of allowances of less than $500.\n\n Our view, however, is that appeals from all orders making or refusing to make allowances of compensation or reimbursement under Ch. X of the Chandler Act may be had only at the discretion of the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n Under  77B, sub. c(9) it was provided that 'appeals from orders fixing such allowances may be taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals independently of other appeals in the proceeding and shall be heard summarily.' And it was held by this Court in Shulman v. Wilson-Sheridan Hotel Co., \n301 \nU.S. 172\n, 57 S.Ct. 680, that those appeals could not be had as a matter of right but only in the discretion of the appellate court as provided in former  24, sub. b. That was the way the matter stood when  250 was drafted. The history of that section1 shows that it was derived from  77B, sub. c(9). But, significantly, the words 'and allowed by' were added-words not present in  77B, sub. c(9). The result plainly was (1) to carry over into the new act the rule of Shulman v. Wilson-Sheridan Hotel Co., supra, and (2) to set apart in a separate section the provisions for appeals from that type of order so as to make those appeals no longer dependent on  24, which had become a storm center for the revisionists. \n2\n If the House did not intend the latter result, then the addition of the words 'and allowed by' were wholly needless, as under the House revision of  24 appeals from compensa- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 382, 386]\n\u00a0\n tion orders would have been discretionary with the appellate court. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[309 \nU.S. 382, 387]\n\u00a0\n Hence under the House Bill as it reached the Senate, it seems clear that no such appeals could be had as a matter of right. In the Senate the present  24 was substituted for the House provision; but the present  250 was not altered in any respect material here. It is clear from the Senate hearings and Committee Report that the Senate was interested only in the elimination from  24 of the old distinctions between 'controversies arising in bankruptcy proceedings' and 'proceedings' in bankruptcy. \n4\n There was not the slightest intimation of any \n\n[309 \nU.S. 382, 388]\n\u00a0\n dissatisfaction with the rule of Shulman v. Wilson-Sheridan Hotel Co., supra, or with  250 as it passed the House. To be sure, the Senate Committee Report is somewhat ambiguous. \n5\n But it is perhaps significant that that report in commenting on  24 stated not that it 'abolished' but that it 'practically abolished' the distinction between appeals as of right and appeals by leave of the appellate courts.\n More important, however, is the matter of statutory construction. To hold that an appeal from a compensation order is governed by  24 the words 'taken to and allowed by' in  250 must be read 'taken to or allowed by'. Only then can appeals from compensation orders involving less than $ 500 be governed by 'allowed by' and appeals from all other such orders be governed by 'taken to'. In the face of the foregoing history we do not believe we are justified in substituting 'or' for 'and'. The inappropriateness of it is somewhat emphasized by the history of 'taken to' which in Shulman v. Wilson-Sheridan Hotel Co., supra, was held not to permit an appeal as of right. It is further emphasized by considerations of policy.\n The history of fees in corporate reorganizations contains many sordid chapters. One of the purposes of  77B was to place those fees under more effective control. \n6\n Buttressing that control was  77B, sub. c(9) which, together with former  24, sub. b, made appeals from compensation orders discretionary with the appellate court. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 382, 389]\n\u00a0\n We should not depart from that policy in absence of a clear expression from Congress of its desire for a change. Fee claimants are either officers of the court or fiduciaries,7 such as members of committees, whose claims for allowance from the estate are based only on service rendered to and benefits received by the estate. \n8\n Allowance or disallowance involves an exercise of sound discretion by the court based on that statutory standard. Unlike appeals from other orders, appeals from compensation orders therefore normally involve only one question of law- abuse of discretion. These factors not only emphasize the appropriateness of the separate treatment by Congress of appeals from compensation orders; they reinforce the interpretation of  250 which restricts these appeals. For certainly it seems sound policy to require fiduciaries to make out a prima facie case of inequitable treatment in order to be heard before the appellate court. To allow these appeals as a matter of right is to encourage an unseemly parade to the appellate courts and to add to the time and expense of administration. We will not resolve any ambiguities in favor of that alternative.\n Whether or not the Circuit Court of Appeals erred in modifying the order so as to grant respondents an increased allowance was not raised in the petition for certiorari and hence has not been considered here.

The Circuit Courts of Appeals of the United States and the United States Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, in vacation, in chambers, and during their respective terms, as now or as they may be hereafter held, are hereby invested with appellate jurisdiction from the several courts of bankruptcy in their respective jurisdictions (1) of controversies arising in the course of proceedings under this Act in the same manner and to the same extent as in suits at law or in equity; (2) to superintend and revise, in matter of law and fact, the proceedings of such inferior courts of bankruptcy in the following cases: (a) A judgment adjudging or refusing to adjudge a person a bankrupt; (b) a judgment approving or dismissing a petition filed by or against a debtor under chapter X of this Act; (c) a judgment granting or denying a discharge; (b) a judgment confirming or refusing to confirm an arrangement or plan; (e) a judgment allowing or rejecting a debt, claim, or interest of $500 or over; and (f) a judgment allowing or dismissing an application for an order upon a bankrupt or other person to deliver or turn over property to the marshal, or to the receiver or trustee of the estate; and (3) to superintend and revise, in matter of law only, the proceedings in all other cases of such inferior courts of bankruptcy.\n\n'b.

The amendment presented by the committee practically abolishes this distinction. Under it, appeals may be made as of right in all cases involving $500 or more. In controversies of less than this amount, appeals may be taken only upon allowance by the appellate court. The jurisdiction of the appellate court will extend both to matters of law and of fact, except that in an appeal from a judgment on a verdict rendered by a jury the jurisdiction will extend to matters of law only. The removal of the troublesome distinction will be a service to both bench and bar. It is often difficult to determine the proper procedure under the present law and frequently appeals are taken in both ways in order to be certain. The House bill seeks to remedy this condition by providing that in the event of mistake the appellate court may consider the appeal as properly taken and proceed to a determination of the case. Your committee believes it is much better to eliminate the distinction altogether.'\n The testimony of Reuben G. Hunt before the Senate Committee is particularly illuminating on this point of controversy. S. Hearings, supra, note 2, pp. 53 et seq.

LAKE VALLEY CO.(1940)\nNo. 20\nArgued: Decided: November 18, 1940\n\n\n\n\n[311 \nU.S. 91, 92]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Abraham W. Brussell, of Chicago, Ill., for petitioners.\n Mr. Arthur R. Seelig, of Chicago, Ill., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This proceeding presents two questions: First, Does there here exist a 'labor dispute' within the meaning of the Norris-LaGuardia Act?1 Second, If there is a 'labor dispute', must the jurisdictional prerequisites of the Norris-LaGuardia Act2 be complied with before injunc- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 91, 93]\n\u00a0\n tive process can be used against labor union accused of violating the Sherman Anti-Trust Act?3\n The District Court found that this was a case 'involving or growing out of a labor dispute'; that plaintiffs (respondents here) had failed to satisfy the prerequisites of the Norris-LaGuardia Act; and that, accordingly, the court was without jurisdiction to grant either a temporary or a permanent injunction. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, one judge dissenting;4 it was the opinion of that court that the case did not grow out of a labor dispute, and that even if it had, a federal court would have jurisdiction to enjoin if the Sherman Act had been violated. \n5\n Because of the importance of these questions, we granted certiorari. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The Norris-LaGuardia Act applies to labor disputes between 'persons who are engaged in the same industry, trade, craft or occupation; or have direct or indirect interests therein.' \n7\n Here, all of the parties have 'direct or indirect interests' in the production, processing, sale, and distribution of milk. Plaintiffs, who sought the injunction, were four: one was the Chicago local of a C.I.O. union, the Amalgamated Dairy Workers; two were Chicago dairies whose milk was processed and distributed by members of the C.I.O. union;8 the fourth was a \n\n[311 \nU.S. 91, 94]\n\u00a0\n Wisconsin cooperative association which supplied milk to the plaintiff dairies. Defendants were the Chicago local of the A.F. of L. Milk Wagon Drivers' Union, and its officials. The defendant union is a craft organization, limiting its membership to milk wagon drivers; the plaintiff union is organized along industrial lines, and its membership consists of all kinds of dairy workers, including inside help, office workers, wagon drivers, helpers, sweepers and janitors.\n A brief statement as to the background of the controversy is necessary for a better understanding of the issues. The Chicago local of the A.F. of L. Milk Wagon Drivers' Union was organized in 1902. Since the organization, working conditions of the members have been materially improved; hours have been shortened, wages have been raised, and vacation periods with full pay have been secured. These better terms and conditions of employment have moved concurrently with a more or less steady increase in union membership and influence. At the time this litigation was begun the union had more than five thousand members.\n With the approach and continuance of the depression of the early Thirties, the milk business, like other industries, was in acute distress. Loss of profits from decreased demand stimulated dairies to devise new and cheaper methods to obtain and serve customers. Under the long existing practice in Chicago, dairies had owned milk trucks and wagons, and had operated them with employee drivers-chiefly members of the A.F. of L. local. A major part of the business consisted of door-to-door deliveries to retail customers. Some of the A.F. of L. drivers also delivered milk to retail stores, those stores in turn selling to their customers. What appears to have been an insignificant part of the milk supply of pre- depression Chicago was delivered by retail milk 'peddlers' who bought from the dairy at wholesale and sold at retail from their own trucks or wagons. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 91, 95]\n\u00a0\n But with the depression this practice of sale by 'peddlers' expanded, branched out into sales to retail stores, and developed into what is called the 'vendor system'-around which revolves the present controversy. Retail peddling started the controversy; at the root of the conflict, however, is this later emerging 'vendor system', under which 'vendors' delivered milk at wholesale to retail stores. Under this system, plaintiff dairies make daily sales of milk to individuals owning their own trucks. These individuals, called 'vendors', resell the milk to retail stores. Unsold milk is no loss to the 'vendor', because the dairy takes it back at the full purchase price.\n With the spread of this new competitive system, the business of the dairies employing union milk wagon drivers decreased. Many of the union drivers lost their jobs and were dependent upon their union's relief funds and upon public relief agencies for their support. How many of those who lost their jobs became unemployed as the result of the depression and how many were displaced by the growth of the 'vendor system' cannot be determined; both causes undoubtedly contributed.\n The stores buying milk from plaintiff dairies through these vendors made a practice of selling it below the standard prices charged for milk supplied by dairies employing A.F. of L. drivers. Defendant union and its members claimed that the reason the price could be cut was that the vendors worked long hours, under unfavorable working conditions, without vacations, and with very low earnings. On the other hand, the vendors and the dairies utilizing their services asserted that the reason for the lower prices was that the vendor system was more economical, that under it more milk could be delivered by wholesale to the cash and carry cut-rate stores, and that such distribution cost less even on the same wage level than did door-to-door distribution. As the vendor system made increasing inroads on the business of the union dairies, the opposition of the defendant union became \n\n[311 \nU.S. 91, 96]\n\u00a0\n more active. Its members insisted that the vendor system constituted unfair competition, depressing labor standards. To combat it, they attempted-as the District Court found from the facts-to unionize the employees and vendors of the dairies utilizing this plan. Not succeeding in this attempt, in 1934 they began picketing the so- called cut-rate stores. The picketing was carried on almost continuously until this suit was filed. Pickets usually carried placards denouncing cut-rate stores as unfair to the A.F. of L. local. During the years in which this strife continued, store windows were broken, personal altercations occurred, charges and countercharges were frequent, arrests were made and court proceedings instituted. Finally, in March, 1938-about two months before the complaint was filed in this case-the vendors and the other employees of the plaintiff dairies organized the plaintiff union under a C.I.O. charter. Thereupon signs were placed inside the cut-rate store windows, announcing that the milk handled by the stores was processed and delivered by members of the plaintiff union. But this did not settle the long- standing controversy; the picketing continued, and this suit followed.\n The petition for an injunction rests primarily upon the charge that the defendant union and its officials had entered into a conspiracy to interfere with and restrain interstate commerce in violation of the Sherman and Clayton Acts. It is contended by plaintiffs that the controversy is not a labor dispute within the meaning of the Norris- LaGuardia Act, but is an unlawful secondary boycott of which the purpose is not to unionize the vendors but to obtain for the defendants' employers a Chicago milk monopoly at a sustained high price level, contrary to the Sherman Act.\n First. The complaint on its face is probably sufficient to show that a labor dispute existed. \n9\n We need not decide \n\n[311 \nU.S. 91, 97]\n\u00a0\n that point, however, for the case proceeded to final judgment. Defendants filed an answer, and the court referred plaintiffs' motion for a temporary injunction to a special master. The master conducted extensive hearings, and heard evidence offered by both sides. In his report, the master found, in the language of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, that the case arose out of and involved a labor 'dispute between one or more employers or associations of employers and one or more employees or associations of employees', all of whom were engaged in the same industry, trade, craft or occupation, namely, the milk industry; that defendants had attempted for some time to unionize the employees of the plaintiff dairies and of other cut-rate dairies, and that the picketing was an effort on the part of the defendant to compel the vendors and wagon drivers of the dairies to join the defendant union for the purpose of improving working conditions and wages of vendors; that the working hours of the plaintiff dairies' employees were longer and the wage scales lower than the union standards. 10 The District Court adopted the findings of the master, and made further findings of its own. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 91, 98]\n\u00a0\n It is not material, as the Circuit Court of Appeals thought, that defendants' attempt to unionize the vendors was upon the condition that they would cease to handle milk as 'vendors' if admitted to membership in the union. There are few instances of attempted unionization in which a change to union membership would not require some alteration in the conditions or terms of employment. Union membership contemplates change- change which it is believed will bring about better working conditions for the employees. Moreover, the evidence offered by the plaintiffs themselves shows that membership in defendant union would have involved no substantial change in the vendors' relationship to the dairies. Truck drivers employed by dairies were eligible for membership in the defendant union, and plaintiffs' evidence showed that the 'vendors' were actually regarded as employees of the plaintiff dairies. The plaintiffs offered as a part of their evidence the articles of agreement between the plaintiff union and the plaintiff dairies; each of those contracts contains the following provision: 'The term 'employee', as used in this Agreement shall mean all wholesale and retail route salesmen or drivers and their helpers and assistants; and milk distributors commonly referred to as 'Vendors'; all persons employed in the sale and distribution of the Company's products; ....' And each agreement provided for a closed shop and gave to plaintiff union the exclusive right to represent all the dairy's employees, including the vendors, for purposes of negotiating on 'all questions of wages, hours, and conditions of employment that shall prevail in the Company's business.' \n11\n\u00a0\n\n Whether rightly or wrongly, the defendant union believed that the 'vendor system' was a scheme or device \n\n[311 \nU.S. 91, 99]\n\u00a0\n utilized for the purpose of escaping the payment of union wages and the assumption of working conditions commensurate with those imposed under union standards. To say, as the Circuit Court of Appeals did, that the conflict here is not a good faith labor issue, and that therefore there is no 'labor dispute', is to ignore the statutory definition of the term; to say, further, that the conditioned abandonment of the vendor system, under the circumstances, was an issue unrelated to labor's efforts to improve working conditions, is to shut one's eyes to the everyday elements of industrial strife.\n Nor does the controversy cease to be a labor dispute, as the Circuit Court of Appeals thought, because the plaintiff dairies' employees became organized. 12 This merely transformed the defendants' activities from an effort to organize non-union men to a conflict which included a controversy between two unions. A controversy 'concerning the association or representation of persons in negotiating, fixing, maintaining, changing, or \n\n[311 \nU.S. 91, 100]\n\u00a0\n seeking to arrange terms or conditions of employment' is expressly included within the definition of a labor dispute in the Norris-LaGuardia Act.\n The District Court not only found that a labor dispute existed, but also found that it was without jurisdiction to grant an injunction because the requirements of the Norris-LaGuardia Act had not been met. We do not understand that the Circuit Court of Appeals overturned this finding. That court said (108 F.2d 443): 'Again, if jurisdiction were conceded and there was a labor dispute involved, then it is quite doubtful if appellants could recover because they have not in every respect complied with the requirements of the Norris-LaGuardia Act.' We agree with the District Court that this case grows out of a labor dispute. Since the requirements of the Norris-LaGuardia Act have not been met, the court did not have jurisdiction to grant an injunction unless by virtue of that phase of the bill which charged a violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.\n Second. The Court of Appeals concluded that the defendants' picketing activities constituted a secondary boycott in violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, and that for this reason regardless of the Norris- LaGuardia Act, the District Court had jurisdiction to grant an injunction even though the case arose out of or involved a labor dispute. \n13\n In this the Court was in error.\n No specific language of the Norris-LaGuardia Act is pointed to in support of the theory that the act was to be inapplicable where injunctions are sought against labor unions charged with violating the Sherman Act in \n\n[311 \nU.S. 91, 101]\n\u00a0\n the course of labor disputes. On the contrary, section 1 of the Norris- LaGuardia Act provides that 'No court of the United States ... shall have jurisdiction to issue any restraining order or temporary or permanent injunction in a case involving or growing out of a labor dispute, except in a strict conformity with the provisions of this Act (chapter).' This unequivocal jurisdictional limitation is reiterated in other sections of the act. The Norris-LaGuardia Act-considered as a whole and in its various parts-was intended drastically to curtail the equity jurisdiction of federal courts in the field of labor disputes. And this court has said that 'the legislative history of the act demonstrates that it was the purpose of the Congress further to extend the prohibitions of the Clayton Act respecting the exercise of jurisdiction by federal courts and to obviate the results of the judicial construction of that act.' \n14\n\u00a0\n\n The committee reports on the Norris-LaGuardia Act reveal that many of the injunctions which were considered most objectionable by the Congress were based upon complaints charging conspiracies to violate the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. To end the granting of injunctions of this type, section 5 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act deprived federal courts of jurisdiction to issue restraining orders or injunctions 'upon the ground that any of the persons participating or interested in a labor dispute constitute or are engaged in an unlawful combination or conspiracy because of the doing in concert of the acts enumerated ....' In reporting the bill, the House Judiciary Committee said: 'This section is included principally because many of the objectionable injunctions have been issued under the provisions of the anti-trust laws, a necessary prerequisite for invoking the jurisdiction of which is a finding of the existence of a conspiracy or combination and without which no injunction could have been issued.' \n15\n\u00a0\n\n[311 \nU.S. 91, 102]\n\u00a0\n The Norris-LaGuardia Act passed in 1932, is the culmination of a bitter political, social and economic controversy extending over half a century. Hostility to 'government by injunction' had become the rallying slogan of many and varied groups. Indeed, as early as 1914 Congress had responded to a widespread public demand that the Sherman Act be amended, and had passed the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 730, itself designed to limit the jurisdiction of federal courts to issue injunctions in cases involving labor disputes. But the proponents of the Norris-LaGuardia Act felt that the jurisdictional limitations of the Clayton Act had been largely nullified by judicial decision. Thus, the Senate Judiciary Committee, reporting the Norris-LaGuardia Act, said: 'That there have been abuses of judicial power in granting injunctions in labor disputes is hardly open to discussion. The use of the injunction in such disputes has been growing by leaps and bounds. ... For example, approximately 300 were issued in connection with the railway shopmen's strike of 1922, ....'16 And on the same subject the House Judiciary Committee said: 'These are the same character of acts which Congress in section 20 of the Clayton Act of October 15, 1914, 29 U.S.C.A.  52, sought to restrict from the operation of injunctions, but because of the interpretations placed by the courts on this section of the Clayton Act, the restrictions as contained therein have become more or less valueless to labor, and this section is intended by more specific language to overcome the qualifying effects of the decisions of the courts in this respect.' \n17\n As an example of the judicial interpretation of the Clayton Act which the Committee said was 'responsible in part for this agitation for further legislation,' the Committee referred to the cases of Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, \n254 \nU.S. 443\n, 41 S.Ct. 172, 16 A.L.R. 196, American Steel Foundries v. Tri-City Central Trades Council, 257 \n\n[311 \nU.S. 91, 103]\n\u00a0\n U.S. 184, 42 S.Ct. 72, 27 A.L.R. 360, and Bedford Cut Stone Co. v. Journeyman Stone Cutters' Association, \n274 \nU.S. 37\n, 47 S.Ct. 522, 54 A.L.R. 791. In these cases, the jurisdiction of the courts to grant injunctions had been upheld upon allegations and findings that the Sherman Anti-Trust Act had been violated.\n Whether or not one agrees with the committees that the cited cases constituted an unduly restricted interpretation of the Clayton Act, one must agree that the committees and the Congress made abundantly clear their intention that what they regarded as the misinterpretation of the Clayton Act should not be repeated in the construction of the Norris- LaGuardia Act. For us to hold, in the face of this legislation, that the federal courts have jurisdiction to grant injunctions in cases growing out of labor disputes, merely because alleged violations of the Sherman Act are involved, would run counter to the plain mandate of the act and would reverse the declared purpose of Congress. 18 The Circuit Court of Appeals was in error; its judgment is reversed and the judgment of the District Court dismissing the bill for injunction is affirmed. It is so ordered.\n Judgment of Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 29 U.S.C.  101-115, 47 Stat. 70, 29 U.S.C.A.  101-115.

Undoubtedly, the master failed to use apt language in expressing his conclusions. But the language used, read in its context and in conjunction with the entire record, reveals that the objections to the finding are without foundation. What the master said in his report was: 'The Master is of the opinion that the dispute involved in the instant case brings it within the provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act .... The testimony of defendants' witnesses is to the effect that they have attempted for some time to unionize the employees of the Plaintiff Dairies and other cut-rate Dairies; that the picketing complained of herein is an effort to compel the vendors, and wagon drivers employed by the Plaintiff Dairies to join the defendant union for the purpose of improving working conditions and wages of said vendors and employees of the Plaintiff Dairies, and that the working hours and wage scale of Plaintiff Dairy's employees is lower than the union scale.' \n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] On the subject of the actual status of the vendors, the president of one of the plaintiff dairies testified as follows:\n'The Witness (Sigfried Weiss, president of the Lake Valley dairy): He wants to know if they are employed by the dairy?\n\n'Mr. Riskind (attorney for defendants) Yes, that is all I want to know.\n\n'A. Now that is not so easy to say, if they are employed or not. We have contracts, and they are bound to our dairy. They are actually employed by our dairy, but we have the vendor system, where they own their own trucks and they pay their own expenses and they buy milk at a certain price at our dairy. In one way they are employees, and in another way, we don't pay wages. We have to pay whatever they can make over a certain price. We charge them a certain price.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] 'Under these conditions we think it cannot be fairly said that there is a good faith labor issue involved between the defendant union and either the dairies' employees or the 'vendors' or the stores. Especially is this true when we consider the fact that the 'vendors' are organized as members of a well-recognized union, which with their consent is acting as their representative in matters dealing with their employers.' 108 F.2d at page 442. \n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] The Court said: 'Moreover, we think it is clear from the findings and from the undisputed evidence in this case that the appellees' picketing activities constitute a secondary boycott, which is an unlawful activity, of which appellees could not avail themselves even though a labor dispute were involved.

UNITED STATES(1940)\nNo. 536\nArgued: Decided: March 25, 1940\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York.\n\n\n[309 \nU.S. 436, 438]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Dean G. Acheson, of Washington, D.C., for appellants.\n\n\n\n[309 \nU.S. 436, 442]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Thurman W. Arnold, Asst. Atty. Gen., for appellee.\n\n\n\n[309 \nU.S. 436, 445]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Government brought this suit in the District Court for Southern New York, to restrain appellant Ethyl Gasoline Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and the other appellants, who are its officers, from granting licenses, under patents controlled by it, to jobbers to sell and distribute lead-treated motor fuel, and from enforcing \n\n[309 \nU.S. 436, 446]\n\u00a0\n provisions in licenses to oil refiners which restrict their sale of the motor fuel to the licensed jobbers, as violations of the Sherman Anti- Trust Act. 26 Stat. 209, 15 U.S.C.  1, as amended August 17, 1937, 50 Stat. 693, 15 U.S.C.A.  1. The trial court granted the relief sought and from its decision in favor of the Government the case comes here on direct appeal under the provisions of  2 of the Expediting Act of February 11, 1903, as amended 36 Stat. 1167, 15 U.S.C.  29, 15 U.S.C.A.  29;  238 of the Judicial Code, as amended 43 Stat. 938, 28 U.S.C.  345, 28 U.S.C.A.  345.\n The case was tried on an agreed statement of facts which was incorporated in the findings of the trial court and, except as noted, there is no dispute as to the facts. The appellant corporation is engaged in the manufacture and sale of a patented fluid compound containing tetraethyl lead, a poisonous substance, which, when added to gasoline used as a motor fuel, increases the efficiency of high pressure combustion engines in which the fuel is consumed. The Ethyl Corporation owns two patents covering the composition of the fluid, No. 1,592,954 of July 20, 1926, and No. 1,668,022 of May 1, 1928. It has a third patent, No. 1,573, 846 of February 23, 1926, claiming a motor fuel produced by mixing gasoline with the patent fluid compound, which is claimed also by the two patents first mentioned. It also has a patent, No. 1,787,419, of December 30, 1930, claiming a method of using fuel containing the patented fluid in combustion motors. The corporation manufactures and sells the patented fluid to oil refiners, solely for use in the production of the improved type of motor fuel. It issues licenses under its patents to refiners and to jobbers of motor fuel on terms and conditions presently to be noted, but it does not charge or receive any royalty for its licenses. It derives its profit solely from the sale of the patented ethyl fluid to its refiner licensees. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 436, 447]\n\u00a0\n The Licensing Agreements.\n Appellant grants licenses under its patents to most of the large oil refining companies in the United States, to manufacture, sell and distribute motor fuel containing the patented fluid. The licenses provide that appellant will sell to the licensees their requirements of the patented fluid. They prohibit the licensees from selling the manufactured product to any except to other licensed refiners, to jobbers licensed by appellant and to retail dealers and consumers. They require the licensed refiners to mix the patented fluid with the gasoline at their refineries with equipment approved by appellant and in conformity to regulations promulgated by the Surgeon General of the United States and any other governmental body having jurisdiction. The refiners agree to impose obligations on all purchasers to conform to such health regulations and to require them to impose like obligations on those to whom they sell. The refiners agree, upon notice by appellant, to discontinue sales to other refiners or jobbers whose licenses appellant has cancelled. The licenses also provide for the maximum amount of the fluid to be used in the gasoline; and that, within that limit, the licensees' regular or 'best non- premium' gasoline shall have a maximum octane rating of 701 and shall be sold as the next highest priced motor fuel of the \n\n[309 \nU.S. 436, 448]\n\u00a0\n licensee below the licensee's ethyl gasoline, which shall have a minimum octane rating of 76 and shall be sold at a certain fixed price differential above the average net sales price of the licensees' best non- premium grade of commercial gasoline. The licenses further provide the conditions under which the name of the Ethyl Corporation and its trademark or trade names may be used in connection with the advertising and sale of the patented motor fuel. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Jobbers are generally required by appellant to apply for licenses through the refiners from whom they expect to purchase the motor fuel. The licenses to jobbers purport to grant the right to sell and deliver to retail dealers and consumers within a specified territory regular and ethyl gasoline, manufactured and sold by a designated licensed refiner. \n3\n The licensed jobbers are required to furnish appellant monthly with a list of all places at which the motor fuel is sold under the licenses. They agree to comply with health regulations relating to the handling of the motor fuel promulgated by the Surgeon General or other governmental agency; to post and distribute any notices concerning the handling of such fuel as required by the appellant; to permit physical examination of employees, and to require customers purchasing for resale to assume similar obligations. Adulteration and dilution of motor fuel distributed under the licenses is prohibited, and requirements similar to those contained in refiner licenses are imposed with respect to the use of \n\n[309 \nU.S. 436, 449]\n\u00a0\n appellant's corporate name and trade names in connection with the advertising and sale of the motor fuel. Appellant is given the right to cancel the jobbers' licenses at any time for failure to comply with their terms, and either party may cancel, with or without cause, on thirty days' written notice.\n The licensing system established by appellant affects and controls the business of the major part of those engaged in manufacturing and distributing motor fuel oil in the United States. Appellant issues licenses to 123 refiners, including every leading oil company, except one, the Sun Oil Company, which does not generally do business through jobbers. They refine 88% of all gasoline sold in the United States, and the gasoline processed by them under the license agreements is 70% of all the gasoline thus sold, and 85% of all gasoline processed to obtain a high octane rating.\n Any jobber in the United States desiring to sell lead-treated gasoline must secure a license from the Ethyl Corporation, revocable at its will, before it can procure the gasoline from licensed refiners. Of the 12,000 jobbers doing business in the United States approximately 11, 000 are licensed by appellant. The jobber must procure a new license on changing his source of supply. The greater part of all gasoline treated with the patented fluid is sold and transported in interstate commerce. It is sold in part through wholesale and retail outlets owned and controlled by the refiners and in part to individual retailers and consumers. A large volume and a substantial part of the whole is distributed through licensed jobbers to whom it is delivered at their bulk storage plants through the channels of interstate commerce.\n By their terms, the licensing agreements serve to exclude all unlicensed jobbers from the market, and in the \n\n[309 \nU.S. 436, 450]\n\u00a0\n particulars already mentioned, and in others presently to be discussed, they control the conduct of the business of licensed jobbers in the distribution of the patented motor fuel and enable appellant at will to exclude others from the business. The refiners' licenses also in terms place restraints on the sales price of refiners by establishing the prescribed differential between regular and ethyl gasoline. From this and from the other stipulated facts the Government argues that the control acquired through the licensing agreements over the refiners and jobbers has been used by appellants to control the business practices of the jobbers and particularly to maintain resale prices of the patented motor fuel in unlawful restraint of interstate commerce. In support of this contention it relies upon the long established practice of appellant to refuse to grant licenses to jobbers who cut prices or refuse to conform to the marketing policies and posted prices of the major refineries or the market leaders among them.\nDecision Below and Contentions of Apellants.\n The trial court concluded that in view of the indefinite language of the stipulation it was perhaps a permissible, though not a necessary conclusion that an agreement or understanding for the maintenance of prices existed between the appellant and the jobber licensees. But it considered it unnecessary to decide this issue, since it found that the appellant's licensing practices affecting the jobbers, in conjunction with the agreements and cooperation of the licensed refiners, had been used by appellant as the means of excluding from the market the unlicensed jobbers who do not conform to the market policies and posted gasoline prices adopted by the major oil companies or the market leaders among them, and that appellant uses the control thus established to coerce adherence to those policies and prices generally by the licensed jobbers, and that this restriction upon the industry effected \n\n[309 \nU.S. 436, 451]\n\u00a0\n through the license contracts with refiners and jobbers was not within appellant's patent monopoly, and operated unreasonably to restrain interstate commerce in the processed gasoline.\n It concluded that the licensing system was not, as appellant argues, necessary for the protection of such legitimate interests as the patentee had in the protection of the quality of the treated gasoline sold upon the market, and its use by the jobbers with safety to the public health. Appellants were accordingly enjoined from enforcing or attempting to enforce, or including in any subsequent agreement provisions that refiners shall sell lead-treated gasoline only to licensed jobbers, and from requiring or attempting to require jobbers to secure licenses, and from enforcing or attempting to enforce the provisions of any outstanding jobber licenses. The decree also declared the jobber licenses illegal and required appellant to notify the jobbers that the licenses have been cancelled.\n Appellant, insisting that it does not use the jobbers' licensing system to maintain prices, makes two principal attacks on the decree. It urges that the licensing of the refiners and jobbers, the restraints upon the sale of the patented fuel by the refiners, and the restrictions placed upon the jobbers, are all reasonably necessary for the commercial development of appellant's patents and for insuring a financial return from them, and are therefore within its patent monopoly. In any case, it is said that the conditions attached to the refiners' and jobbers' licenses are appropriate and reasonably adapted to the maintenance of the quality of the product and for the protection of the public in its use of a product containing a dangerous poison, and both are essential to the maintenance of the market for the patented fuel, on which the market for appellant's patented fluid depends. And since the jobbers' licenses are a necessary or appropriate \n\n[309 \nU.S. 436, 452]\n\u00a0\n means of protecting the interests of appellant and the public in the quality and safe use of the patented product, it is argued that the decree abolishing the whole system of jobbers' licenses went further than was necessary or proper to prevent such restraint as there may have been exerted on the jobbers with respect to prices and marketing policies.\nRelation of the Licensing Agreements to Price Maintenance.\n For the moment we may lay to one side the particular restrictions enumerated in the contracts of the refiners with jobbers, and turn to the relation of appellant's licensing policy to the maintenance of price policies by the jobbers. While the trial court found no contract or agreement which purports to prescribe resale prices or to exact any price policy of the jobbers, the stipulation of facts shows that appellant, through its patents, its contracts, and its licensing policy, has acquired the power to exclude at will from participation in the nationwide market for lead-treated motor fuel all of the 12,000 motor fuel jobbers of the country, by refusing to license any of the 1,000 unlicensed jobbers, or by cancelling, as it may at will, the licenses of any of the 11,000 licensed jobbers. This we assume, for present purposes, it could lawfully do by virtue of the power conferred by its patent to exclude any or all others from selling the patented product. But it does not follow that it can lawfully exercise that power in such manner as to control the patented commodity in the hands of the licensed jobbers who had purchased it, or their actions with respect to it in ways not within the limits of the patent monopoly, and conspicuously among such controls which the Sherman law prohibits and the patent law does not sanction is the regulation of prices and the suppression of competition among the purchasers of the patented articles. That appellant, by the plan \n\n[309 \nU.S. 436, 453]\n\u00a0\n and scope of its licensing policy has acquired vast potential power to accomplish that end cannot be doubted. And we think the record supports the finding of the trial court that appellant has exercised that power continuously for a considerable period as a means of control over the price policies of the licensed jobbers.\n From the stipulation of facts, it appears that since 1929 appellant has pursued the practice of investigating, through field agents, the 'business ethics' of jobbers applying for licenses, and of rejecting such applications upon the adverse report of the agent. Appellant admits that the phrase 'business ethics' is used to denote compliance with 'marketing policies and prevailing prices of the petroleum industry', which are the 'marketing policies and posted prices of the major oil companies or the market leaders among them'. Among these is the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey which owns one-half of the capital stock of the appellant. \n4\n While not all applicants who have failed to maintain prices and marketing policies have been rejected, the record leaves no doubt that appellant has made use of its dominant position in the trade to exercise control over prices and marketing policies of jobbers in a sufficient number of cases and with sufficient continuity to make its attitude toward price cutting a pervasive influence in the jobbing trade.\n In many instances, although not in all, an adverse report by the investigator as to the applicant's business ethics has been the sole ground for rejecting his application, and appellant admits that the greater number of applications for licenses which have been denied were rejected because of such an adverse report. In the cases in which licenses have been refused, something less than one-half of the rejected applicants were later granted licenses on their assurance that their marketing practices \n\n[309 \nU.S. 436, 454]\n\u00a0\n would be changed. The total number of rejections for failure to comply with that standard does not appear, for appellant has failed to keep any record of the ground of rejection of applications for licenses, admittedly because it is reluctant to preserve in its records 'the extent to which maintenance of prices and marketing policies by jobbers entered into the granting of licenses.'\n Jobbers' licenses do not appear to have been cancelled because of failures to maintain policies or prices of the major oil companies whenever they have occurred, but it is an established practice of appellant to investigate the business ethics of licensed jobbers in order to ascertain whether they maintain the marketing prices, policies and practices prevailing or ostensibly prevailing in the industry. Representatives of appellant have from time to time, but not in every case, reported a jobber to his supplier or refiner for not maintaining the marketing policies of the latter, and in some cases they have united in persuading the jobber to mend his ways. Appellant has generally required each licensed jobber to purchase all his treated fuel from a single refiner and in some instances has refused a license to jobbers who wished to change their source of supply from one licensed refiner to another.\n These long-continued practices have had the effect upon the industry naturally to be expected. Large numbers of refiners and the majority of jobbers believe that the jobbers must maintain the required business ethics in order to obtain licenses, and a number of licensed jobbers believe that they are required by appellant's licensing practices to maintain prices and abide by the marketing practices of the major oil companies. Appellant, in its printed instructions to field representatives as to the manner of conducting investigations of licensed jobbers, after pointing out that one of the reasons for the investigation of the jobber before the issuance of the license \n\n[309 \nU.S. 436, 455]\n\u00a0\n is to insure that he 'will not resort to unethical methods in competing with our other licensed jobbers and refiners,' and after describing the methods of conducting the investigation,5 sums up the result as follows: 'We have, through these supplemental investigations, been able to correct the ethyl picture to a considerable extent, and have succeeded in eliminating from our jobber lists some of our former accounts who were not a credit to us as licensees of the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation'.\n It is not denied, and could not well be, that if appellant's comprehensive control of the market in the distribution of the leadtreated gasoline, as disclosed by the record, had been acquired without aid of the patents, but wholly by the contracts with refiners and jobbers, such control would involve a violation of the Sherman Act.

General Electric Co., supra, 272 U.S. at page 485, 47 S.Ct. at page 195.\n Appellant, as patentee, possesses exclusive rights to make and sell the fluid and also the lead-treated motor fuel. By its sales to refiners it relinquishes its exclusive right to use the patented fluid and it relinquishes to the licensed jobbers its exclusive rights to sell the lead- treated fuel by permitting the licensed refiners to manufacture and sell the fuel to them. And by the authorized sales of the fuel by refiners to jobbers the patent monopoly over it is exhausted, and after the sale neither appellant nor the refiners may longer rely on the patents to exercise any control over the price at which the fuel may be resold. Adams v. Burke, supra; Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus, supra; Bauer & Cie v. O'Donnell, supra; Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co., supra.\n The picture here revealed is not that of a patentee exercising its right to refuse to sell or to permit his licensee to sell the patented products to price-cutters. Compare United States v. Colgate & Co., \n250 \nU.S. 300\n, 39 S.Ct. 465, 7 A.L.R. 443, with United States v. A. Schrader's Son, Inc., \n252 \nU.S. 85\n, 40 S.Ct. 251. A very different scene is depicted by the record. It is one in which appellant has established the marketing of the patented fuel in vast amounts on a nationwide scale through the 11,000 jobbers and at the same time, by the leverage of its licensing contracts resting on the fulcrum of its patents, it has built up a combination capable of use, and actually used, as a means of controlling jobbers' prices and suppressing competition among them. It \n\n[309 \nU.S. 436, 458]\n\u00a0\n seems plain that this attempted regulation of prices and market practices of the jobbers with respect to the fuel purchased, for which appellant could not lawfully contract, cannot be lawfully achieved by entering into contracts or combinations through the manipulation of which the same results are reached by the exercise of the power which they give to control the action of the purchasers. Such contracts or combinations which are used to obstruct the free and natural flow in the channels of interstate commerce of trade even in a patented article, after it is sold by the patentee or his licensee, are a violation of the Sherman Act.

Agreements for price maintenance of articles moving in interstate commerce are, without more, unreasonable restraints within the meaning of the Sherman Act because they eliminate competition, United States v. Trenton Potteries Co., \n273 \nU.S. 392\n, 47 S.Ct. 377, 50 A.L.R. 989, and agreements which create potential power for such price maintenance exhibited by its actual exertion for that purpose are in themselves unlawful restraints within the meaning of the Sherman Act, which is not only a prohibition against the infliction of a particular type of public injury but 'a limitation of rights ... which may be pushed to evil consequences, and therefore restrained'. Standard Sanitary Mfg. Co. v. United States, supra, 226 U.S. at page 49, 33 S.Ct. at page 15; American Column Co. v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 377, 400\n, 42 S.Ct. 114, 117, 21 A.L.R. 1093; United States v. American Linseed Oil Co., \n262 \nU.S. 371\n, 43 S.Ct. 607; United States v. Trenton Potteries Co., supra, 273 U.S. at page 397, 398, 47 S.Ct. at page 379, 50 A.L.R. 989.\n The extent to which appellant's dominion over the jobbers' business goes beyond its patent monopoly, is emphasized by the circumstances here present that the prices and market practices sought to be established are not those prescribed by appellant-patentee, but by the \n\n[309 \nU.S. 436, 459]\n\u00a0\n refiners. Appellant neither owns nor sells the patented fuel nor derives any profit through royalties or otherwise from its sale. It has chosen to exploit its patents by manufacturing the fluid covered by them and by selling that fluid to refiners for use in the manufacture of motor fuel. Such benefits as result from control over the marketing of the treated fuel by the jobbers accrues primarily to the refiners and indirectly to appellant, only in the enjoyment of its monopoly of the fluid secured under another patent. The licensing conditions are thus not used as a means of stimulating the commercial development and financial returns of the patented invention which is licensed, but for the commercial development of the business of the refiners and the exploitation of a second patent monopoly not embraced in the first. The patent monopoly of one invention may no more be enlarged for the exploitation of a monopoly of another, see Standard Sanitary Mfg. Co. v. United States, supra, than for the exploitation of an unpatented article, United Shoe Machinery Co. v. United States, supra; Carbice Corporation v. American Patents Corporation, supra; Leitch Manufacturing Co. v. Barber Co., supra; American Lecithin Co. v. Warfield Co., 7 Cir., 105 F.2d 207, or for the exploitation or promotion of a business not embraced within the patent. Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. United States, supra, 306 U.S. at pages 228-230, 59 S.Ct. at pages 475, 476.\nProtection of Health and Quality of Product.\n The trial court was of opinion that such interest as appellant has in protecting the health of the public in connection with the distribution of the fuel, and in preventing adulteration, deterioration and dilution of the motor fuel in the hands of the jobbers may be adequately protected without resort to the jobber license device which has been and is capable of being used for other and illicit purposes. Compare International Business Machines Corporation v. United States, supra, 298 U.S. at pages 139, 140, 56 S.Ct. at page 705. This \n\n[309 \nU.S. 436, 460]\n\u00a0\n conclusion is, we think, amply supported by the record. The precautions taken to protect the public health in the handling of the motor fuel by jobbers and service stations includes the health restrictions imposed on jobbers by the refiners included in their contracts with jobbers, inspections, more or less perfunctory, by representatives of appellant and the posting by jobbers and distributors of notices supplied by appellant stating that the fuel contains load and is for use as a motor fuel only. These activities are not interfered with by the decree.\n There is no authentic instance of injury resulting from the handling of leadtreated gasoline after its manufacture attributable to its lead content. Extensive expert study, carried on under direction of appellant over a period of years, detailed in the record, resulted in a report that the risk arising from the absorption of lead through the skin in the handling of the lead-treated fuel is so small as to be negligible, and that the use of the fuel made in conformity to the refiners' licenses has not caused or produced any dangers or hazards to health.\n The avoidance of such dangers as there may be in the handling of the motor fuel by jobbers and distributors is plainly not beyond control by public health regulations, and would seem, as the district court thought, to be amply secured, in any case, through the self-interest of the refiners in requiring the purchasers of their gasoline to take proper health precautions including the posting of notices which appellant supplies and by the continuance of appellant's inspection, all of which are permissible under the decree. It is likewise apparent that the interest the appellant has in preventing dilution, adulteration and deterioration of the treated gasoline in the hands of the jobbers may be similarly protected without continued resort to jobber licenses, which is precluded by reason of their use and the danger of their continued use for other and illegal purposes. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 436, 461]\n\u00a0\n Since the unlawful control over the jobbers was established and maintained by resort to the licensing device, the decree rightly suppressed it even though it had been or might continue to be used for some lawful purposes. The court was bound to frame its decree so as to suppress the unlawful practices and to take such reasonable measures as would preclude their revival. Local 167 v. United States, \n291 \nU.S. 293\n, 54 S.Ct. 396; Warner & Co. v. Lilly & Co., \n265 \nU.S. 526, 532\n, 44 S.Ct. 615, 618. It could, in the exercise of its discretion, consider whether that could be accomplished effectively without disestablishing the licensing system, and whether there were countervailing reasons for continuing it as a necessary or proper means for appellant to carry out other lawful purposes. Since the court rightly concluded that these reasons were without substantial weight, it properly suppressed the means by which the unlawful restraint was achieved. Local 167 v. United States, supra, 291 U.S. at page 299, 300, 54 S.Ct. at page 399; cf. Merchants' Warehouse Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 501, 513\n, 51 S.Ct. 505, 509\n\n\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The utility of lead-treated gasoline for use in high compression engines is expressed in terms of octane numbers, an arbitrary scale of measurement indicating the relative degree of compression to which the fuel may be subjected without causing 'knock' in the engine, which is prevented or reduced by the use of the fuel. The octane rating of motor fuel increases with the amount of the patented fluid added to the gasoline which, in any case, is small. Appellant's licenses to refiners authorize the manufacture of gasoline of high octane rating, 68 or more, of two classes, 'regular', in which there is one part of tetraethyl lead to 4200 parts of gasoline, and 'ethyl gasoline', in which there is one part of tetraethyl lead to 1700 parts of gasoline. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The name of the Ethyl Corporation and its trademark or trade names 'Ethyl' and 'Q' may not be used in connection with the advertising and sale of regular gasoline.

'Ethics of the jobber is based on the territory in which he is marketing and the conditions surrounding the sale of gasoline by other ethyl gasoline distributors. Care should be taken, if possible, to find out the instigator of any practices which tend to unfair competition. Business ethics is a relative quality and no hard and fast rule can be given to govern all cases. Information given to field representatives and picked up in the various contacts should be weighed carefully before a final decision is reached. One of the three words, 'good', 'questionable', or 'unethical' is to be used in answering this question.'\n In January, 1935 the question as to 'business ethics' was eliminated from the form report of field agents. But business ethics has since continued to be one of the principal subjects of investigation and, as before, the result of the field agent's investigation has been included in his report and his recommendations have been generally accepted and acted upon by his superiors.\nScope of the Patent Monopoly. \n\n\n\n\n","30":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEX PARTE BRANSFORD(1940)\n\nArgued: Decided: May 20, 1940\n\n\n\n\n[310 \nU.S. 354, 355]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Gerald Jones, of Tucson, Ariz., for petitioner.\n Mr. J. L. Gust, of Phoenix, Ariz., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The county treasurer and ex-officio tax collector of Pima County, Arizona, moves to file a tendered petition for a writ of mandamus to be directed to District Judge Ling of the federal district court for that state. A rule to show cause has issued and the return has been made. Petitioner, a county treasurer, and other officials are defendants together with their counties, in a suit brought in the district court by the Valley National Bank in which the Bank is seeking an interlocutory and permanent injunction against the collection of certain taxes by the counties. The district judge has ruled that he will hear the case while sitting alone and petitioner contends that under Section 266 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A.  380, he is entitled to have the case heard before three judges. Mandamus is the proper remedy. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Arizona taxes shares of bank stock in the name of the shareholders and requires the bank to pay for them. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[310 \nU.S. 354, 356]\n\u00a0\n Assessments are made in the first instance by county assessors, with an appeal allowed first to a county and then to a state board of equalization. The state board returns the final assessment with a levy of the rate for state purposes to the county supervisors. This body adds the several local rates and places the assessment upon the tax roll. Collection is performed by the county treasurer,3 and the taxes collected are apportioned between state and county. \n4\n Where a bank is doing business in several counties the value of its stock is apportioned among the counties in accordance with the assets located in each. \n5\n Because other property in the state has been under-assessed the state board in 1935 ordered that bank shares be valued at 75% of capital stock, surplus and undivided profit. Assets, borrowings, deposits and other liabilities are disregarded.\n The petitioner is the only defendant to apply for mandamus. As the issuance of such an order depends on the jurisdiction of the single district judge, sitting alone, over the suit pending in the district court, this is sufficient. As the issues with this petitioner in that suit include those with all other defendants, we do not need to state the issues arising with the officials of counties other than Pima. The Bank states its controversy with the petitioner arose in the following manner. The Bank had branches in several counties. It had common capital stock, a surplus and undivided profits. Also the Bank had an issue of preferred which it had sold to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation prior to the time of the 1935 assessment at the par value of $1,240,000 and which the Reconstruction Finance Corporation still owns. Taking the position that the preferred owned by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation could not be taxed, \n\n[310 \nU.S. 354, 357]\n\u00a0\n the Bank reported a total value of $524,629.50, 75% of $699,026 (the amount of its common, surplus, undivided profits and reserves), as the total taxable value of its shares, and apportioned this among the counties according to the assets there located. On this basis $139,088.80, 26.53% of its total taxable value, was apportioned to Pima County. The assessor of Pima County made an assessment of $327,590, the 'actual cash value of the real and personal property' situated in Pima County. By agreement of the parties, the Bank paid the amount which under its computation was due Pima County, the right to litigate the validity of the county's assessment being reserved. Subsequently, the petitioner having threatened to institute proceedings to enforce the county's assessment, the Bank brought its suit in the district court to enjoin collection.\n The Bank by its bill in the district court seeks an injunction upon several grounds. We are of the opinion that none of these compels the trial judge to call a three-judge court under Section 266.\n The assessment in Pima County was made in the amount of the value of the Bank's real estate and personal property. It is therefore, says the Bank, impossible to tell whether the assessment is the valuation of the property, the proportion of the value of the common stock alone or that of the aggregate of the common and preferred. An assessment upon the property, it is alleged, is 'void as unauthorized by the statutes of Arizona.' If the valuation includes the preferred stock, the complaint alleges it is invalid because of the Act of March 20, 1936, exempting the preferred stock while owned by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. \n6\n If the valuation is upon the common stock alone, it is said to be invalid (1) because the valuation is far beyond the actual value and therefore confiscatory and (2) because the valuation is discrimina- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 354, 358]\n\u00a0\n tory since the common stock in other banks is assessed at 75% of the value of common stock, surplus and undivided profits and other classes of property at sixty per cent of its actual value, while this valuation is on the basis of approximately twice the common stock, surplus and undivided profits of the bank and twice its actual value. It is further alleged that this excessive and discriminatory valuation violates R.S.  5219, 12 U.S.C. A.  548, which limits the rate of taxation of national bank shares to that assessed 'upon other moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens ... coming into competition with the business of national banks.' It is prayed that action under these assessments for the reasons stated be enjoined as violative of the Constitution and laws of the United States and Arizona.\n Section 266 lays down as one of the requirements for a three-judge court that the injunction against the officer of the state to restrain the enforcement, operation or execution of the state statute must be sought 'upon the ground of the unconstitutionality of such statute.'\n In so far as it is alleged that the assessments are void because unauthorized by the Arizona statute, the injunction sought is obviously not upon the ground of the unconstitutionality of the state statute as tested by the federal Constitution.\n The allegations that the assessments should be enjoined because violative of the statute exempting preferred stock owned by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and R.S.  5219 depend upon no constitutional provision within the meaning of Judicial Code Section 266. If such assessments are invalid, it is because they levy taxes upon property withdrawn from taxation by federal law7 or in a manner forbidden by the National Banking Act. \n8\n The \n\n[310 \nU.S. 354, 359]\n\u00a0\n declaration of the supremacy clause9 gives superiority to valid federal acts over conflicting state statutes but this superiority for present purposes involves merely the construction of an act of Congress, not the constitutionality of the state enactment. This was decided as to Section 266 in Ex parte Buder,10 and before that a similar result had been reached in Lemke v. Farmers Grain Company11 in regard to a provision of the Judicial Code granting direct appeal to this Court in cases where the sole issue12 was the unconstitutionality of a state statute. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n It is said, however, that the allegations of confiscation and discrimination in valuation of the common shares in comparison with the stock of other banks and other property show the injunction is sought upon the ground of the unconstitutionality of the statute. This point depends upon excessive valuation of the shares. The validity of the statute itself is not involved. Variations by assessors in valuations of like property, taxable under the same statute, sufficiently marked to be discriminatory under the Constitution or valuations so large as to be confiscatory cannot properly be said to be the basis for attack on the ground of the unconstitutionality of the statute. Such assessments, if made and if invalid, are so because of a wrong done by officers under the statute rather than because of the requirement of the statute itself. \n 14\n\u00a0\n\n But it is said by the petitioner here that the last sentence of Section 3071 requires this excessive and discrimina- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 354, 360]\n\u00a0\n tory assessment. That sentence reads: 'When a bank maintains branches or conducts business in more than one county, city or town, the assessed value of the capital stock shall be apportioned among the several counties, cities and towns in which the main office or such branches are maintained or business conducted, and the amount apportioned to each county, city or town shall not be less than the actual cash value of the real and personal property of such bank situated in such county, city or town.' If this is interpreted as requiring that the apportionment of the value of the capital stock to each county must not be less than the tangible property in that county, the aggregate apportionment may be much larger than the assessed value of the stock. A greater assessment per share will occur if the total valuation is allocated to common shares only. If the valuation, reached under the formula by treating the preferred as capital stock, is allocated among the common shares, only, it would mean that the preferred was treated as stock for purposes of the valuation and disregarded for the assessment of individual shares. The argument of petitioner is that if the result, as he contends the Bank alleges, violates the federal Constitution by discrimination of common shares as compared to shares of other banks without preferred stock or owners of other property, the statute violates it. Therefore, in effect, the attack on the constitutionality of the assessment is an attack on the constitutionality of the statute.\n The contention of the Bank, however, is that the assessor misinterpreted the statute; that the objectionable aspect of the assessment is the attribution to the common of the whole amount instead of an apportionment to both preferred and common or the use of the preferred as capital stock in the state valuation formula. We are not now called upon to reach any conclusion upon the meaning of the Arizona tax statutes. If the trial court deter- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 354, 361]\n\u00a0\n mines that the assessment complained of is made properly under the statutes and that by the statute the assessment is to be prorated among the common shares, it would determine only a question of statutory construction. It is necessary to distinguish between a petition for injunction on the ground of the unconstitutionality of a statute as applied, which requires a three-judge court,15 and a petition which seeks an injunction on the ground of the unconstitutionality of the result obtained by the use of a statute which is not attacked as unconstitutional. The latter petition does not require a three-judge court. \n16\n In such a case the attack is aimed at an allegedly erroneous administrative action. \n17\n Until the complainant in the district court attacks the constitutionality of the statute, the case does not require the convening of a three-judge court, any more than if the complaint did not seek an interlocutory injunction. \n18\n Where by an omission to attack the constitutionality of a state statute, its validity is admitted for the purposes of the bill, a determination by the trial court that the assessment accords with the statute would result in the refusal of the injunction and the dismissal of the bill. Jurisdiction, properly assumed, may be lost be the special court, when it appears that a prerequisite such as need for relief against state officers is lacking. \n19\n Even where the statute is attacked as unconstitutional, Section 266 is inapplicable unless the action complained of is directly attributable to the statute. \n20\n There is no indication that Congress sought by Section 266 to have every attack on the constitutionality of a state statute determined by a three-judge court. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 354, 362]\n\u00a0\n It sought such a bench only to avoid precipitate determinations on constitutionality on motions for interlocutory injunctions.\n As the foregoing ground adequately disposes of the petition for mandamus, we do not discuss the other reasons for refusal urged by the Bank.\n The motion to file the petition for mandamus is denied.\n Motion denied. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Ex parte Williams, \n277 \nU.S. 267, 269\n, 48 S.Ct. 523, 524; Stratton v.

POTTSVILLE B. CO.(1940)\nNo. 265\nArgued: January 11, 1940Decided: January 29, 1940\n\n\n\n\n[309 \nU.S. 134, 135]\n\u00a0\n Robert H. Jackson, Sol. Gen., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Charles D. Drayton and Eliot C. Lovett, both of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[309 \nU.S. 134, 136]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The court below issued a writ of mandamus against the Federal Communications Commission, and, because important issues of administrative law are involved, we brought the case here. \n308 \nU.S. 535\n, 60 S.Ct. 107, 84 L.Ed. --. We are called upon to ascertain and enforce the spheres of authority which Congress has given to the Commission and the courts, respectively, through its scheme for the regula- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 134, 137]\n\u00a0\n tion of radio broadcasting in the Communications Act of 1934, c. 652, 48 Stat. 1064, as amended by the Act of May 20, 1937, c. 229, 50 Stat. 189, 47 U.S.C.  151 et seq., 47 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq.\n Adequate appreciation of the facts presently to be summarized requires that they be set in their legislative framework. In its essentials the Communications Act of 1934 derives from the Federal Radio Act of 1927, c. 169, 44 Stat. 1162, as amended, 46 Stat. 844. By this Act Congress, in order to protect the national interest involved in the new and far-reaching science of broadcasting, formulated a unified and comprehensive regulatory system for the industry. \n1\n The common factors in the administration of the various statutes by which Congress had supervised the different modes of communication led to the creation, in the Act of 1934, of the Communications Commission. But the objectives of the legislation have remained substantially unaltered since 1927\n\n\n Congress moved under the spur of a widespread fear that in the absence of governmental control the public interest might be subordinated to monopolistic domination in the broadcasting field. To avoid this Congress provided for a system of permits and licenses. Licenses were not to be granted for longer than three years. Communications Act of 1934, Title iii,  307(d). No license was to be 'construed to create any right, beyond the terms, conditions, and periods of the license.' Ibid.  301. In granting or withholding permits for the construction of stations, and in granting, denying modifying or revoking licenses for the operation of stations, 'public \n\n[309 \nU.S. 134, 138]\n\u00a0\n convenience, interest, or necessity' was the touchstone for the exercise of the Commission's authority. While this criterion is as concrete as the complicated factors for judgment in such a field of delegated authority permit, it serves as a supple instrument for the exercise of discretion by the expert body which Congress has charged to carry out its legislative policy. Necessarily, therefore, the subordinate questions of procedure in ascertaining the public interest, when the Commission's licensing authority is invoked-the scope of the inquiry, whether applications should be heard contemporaneously or successively, whether parties should be allowed to intervene in one another's proceedings, and similar questions- were explicitly and by implication left to the Commission's own devising, so long, of course, as it observes the basic requirements designed for the protection of private as well as public interest. Ibid., Title I,  4(j), 47 U.S.C.A.  154(j). Underlying the whole law is recognition of the rapidly fluctuating factors characteristic of the evolution of broadcasting and of the corresponding requirement that the administrative process possess sufficient flexibility to adjust itself to these factors. Thus, it is highly significant that although investment in broadcasting stations may be large, a license may not be issued for more than three years; and in deciding whether to renew the license, just as in deciding whether to issue it in the first place, the Commission must judge by the standard of 'public convenience, interest, or necessity.' The Communications Act is not designed primarily as a new code for the adjustment of conflicting private rights through adjudication. Rather it expresses a desire on the part of Congress to maintain, through appropriate administrative control, a grip on the dynamic aspects of radio transmission. 2 \n\n[309 \nU.S. 134, 139]\n\u00a0\n Against this background the facts of the present case fall into proper perspective. In May, 1936, The Pottsville Broadcasting Company, respondent here, sought from the Commission a permit under  319 Ibid., Title iii, for the construction of a broadcasting station at Pottsville, Pennsylvania. The Commission denied this application on two grounds: (1) that the respondent was financially disqualified; and (2) that the applicant did not sufficiently represent local interests in the community which the proposed station was to serve. From this denial of its application respondent appealed to the court below. That tribunal withheld judgment on the second ground of the Commission's decision, for it did not deem this to have controlled the Commission's judgment. But, finding the Commission's conclusion regarding the respondent's lack of financial qualification to have been based on an erroneous understanding of Pennsylvania law, the Court of Appeals reversed the decision and ordered the 'cause ... remanded to the ... Communications Commission for reconsideration in accordance with the views expressed.' Pottsville Broadcasting Co. v. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 134, 140]\n\u00a0\n Federal Communications Commission, 69 App.D.C. 7, 98 F.2d 288.\n Following this remand, respondent petitioned the Commission to grant its original application. Instead of doing so, the Commission set for argument respondent's application along with two rival applications for the same facilities. The latter applications had been filed subsequently to that of respondent and hearings had been held on them by the Commission in a consolidated proceeding, but they were still undisposed of when the respondent's case returned to the Commission. With three applications for the same facilities thus before it, and the facts regarding each having theretofore been explored by appropriate procedure, the Commission directed that all three be set down for argument before it to determine which, 'on a comparative basis' 'in the judgment of the Commission will best serve public interest.' At this stage of the proceedings, respondents sought and obtained from the Court of Appeals the writ of mandamus now under review. That writ commanded the Commission to set aside its order designating respondent's application 'for hearing on a comparative basis' with the other two, and 'to hear and reconsider the application' of The Pottsville Broadcasting Company 'on the basis of the record as originally made and in accordance with the opinions' of the Court of Appeals in the original review (69 App.D.C. 7, 98 F.2d 288), and in the mandamus proceedings. Pottsville Broadcasting Co. v. Federal Communications Commission, 70 App.D.C. 157, 105 F.2d 36.\n The Court of Appeals invoked against the Commission the familiar doctrine that a lower court is bound to respect the mandate of an appellate tribunal and cannot reconsider questions which the mandate has laid at rest. See In re Sanford Fork & Tool Co., Petitioner, \n160 \nU.S. 247, 255\n, 256 S., 16 S.Ct. 291, 293. That proposition is indisputable, but it does not tell us \n\n[309 \nU.S. 134, 141]\n\u00a0\n what issues were laid at rest. Compare Sprague v. Ticonic Bank, \n307 \nU.S. 161\n, 59 S.Ct. 777. Nor is a court's interpretation of the scope of its own mandate necessarily conclusive. To be sure the court that issues a mandate is normally the best judge of its content, on the general theory that the author of a document is ordinarily the authoritative interpreter of its purposes. But it is not even true that a lower court's interpretation of its mandate is controlling here. Compare United States v. Morgan, \n307 \nU.S. 183\n, 59 S.Ct. 795. Therefore, we would not be foreclosed by the interpretation which the Court of Appeals gave to its mandate, even if it had been directed to a lower court.\n A much deeper issue, however, is here involved. This was not a mandate from court to court but from a court to an administrative agency. What is in issue is not the relationship of federal courts inter se-a relationship defined largely by the courts themselves-but the due observance by courts of the distribution of authority made by Congress as between its power to regulate commerce and the reviewing power which it has conferred upon the courts under Article III of the Constitution, U.S.C. A. A review by a federal court of the action of a lower court is only one phase of a single unified process. But to the extent that a federal court is authorized to review an administrative act, there is superimposed upon the enforcement of legislative policy through administrative control a different process from that out of which the administrative action under review ensued. The technical rules derived from the interrelationship of judicial tribunals forming a hierarchical system are taken out of their environment when mechanically applied to determine the extent to which Congressional power, exercised through a delegated agency, can be controlled within the limited scope of 'judicial power' conferred by Congress under the Constitution. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 134, 142]\n\u00a0\n Courts, like other organisms, represent an interplay of form and function. The history of Anglo-American courts and the more or less narrowly defined range of their staple business have determined the basic characteristics of trial procedure, the rules of evidence, and the general principles of appellate review. Modern administrative tribunals are the outgrowth of conditions for different from those. \n3\n To a large degree they have been a response to the felt need of governmental supervision over economic enterprise-a supervision which could effectively be exercised neither directly through self-executing legislation nor by the judicial process. That this movement was natural and its extension inevitable, was a quarter century ago the opinion of eminent spokesmen of the law. \n4\n Perhaps the most striking characteristic of this movement has been the investiture of administrative agencies with power far exceeding and different from the conventional judicial modes for adjusting conflicting claims-modes whereby interested litigants define the scope of the inquiry and determine the data on which the judicial judgment is ultimately based. Administrative agencies have power themselves to initiate inquiry, \n\n[309 \nU.S. 134, 143]\n\u00a0\n or, when their authority is invoked, to control the range of investigation in ascertaining what is to satisfy the requirements of the public interest in relation to the needs of vast regions and sometimes the whole nation in the enjoyment of facilities for transportation, communication and other essential public services. \n5\n These differences in origin and function preclude wholesale transplantation of the rules of procedure, trial and review which have evolved from the history and experience of courts. Thus, this Court has recognized that bodies like the Interstate Commerce Commission, into whose would Congress has cast more recent administrative agencies, 'should not be too narrowly constrained by technical rules as to the admissibility of proof,' Interstate Commerce Commission v. Baird, \n194 \nU.S. 25, 44\n, 24 S.Ct. 563, 568, 569, should be free to fashion their own rules of procedure and to pursue methods of inquiry capable of permitting them to discharge their multitudinous duties. \n6\n Compare New England Divisions Case, \n261 \nU.S. 184\n, 43 S.Ct. 270. To be sure, the laws under which these agencies operate prescribe the fundamentals of fair play. They require that inter- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 134, 144]\n\u00a0\n ested parties be afforded an opportunity for hearing and that judgment must express a reasoned conclusion. But to assimilate the relation of these administrative bodies and the courts to the relationship between lower and upper courts is to disregard the origin and purposes of the movement for administrative regulation and at the same time to disregard the traditional scope, however far-reaching, of the judicial process. Unless these vital differentiations between the functions of judicial and administrative tribunals are observed, courts will stray outside their province and read the laws of Congress through the distorting lenses of inapplicable legal doctrine.\n Under the Radio Act of 1927 as originally passed, the Court of Appeals was authorized in reviewing action of the Radio Commission to 'alter or revise the decision appealed from and enter such judgment as to it may seem just.'  16 of the Radio Act of 1927, 44 Stat. 1169. Thereby the Court of Appeals was constituted 'a superior and revising agency in the same field' as that in which the Radio Commission acted. Federal Radio Comm. v. General Electric Co., \n281 \nU.S. 464, 467\n, 50 S.Ct. 389, 390. Since the power thus given was administrative rather than judicial, the appellate jurisdiction of this Court could not be invoked. Federal Radio Comm. v. General Electric Co., supra. To lay the basis for review here, Congress amended  16 so as to terminate the administrative oversight of the Court of Appeals. c. 788, 46 Stat. 844. In 'sharp contrast with the previous grant of authority' the court was restricted to a purely judicial review. 'Whether the commission applies the legislative standards validly set up, whether it acts within the authority conferred or goes beyond it, whether its proceedings satisfy the pertinent demands of due process, whether, in short, there is compliance with the legal requirements which fix the province of the commission and govern its action, are appropriate \n\n[309 \nU.S. 134, 145]\n\u00a0\n questions for judicial decision.' Federal Radio Comm'n v. Nelson Bros. Co., \n289 \nU.S. 266, 276\n, 53 S.Ct. 627, 632, 89 A.L.R. 406.\n On review the court may thus correct errors of law and on remand the Commission is bound to act upon the correction. Federal Power Comm'n v. Pacific Co., \n307 \nU.S. 156\n, 59 S.Ct. 766. But an administrative determination in which is imbedded a legal question open to judicial review does not impliedly foreclose the administrative agency, after its error has been corrected, from enforcing the legislative policy committed to its charge. Cf. Ford Motor Co. v. Labor Board, \n305 \nU.S. 364\n, 59 S.Ct. 301.\n The Commission's responsibility at all times is to measure applications by the standard of 'public convenience, interest, or necessity.' The Commission originally found respondent's application inconsistent with the public interest because of an erroneous view regarding the law of Pennsylvania. The Court of Appeals laid bare that error, and, in compelling obedience to its correction, exhausted the only power which Congress gave it. At this point the Commission was again charged with the duty of judging the application in the light of 'public convenience, interest, or necessity.' The fact that in its first disposition the Commission had committed a legal error did not create rights of priority in the respondent, as against the later applicants, which it would not have otherwise possessed. Only Congress could confer such a priority. It has not done so. The Court of Appeals cannot write the principle of priority into the statute as an indirect result of its power to scrutinize legal errors in the first of an allowable series of administrative actions. Such an implication from the curtailed review allowed by the Communications Act is at war with the basic policy underlying the statute. It would mean that for practical purposes the contingencies of judicial review and of litigation, rather than the public interest, \n\n[309 \nU.S. 134, 146]\n\u00a0\n would be decisive factors in determining which of several pending applications was to be granted.\n It is, however, urged upon us that if all matters of administrative discretion remain open for determination on remand after reversal, a succession of single determinations upon single legal issues is possible with resulting delay and hardship to the applicant. It is always easy to conjure up extreme and even oppressive possibilities in the exertion of authority. But courts are not charged with general guardianship against all potential mischief in the complicated tasks of government. The present case makes timely the reminder that 'legislatures are ultimate guardians of the liberties and welfare of the people in quite as great a degree as the courts.' Missouri, Kansas & Texas Ry. Co. v. May, \n194 \nU.S. 267, 270\n, 24 S.Ct. 638, 639. Congress which creates and sustains these agencies must be trusted to correct whatever defects experience may reveal. Interference by the courts is not conducive to the development of habits of responsibility in administrative agencies. Anglo-American courts as we now know them are themselves in no small measure the product of a historic process.\n The judgment is reversed, with directions to dissolve the writ of mandamus and to dismiss respondent's petition.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concurs in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] For the legislative history of the Act of 1927, see H.Rep.

'... the commission desires to point out that the test-'public interest, convenience, or necessity'-becomes a matter of a comparative and not an absolute standard when applied to broadcasting stations. Since the number of channels is limited and the number of persons desiring to broadcast is far greater than can be accommodated, the commission must determine from among the applicants before it which of them will, if licensed, best serve the public. In a measure, perhaps, all of them give more or less service. Those who give the least, however, must be sacrificed for those who give the most. The emphasis must be first and foremost on the interest, the convenience, and the necessity of the listening public, and not on the interest, convenience, or necessity of the individual broadcaster, or the advertiser.'

Respondent contends, and the court below seemed to believe that this rule bound the Commission to give respondent a non-comparative consideration because its application had been set down for hearing before the later and rival applications were filed. The Commission interprets this rule simply as governing the order in which applications shall be heard, and not touching upon the order in which they shall be acted upon or the manner in which they shall be considered.

RADIO STATION(1940)\nNo. 499\nArgued: February 9, 1940Decided: March 25, 1940\n\n\n\n As Amended on Denial of Rehearing April 22, 1940.\n Messrs. Robert H. Jackson, Atty. Gen., and William J. Dempsey, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 470, 471]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Louis G. Caldwell, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We took this case to resolve important issues of substance and procedure arising under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n January 20, 1936, the Telegraph Herald, a newspaper published in Dubuque, Iowa, filed with the petitioner an application for a construction permit to erect a broadcasting station in that city. May 14, 1936, the respondent, who had for some years held a broadcasting license for, and had operated, Station WKBB at East Dubuque, Illinois, directly across the Mississippi River from Dubuque, Iowa, applied for a permit to move its transmitter and studios to the last named city and to install its station there. August 18, 1936, respondent asked leave to intervene in the Telegraph Herald proceeding, alleging in its petition, inter alia, that there was an insufficiency of advertising revenue to support an additional station in Dubuque and insufficient talent to furnish programs for an additional station; that adequate service was being rendered to the community by Station WKBB and there was no need for any additional radio outlet in Dubuque and that the granting of the Telegraph Herald application would not serve the public interest, convenience, and necessity. Intervention was permitted and both applications were set for consolidated hearing.\n The respondent and the Telegraph Herald offered evidence in support of their respective applications. The respondent's proof showed that its station had operated \n\n[309 \nU.S. 470, 472]\n\u00a0\n at a loss; that the area proposed to be served by the Telegraph Herald was substantially the same as that served by the respondent and that, of the advertisers relied on to support the Telegraph Herald station, more than half had used the respondent's station for advertising.\n An examiner reported that the application of the Telegraph Herald should be denied and that of the respondent granted. On exceptions of the Telegraph Herald, and after oral argument, the broadcasting division of petitioner made an order granting both applications, reciting that 'public interest, convenience, and necessity would be served' by such action. The division promulgated a statement of the facts and of the grounds of decision, reciting that both applicants were legally, technically, and financially qualified to undertake the proposed construction and operation; that there was need in Dubuque and the surrounding territory for the services of both stations, and that no question of electrical interference between the two stations was involved. A rehearing was denied and respondent appealed to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. That court entertained the appeal and held that one of the issues which the Commission should have tried was that of alleged economic injury to the respondent's station by the establishment of an additional station and that the Commission had erred in failing to make findings on that issue. It decided that, in the absence of such findings, the Commission's action in granting the Telegraph Herald permit must be set aside as arbitrary and capricious. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The petitioner's contentions are that under the Communications Act economic injury to a competitor is not a ground for refusing a broadcasting license and that, since this is so, the respondent was not a person aggrieved or whose interests were adversely affected, by the Com- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 470, 473]\n\u00a0\n mission's action, within the meaning of Section 402(b) of the Act, 47 U.S. C.A.  402(b), which authorizes appeals from the Commission's orders.\n The respondent asserts that the petitioner in argument below contended itself with the contention that the respondent had failed to produce evidence requiring a finding of probable economic injury to it. It is consequently insisted that the petitioner is not in a position here to defend its failure to make such findings on the ground that it is not required by the Act to consider any such issue. By its petition for rehearing in the court below, the Commission made clear its position as now advanced. The decision of the court below, and the challenge made in petition for rehearing and here by the Commission, raise a fundamental question as to the function and powers of the Commission and we think that, on the record, it is open here.\n First. We hold that resulting economic injury to a rival station is not in and of itself, and apart from considerations of public convenience, interest, or necessity, an element the petitioner must weigh and as to which it must make findings in passing on an application for a broadcasting license.\n Section 307(a) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C.A.  307(a), directs that 'the Commission, if public convenience, interest, or necessity will be served thereby, subject to the limitations of this Act ( chapter), shall grant to any applicant therefor a station license provided for by this Act (chapter).' This mandate is given meaning and contour by the other provisions of the statute and the subject matter with which it deals. \n3\n The Act contains no express command that in passing upon an application the Commission must consider the effect of competition with an existing station. Whether the Commission should consider the subject must depend \n\n[309 \nU.S. 470, 474]\n\u00a0\n upon the purpose of the Act and the specific provisions intended to effectuate that purpose.\n The genesis of the Communications Act and the necessity for the adoption of some such regulatory measure is a matter of history. The number of available radio frequencies is limited. The attempt by a broadcaster to use a given frequency in disregard of its prior use by others, thus creating confusion and interference, deprives the public of the full benefit of radio audition. Unless Congress had exercised its power over interstate commerce to bring about allocation of available frequencies and to regulate the employment of transmission equipment the result would have been an impairment of the effective use of these facilities by anyone. The fundamental purpose of Congress in respect of broadcasting was the allocation and regulation of the use of radio frequencies by prohibiting such use except under license.\n In contradistinction to communication by telephone and telegraph, which the Communications Act recognizes as a common carrier activity and regulates accordingly in analogy to the regulation of rail and other carriers by the Interstate Commerce Commission,4 the Act recognizes that broadcasters are not common carriers and are not to be dealt with as such. 5 Thus the Act recognizes that the field of broadcasting is one of free competition. The sections dealing with broadcasting demonstrate that Congress has not, in its regulatory scheme, abandoned the principle of free competition, as it has done in the case of railroads,6 in respect of which regulation involves the suppression of wasteful practices due to competition, the regulation of rates and charges, and other measures \n\n[309 \nU.S. 470, 475]\n\u00a0\n which are unnecessary if free competition is to be permitted.\n An important element of public interest and convenience affecting the issue of a license is the ability of the licensee to render the best practicable service to the community reached by his broadcasts. That such ability may be assured the Act contemplates inquiry by the Commission, inter alia, into an applicant's financial qualifications to operate the proposed station. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n But the Act does not essay to regulate the business of the licensee. The Commission is given no supervisory control of the programs, of business management or of policy. In short, the broadcasting field is open to anyone, provided there be an available frequency over which he can broadcast without interference to others, if he shows his competency, the adequacy of his equipment, and financial ability to make good use of the assigned channel.\n The policy of the Act is clear that no person is to have anything in the nature of a property right as a result of the granting of a license. Licenses are limited to a maximum of three years' duration, may be revoked, and need not be renewed. Thus the channels presently occupied remain free for a new assignment to another licensee in the interest of the listening public.\n Plainly it is not the purpose of the Act to protect a licensee against competition but to protect the public. Congress intended to leave competition in the business of broadcasting where it found it, to permit a licensee who was not interfering electrically with other broadcasters to survive or succumb according to his ability to make his programs attractive to the public.\n This is not to say that the question of competition between a proposed station and one operating under an \n\n[309 \nU.S. 470, 476]\n\u00a0\n existing license is to be entirely disregarded by the Commission, and, indeed, the Commission's practice shows that it does not disregard that question. It may have a vital and important bearing upon the ability of the applicant adequately to serve his public; it may indicate that both stations,-the existing and the proposed-will go under, with the result that a portion of the listening public will be left without adequate service; it may indicate that, by a division of the field, both stations will be compelled to render inadequate service. These matters, however, are distinct from the consideration that, if a license be granted, competition between the licensee and any other existing station may cause economic loss to the latter. If such economic loss were a valid reason for refusing a license this would mean that the Commission's function is to grant a monopoly in the field of broadcasting, a result which the Act itself expressly negatives,8 which Congress would not have contemplated without granting the Commission powers of control over the rates, programs, and other activities of the business of broadcasting.\n We conclude that economic injury to an existing station is not a separate and independent element to be taken into consideration by the Commission in determining whether it shall grant or withhold a license.\n Second. It does not follow that, because the licensee of a station cannot resist the grant of a license to another, on the ground that the resulting competition may work economic injury to him, he has no standing to appeal from an order of the Commission granting the application.\n Section 402(b) of the Act, 47 U.S.C.A.  402(b), provides for an appeal to the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia (1) by an applicant for a license or permit, or (2) 'by any other person aggrieved or whose interests are adversely affected \n\n[309 \nU.S. 470, 477]\n\u00a0\n by any decision of the Commission granting or refusing any such application.'\n The petitioner insists that as economic injury to the respondent was not a proper issue before the Commission it is impossible that  402(b) was intended to give the respondent standing to appeal, since absence of right implies absence of remedy. This view would deprive subsection (2) of any substantial effect.\n Congress had some purpose in enacting section 402(b)(2). It may have been of opinion that one likely to be financially injured by the issue of a license would be the only person having a sufficient interest to bring to the attention of the appellate court errors of law in the action of the Commission in granting the license. It is within the power of Congress to confer such standing to prosecute an appeal. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n We hold, therefore, that the respondent had the requisite standing to appeal and to raise, in the court below, any relevant question of law in respect of the order of the Commission.\n Third. Examination of the findings and grounds of decision set forth by the Commission discloses that the findings were sufficient to comply with the requirements of the Act in respect of the public interest, convenience, or necessity involved in the issue of the permit. In any event, if the findings were not as detailed upon this subject as might be desirable, the attack upon them is not that the public interest is not sufficiently protected but only that the financial interests of the respondent have not been considered. We find no reason for abrogating the Commission's order for lack of adequate findings.\n Fourth. The respondent here renews a contention made in the Court of Appeals to the effect that the Com- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 470, 478]\n\u00a0\n mission used as evidence certain data and reports in its files without permitting the respondent, as intervenor before the Commission, the opportunity of inspecting them. The Commission disavows the use of such material as evidence in the cause and the Court of Appeals has found the disavowal veracious and sufficient. We are not disposed to disturb its conclusion.\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS took no part in the decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of June 19, 1934, c. 652, 48 Stat. 1064; Act of June 5, 1936, c. 511, 49 Stat. 1475; Act of May 20, 1937, c. 229, 50 Stat. 189, 47 U.S.C.  151 et seq., 47 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Sanders Brothers Radio Station v.

Act of June 19, 1934, 48 Stat. 1064, as amended by the Act of June 5, 1936, 49 Stat. 1475, and by the Act of May 20, 1937, 50 Stat. 189, 47 U.S.C.  151 et seq., 47 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq.\n Insofar as action of the Federal Communications Commission is subject to judicial review, the Act bifurcates access to the lower federal courts according to the nature of the subject matter before the Commission. Barring the exceptions immediately to be noted,  402(a) assimi- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 132, 134]\n\u00a0\n lates 'suits to enforce, enjoin, set aside, annul, or suspend any order of the Commission under this Act (chapter)' to the scheme of the Act of October 22, 1913, 38 Stat. 219, 28 U.S.C.A.  41, 43-48, pertaining to judicial review of orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Therefore as to the general class of orders dealt with by  402(a) jurisdiction rests exclusively in the appropriate district court, specially constituted, with direct appeal to this Court. Excepted from this scheme of jurisdiction is 'any order of the Commission granting or refusing an application for a construction permit for a radio station, or for a radio station license, or for renewal of an existing radio station license, or for modification of an existing radio station license, or suspending a radio operator's license.' These five types of orders, thus placed beyond the jurisdiction of the district courts, are then affirmatively dealt with by  402(b). As to them, that provision gives an appeal 'from decisions of the Commission to the (United States) Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia,' with ultimate resort to this Court only upon writ of certiorari.\n Our problem, then, is to apply this scheme of jurisdiction to the situation before us. Acting under  310(b) of the Communications Act, the Commission refused consent to an assignment to the Columbia Broadcasting System of California of a radio station license held by the Associated Broadcasters. Columbia and Associated thereupon sought in the Court of Appeals for the District review of the Commission's denial of consent. The Commission moved to dismiss the appeals for want of jurisdiction. The court below, with one justice dissenting, denied the motions and entertained jurisdiction. 71 App.D.C. 206, 108 F.2d 737.\n The crux of the controversy is whether an order of the Commission, in the exercise of its authority under  310(b), denying consent to an assignment of a radio station license is an order 'refusing an application ... for \n\n[311 \nU.S. 132, 135]\n\u00a0\n a radio station license,' within the meaning of  402(a) and (b). If it is, the court below was seized of jurisdiction. If it is not, that court was without it. In the language quoted in the margin, Congress has made the choice and it is for us to ascertain it. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Primarily, our task is to read what Congress has written. As a matter of common speech, the excepted types of orders which alone can come before the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia do not include an order refusing the consent required by  310(b). Refusing 'an application ... for a radio station license' is hardly an apt way to characterize refusal to assent to the transfer of such a license from an existing holder. Nor is there anything to indicate that the peculiar idiom of the industry or of administrative practice has modified \n\n[311 \nU.S. 132, 136]\n\u00a0\n the meaning that ordinary speech assigns to the language. Instead of assimilating the requirements for transfers to applications for new licenses or renewals, the Act as a whole sharply differentiates between them. Different considerations of policy may govern the granting or withholding of licenses from those which pertain to assent to transfers. And Congress saw fit to fashion different provisions for them. Compare  307, 308, 309, and 319 with  310(b). There are also differences in the formulated administrative practice for disposing of applications for station licenses and requests for consents to transfer. Nor do some similarities in treatment make irrelevant the differences.\n A sensible reading of the jurisdictional provisions in the context of the substantive provisions to which they relate gives no warrant for denying significance to the classification made by Congress between those orders for which review can only come before the local district courts, and those five types of orders, explicitly characterized, which alone can come before the Court of Appeals for the District. And an order denying consent to an application for a transfer is not one of those five, for it is not an application for 'a radio station license' in any fair intendment of that category.\n What thus appears clear from a reading of the Communications Act itself is not modified by the collateral materials which have been pressed upon us. That both sides invoke the same extrinsic aids, one to fortify and the other to nullify the conclusion we have reached, in itself proves what dubious light they shed. What was said in Committee Reports and some remarks by the proponent of the measure in the Senate are sufficiently ambiguous, insofar as this narrow issue is concerned, to invite mutually destructive dialectic but not strong enough either to strengthen or weaken the force of what \n\n[311 \nU.S. 132, 137]\n\u00a0\n Congress has enacted. See Sen.Rep. No. 781, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 9-10; House Rep. No. 1918, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 49-50; 78 Cong.Rec. 8825-26. This leaves for consideration only the bearing of an earlier decision by the Court of Appeals for the District on this very question, arising under the predecessor of the Communications Act, the Radio Act of 1927, 44 Stat. 1162, as amended, 46 Stat. 844, 47 U.S.C.A.  81 et seq. In that Act  16 covered, for present purposes, the provisions of  402(b) of the Communications Act. Inter alia, it provided for appeals to the court below by 'any applicant for a station license.' Construing that provision, the court below in Pote v. Federal Radio Commission, 62 App.D.C. 303, 67 F.2d 509, held that it was without jurisdiction over an appeal by a transferee to whom consent to a transfer had been denied. The present  402 was adopted after this decision and another decision by the same court within this field of jurisdiction (Goss v. Federal Radio Commission, 62 App.D.C. 301, 67 F.2d 507) had been presumably brought to the attention of Congress. Hearings on S. 2910, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 44-45. On the one hand it is insisted that, in the light of these circumstances, the construction in the Pote decision was impliedly enacted by Congress, while respondents urge that differences in the provisions regarding the Commission's power over consent to transfers destroy the significance of the Pote case. But these changes in  310(b), which stiffened the control of the Commission over transfers, are wholly unrelated to the technical question of jurisdiction with which we are now concerned. We are not, however, willing to rest decision on any doctrine concerning the implied enactment of a judicial construction upon reenactment of a statute. The persuasion that lies behind that doctrine is merely one factor in the total effort to give fair meaning to language. And so, at the lowest, the Pote case certainly \n\n[311 \nU.S. 132, 138]\n\u00a0\n does not detract from, but if anything reenforces, the construction required by a clear-eyed reading of the statute.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 402: '(a) The provisions of the Act of October 22, 1913 (38 Stat. 219), relating to the enforcing or setting aside of the orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission, are hereby made applicable to suits to enforce, enjoin, set aside, annul, or suspend any order of the Commission under this Act (chapter) (except any order of the Commission granting or refusing an application for a construction permit for a radio station, or for a radio station license, or for renewal of an existing radio station license, or for modification of an existing radio station license, or suspending a radio operator's license), and such suits are hereby authorized to be brought as provided in that Act. ...\n'(b) An appeal may be taken, in the manner hereinafter provided, from decisions of the Commission to the (United States) Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in any of the following cases:\n\n'(1) By any applicant for a construction permit for a radio station, or for a radio station license, or for renewal of an existing radio station license, or for modification of an existing radio station license, whose application is refused by the Commission.\n\n'(2) By any other person aggrieved or whose interests are adversely affected by any decision of the Commission granting or refusing any such application.\n\n'(3) By any radio operator whose license has been suspended by the Commission.'\n\n If the assignee is covered  402(b)(1) the assignor would be within  402(b) (2). \n\n\n\n\n","34":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFEDERAL HOUSING ADMINISTRATION, REGION NO. 4 v. BURR(1940)\nNo. 354\nArgued: January 31, 1940Decided: February 12, 1940\n\n\n\n\n[309 \nU.S. 242, 243]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert H. Jackson, Atty. Gen., and Sidney J. Kaplan, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Gus O. Nations, of St. Louis, Mo., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question presented here is whether the Federal Housing Administration is subject to garnishment for moneys due to an employee. The Supreme Court of the State of Michigan held that it was. Burr v. Heffner, 289 Mich. 91, 286 N.W. 169. We granted certiorari, \n308 \nU.S. 541\n, 60 S.Ct. 129, 84 L.Ed. --, in view of the importance of the problem and the confused state of the authorities on the right to garnishee recently created agencies or corporations of the federal government. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n In 1930 respondent obtained final judgment in Michigan against one Heffner and one Brooks. In 1938 petitioner was served with a writ of garnishment issued by the Michigan court. \n2\n Petitioner appeared and filed an answer and disclosure stating that Brooks was no longer connected with it due to his death subsequent to service of the writ but admitting that it owed Brooks at the time \n\n[309 \nU.S. 242, 244]\n\u00a0\n of his death $71.11. Its answer further asserted that it was 'an agency of the United States Government and is, therefore, not subject to garnishee proceedings.' On motion of respondent judgment was entered against petitioner for the amount of its indebtedness to Brooks and execution was allowed thereunder. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Michigan that judgment was affirmed.\n The problem here is unlike that in Buchanan v. Alexander, 4 How. 20, where creditors of seamen of the frigate Constitution were not allowed to attach their wages in the hands of a disbursing officer of the federal government. That ruling was derived from the principle that the United States cannot be sued without its consent. There no consent whatsoever to 'sue and be sued' had been given. Here the situation is different. Sec. 1 of Title 1 of the National Housing Act (Act of June 27, 1934, c. 847, 48 Stat. 1246) authorized the President 'to create a Federal Housing Administration all of the powers of which shall be exercised by a Federal Housing Administrator.' That section was amended in 1935 (Act of August 23, 1935, c. 614, 49 Stat. 684, 722) by adding thereto the provision that 'The Administrator shall, in carrying out the provisions of this title and titles II and III, be authorized, in his official capacity, to sue and be sued in any court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal.' 12 U.S.C.A.  1702\n\n\n Since consent to 'sue and be sued' has been given by Congress, the problem here merely involves a determination of whether or not garnishment comes within the scope of that authorization. No question as to the power of Congress to waive the governmental immunity is present. For there can be no doubt that Congress has full power to endow the Federal Housing Administration with the government's immunity from suit or to determine the extent to which it may be subjected to the judicial process. Federal Land Bank v. Priddy, 295 U.S. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 242, 245]\n\u00a0\n 229, 55 S.Ct. 705; Keifer & Keifer v. Reconstruction Finance Corporation, \n306 \nU.S. 381\n, 59 S.Ct. 516.\n As indicated in Keifer & Keifer v. Reconstruction Finance Corporation, supra, we start from the premise that such waivers by Congress of governmental immunity in case of such federal instrumentalities should be liberally construed. This policy is in line with the current disfavor of the doctrine of governmental immunity from suit, as evidenced by the increasing tendency of Congress to waive the immunity where federal governmental corporations are concerned. Keifer & Keifer v. Reconstruction Finance Corporation, supra. Hence, when Congress establishes such an agency, authorizes it to engage in commercial and business transactions with the public, and permits it to 'sue and be sued', it cannot be lightly assumed that restrictions on that authority are to be implied. Rather if the general authority to 'sue and be sued' is to be delimited by implied exceptions, it must be clearly shown that certain types of suits are not consistent with the statutory or constitutional scheme,3 that an implied restriction of the general authority is necessary to avoid grave interference with the performance of a governmental function, or that for other reasons it was plainly the purpose of Congress to use the 'sue and be sued' clause in a narrow sense. In the absence of such showing, it must be presumed that when Congress launched a governmental agency into the commercial world and endowed it with authority to 'sue or be sued', that agency is not less amenable to judicial process than a private enterprise under like circumstances would be.\n Clearly the words 'sue and be sued' in their normal connotation embrace all civil process incident to the commencement or continuance of legal proceedings. Garnishment and attachment commonly are part and \n\n[309 \nU.S. 242, 246]\n\u00a0\n parcel of the process, provided by statute, for the collection of debts. \n4\n In Michigan a writ of garnishment is a civil process at law, in the nature of an equitable attachment. See Posselius v. First National Bank-Detroit, 264 Mich. 687, 251 N.W. 429, 90 A.L.R. 342. But however it may be denominated, whether legal or equitable,5 and whenever it may be available, whether prior to6 or after final judgment,7 garnishment is a well-known remedy available to suitors. To say that Congress did not intend to include such civil process in the words 'sue and be sued' would in general deprive suits of some of their efficacy. Hence, in absence of special circumstances, we assume that when Congress authorized federal instrumentalities of the type here involved to 'sue and be sued' it used those words in their usual and ordinary sense. \n8\n State decisions barring gar- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 242, 247]\n\u00a0\n nishment against a public body though it may 'sue and be sued'9 are not persuasive here as they reflect purely local policies concerning municipalities, counties and the like, and involve considerations not germane to the problem of amenability to suit of the modern federal governmental corporation.\n Our conclusion is strengthened by the legislative history of the many recently created governmental agencies or corporations. It shows that in but few instances was a proviso added to the 'sue and be sued' clause prohibiting garnishment or attachment. \n10\n The fact that in the run of recent statutes no such exceptions were made and that in only a few of them were any special prohibitions included adds corroborative weight to our conclusion that such civil process was intended.\n Up to this point, however, petitioner does not raise its major objections. Rather it grounds its claim to immunity from garnishment largely on statutory construction and on matters of policy. As to the former, it relies heavily on the fact that the authority to 'sue and be sued' excludes cases unrelated to the Administrator's own duties or liabilities since the statute provides that the 'Administrator shall, in carrying out the provisions of this title (Title I) and titles II and III' be authorized to \n\n[309 \nU.S. 242, 248]\n\u00a0\n 'sue and be sued.' Petitioner therefore contends that Congress has consented to a suit against the Administrator only where the plaintiff is a party to a transaction with him which in turn is related to 'carrying out' the provisions of those titles. Title I contains the only provisions material here. Sec. 1 gave the Administrator, inter alia authority to appoint such officers and employees 'as he may find necessary;' to 'prescribe their authorities, duties, responsibilities, and tenure and fix their compensation, without regard to the provisions of other laws applicable to the employment or compensation of officers or employees of the United States;' and to 'make such expenditures (including expenditures for personal services and rent at the seat of government and elsewhere, for law books and books of reference, and for paper, printing, and binding) as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this title and titles II and III (of this chapter), without regard to any other provisions of law governing the expenditure of public funds.' Sec. 2, 12 U.S.C.A.  1703, gave limited authority to the administrator to insure financial institutions;  3, 12 U.S.C.A.  1704, authority to make loans to such institutions. Since the Administrator could be sued, in his official capacity, in 'carrying out' the provisions of Title I, it would seem clear that such suits as were based on employment contracts made pursuant to the authority granted by  1 were permitted. Accordingly, it seems clear that Brooks, whose claim11 was garnisheed by respondent, could have sued on that claim and obtained the benefit of that civil process which was available in the appropriate state or federal proceeding. Federal Land Bank v. Priddy, supra. To allow respondent to reach that claim through a writ of garnishment is \n\n[309 \nU.S. 242, 249]\n\u00a0\n therefore not to enlarge petitioner's liability nor to add one iota to the scope of  1. For the end result is simply to allow a suit for the collection of a claim on which Congress expressly made petitioner suable. The mere change in the payee does not make the suit unrelated to the duties and liabilities of the Administrator under  1.\n But petitioner strongly urges considerations of policy against this conclusion and stresses the heavy burdens which would be imposed on such governmental instrumentalities if garnishment were permitted. It asserts that the task of preparing answers, disclosures and returns to numerous garnishment processes in the courts of each of the states would appreciably impede the federal functions of such an agency. It points to various state legislation regulating and restricting garnishment against public bodies and concludes that if immunity of public bodies from garnishment is to be abrogated, it should be done by legislation so that the remedy could be appropriately molded to fit the needs of government.\n In our view, however, the bridge was crossed when Congress abrogated the immunity by this 'sue and be sued' clause. And no such grave interference with the federal function has been shown to lead us to imply that Congress did not intend the full consequences of what it said. Hence, considerations of convenience, cost and efficiency12 which have been urged here are for Congress which, as we have said, has full authority to make such restrictions on the 'sue and be sued' clause as seem to it appropriate or necessary.\n There is some point made of the fact that suit was brought against the Federal Housing Administration rather than against the Administrator. But when the \n\n[309 \nU.S. 242, 250]\n\u00a0\n statute authorizes suits by or against the Administrator 'in his official capacity' we conclude that that permits actions by or against the Federal Housing Administration. The Administrator acts for and on behalf of the Federal Housing Administration, since by express terms of the Act all of the powers of the latter 'shall be exercised' by him. Hence action by him in the name of the Federal Housing Administration would be action in his official capacity.\n Petitioner claims that execution should not have been allowed under the judgment. The Act permits the Administrator 'to sue and be sued in any court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal.' Whether by Michigan law execution under such a judgment may be had is, like the availability of garnishment, Federal Land Bank v. Priddy, supra, a state question. And so far as the federal statute is concerned, execution is not barred, for it would seem to be part of the civil process embraced within the 'sue and be sued' clause. That does not, of course, mean that any funds or property of the United States can be held responsible for this judgment. Claims against a corporation are normally collectible only from corporate assets. That is true here. Congress has specifically directed that all such claims against the Federal Housing Administration of the type here involved 'shall be paid out of funds made available by this Act (chapter).'  1. Hence those funds, and only those, are subject to execution. The result is that only those funds which have been paid over to the Federal Housing Administration in accordance with  1 and which are in its possession, severed from Treasury funds and Treasury control, are subject to execution. Since no consent to reach government funds has been given, execution thereon would run counter to Buchanan v. Alexander, supra. To conclude otherwise would be to allow proceedings against the United States where it had not waived its immunity. This re- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 242, 251]\n\u00a0\n striction on execution may as a practical matter deprive it of utility, since funds of petitioner appear to be deposited with the Treasurer of the United States and payments and other obligations are made through the Chief Disbursing Officer of the Treasury. 13 But that is an inherent limitation, under this statutory scheme, on the legal remedies which Congress has provided. And since respondent obtains its right to sue from Congress, it necessarily must take it subject to such restrictions as have been imposed. The fact that execution may prove futile is one of the notorious incidents of litigation, as is the fact that execution is not an indispensable adjunct of the judicial process. \n14\n\u00a0\n\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice MURPHY did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Garnishment of wages due an employee of the United States Shipping Board Merchant Fleet Corporation was disallowed in MacCarthy v.

Peck caused the title of a savings bank account standing in her name to be transferred on the records of the bank to 'Edith M. Peck, in trust for Ethel Adelaide Field'. Miss Peck retained exclusive control over the account, with sole right of withdrawal and right of revocation, and gave no further notice of the existence of a trust.\n This suit was brought by Ethel Adelaide Field against the bank and the executors of Miss Peck to obtain a decree that the credit balance of the account belonged to the complainant. The executors denied the validity of the trust and claimed title. The District Court found in favor of the executors upon the ground that under the law of New Jersey there was no trust and no valid gift. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the judgment, holding that under a state statute the complainant was entitled to recover. In so ruling, the court declined \n\n[311 \nU.S. 169, 175]\n\u00a0\n to follow contrary decisions of the Chancery Court of New Jersey. 3 Cir., 108 F.2d 521. In view of the importance of the question thus presented, we granted certiorari. \n309 \nU.S. 652\n, 60 S.Ct. 890.\n In 1932, the legislature of New Jersey passed four statutes, in similar terms and approved on the same date, dealing with trust deposits in banks. The text of one of these provisions is set forth in the margin. \n1\n Prior to these statutes, it had been the law of New Jersey that a mere savings bank deposit made by a decedent in his own name as trustee for another, over which the decedent exercised complete control during his life, was insufficient to establish a gift inter vivos or to create a trust as against the decedent's legal representatives. Nicklas v. Parker, 69 N.J.Eq. 743, 61 A. 267, affirmed, 71 N.J.Eq. 777, 61 A. 267, 71 A. 1135, 14 Ann.Cas. 921; Johnson v. Savings Investment & Trust Company, 107 N.J.Eq. 547, 153 A. 382, affirmed, 110 N.J.Eq. 466, 160 A. 371.\n The statutes of 1932 came before the Chancery Court of New Jersey in 1936, in two cases decided independently by two Vice-Chancellors, Thatcher v. Trenton Trust Company, \n\n[311 \nU.S. 169, 176]\n\u00a0\n 119 N.J.Eq. 408, 182 A. 912, and Travers v. Reid, 119 N.J.Eq. 416, 182 A. 908. In the Thatcher case it appeared that the decedent, at the time of her death in 1934, had two bank balances standing to her credit 'in trust for Clifford Thatcher', the complainant. The bill was dismissed. The court found that there were no facts, beyond the mere opening of the account in that manner, 'in any wise tending to prove the declaration of a trust'. The court examined the legislation of 1932, which it was argued had changed the law of the State, and after considering possible purposes of the legislature and analyzing the language employed, which was deemed to be 'confused' and 'difficult to comprehend', the court decided that the legislation was inoperative to change the law applicable to the facts before the court. In the Travers case, the decedent had changed his bank account to his name 'in trust for Joseph Jennings', a minor. In a suit by the decedent's executrix to recover the money, a motion by the minor's guardian to strike the bill for want of equity and upon the ground that the fund was the property of the ward or held in trust for him, was denied. After stating the law as it stood before the statutes of 1932, the court concluded that they had not been effective to alter the previous legal requirements of a gift inter vivos or a valid trust. These cases were not reviewed by the Court of Errors and Appeals of New Jersey and, so far as appears, that court has not expressed an opinion upon the construction and effect of the statutory provisions. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[311 \nU.S. 169, 177]\n\u00a0\n The Circuit Court of Appeals found it impossible to distinguish the facts in the two Chancery cases from those shown here. The court recognized its duty to follow the law of the State and said that where that law had been determined by the state court of last resort its decision must be followed irrespective of the federal court's opinion of what the law ought to be. But the majority of the Circuit Court of Appeals ( 108 F.2d 526), took the view that it was not so bound by 'the pronouncements of other state courts' but might conclude that 'the decision does not truly express the state law'. The court held that the statute of 1932 was 'clearly constitutional and unambiguous' and that 'contrary decisions' of the Chancery Court of New Jersey were not binding. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court was reversed.\n We think that this ruling was erroneous. The highest state court is the final authority on state law (Beals v. Hale, 4 How. 37, 54; Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64, 78\n, 58 S.Ct. 817, 822, 114 A.L.R. 1487), but it is still the duty of the federal courts, where the state law supplies the rule of decision,3 to ascertain and apply that law even though it has not been expounded by the highest court of the State. See Ruhlin v. New York Life Insurance Co., \n304 \nU.S. 202, 209\n, 58 S.Ct. 860, 862. An intermediate state court in declaring and applying the state law is acting as an organ of the State and its deter- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 169, 178]\n\u00a0\n mination, in the absence of more convincing evidence of what the state law is, should be followed by a federal court in deciding a state question. We have declared that principle in West v. American Telephone and Telegraph Co., \n311 \nU.S. 223\n, 61 S.Ct. 179, decided this day. It is true that in that case an intermediate appellate court of the State had determined the immediate question as between the same parties in a prior suit, and the highest state court had refused to review the lower court's decision, but we set forth the broader principle as applicable to the decision of an intermediate court, in the absence of a decision by the highest court, whether the question is one of statute or common law.\n Here, the question was as to the construction and effect of a state statute. The federal court was not at liberty to undertake the determination of that question on its own reasoning independent of the construction and effect which the State itself accorded to its statute. That construction and effect are shown by the judicial action through which the State interprets and applies its legislation. That judicial action in this instance has been taken by the Chancery Court of New Jersey and we have no other evidence of the state law in this relation. Equity decrees in New Jersey are entered by the Chancellor, who constitutes the Court of Chancery,4 upon the advice of the Vice-Chancellors,5 and these decrees, like the judgments of the Supreme Court of New Jersey are subject to review only by the Court of Errors and Appeals. \n6\n We have held that the decision of the Supreme Court upon the construction of a state statute should be followed in the absence of an expression of a countervailing view by the State's highest court (Erie Railroad Co. v. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 169, 179]\n\u00a0\n Hilt, \n247 \nU.S. 97, 100\n, 101 S., 38 S.Ct. 435, 436; Erie Railroad Co. v. Duplak, \n286 \nU.S. 440, 444\n, 52 S.Ct. 610, 611), and we think that the decisions of the Court of Chancery are entitled to like respect as announcing the law of the State.\n While, of course, the decisions of the Court of Chancery are not binding on the Court of Errors and Appeals, a uniform rulign either by the Court of Chancery or by the Supreme Court over a course of years will not be set aside by the highest court 'except for cogent and important reasons'. Ramsey v. Hutchinson, 117 N.J.L. 222, 223, 187 A. 650, 651. It appears that ordinarily the decisions of the Court of Chancery, if they have not been disapproved, are treated as binding in later cases in chancery (Philadelphia & Camden Ferry Co. v. Johnson, 94 N.J.Eq. 296, 297, 121 A. 900), but there is always, as respondent urges, the possibility that a particular decision of the Court of Chancery will not be followed by the Supreme Court (see Flagg v. Johansen, 124 N.J.L. 456, 461, 12 A.2d 374) or even by the Court of Chancery itself. See Kicey v. Kicey, 112 N.J. Eq. 459, 461, 164 A. 684. It is the function of the court of last resort to resolve such conflicts as may be created by decisions of the lower courts and except in rare instances that function is performed and the law is settled accordingly. Here, however, there is no conflict of decision. Whether there ever will be, or the Court of Errors and Appeals will disapprove the rulings in the Thatcher and Travers cases, is merely a matter of conjecture. See West v. American Telephone and Telegraph Co., supra. At the present time the Thatcher and Travers cases stand as the only exposition of the law of the State with respect to the construction and effect of the statutes of 1932, and the Circuit Court of Appeals was not at liberty to reject these decisions merely because it did not agree with their reasoning.\n The question has practical aspects of great importance in the proper administration of justice in the federal \n\n[311 \nU.S. 169, 180]\n\u00a0\n courts. It is inadmissible that there should be one rule of state law for litigants in the state courts and another rule for litigants who bring the same question before the federal courts owing to the circumstance of diversity of citizenship. In the absence of any contrary showing, the rule of the Thatcher and Travers cases appears to be the one which would be applied in litigation in the state court, and whether believed to be sound or unsound, it should have been followed by the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and that of the District Court is affirmed.\n It is so ordered.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Chapter 40, New Jersey Session Laws of 1932, Section 1, is as follows:\n'1. Whenever any deposit shall be made with any savings bank, trust company or bank by any person in trust for another, and no other or further notice of the existence and terms of a legal and valid trust shall have been given in writing to the savings bank, trust company or bank, in the event of the death of the trustee, the same or any part thereof, together with the dividends or interest thereon, shall be paid to the person in trust for whom the said deposit was made, or to his or her legal representatives and the legal representatives of the deceased trustee shall not be entitled to the funds so deposited nor to the dividends or interest thereon notwithstanding that the funds so deposited may have been the property of the trustee; provided, that the person for whom the deposit was made, if a minor, shall not draw the same during his or her minority without the written consent of the legal representatives of said trustee'. See Revised Statutes of New Jersey, 1937, 17:9-4, N.J.S.A. 17:9- 4. \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] In Cutts v. Najdrowski, 1938, 123 N.J.Eq. 481, 198 A. 885, the Court of Errors and Appeals held that the validity of a trust of choses in action created by a transaction inter vivos was determined by the law of the place where the transaction occurred, in that case New York. In Trust Company of New Jersey v. Farawell, 1940, 127 N.J.Eq. 45, 11 A.2d 98, the Court of Errors and Appeals held that, where the decedent had made a deposit in her name in trust for her daughters, and the savings bank book was thereafter in the possession of the daughters and withdrawals were made upon the signatures of the mother and the daughters and were used for maintaining properties devised to the daughters by the mother shortly after the account was opened, there was sufficient evidence to show a presently effective trust. The court said that such a trust depends essentially upon the same principles 'that activate a gift inter vivos, comprising donative intent, delivery of the subject matter to the extent that delivery is possible or can be indicated, and the abdication by the donor of dominion over the subject matter.' Id., 127 N.J.Eq. page 48, 11 A. 2d 98, page 99.

His claim was based on a sheriff's deed consummating an execution sale under a judgment entered upon an award of the State Industrial Commission against Geraldine Oil Company. The respondent's title was derived through a conveyance by an assignee for the benefit of creditors of the same company, confirmed by a bankruptcy court. The respondent cross-petitioned for a judgment declaring the sheriff's sale to petitioner void and quieting respondent's title. The trial court directed a verdict for petitioner and entered judgment thereon, which the Supreme Court reversed.\n August 30, 1934, the Commission made an award to one Rainholt against Snyder, as employer and Geraldine Oil Company, as owner of the property. For payment of the award Geraldine Oil Company was secondarily liable.\n October 11, 1934, Geraldine Oil Company, being insolvent, assigned the property in question to a trustee for the benefit of creditors. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 294, 297]\n\u00a0\n December 8, 1934, the award in favor of Rainbolt was filed of record in a State District Court and became a judgment of that court.\n January 21, 1935, the assignee for the benefit of creditors sold the property to the respondent.\n September 13, 1935, execution issued on the Rainbolt judgment, and, September 17th, the sheriff levied on the property as property of the Geraldine Oil Co. The execution was issued on the theory that the assignment for the benefit of creditors was invalid, and the property, therefore, remained that of the assignor. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n October 24, 1935, Geraldine Oil Company was adjudged a voluntary bankrupt in the District Court of the United States for Western Oklahoma.\n November 12, 1935, the sheriff sold the property, pursuant to the execution, and the petitioner bought it. A notice of the adjudication in bankruptcy was read at the sale in the presence of the petitioner. On the same day the sheriff made return of the sale to the court out of which the execution issued.\n November 21, 1935, the trustee in bankruptcy filed in that court his objections to the conformation of the sheriff's sale, alleging, inter alia, that Geraldine Oil Company was insolvent when Rainbolt obtained judgment and had been so ever since; that the company had been adjudicated a bankrupt within four months of the securing of the lien under the execution, and that, by virtue of  67, sub. f, of the Bankruptcy Act, the lien was absolutely void.\n March 28, 1936, the court ordered that the sale of confirmed and granted the trustee in bankruptcy an exception to its action. The latter gave notice of appeal to the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, but it does not appear that he perfected an appeal. The order of confirmation was entered of record April 22, 1936. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 294, 298]\n\u00a0\n June 4, 1936, the respondent petitioned the United States District Court for confirmation of the sale of the property made to the respondent by the assignee for the benefit of creditors on January 21, 1935. The trustee in bankruptcy objected, but subsequently withdrew his objections and the referee made an order confirming the sale. The assignee then paid to the trustee the consideration received by him from the respondent as purchaser at the assignee's sale. It does not appear that the petitioner had notice of the application or was present at the hearing.\n June 10, 1936, the sheriff delivered a deed to the petitioner as purchaser at the execution sale.\n Both petition and answer allege that the respondent was in possession of the property at the time suit was brought, and we may assume that the petitioner never was in possession.\n The Supreme Court held that entry of the Commission's award in the State Court made it a judgment of that court; that such judgment did not constitute a lien on the property of Geraldine Oil Company in question; and that no lien was acquired until the levy of execution on September 17, 1935, about a month prior to the adjudication of the company as a bankrupt.\n The respondent asserted that, as the judgment in favor of Rainbolt was not a lien when Geraldine Oil Company assigned for the benefit of creditors, or when the assignee sold the property to the respondent, its title must prevail; and, in the alternative, that the same result must follow from the fact that since the lien of the levy was obtained less than four months prior to the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, it was voided by  67, sub. f.\n The Supreme Court stated that, if either of these contentions were sound, the petitioner could not prevail. It expressly declined to consider the efficacy of the sale by the assignee for the benefit of creditors to pass title \n\n[309 \nU.S. 294, 299]\n\u00a0\n to the respondent clear of the lien of the subsequent levy, and rested its decision upon its view of the effect of  67, sub. f. Since the judgment is based exclusively upon a federal ground, we have jurisdiction.\n s 67, sub. f, provides: 'All levies, judgments, attachments, or other liens, obtained through legal proceedings against a person who is insolvent, at any time within four months prior to the filing of a petition in bankruptcy against him, ... shall be deemed null and void in case he is adjudged a bankrupt, and the property affected by the levy, judgment, attachment, or other lien, ... shall be deemed wholly discharged and released from the same, and shall pass to the trustee as a part of the estate of the bankrupt, unless the court shall, on due notice, order that the right under such levy, judgment, attachment, or other lien shall be preserved for the benefit of the estate; and thereupon the same may pass to and shall be preserved by the trustee for the benefit of the estate as aforesaid. And the court may order such conveyance as shall be necessary to carry the purposes of this section into effect: Provided, That nothing herein contained shall have the effect to destroy or impair the title obtained by such levy, judgment, attachment, or other lien, of a bona fide purchaser for value who shall have acquired the same without notice or reasonable cause for inquiry.'\n The court held that the section, proprio vigore, nullified the lien of the levy so that the property passed to the trustee discharged thereof, and concluded that, since, at the time of the sheriff's sale, the property was discharged of the lien, the sale, and the deed delivered pursuant to it, were void; and, as a trustee's sale would pass title clear of the lien, the same result would follow from the bankruptcy court's validation, with the trustee's consent, of the assignee's sale previously made. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 294, 300]\n\u00a0\n The question is whether the state court was right in holding that, by force of  67, sub. f, the adjudication in bankruptcy automatically discharged the lien of the levy, irrespective of any action on the part of the trustee. Expressions supporting this view may be found in cases decided by federal courts,4 and statements squinting in the same direction have been made by this court. \n5\n In none of these instances, however, was the litigation between third parties, or between the lienor or one claiming title under an execution sale, and an opponent deriving title from the trustee in bankruptcy. In all of them a bankruptcy receiver or trustee instituted action in the bankruptcy court or some other court, or became a party to the proceeding in which the lien was acquired, to avoid the lien, or the bankrupt brought suit to avoid the lien as to property set apart to him as exempt in the bankruptcy case.\n Some state courts have definitely held that the adjudication operates automatically to nullify the lien which must be treated as void whenever and wherever drawn into question, either in a direct or a collateral proceeding, and whether the trustee in bankruptcy has taken the property into his possession or abandoned it. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n[309 \nU.S. 294, 301]\n\u00a0\n On the other hand, it was said in Taubel-Scott-Kitzmiller Co. v. Fox et al., \n264 \nU.S. 426, 429\n, 44 S.Ct. 396, 397: 'For the statute does not, as a matter of substantive law, declare void every lien obtained through legal proceedings within four months of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy.' The court there pointed out that a number of issues of fact must be resolved before it can be determined that the lien is void. And, in Pigg & Son v. United States, for Use of Leach, 10 Cir., 81 F.2d 334, 337, it was held that liens obtained in judicial proceedings within four months of the filing of the petition are not void, but voidable in a proper suit, and that the property affected by the lien does not automatically pass to the trustee, discharged of the lien.\n In Connell v. Walker, \n291 \nU.S. 1, 3\n, 54 S.Ct. 257, this court indicated that the operation of  67, sub. f, is not automatic, since the trustee in bankruptcy has an election either to avoid the lien, or to be subrogated to it for the benefit of the bankrupt estate.\n A number of state courts have held, and we think rightly, that the section is intended for the benefit of creditors of the bankrupt and, therefore, does not avoid liens as against all the world but only as against the trustee and those claiming under him. \n7\n It is settled, however, that not only may the trustee avoid the lien (Taubel-Scott-Kitzmiller Co. v. Fox et al., supra; Connell v. Walker, supra), but that the bankrupt may assert its invalidity as respects property set apart to him as exempt in the bankruptcy proceeding. Chicago, B. & Q.R. Co. v. Hall, \n229 \nU.S. 511\n, 33 S.Ct. 885. But the lien is not avoided for the \n\n[309 \nU.S. 294, 302]\n\u00a0\n benefit of the bankrupt save as to his exempt property or nullified as respects other lienors or third parties. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n Although  67, sub. f, unequivocally declares that the lien shall be deemed null and void, and the property affected by it shall be deemed wholly discharged and released, the section makes it clear that this is so only under specified conditions. At the date of creation of the lien the bankrupt must have been insolvent; the lien must have been acquired within four months of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy; and the property affected must not have been sold to a bona fide purchaser. Furthermore, the lien is preserved if the trustee elects to enforce it for the benefit of the estate. These conditions create issues of fact which, as between the trustee, or one claiming under him, and the lienor, or one claiming by virtue of the lien, the parties are entitled to have determined judicially. The courses open to the trustee under the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 were to proceed to have the lien declared void, by plenary suit,9 or by intervention in the court where it was obtained,10 or by applying, in the bankruptcy cause, to restrain enforcement,11 as might be appropriate in the circumstances.\n In the instant case the trustee intervened in the state court and opposed the confirmation of the execution sale \n\n[309 \nU.S. 294, 303]\n\u00a0\n on the ground that  67, sub. f, had avoided and discharged the lien of the levy. The issue was decided against him and he did not appeal. Later, when the respondent, who had purchased at the assignee's sale, asked the bankruptcy court to confirm that sale, the trustee withdrew his objections to confirmation and accepted from the assignee the consideration received from the respondent as purchaser at the latter's sale. The trustee's acquiescence in the confirmation of the sale to the respondent would seem to be at least a tacit assertion that the levy of the execution did not constitute an encumbrance upon respondent's title. But we think, if in other circumstances the trustee's conduct could amount to an election to avoid the lien, it can have no such effect here, in view of the prior decision against him on that issue in the state court.\n We are of opinion that the trustee, having raised the issue in the state court, was bound by the final decision of that tribunal. The estoppel of the judgment of the state court extended not only to him but to the respondent as his transferee. This conclusion requires reversal of the judgment.\n We do not pass upon the question whether the title of the respondent, derived from the sale of the property to it by the assignee for the benefit of creditors, is, by virtue of that sale, superior to the title of the petitioner. This is a question of state law which the Court below remains free to decide.\n The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n So ordered.\n Reversed and remanded, with directions.\n Mr. Justice MURPHY took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Pauline Oil & Gas Co. v.

CO. v. UNITED STATES(1940)\nNo. 15\nArgued: Decided: November 12, 1940\n\n\n\n\n[311 \nU.S. 15, 16]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Frank Gibbons, of Buffalo, N.Y., for petitioners.\n Mr. Edwin J. Culligan, of Buffalo, N.Y., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The United States brought this suit on behalf of George S. Hallenbeck to recover upon a bond given by Fleisher Engineering & Construction Company and Joseph A. Bass, with their sureties, and providing for the payment for labor and material furnished under a contract between the principals on the bond and the United States for the construction of a certain housing project. Part of the labor required by the contract was performed by Hallenbeck for a subcontractor with the approval of the contractors. The suit was brought under the Miller Act of August 24, 1935, 40 U.S.C. 270b, 40 U.S.C.A.  270b. Plaintiff obtained a summary judgment ( D.C., 30 F.Supp. 964) which the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 2 Cir., 107 F.2d 925.\n The applicable provision of the Miller Act is set forth in the margin. 1 The question is whether the giving of \n\n[311 \nU.S. 15, 17]\n\u00a0\n the required written notice to the contractor was sufficient, as it was not sent by 'registered mail'. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that as the receipt of written notice was conceded and the contents of the notice were adequate, the statute was satisfied. In view of alleged conflict with the decision in United States for Use and Benefit of John A. Denie's Sons Co. v. Bass, 6 Cir., 111 F.2d 965, we granted certiorari. \n309 \nU.S. 693\n, 60 S.Ct. 886\n\n\n In construing the earlier Act, the Hurd Act, 40 U.S.C.A.  270, for which the Miller Act is a substitute, we observed that it was intended to be highly remedial and should be construed liberally. United States for Use of Alexander Bryant Co. v. New York Steam Fitting Co., \n235 \nU.S. 327, 337\n, 35 S.Ct. 108, 111; Illinois Surety Co. v. John Davis Co ., \n244 \nU.S. 376, 380\n, 37 S.Ct. 614, 616; Fleischmann Construction Co. v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 349, 360\n, 46 S.Ct. 284, 289. We recognized that the statute created a new right of action and that compliance with the prescribed limitation was essential to the assertion of the right conferred. Accordingly, as it was provided that a material-man could not bring suit on the contractor's bond in the name of the United States within six months from completion and settlement, the Court held that \n\n[311 \nU.S. 15, 18]\n\u00a0\n this provision plainly conditioned the right to sue. United States ex rel. Texas Portland Cement Co. v. McCord, \n223 \nU.S. 157, 162\n, 163 S., 34 S.Ct. 550, 552, 553. That ruling was distinguished in the case of the Alexander Bryant Company, supra (\n235 \nU.S. 327\n, 35 S.Ct. 113) where it was held that the provision of the Act requiring notice to be given to other creditors by the creditor availing himself of the right to sue within the specified year, if the Government did not bring suit within six months after completion, was not 'of the essence of jurisdiction over the case' or 'a condition of the liability' of the surety on the bond. In short, a requirement which is clearly made a condition precedent to the right to sue must be given effect, but in determining whether a provision is of that character the statute must be liberally construed so as to accomplish its purpose. 'Technical rules otherwise protecting sureties from liability have never been applied in proceedings under this statute'. Illinois Surety Co. v. John Davis Co., supra (\n244 \nU.S. 376\n, 37 S.Ct. 616). The same principle should govern the application of the Miller Act.\n In the instant case, we may lay on one side the fact that the notice was addressed to the project engineer. As the court below said, it was admitted that the notice was in writing and was sent by mail and that it reached one of the two contractors who had jointly and severally agreed to perform the contract. And at this bar, the actual receipt of the notice and the sufficiency of its statements have not been challenged.\n In giving the statute a reasonable construction in order to effect its remedial purpose, we think that a distinction should be drawn between the provision explicitly stating the condition precedent to the right to sue and the provision as to the manner of serving notice. The structure of the statute indicates the distinction. The proviso, which defines the condition precedent to suit, states that the material-man or laborer 'shall have a \n\n[311 \nU.S. 15, 19]\n\u00a0\n right of action upon the said payment bond upon giving written notice to said contractor' within ninety days from the date of final performance. The condition as thus expressed was fully met. Then the statute goes on to provide for the mode of service of the notice. 'Such notice shall be served by mailing the same by registered mail, postage prepaid', or 'in any manner' in which the United States marshal 'is authorized by law to serve summons'. We think that the purpose of this provision as to manner of service was to assure receipt of the notice, not to make the described method mandatory so as to deny right of suit when the required written notice within the specified time had actually been given and received. In the face of such receipt, the reason for a particular mode of service fails. It is not reasonable to suppose that Congress intended to insist upon an idle form. Rather, we think that Congress intended to provide a method which would afford sufficient proof of service when receipt of the required written notice was not shown.\n In this view we conclude that the Circuit Court of Appeals correctly disposed of the case and its judgment is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 2 of the Act of August 24, 1935, c. 642, 49 Stat. 794, 40 U.

His application and a competing one were heard by an examiner. The Commission, on May 1, 1936, denied respondent's application on the sole ground that he was financially disqualified. He appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and the Commission's decision was reversed. Heitmeyer v. Federal Communications Commission, 68 App.D.C. 180, 95 F.2d 91. To proceed in conformity with this opinion, the case was remanded to the Commission.\n After Heitmeyer's appeal two other applications for the same facilities were filed with the Commission. Following intermediate litigation, needless here to recount, the Commission directed that respondent's case be reopened in conjunction with the pending rival applica- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 146, 148]\n\u00a0\n tions.

But the Commission's duty was to apply the statutory standard in deciding which of the applicants was to receive a permit after it fell into legal error as well as before. If, in the Commission's judgment, new evidence was necessary to discharge its duty, the fact of a previously erroneous denial should not, according to the principles enunciated in the Pottsville case, supra, bar it from access to the necessary evidence for correct judgment.\n The judgment is reversed, with directions to dissolve the writ of mandamus and to dismiss respondent's petition.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concurs in the result. \n\n\n\n","39":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGENERAL AMERICAN TANK CAR CORP. v.

The answer admitted the execution of the agreement \n\n[308 \nU.S. 422, 424]\n\u00a0\n but pleaded that payment of the sum demanded would amount to the making of a rebate, contrary to the provisions of the Elkins Act. \n1\n The District Court rendered judgment for the petitioner which the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding the respondent entitled to the full amount claimed. \n2\n We granted certiorari on account of the importance of the question involved and of the \n\n[308 \nU.S. 422, 425]\n\u00a0\n allegation that the judgment was not in accord with prior decisions of this court. \n308 \nU.S. 533\n, 60 S.Ct. 85, 84 L.Ed. --.\n The petitioner is a corporation, unaffiliated with any railroad, which owns and leases tank cars to railroads and to shippers for use in transportation in interstate commerce. The respondent is a wholly owned subsidiary of El Dorado Oil Works, a manufacturer of coconut oil operating a plant at Berkeley, California, and brought the action as assignee of the latter's rights under the lease.\n September 28, 1933, the petitioner and the Oil Works entered into an agreement whereby the former leased to the latter fifty tank cars designated in the contract as 'permanent cars', at a rental of $27.50 per car per month. The petitioner agreed to supply the Oil Works with such additional cars as it might need for the shipment of its products, on a rental basis of $30 per car per month, these to be ordered from time to time as needed and returned when no longer required.\n The contract provided that the petitioner would collect, and credit to the rental account of the Oil Works each month, all mileage earned by the cars while in the Oil Works' service, 'according to and subject to all rules of the tariffs of the railroads.' The petitioner was to pay the cost of repairs and maintenance but the Oil Works was to be responsible for damage or destruction of the cars while on privately owned tracks.\n The leased cars were used by the Oil Works for shipment of its products. Such use was important to the Oil Works since the railroads serving its plant were not prepared to furnish shippers a full supply of the kind of cars needed for carrying the oils in question. The railroad tariffs, though stating rates on the Oil Works' products when shipped in tank cars, disclaimed any obligation to furnish cars of the requisite type. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 422, 426]\n\u00a0\n The carriers maintain tariffs applicable to the allowances to be made to car owners for the use of tank cars, which provide for payment of one and one-half cents per car mile loaded and empty. The tariffs also embody rules which, during part of the period in controversy, stated that mileage payments would be made only to the party whose reporting marks appeared upon the cars and during part of the period that 'mileage for the use of cars of private ownership will be paid for loaded and empty movements only to the car owner-not to a lessee.' The rules precluded payment of the mileage allowance to the Oil Works under the circumstances of this case, since the lease stipulated that all the leased cars should bear the reporting marks of the petitioner.\n The petitioner complied with the provisions of the agreement until July 2, 1934, when the Interstate Commerce Commission rendered its decision in Use of Privately Owned Refrigerator Cars, 201 I.C.C. 323, in which it considered the payment of mileage allowances to shippers either directly or through car owners, which payments exceeded the total of the agreed rental for the use of the cars and any additional actual expenses of the shipper in connection with the cars. In that case the Commission held that such payments operated to give the lessee transportation of his products at lower rates than those paid by other shippers who use cars furnished by the carriers and thus amounted to a rebate from the published transportation rates. The petitioner's practice had been to collect the mileage, deduct the rental due, and pay over the balance monthly. After the rendition of the Commission's decision the petitioner collected the mileage from the railroads, credited the Oil Works with the rental due, retained the balance, and refused to pay it over. The ground of its refusal was that to follow the former practice would render it a participant in illegal rebating. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 422, 427]\n\u00a0\n It was disclosed at trial that throughout the period covered by the respondent's claim the mileage allowances had, in every month, exceeded the rentals, leaving a substantial balance which the respondent insisted should be paid to it. During the seven month period from November 1, 1934, to May 31, 1935, this balance amounted to $17,614.13.\n The District Court concluded that payment to the shipper of any excess of the mileage allowances over stipulated rents would constitute a rebate prohibited by the Elkins Act and, in that view, held that the respondent could not recover. The Circuit Court of Appeals permitted a recovery on the ground that Sec. 15(13)3 of the Interstate Commerce Act authorized the payment of mileage allowances by railroads for the use of private cars furnished by shippers for the transportation of their own commodities; that the practice had been approved by the Commission, and maximum rates fixed by it; that the one and one-half cents per car mile allowance appeared in the carriers' published tariffs dealing with the subject and was, and would remain until action by the Commission, the legal rate payable for the use of such cars; that, while it is open to the Commission to inquire, on its own motion or on complaint, as to any abuses in connection with such tariff mileage allowances, until the Commission does act, the carriers are justified in continuing to pay the scheduled rates; that the shipper in this case is the furnisher or supplier of privately owned cars to the carriers, and the lease agreement constitutes the petitioner a mere agent for the collection and payment of the mileage allowances to the shipper; and that, consequently, the payment, by the petitioner to the shipper, of any excess of the mileage earnings is not a rebate within the terms of the Elkins Act. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 422, 428]\n\u00a0\n The petitioner insists that this conclusion is wrong and that of the District Court correct. The Interstate Commerce Commission, as a friend of the court, has filed a brief in which it contends, first, that the District Court was without jurisdiction to entertain the cause, as the question involved is one primarily for administrative action by the Commission and, secondly, that the payment of the excess credits by the petitioner would result in payment of a prohibited rebate to the shipper.\n We hold that the District Court had jurisdiction but that, upon disclosure of the terms and operation of the lease contract, it should not have proceeded to adjudicate the rights and liabilities of the parties in the absence of a decision by the Commission with respect to the validity of the practice involved in the light of the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act.\n Freight cars are facilities of transportation, as defined by the Act. 4 The railroads are under obligation, as part of their public service, to furnish these facilities upon reasonable request of a shipper,5 and therefore have the exclusive right to furnish them. They are not, however, under an obligation to own such cars. They may, if they deem it advisable, lease them so as to be in a position to furnish them according to the demand of the shipping public and, if the carriers do so lease cars, the terms on which they obtain them are not the subject of direct control by the Interstate Commerce Commission. \n6\n If the carriers pay too much for the hire of such cars the Commission may, of course, refuse to allow them to reflect such excess cost in their tariffs. The lessor of such cars to a railroad, however, is not itself a carrier or en- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 422, 429]\n\u00a0\n gaged in any public service. Therefore its practices lie without the realm of the Commission's competence.\n Cars thus leased and used by the carriers are to be distinguished from so-called private cars with which we are here concerned. Shippers, particularly those who require a specialized form of freight car for transportation of their products, may and do, own cars adapted for the purpose. They may, and do, in lieu of owning such facilities, rent them from the owners. Car companies owning a large number of a special type of freight car, some affiliates or subsidiaries of railroads and others, like the petitioner, wholly independent and financed by private capital, have, for many years, been in the business of leasing cars to shippers. The practice has been well known and well understood. It is entirely lawful and the Commission has so held. \n7\n But the practice cannot modify the requirements of paragraph (13) of Sec. 15,8 which governs the payment of allowances for private cars, and invests the Commission with authority to find and declare what allowances are reasonable.\n As the Circuit Court of Appeals has pointed out, different shippers may have differing costs in respect of privately owned cars furnished the carriers. Nevertheless, as the allowances to be made them by the carriers \n\n[308 \nU.S. 422, 430]\n\u00a0\n for the use of such cars must be the subject of published schedules,9 and must be just and reasonable,10 the Commission is compelled to ascertain in the light of past and present experience a fair and reasonable compensation to cover such costs and prescribe a uniform rate which will reflect such experience. It is inevitable that some shippers may be able to furnish facilities at less than the published allowance while others may find their costs in excess of it. This fact, however, does not militate against the fixing of a uniform rate applicable to shippers properly classified by the Commission. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n From what has been said it results that the shipper in this case was permitted by law to furnish freight cars for the transportation of its products and to be paid a reasonable allowance for performing this portion of the public service which the carrier was bound to render, and that the law requires that the amount and conditions of payment of such allowance shall be set forth in a published tariff. If this is not done, the shipper may complain to the Commission, to the end that a proper allowance be ascertained and made effective by a schedule duly published. In the present case this has not been done. Nor has the shipper ever applied to the Commission for its decision as to what was a proper allowance for the cars furnished by it.\n As we have stated, the mileage tariffs published by the American Railway Association, which govern the instant case, require that private cars be marked with socalled reporting marks or initials together with a car number. These marks are for the purpose of keeping records of the car's movements and mileage. Appropriate marks to designate privately owned cars are assigned by the Rail- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 422, 431]\n\u00a0\n way Association to their owners. The rules appearing in the tariff during a portion of the period in question provided that the mileage for the use of cars of private ownership would be paid to the car owner or to the party who had acquired the car or cars as shown by the permanent reporting marks. The lease agreement provided that the cars should bear the reporting marks of the petitioner. Thus the carrier was bound by its rules to pay the allowance to the petitioner. During a portion of the term in controversy the rules provided that mileage could be paid only to the car owner, not to a lessee. Here again the rules precluded the payment of the allowance by the carrier to the shipper.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals has held, and we think correctly, that the shipper-the Oil Works-furnished the cars to the carrier in the present instance. The petitioner did not. The shipper was then entitled, under the plain terms of Sec. 15(13), to be paid by the carrier a just and reasonable allowance for providing the facility. It seems clear that no rule or regulation of the carrier may provide for the payment of such allowance to any other person. And we think the consideration that, in this case, the petitioner acted merely as collecting agent for the shipper, does not take the case out of the Commission's jurisdiction. If it should appear that, with respect to the tank cars in question, the shipper-lessee is making substantial profits on leased cars, by reason of the excess of the mileage allowances over the rentals paid, it might in the light of all the facts be found that the shipper is, in the result, obtaining transportation at a lower cost than others who use cars assigned them by the carriers or own their own cars. The Commission has found that, in the case of refrigerator cars, held under similar leases, this has been the case. \n12\n The inquiry into the lawfulness of the prac- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 422, 432]\n\u00a0\n tice is one peculiarly within the competence of the Commission. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n As the tariffs now contain no provision for the payment of car mileage allowances by the railroad to the shipper directly, and as, upon the face of things as disclosed by this record, the shipper is apparently reaping a substantial profit from the use of the cars, a clear case is made for the exercise of the administrative judgment of the Commission. The Circuit Court of Appeals, without supporting evidence in the record as to any specific items, said that there are obviously other expenses which the shipper must bear over and above the actual rental paid. If this were so, the reflection of those expenses, as well as the rental itself, in the allowance paid by the carrier to the shipper for the use of the latter's cars, would be a matter for the administrative judgment of the Commission and not for determination by a court. \n 14\n\u00a0\n\n We have said that the Commission insists the District Court was without jurisdiction of the cause. With this we do not agree. The action was an ordinary one in assumpsit on a written contract. The court had jurisdiction of the subject matter and of the parties. But it appeared here, as it did in Mitchell Coal & Coke Co. v. Pennsylvania R.R. Co., \n230 \nU.S. 247\n, 33 S.Ct. 916, that the question of the reasonableness and legality of the practices of the parties was subjected by the Interstate Commerce Act to the administrative authority of the Interstate Commerce Commission. The policy of the Act is that reasonable allowances and practices, which shall not offend against the prohibitions of the Elkins Act, are to be fixed and settled after full investigation by the Commission, and that there is remitted to the courts only the function of \n\n[308 \nU.S. 422, 433]\n\u00a0\n enforcing claims arising out of the failure to comply with the Commission's lawful orders.\n When it appeared in the course of the litigation that an administrative problem, committed to the Commission, was involved, the court should have stayed its hand pending the Commission's determination of the lawfulness and reasonableness of the practices under the terms of the Act. There should not be a dismissal, but, as in Mitchell Coal & Coke Co. v. Pennsylvania R.R. Co., supra, the cause should be held pending the conclusion of an appropriate administrative proceeding. Thus any defenses the petitioner may have will be saved to it. \n15\n\u00a0\n\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity to this opinion. So ordered.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of February 19, 1903, c. 708, Sec. 1, 32 Stat. 847, as amended.\n'(3) Receiving rebates; additional venalty and recovery thereof.

COMMISSIONER OF INT. REV.(1940)\nNo. 462\nArgued: February 8, 1940Decided: February 26, 1940\n\n\n\n Messrs. Harold Evans and Shippen Lewis, both of Philadelphia, Pa., for petitioner\n Mr. J. Louis Monarch, of Washington, D.C., for respondent. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 304, 305]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves the construction and application of provisions of the Revenue Act of 1926, as amended by that of 1934, and of the Revenue Act of 1932, relating to the venue of proceedings to review a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals and setting limitations upon the assessment of income tax.\n The petitioner is a trust company, doing a general business as such, including administering trust estates and acting as agent for the custody, handling, and management of its clients' investments. In 1930 it created, by an appropriate instrument, a fund to afford those for whom it acted the advantage of investing small amounts in securities at minimum expense and with opportunity of ready liquidation. The fund has since been managed according to the terms of the agreement. In the course of administration the petitioner has paid to the participants their respective shares of income from the invested principal, and has filed fiduciary returns of income on Treasury Form 1041, intended for use by trustees.\n March 15, 1933, the petitioner, as trustee, filed such a return, for the calendar year 1932, with the Collector of Internal Revenue for the First District of Pennsylvania, at Philadelphia. The return accurately set forth the gross income, the deductions, and the net income,-in short all information necessary to the calculation of any tax which might be due,- and attached a list of the beneficiaries of the fund, and their shares of the income. No corporation income tax return was filed on Treasury Form 1120. The participants in the fund, who were required to make individual returns for the year 1932, included in their respective returns, filed on or before March 15, 1933, their shares of income.\n September 17, 1936, pursuant to the recommendation of a treasury agent that the fund be taxed as a corpora- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 304, 306]\n\u00a0\n tion,1 the respondent prepared from the Form 1041 return, a substitute corporation return on Form 1120, covering the year 1932, and, on February 27, 1937, gave notice of a consequent deficiency of tax.\n The petitioner carried the matter to the Board of Tax Appeals for redetermination, asserting that it was taxable as a trust and not as an association and that assessment and collection of the asserted deficiency was barred by the expiration of two years from the date its return was filed. The Board held the assessment barred.\n The respondent petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit to review the Board's decision. That court held that the venue provision of Section 1002(a) of the Revenue Act of 1926, as amended by Section 519 of the Revenue Act of 1934,2 empowered it to entertain the petition, and that the assessment of a deficiency was not barred by Sections 275 and 276 of the Revenue Act of 1932,3 the applicable section, in its view, being 275(c).4 \n\n[309 \nU.S. 304, 307]\n\u00a0\n The petitioner sought certiorari on the ground that the Circuit Court of Appeals' decision that the fiduciary return it had filed was a return which governed venue under Section 1002, as amended, but no return within the meaning of Section 275(c), conflicts with a decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. \n5\n Because of the conflict we granted certiorari. \n308 \nU.S. 544\n, 60 S.Ct. 176, 84 L.Ed. --.\n Petitioner and respondent agree that the court below was right in holding the return in question was such a return as fixed the venue of the petition for review in the Third Circuit, where the return was filed. We concur in this view.\n The petitioner contends that the fiduciary return filed on Form 1041 was a return within the meaning of Section 275(a), which limits the time for assessment to two years after the filing of the return. The respondent insists that the return was 'no return of the tax' within the meaning of Section 275(c), and, therefore, the four-year limitation specified in that section applies.\n As the notice of deficiency was given more than two years after the filing of the fiduciary return, and within four years of the filing of the last return by any participant in the fund, decision turns upon which subsection governs.\n We hold that the return was a return within the meaning of Section 275(a) and that the petitioner cannot be held \n\n[309 \nU.S. 304, 308]\n\u00a0\n to have made no return so as to bring the case within Section 275(c).\n First. We are of opinion that if the return filed by the petitioner was such as to create venue of the proceeding for review in the court below, it was also a return under the terms of Section 275(a), so that the two-year period of limitations imposed by that section is applicable.\n The return was a fiduciary return. It is admitted that the petitioner in respect of the fund was a fiduciary and was bound to file such a return. 6 It contained all of the data from which a tax could be computed and assessed although it did not purport to state any amount due as tax. Section 1002(a), as amended, supra, confers venue upon the Circuit Court for the circuit in which was made 'the return of the tax in respect of which the liability arises.' Section 275(a) provides that the amount of tax must be assessed within two years after 'the return was filed.' Section 275(c) fixes a period of four years for assessment 'if a corporation makes no return of the tax imposed by this title (chapter)', but each shareholder returns his distributive share of the net income.\n We think the language of the sections is such that it cannot be said the fiduciary return filed by the petitioner was a return of the tax in respect of which the liability arises but was no return of the tax imposed by the statute.\n The respondent urges that the two sections have separate aims; that the venue provision was inserted for the convenience of taxpayers, so that they should not be compelled to litigate in courts far from their domicile, whereas the limitation sections have nothing to do with the designation of a forum. Conceding that this is true, it remains that, if the return in question complies with the one description, it equally complies with the other. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 304, 309]\n\u00a0\n We find no adequate reason for attributing a different meaning to the two phrases.\n Second. Section 275(c) is inapplicable. Sections 275 and 276 set up a complete scheme of limitations on assessment of income taxes. Section 275( a) imposes a limitation of two years after the filing of the return. Section 276(a) provides that there shall be no period of limitations if a false return, or no return, be filed. If the statute went no further, and if the respondent's position is correct that, in this case, the taxpayer was a corporation and filed no return as such, then there would be no period of limitations whatever. This was the situation under the Revenue Act of 1924. 7\n The legislative history demonstrates that Section 275(c) was adopted to set a period of limitations where no return is filed by the association but returns are filed only by the members. In other words, subsection (c) was adopted to limit, rather than to enlarge, the time for assessment in such a case. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n The respondent's contention is that where a fiduciary, in good faith, makes what it deems the appropriate return, which discloses all of the data from which the tax, treated as one imposed upon an association ( classified as a corporation under the statute), can be computed, such a return is to be deemed no return. We think this view inadmissible. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 304, 310]\n\u00a0\n It cannot be said that the petitioner, whether treated as a corporation or not, made no return of the tax imposed by the statute. Its return may have been incomplete in that it failed to compute a tax, but this defect falls short of rendering it no return whatever. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n The judgment is reversed.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n]  1111(a)(2) of the Revenue Act of 1932, 47 Stat. 169, 289, 26 U.S. C.A.Int.Rev.Code,  3797(3): 'The term 'corporation' includes associations ....'

Wilkins, of Washington, D.C., and Lloyd E. Elliott, of Dallas, Tex., for petitioner.\n Miss Helen R. Carloss, Sp. Asst. to Atty. Gen., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Decision in this case turns on the question whether a capital stock tax return filed pursuant to  215 of the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 195, 207, may be amended within the time fixed for filing the return. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 389, 391]\n\u00a0\n Sections 215 and 216 of the National Industrial Recovery Act impose interrelated taxes on domestic corporations, namely an annual capital stock tax and an annual tax on profits in excess of 12 1\/2 per cent of the capital stock, calculated on the basis of the value of the capital stock as fixed by the corporation's return for the first year in which the tax is imposed.\n Section 215(a) imposes on domestic corporations an annual tax with respect to carrying on or doing business for any part of the taxable year at the rate of '$1 for each $1,000 of the adjusted declared value of its capital stock.' Section 215(f) provides that 'For the first year ending June 30 in respect of which a tax is imposed by this section upon any corporation, the adjusted declared value shall be the value, as declared by the corporation in its first return under this section (which declaration of value cannot be amended), as of the close of its last income-tax taxable year ending at or prior to the close of the year for which the tax is imposed by this section .... For any subsequent year ending June 30, the adjusted declared value in the case of a domestic corporation shall be the original declared value' as changed by certain prescribed capital adjustments occasioned by increases and decreases of capital occurring after 'the date as of which the original declared value was declared.' Section 216(a) imposes an annual tax upon so much of the net income of a corporation taxable under $215(a) as is in excess of 12 1\/2 per cent of the 'adjusted declared value of its capital stock ... as of the close of the preceding income-tax taxable year (or as of the date of organization if it had no preceding income-tax taxable year) ....'\n It will be observed that by  215(a) and (f) the declared value of capital stock which is made the basis of computation of both taxes is not required to conform either to the actual or to the nominal capital of the taxpaying \n\n[308 \nU.S. 389, 392]\n\u00a0\n corporation; and that the declared value for the first taxable year, with the addition or subtraction of specified items of subsequent capital gains or losses is made the basis of the computation of both taxes in later years. The taxpayer is thus left free to declare any value of capital stock for its first taxable year which it may elect, but since the declared value for the first year is a controlling factor for the computation of taxes for later years, the statute provides that the declaration once made cannot be amended. Because of the method of computation, increase or decrease in the declared value of capital, and of the corresponding tax, produces, as the case may be, a decrease or an increase in the tax on excess profits.\n In August, 1933, petitioner, a Texas corporation, mistakenly believing that it was required to state the par value of its issued capital stock in its tax return, filed a timely return for the year ending June 30, 1933, declaring the value of its entire capital stock to be $120, 000 and paid the tax of $120. The date for filing returns for that year having been extended to September 29, 1933, T.D. 4368, 4386, petitioner before that date filed an amended return, declaring the value of its capital stock to be $250,000. On March 15, 1934, petitioner filed its income and excess profits tax return for the calendar year 1933. The Commissioner, having refused to accept the amended capital stock return, gave notice of a deficiency in the excess profits tax calculated upon the basis of the capital stock value of $120,000 as declared in petitioner's original return.\n The Board of Tax Appeals determined that petitioner's capital stock and excess profits tax should be computed on the basis of $120,000 capital stock value as originally stated instead of $250,000 stock value declared in its amended return, found a deficiency, and entered its order accordingly. 38 B.T.A. 141. The Circuit Court of \n\n[308 \nU.S. 389, 393]\n\u00a0\n Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding that  215(f) by its terms precluded any amendment of the tax return for the first year even though made within the time allowed for filing the return. 104 F.2d 24. We granted certiorari October 9, 1939, \n308 \nU.S. 533\n, 60 S.Ct. 93, 84 L.Ed. --, to resolve a conflict of the decision below with that of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Glenn v. Oertel Co., 97 F.2d 495, and that of the Court of Claims in Philadelphia Brewing Company v. United States, 27 F.Supp. 583.\n The Commissioner founds his argument in support of the decision below upon a literal reading of the introductory sentence of  215(f) already quoted, which, he argues, precludes even a timely amendment of the tax return for the first year, and upon the administrative and Congressional interpretation of the statute. He insists that the phrase 'first return' in the clause 'declared value shall be the value, as declared by the corporation in its first return under this section (which declaration of value cannot be amended)', means the first paper filed by the taxpayer as a return, and that these words plainly forbid any amendment of the declared value of the capital stock, even though made within the time allowed for filing the return.\n In making these contentions the Commissioner concedes that the amount of the declared value of capital fixed for the first year is a matter of indifference to the Government since the statute leaves the taxpayer free to declare any amount which its fancy may choose and that for any reduction in capital stock tax effected by the declaration of a low value of the capital stock there is an accompanying increase in excess profits taxes. He concedes that if petitioner had filed but a single return on the date of filing the amended return, stating the value of the capital stock as $250,000 instead of $120,000, the Government would have been concluded by the taxpayer's declaration and that it has long been the practice \n\n[308 \nU.S. 389, 394]\n\u00a0\n of the department, in the cases of other types of tax to accept an amended return, filed within the period allowed for filing returns, as the return of the taxpayer for the taxable year. He concedes also, as he logically must, that the argument leads to the conclusion that a mistake in the declaration of value whether of law or of fact, however, serious and excusable, cannot be corrected by a timely amendment of the return.\n All statutes must be construed in the light of their purpose. A literal reading of them which would lead to absurd results is to be avoided when they can be given a reasonable application consistent with their words and with the legislative purpose. Hawaii v.

United States, \n287 \nU.S. 435, 446\n, 53 S.Ct. 210, 214, 77 LEd. 413, 86 A.L.R. 249; Burnet v. Guggenheim, \n288 \nU.S. 280, 285\n, 53 S.Ct. 369, 370, 77 L,.ed. 748; Armstrong Paint & Varnish Works v. Nu-Enamel Corp., \n305 \nU.S. 315, 332\n, 333 S., 59 S.Ct. 191, 199, 200. Here the purpose of the statute is unmistakable. It is to allow the taxpayer to fix for itself the amount of the taxable base for purposes of computation of the capital stock tax, but with the proviso that the amount thus fixed for the first taxable year shall be accepted, with only such changes as the statute prescribes for the purpose of computing the capital stock and excess profits taxes in later years. Congress thus avoided the necessity of prescribing a formula for arriving at the actual value of capital for the purpose of computing excess profits taxes, which had been found productive of much litigation under earlier taxing acts, see Sen.Rep. 52, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 11-12; cf. Ray Consolidated Copper Co. v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 373, 376\n, 45 S.Ct. 526, 527. At the same time it guarded against loss of revenue to the Government through understatements of capital, by providing for an increase in excess profits tax under  216 ensuing from such understatements.\n It is plain that none of these purposes would have been thwarted and no interest of the Government would have \n\n[308 \nU.S. 389, 395]\n\u00a0\n been harmed had the Commissioner, in conformity to established departmental practice, accepted the petitioner's amended declaration. It is equally plain that by its rejection petitioner has been denied an opportunity to make a declaration of capital stock value which it was the obvious purpose of the statute to give, and that denial is for no other reason than that the declaration appeared in an amended instead of an unamended return. We think that the words of the statute, fairly read in the light of the purpose, disclosed by its own terms, require no such harsh and incongruous result.\n Section 215 nowhere mentions amendment of returns or amended returns. It speaks of 'declared value' for the first tax year and provides that the 'declaration of value' cannot be amended. The 'declaration of value' is that of the corporation in its 'first return under this section'. The 'first return' as the context shows is the return for the first tax year of the taxpayer and the characterization of the return as 'first' is obviously used to distinguish the return made for the first year from the return 'for any subsequent year' in which the 'adjusted declared value' is required by the same section to conform to a formula based on the 'declared value' for the first year and which, for that reason, 'cannot be amended'.\n'First return' thus means a return for the first year in which the taxpayer exercises the privilege of fixing its capital stock value for tax purposes, and includes a timely amended return for that year. A timely amended return is as much a 'first return' for the purpose of fixing the capital stock value in contradistinction to returns for subsequent years, as is a single return filed by the taxpayer for the first tax year. Glenn v. Oertel Co., supra; Philadelphia Brewing Company v. United States, supra; see also, similarly construing the phrase 'first return' under  114(b)(4) of the Revenue Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 680, \n\n[308 \nU.S. 389, 396]\n\u00a0\n 710, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 702; C. H. Mead Coal Co. v. Commissioner, 4 Cir., 106 F.2d 388, 390; cf. Pacific National Co. v. Welch, \n304 \nU.S. 191, 194\n, 58 S.Ct. 857, 858. Thus read the statute gives full effect to its obvious purposes and to the evident meaning of its words. To construe 'first return' as meaning the first paper filed as a return, as distinguished from the paper containing a timely amendment, which, when filed is commonly known as the return for the year for which it is filed, is to defeat the purposes of the statute by dissociating the phrase from its context and from the legislative purpose in violation of the most elementary principles of statutory construction.\n\n Article 24 of Treasury Regulations 64 (1933 ed.), under  215(f) of the National Industrial Recovery Act, in force when the petitioner filed its amended return, did not call for any different construction from that which we have indicated is the correct one. The article made no mention of the 'first return'. It pointed out merely that the original declared value would be the basis of the tax for the first and later years, and stated 'This value once having been declared may not subsequently be changed either by the corporation or by the commissioner.' This evidently refers to the parenthetical clause of  215(f) 'which declaration ... cannot be amended' which phrase concededly does not preclude an effective declaration of value in a timely amended return. \n 1\n\u00a0\n\n Sections 215 and 216 of the National Industrial Recovery Act were reenacted as  701 and 702 of the 1934 \n\n[308 \nU.S. 389, 397]\n\u00a0\n Revenue Act, 48 Stat. 680, 769, 770, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, pages 787- 789. That act,  703, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 789, amended the National Industrial Recovery Act so as to provide that the capital stock tax and excess profits tax imposed by  215 and 216 of the act last mentioned should not apply respectively to any taxpayer in any year except the years ending June 30, 1933 and June 30, 1934. The amended Regulations 64 (1934 ed.), relating to  701 and 702 of the Revenue Act of 1934, are prefaced with the statement 'It must constantly be borne in mind that these regulations relate only to the tax imposed by  701 of the Revenue Act of 1934. With respect to the tax imposed by  215 of the National Industrial Recovery Act consult Regulations 64, edition of 1933'. This warning was repeated in Regulations 64, 1936 edition, under the corresponding  105 and 106 of the 1935 Revenue Act, 49 Stat. 1014, 1017- 1019, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, pages 798-801.\n Since the regulations under the Revenue Acts for 1934 and 1935 are thus made inapplicable to the taxpayer's stock return under the National Industrial Recovery Act for the year ending June 30, 1933, they are without force for present purposes except as they are persuasive commentaries on the meaning of the language of  215(f) of the National Industrial Recovery Act which was carried forward into later revenue acts. Article 41(d) of Treasury Regulations 64, published under the 1934 Act, declared that 'First return means the first capital stock tax return filed by a corporation for its first taxable year', a definition which was continued in Article 44 of Regulations 64 (1936 ed.), under the corresponding  105 of the Revenue Act of 1935. Article 44 of the latter regulation for the first time informed taxpayers that an effective declaration of value for the first tax year could not be made in a timely amended return, saying, 'A subsequent return declaring a different value, even though filed before the expiration of the prescribed period, is therefore not acceptable under the statute.' \n\n[308 \nU.S. 389, 398]\n\u00a0\n On the argument the Commissioner admitted that this ruling served no administrative or governmental convenience or purpose apart from compliance with the supposed command of the statute. There is thus a complete absence of those reasons which ordinarily lead courts to give persuasive force to an administrative construction and which justify their acceptance of it in preference to their own. The regulations have not been consistent in their interpretation of the statute and do not embody the results of any specialized departmental knowledge or experience. Cf. Brewster v. Gage, \n280 \nU.S. 327, 336\n, 50 S.Ct. 115, 117; Sanford's Estate v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, \n308 \nU.S. 39\n, 60 S.Ct. 51, October term, 1939, decided November 6, 1939. No one, not even the Government, will be prejudiced by its rejection, and as we have said the construction flies in the face of the purposes of the statute and the plain meaning of its words. Judicial obeisance to administrative action cannot be pressed so far.\n It is said that Congress, by the change of the language of the capital stock provisions adopted in the 1938 Revenue Act has attributed to the earlier statute the same meaning as that ascribed to it by the administrative construction. It is familiar doctrine that Congress, by reenacting a section of the Revenue Act without change, approves and adopts a consistent administrative construction of it. But here the argument is that by amendment of the statute, which would preclude such a construction in the future, Congress has also declared that the departmental construction was that intended by the earlier Congress which enacted the statute.\n Section 601 of the 1938 Act, 52 Stat. 447, 565, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev. Acts, page 1139, in addition to other changes in the capital stock and excess profits tax provisions, prescribed that the 'adjusted declared value' should be determined with respect to three year periods, beginning with the year ending June 30, 1938, and denominated the first year of each period \n\n[308 \nU.S. 389, 399]\n\u00a0\n a 'declaration year.' Section 601(f)(2) provided that the declared capital stock value for purposes of the tax shall be the value as declared by the corporation 'in its return for such declaration year (which declaration of value cannot be amended)'. Since, under the new legislation, the return for the declaration year for each three-year period and not that for the first tax year of the taxpayer is controlling, there was no occasion for repeating the phrases 'first year' and 'first return' which had appeared in the earlier legislation and the new section dropped from the statute the words which had given rise to the earlier administrative construction. This was pointed out by the house committee report recommending the amendment,2 stating that the change would serve to permit the taxpayer to amend its declaration by timely amendment of the return for the declaration year and adding, 'denial of all opportunity for correction appears unduly restrictive.'\n It must be assumed that Congress was aware through its committees of the change in the regulations which in 1936 had construed the statute as precluding an effective declaration in a timely amended return, and of the litigation then pending in this case and in Glenn v. Oertel Co., \n\n[308 \nU.S. 389, 400]\n\u00a0\n supra, in which the departmental construction had been challenged as 'unduly restrictive.' In the face of the legislative expression of dissatisfaction with the earlier statute as construed, Congressional purpose to declare that such was the intended meaning is not to be inferred merely from the fact that the amendment providing for the future said nothing as to the past. If we are to draw inferences it would seem as probable that Congress was content to leave the problems of the past to be solved by the courts where they were then pending, rather than to preclude their solution there. Action so ambiguous in its implications as to the past is wanting in that certainty and evident purpose which would justify its acceptance as a legislative declaration of what an earlier Congress had intended rather than an effort to make clear that which had been rendered dubious by unwarranted administrative construction. Cf. Jordan v. Roche, \n228 \nU.S. 436, 445\n, 33 S.Ct. 573, 575; Helvering v. New York Trust Co. \n292 \nU.S. 455\n, 54 S.Ct. 806; Noble v. Oklahoma City, \n297 \nU.S. 481, 492\n, 56 S.Ct. 562, 567. Retroactive declarations of legislative intent prejudicial to those who have acted under an earlier statute whose construction seems clear, it would seem, ought not to be implied more than the legislative intention to give retroactive operation to a new statute. See Hassett v. Welch, \n303 \nU.S. 303, 314\n, 58 S.Ct. 559, 564, and cases cited; cf. Noble v. Oklahoma City, supra.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Government concedes in its brief that the parenthetical clause 'which declaration ... cannot be amended' continued in the capital stock tax section,  601, of the 1938 Revenue Act, 52 Stat. 447, 565, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 1139, does not preclude an effective declaration of value in a timely amended return for the first tax year. If the phrase 'first return' in  215(f) had that effect, then the parenthetical phrase concededly prohibiting amendments in tax returns of later years would have been superfluous. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 'The new section also alleviates the rigid provision of section 105( f) of the 1935 act that the valuation shall be as declared by the corporation in its 'first' return. Errors of calculation or other errors sometimes occur in first returns, and denial of all opportunity for correction appears unduly restrictive. Accordingly, the word 'first' as it appears the second time in section 105(f) of the 1935 act, as amended, is eliminated from the corresponding language appearing in subsection (f)(2) of the new section. This will serve to give a corporation the right, so long as it acts within the time allowed for filing its return (including the last day of any extension period) for the year for which a declaration of value is required, to file subsequent returns for that year showing a different valuation, the valuation shown by the last timely return being binding.'

Graves, all of Chicago, Ill., for respondents.\n\n\n\n[311 \nU.S. 32, 37]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question is whether the Supreme Court of Illinois, by its adjudication that petitioners in this case are bound by a judgment rendered in an earlier litigation to which they were not parties, has deprived them of the due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Respondents brought this suit in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, to enjoin the breach by petitioners of an agreement restricting the use of land within a described area of the City of Chicago, which was alleged to have been entered into by some five hundred of the land owners. The agreement stipulated that for a specified period no part of the land should be 'sold, leased to or permitted to be occupied by any person of the colored \n\n[311 \nU.S. 32, 38]\n\u00a0\n race', and provided that it should not be effective unless signed by the 'owners of 95 per centum of the frontage' within the described area. The bill of complaint set up that the owners of 95 per cent of the frontage had signed; that respondents are owners of land within the restricted area who have either signed the agreement or acquired their land from others who did sign and that petitioners Hansberry, who are Negroes, have, with the alleged aid of the other petitioners and with knowledge of the agreement, acquired and are occupying land in the restricted area formerly belonging to an owner who had signed the agreement.\n To the defense that the agreement had never become effective because owners of 95 per cent of the frontage had not signed it, respondents pleaded that that issue was res judicata by the decree in an earlier suit. Burke v. Kleiman, 277 Ill.App. 519. To this petitioners pleaded, by way of rejoinder, that they were not parties to that suit or bound by its decree, and that denial of their right to litigate, in the present suit, the issue of performance of the condition precedent to the validity of the agreement would be a denial of due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. It does not appear, nor is it contended that any of petitioners is the successor in interest to or in privity with any of the parties in the earlier suit.\n The circuit court, after a trial on the merits, found that owners of only about 54 per cent of the frontage had signed the agreement, and that the only support of the judgment in the Burke case was a false and fraudulent stipulation of the parties that 95 per cent had signed. But it ruled that the issue of performance of the condition precedent to the validity of the agreement was res judicata as alleged and entered a decree for respondents. The Supreme Court of Illinois affirmed. 372 Ill. 369, 24 N.E.2d 37. We granted certiorari to resolve the constitutional question. \n309 \nU.S. 652\n, 60 S.Ct. 889. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 32, 39]\n\u00a0\n The Supreme Court of Illinois, upon an examination of the record in Burke v. Kleiman, supra, found that that suit, in the Superior Court of Cook County, was brought by a landowner in the restricted area to enforce the agreement which had been signed by her predecessor in title, in behalf of herself and other property owners in like situation, against four named individuals who had acquired or asserted an interest in a plot of land formerly owned by another signer of the agreement; that upon stipulation of the parties in that suit that the agreement had been signed by owners of 95 per cent of all the frontage, the court had adjudged that the agreement was in force, that it was a covenant running with the land and binding all the land within the described area in the hands of the parties to the agreement and those claiming under them including defendants, and had entered its decree restraining the breach of the agreement by the defendants and those claiming under them, and that the appellate court had affirmed the decree. It found that the stipulation was untrue but held, contrary to the trial court, that it was not fraudulent or collusive. It also appears from the record in Burke v. Kleiman that the case was tried on an agreed statement of facts which raised only a single issue, whether by reason of changes in the restricted area, the agreement had ceased to be enforcible in equity.\n From this the Supreme Court of Illinois concluded in the present case that Burke v. Kleiman was a 'class' or 'representative' suit and that in such a suit 'where the remedy is pursued by a plaintiff who has the right to represent the class to which he belongs, other members of the class are bound by the results in the case unless it is reversed or set aside on direct proceedings'; (372 Ill. 369, 24 N.E.2d 39), that petitioners in the present suit were members of the class represented by the plaintiffs in the earlier suit and consequently were bound by its decree which had rendered \n\n[311 \nU.S. 32, 40]\n\u00a0\n the issue of performance of the condition precedent to the restrictive agreement res judicata, so far as petitioners are concerned. The court thought that the circumstance that the stipulation in the earlier suit that owners of 95 per cent of the frontage had signed the agreement was contrary to the fact as found in the present suit did not militate against this conclusion since the court in the earlier suit had jurisdiction to determine the fact as between the parties before it and that its determination, because of the representative character of the suit, even though erroneous, was binding on petitioners until set aside by a direct attack on the first judgment.\n State courts are free to attach such descriptive labels to litigations before them as they may choose and to attribute to them such consequences as they think appropriate under state constitutions and laws, subject only to the requirements of the Constitution of the United States. But when the judgment of a state court, ascribing to the judgment of another court the binding force and effect of res judicata, is challenged for want of due process it becomes the duty of this Court to examine the course of procedure in both litigations to ascertain whether the litigant whose rights have thus been adjudicated has been afforded such notice and opportunity to be heard as are requisite to the due process which the Constitution prescribes.

Rupp, \n235 \nU.S. 261, 273\n, 35 S.Ct. 37, 40.\n It is a principle of general application in Anglo-American jurisprudence that one is not bound by a judgment in personam in a litigation in which he is not designated as a party or to which he has not been made a party by service of process. Pennoyer v. Neff, \n95 \nU.S. 714\n; 1 Freeman on Judgments, 5th Ed.,  407. A judgment rendered in such circumstances is not entitled to the full faith and credit which the Constitution and statute of the United States, R.S.  905, 28 U.S.C.  687, 28 U.S.C.A.  687, pre- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 32, 41]\n\u00a0\n scribe, Pennoyer v.

McDonough, \n204 \nU.S. 8\n, 27 S.Ct. 236.\n To these general rules there is a recognized exception that, to an extent not precisely defined by judicial opinion, the judgment in a 'class' or 'representative' suit, to which some members of the class are parties, may bind members of the class or those represented who were not made parties to it. Smith v. Swormstedt, 16 How. 288; Royal Arcanum v. Green, \n237 \nU.S. 531\n, 35 S.Ct. 724, L.R.A.1916A, 771; Hartford L. Ins. Co. v. Ibs, \n237 \nU.S. 662\n, 35 S.Ct. 692, L.R.A.1916A, 765; Hartford Life Ins. Co. v. Barber, \n245 \nU.S. 146\n, 38 S.Ct. 54; Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur v. Cauble, \n255 \nU.S. 356\n, 41 S.Ct. 338; cf. Christopher v. Brusselback, \n302 \nU.S. 500\n, 58 S.Ct. 350.\n The class suit was an invention of equity to enable it to proceed to a decree in suits where the number of those interested in the subject of the litigation is so great that their joinder as parties in conformity to the usual rules of procedure is impracticable. Courts are not infrequently called upon to proceed with causes in which the number of those interested in the litigation is so great as to make difficult or impossible the joinder of all because some are not within the jurisdiction or because their whereabouts is unknown or where if all were made parties to the suit its continued abatement by the death of some would prevent or unduly delay a decree. In such cases where the interests of those not joined are of the same class as the interests of those who are, and where it is considered that the latter fairly represent the former in the prosecution of the litigation of the issues in which all have a common interest, the court will \n\n[311 \nU.S. 32, 42]\n\u00a0\n proceed to a decree. Brown v. Vermuden, 1 Ch.Cas. 272; City of London v. Richmond, 2 Vern. 421; Cockburn v. Thompson, 161 Ves.Jr. 321; West v. Randall, Fed.Cas.No.17,724, 2 Mason 181; Beatty v. Kurtz, 2 Pet. 566; Smith v. Swormstedt, supra; Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur v. Cauble, supra; Story, Equity Pleading (2d Ed.)  98.\n It is evident that the considerations which may induce a court thus to proceed, despite a technical defect of parties, may differ from those which must be taken into account in determining whether the absent parties are bound by the decree or, if it is adjudged that they are, in ascertaining whether such an adjudication satisfies the requirements of due process and of full faith and credit. Nevertheless there is scope within the framework of the Constitution for holding in appropriate cases that a judgment rendered in a class suit is res judicata as to members of the class who are not formal parties to the suit. Here, as elsewhere, the Fourteenth Amendment does not compel state courts or legislatures to adopt any particular rule for establishing the conclusiveness of judgments in class suits; cf. Brown v. New Jersey, \n175 \nU.S. 172\n, 20 S.Ct. 77; Brown v. Mississippi, \n297 \nU.S. 278\n, 56 S.Ct. 461; United Gas Public Service Co. v. Texas, \n303 \nU.S. 123\n, 58 S.Ct. 483; Avery v. Alabama, \n308 \nU.S. 444, 446\n, 447 S., 60 S.Ct. 321, 322, nor does it compel the adoption of the particular rules thought by this court to be appropriate for the federal courts. With a proper regard for divergent local institutions and interests, cf. Jackson County v. United States, \n308 \nU.S. 343, 351\n, 60 S.Ct. 285, 288, this Court is justified in saying that there has been a failure of due process only in those cases where it cannot be said that the procedure adopted, fairly insures the protection of the interests of absent parties who are to be bound by it. Chicago, B. & Q.R. Co. v. Chicago, \n166 \nU.S. 226, 235\n, 17 S.Ct. 581, 584.\n It is familiar doctrine of the federal courts that members of a class not present as parties to the litigation \n\n[311 \nU.S. 32, 43]\n\u00a0\n may be bound by the judgment where they are in fact adequately represented by parties who are present, or where they actually participate in the conduct of the litigation in which members of the class are present as parties, Plumb v. Goodnow (Plumb v. Crane), \n123 \nU.S. 560\n, 8 S.Ct. 216; Confectioners' Machinery Co. v. Racine Engine & Mach. Co., 7 Cir., 163 F. 914; Id., 7 Cir., 170 F. 1021; Bryant El. Co. v. Marshall, C. C., 169 F. 426, or where the interest of the members of the class, some of whom are present as parties, is joint, or where for any other reason the relationship between the parties present and those who are absent is such as legally to entitle the former to stand in judgment for the latter. Smith v. Swormstedt, supra; cf. Christopher v. Brusselback, supra, 302 U.S. at pages 503, 504, 58 S.Ct. at page 352, and cases cited.\n In all such cases, so far as it can be said that the members of the class who are present are, by generally recognized rules of law, entitled to stand in judgment for those who are not, we may assume for present purposes that such procedure affords a protection to the parties who are represented though absent, which would satisfy the requirements of due process and full faith and credit. See Bernheimer v. Converse, \n206 \nU.S. 516\n, 27 S.Ct. 755; Marin v. Augedahl, \n247 \nU.S. 142\n, 38 S.Ct. 452; Chandler v. Peketz, \n297 \nU.S. 609\n, 56 S.Ct. 602. Nor do we find it necessary for the decision of this case to say that, when the only circumstance defining the class is that the determination of the rights of its members turns upon a single issue of fact or law, a state could not constitutionally adopt a procedure whereby some of the members of the class could stand in judgment for all, provided that the procedure were so devised and applied as to insure that those present are of the same class as those absent and that the litigation is so conducted as to insure the full and fair consideration of the common issue. Compare New England Divisions Case, \n261 \nU.S. 184, 197\n, 43 S.Ct. 270, 275; Taggart v. Bremner, 7 Cir., 236 F. 544. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 32, 44]\n\u00a0\n We decide only that the procedure and the course of litigation sustained here by the plea of res judicata do not satisfy these requirements.\n The restrictive agreement did not purport to create a joint obligation or liability. It valid and effective its promises were the several obligations of the signers and those claiming under them. The promises ran severally to every other signer. It is plain that in such circumstances all those alleged to be bound by the agreement would not constitute a single class in any litigation brought to enforce it. Those who sought to secure its benefits by enforcing it could not be said to be in the same class with or represent those whose interest was in resisting performance, for the agreement by its terms imposes obligations and confers rights on the owner of each plot of land who signs it. If those who thus seek to secure the benefits of the agreement were rightly regarded by the state Supreme Court as constituting a class, it is evident that those signers or their successors who are interested in challenging the validity of the agreement and resisting its performance are not of the same class in the sense that their interests are identical so that any group who had elected to enforce rights conferred by the agreement could be said to be acting in the interest of any others who were free to deny its obligation.\n Because of the dual and potentially conflicting interests of those who are putative parties to the agreement in compelling or resisting its performance, it is impossible to say, solely because they are parties to it, that any two of them are of the same class. Nor without more, and with the due regard for the protection of the rights of absent parties which due process exacts, can some be permitted to stand in judgment for all.\n It is one thing to say that some members of a class may represent other members in a litigation where the sole and common interest of the class in the litigation, is either to assert a common right or to challenge an \n\n[311 \nU.S. 32, 45]\n\u00a0\n asserted obligation. Smith v. Swormstedt, supra; Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur v. Cauble, supra; Groves v. Farmers State Bank, 368 Ill. 35, 12 N.E.2d 618. It is quite another to hold that all those who are free alternatively either to assert rights or to challenge them are of a single class, so that any group merely because it is of the class so constituted, may be deemed adequately to represent any others of the class in litigating their interests in either alternative. Such a selection of representatives for purposes of litigation, whose substantial interests are not necessarily or even probably the same as those whom they are deemed to represent, does not afford that protection to absent parties which due process requires. The doctrine of representation of absent parties in a class suit has not hitherto been thought to go so far. See Terry v. Bank of Cape Fear, C.C., 20 F. 777, 781; Weidenfeld v. Northern Pac. Ry. Co., 8 Cir., 129 F. 305, 310; McQuillen v. National Cash Register Co., D.C., 22 F.Supp. 867, 873, affirmed, 4 Cir., 112 F.2d 877, 882; Brenner v. Title Guarantee & Trust Co ., 276 N.Y. 230, 11 N.E.2d 890, 114 A.L.R. 1010; cf. Wabash R.R. Co. v. Adelbert College, \n208 \nU.S. 38\n, 28 S.Ct. 182; Coe v. Armour Fertilizer Works, \n237 \nU.S. 413\n, 35 S.Ct. 625. Apart from the opportunities it would afford for the fraudulent and collusive sacrifice of the rights of absent parties, we think that the representation in this case no more satisfies the requirements of due process than a trial by a judicial officer who is in such situation that he may have an interest in the outcome of the litigation in conflict with that of the litigants. Tumey v. Ohio, \n273 \nU.S. 510\n, 47 S.Ct. 437, 50 A.L.R. 1243\n\n\n The plaintiffs in the Burke case sought to compel performance of the agreement in behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated. They did not designate the defendants in the suit as a class or seek any injunction or other relief against others than the named defendants, and the decree which was entered did not purport to bind others. In seeking to enforce the agreement the plaintiffs \n\n[311 \nU.S. 32, 46]\n\u00a0\n in that suit were not representing the petitioners here whose substantial interest is in resisting performance. The defendants in the first suit were not treated by the pleadings or decree as representing others or as foreclosing by their defense the rights of others, and even though nominal defendants, it does not appear that their interest in defeating the contract outweighed their interest in establishing its validity. For a court in this situation to ascribe to either the plaintiffs or defendants the performance of such functions on behalf of petitioners here, is to attribute to them a power that it cannot be said that they had assumed to exercise, and a responsibility which, in view of their dual interests it does not appear that they could rightly discharge.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice ROBERTS and Mr. Justice REED concur in the result. \n\n\n\n","43":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHELVERING v. BRUUN(1940)\nNo. 479\nArgued: February 28, 1940Decided: March 25, 1940\n\n\n\n\n[309 \nU.S. 461, 462]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert H. Jackson, Atty. Gen., and Arnold Raum, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. John H. McEvers, of Kansas City, Mo., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[309 \nU.S. 461, 464]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The controversy had its origin in the petitioner's assertion that the respondent realized taxable gain from the forfeiture of a leasehold, the tenant having erected a new building upon the premises. The court below held that no income had been realized. \n1\n Inconsistency of the decisions on the subject led us to grant certiorari. \n308 \nU.S. 544\n, 60 S.Ct. 180, 84 L. Ed. --.\n The Board of Tax Appeals made no independent findings. The cause was submitted upon a stipulation of facts. From this it appears that on July 1, 1915, the respondent, as owner, leased a lot of land and the building thereon for a term of ninety-nine years.\n The lease provided that the lessee might, at any time, upon giving bond to secure rentals accruing in the two ensuing years, remove or tear down any building on the land, provided that no building should be removed or torn down after the lease became forfeited, or during the last three and one-half years of the term. The lessee was to surrender the land, upon termination of the lease, with all buildings and improvements thereon.\n In 1929 the tenant demolished and removed the existing building and constructed a new one which had a useful life of not more than fifty years. July 1, 1933, the lease was cancelled for default in payment of rent and taxes and the respondent regained possession of the land and building.\n The parties stipulated 'that as at said date, July 1, 1933, the building which had been erected upon said premises by the lessee had a fair market value of $64,245.68 and that the unamortized cost of the old building, which was removed from the premises in 1929 to make way for the new building, was $12,811.43, thus leaving a net fair market value as at July 1, 1933, of $51,434.25, for \n\n[309 \nU.S. 461, 465]\n\u00a0\n the aforesaid new building erected upon the premises by the lessee.'\n On the basis of these facts, the petitioner determined that in 1933 the respondent realized a net gain of $51,434.25. The Board overruled his determination and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the Board's decision.\n The course of administrative practice and judicial decision in respect of the question presented has not been uniform. In 1917 the Treasury ruled that the adjusted value of improvements installed upon leased premises is income to the lessor upon the termination of the lease. 2 The ruling was incorporated in two succeeding editions of the Treasury Regulations. \n3\n In 1919 the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held in Miller v. Gearin, 258 F. 225, that the regulation was invalid as the gain, if taxable at all, must be taxed as of the year when the improvements were completed. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The regulations were accordingly amended to impose a tax upon the gain in the year of completion of the improvements, measured by their anticipated value at the termination of the lease and discounted for the duration of the lease. Subsequently the regulations permitted the lessor to spread the depreciated value of the improvements over the remaining life of the lease, reporting an aliquot part each year, with provision that, upon premature termination, a tax should be imposed upon the excess of the then value of the improvements over the amount theretofore returned. \n 5\n\u00a0\n\n In 1935 the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit decided in Hewitt Realty Co. v. Commissioner, \n\n[309 \nU.S. 461, 466]\n\u00a0\n 76 F.2d 880, 98 A.L.R. 1201, that a landlord received no taxable income in a year, during the term of the lease, in which his tenant erected a building on the leased land. The court, while recognizing that the lessor need not receive money to be taxable, based its decision that no taxable gain was realized in that case on the fact that the improvement was not portable or detachable from the land, and if removed would be worthless except as bricks, iron, and mortar. It said, 76 F.2d at page 884: 'The question as we view it is whether the value received is embodied in something separately disposable, or whether it is so merged in the land as to become financially a part of it, something which, though it increases its value, has no value of its own when torn away.'\n This decision invalidated the regulations then in force. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n In 1938 this court decided M. E. Blatt Co. v. United States, \n305 \nU.S. 267\n, 59 S.Ct. 186. There, in connection with the execution of a lease, landlord and tenant mutually agreed that each should make certain improvements to the demised premises and that those made by the tenant should become and remain the property of the landlord. The Commissioner valued the improvements as of the date they were made, allowed depreciation thereon to the termination of the leasehold, divided the depreciated value by the number of years the lease had to run, and found the landlord taxable for each year's aliquot portion thereof. His action was sustained by the Court of Claims. The judgment was reversed on the ground that the added value could not be considered rental accruing over the period of the lease; that the facts found by the Court of Claims did not support the conclusion of the Commissioner as to the value to be attributed to the im- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 461, 467]\n\u00a0\n provements after a use throughout the term of the lease; and that, in the circumstances disclosed, any enhancement in the value of the realty in the tax year was not income realized by the lessor within the Revenue Act.\n The circumstances of the instant case differentiate it from the Blatt and Hewitt cases; but the petitioner's contention that gain was realized when the respondent, through forfeiture of the lease, obtained untrammeled title, possession and control of the premises, with the added increment of value added by the new building, runs counter to the decision in the Miller case and to the reasoning in the Hewitt case.\n The respondent insists that the realty,-a capital asset at the date of the execution of the lease,-remained such throughout the term and after its expiration; that improvements affixed to the soil became part of the realty indistinguishably blended in the capital asset; that such improvements cannot be separately valued or treated as received in exchange for the improvements which were on the land at the date of the execution of the lease; that they are, therefore, in the same category as improvements added by the respondent to his land, or accruals of value due to extraneous and adventitious circumstances. Such added value, it is argued, can be considered capital gain only upon the owner's disposition of the asset. The position is that the economic gain consequent upon the enhanced value of the recaptured asset is not gain derived from capital or realized within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment and may not, therefore, be taxed without apportionment.\n We hold that the petitioner was right in assessing the gain as realized in 1933\n\n\n We might rest our decision upon the narrow issue presented by the terms of the stipulation. It does not appear what kind of a building was erected by the tenant or whether the building was readily removable from the \n\n[309 \nU.S. 461, 468]\n\u00a0\n land. It is not stated whether the difference in the value between the building removed and that erected in its place accurately reflects an increase in the value of land and building considred as a single estate in land. On the facts stipulated, without more, we should not be warranted in holding that the presumption of the correctness of the Commissioner's determination has been overborne.\n The respondent insists, however, that the stipulation was intended to assert that the sum of $51,434.25 was the measure of the resulting enhancement in value of the real estate at the date of the cancellation of the lease. The petitioner seems not to contest this view. Even upon this assumption we think that gain in the amount named was realized by the respondent in the year of repossession.\n The respondent can not successfully contend that the definition of gross income in Sec. 22(a) of the Revenue Act of 19327 is not broad enough to embrace the gain in question. That definition follows closely the Sixteenth Amendment. Essentially the respondent's position is that the Amendment does not permit the taxation of such gain without apportionment amongst the states. He relies upon what was said in Hewitt Realty Co. v. Commissioner, supra, and upon expressions found in the decisions of this court dealing with the taxability of stock dividends to the effect that gain derived from capital must be something of exchangeable value proceeding from property, severed from the capital, however invested or employed, and received by the recipient for his separate use, benefit, and disposal. \n8\n He emphasizes the necessity that the gain be separate from the capital and separately disposable. These expressions, however, \n\n[309 \nU.S. 461, 469]\n\u00a0\n were used to clarify the distinction between an ordinary dividend and a stock dividend. They were meant to show that in the case of a stock dividend, the stockholder's interest in the corporate assets after receipt of the dividend was the same as and inseverable from that which he owned before the dividend was declared. We think they are not controlling here.\n While it is true that economic gain is not always taxable as income, it is settled that the realization of gain need not be in cash derived from the sale of an asset. Gain may occur as a result of exchange of property, payment of the taxpayer's indebtedness, relief from a liability, or other profit realized from the completion of a transaction. \n9\n The fact that the gain is a portion of the value of property received by the taxpayer in the transaction does not negative its realization.\n Here, as a result of a business transaction, the respondent received back his land with a new building on it, which added an ascertainable amount to its value. It is not necessary to recognition of taxable gain that he should be able to sever the improvement begetting the gain from his original capital. If that were necessary, no income could arise from the exchange of property; whereas such gain has always been recognized as realized taxable gain.\n Judgment reversed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE concurs in the result in view of the terms of the stipulation of facts.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS took no part in the decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Helvering v.

Gardner, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Thomas P. Helmey, of Minneapolis, Minn., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1934 respondent declared himself trustee of certain securities which he owned. All net income from the trust was to be held for the 'exclusive benefit' of respondent's wife. The trust was for a term of five years, except that it would terminate earlier on the death of either respondent or his wife. On termination of the trust the entire corpus was to go to respondent, while all 'accrued or undistributed net income' and 'any proceeds from the investment of such net income' was to be treated as property owned absolutely by the wife. During the continuance of the trust respondent was to pay over to his wife the whole or such part of the net income as he in his 'absolute discretion' might determine. And during that period he had full power (a) to exercise all voting powers incident to the trusteed shares of stock; (b) to 'sell, exchange, mortgage, or pledge' any of the securities under the declaration of trust 'whether as part of the corpus or principal thereof or as investments or proceeds and any income therefrom, upon such terms and for such consideration' as respondent in his 'absolute discretion may deem fitting'; (c) to invest 'any cash or money in the trust estate or any income therefrom' by loans, secured or unsecured, by deposits in \n\n[309 \nU.S. 331, 333]\n\u00a0\n banks, or by purchase of securities or other personal property 'without restriction' because of their 'speculative character' or 'rate of return' or any 'laws pertaining to the investment of trust funds'; (d) to collect all income; (e) to compromise, etc., any claims held by him as trustee; (f) to hold any property in the trust estate in the names of 'other persons or in my own name as an individual' except as otherwise provided. Extraordinary cash dividends, stock dividends, proceeds from the sale of unexercised subscription rights, or any enhancement, realized or not, in the value of the securities were to be treated as principal, not income. An exculpatory clause purported to protect him from all losses except those occasioned by his 'own wilful and deliberate' breach of duties as trustee. And finally it was provided that neither the principal nor any future or accrued income should be liable for the debts of the wife; and that the wife could not transfer, encumber, or anticipate any interest in the trust or any income therefrom prior to actual payment thereof to her.\n It was stipulated that while the 'tax effects' of this trust were considered by respondent they were not the 'sole consideration' involved in his decision to set it up, as by this and other gifts he intended to give 'security and economic independence' to his wife and children. It was also stipulated that respondent's wife had substantial income of her own from other sources; that there was no restriction on her use of the trust income, all of which income was placed in her personal checking account, intermingled with her other funds, and expended by her on herself, her children and relatives; that the trust was not designed to relieve respondent from liability for family or household expenses and that after execution of the trust he paid large sums from his personal funds for such purposes.\n Respondent paid a federal gift tax on this transfer. During the year 1934 all income from the trust was dis- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 331, 334]\n\u00a0\n tributed to the wife who included it in her individual return for that year. The Commissioner, however, determined a deficiency in respondent's return for that year on the theory that income from the trust was taxable to him. The Board of Tax Appeals sustained that redetermination. 38 B.T.A. 1532. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. 8 Cir., 105 F.2d 586. We granted certiorari because of the importance to the revenue of the use of such short term trusts in the reduction of surtaxes. \n308 \nU.S. 542\n, 60 S.Ct. 139, 84 L.Ed. --.\n Sec. 22[a] of the Revenue Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 680, 686, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 669, includes among 'gross income' all 'gains, profits, and income derived ... from professions, vocations, trades, businesses, commerce, or sales, or dealings in property, whether real or personal, growing out of the ownership or use of or interest in such property; also from interest, rent, dividends, securities, or the transaction of any business carried on for gain or profit, or gains or profits and income derived from any source whatever.' The broad sweep of this language indicates the purpose of Congress to use the full measure of its taxing power within those definable categories. Cf. Helvering v. Midland Mutual Life Insurance Co., \n300 \nU.S. 216\n, 57 S.Ct. 423, 108 A.L.R. 436. Hence our construction of the statute should be consonant with that purpose. Technical considerations, niceties of the law of trusts or conveyances, or the legal paraphernalia which inventive genius may construct as a refuge from surtaxes should not obscure the basic issue. That issue is whether the grantor after the trust has been established may still be treated, under this statutory scheme as the owner of the corpus. See Blair v. Commissioner, \n300 \nU.S. 5, 12\n, 57 S.Ct. 330, 333. In absence of more precise standards or guides supplied by statute or appropriate regulations,1 \n\n[309 \nU.S. 331, 335]\n\u00a0\n the answer to that question must depend on an analysis of the terms of the trust and all the circumstances attendant on its creation and operation. And where the grantor is the trustee and the beneficiaries are members of his family group, special scrutiny of the arrangement is necessary lest what is in reality but one economic unit be multiplied into two or more2 by devices which, though valid under state law, are not conclusive so far as  22(a) is concerned.\n In this case we cannot conclude as a matter of law that respondent ceased to be the owner of the corpus after the trust was created. Rather, the short duration of the trust, the fact that the wife was the beneficiary, and the retention of control over the corpus by respondent all lead irresistibly to the conclusion that respondent continued to be the owner for purposes of  22(a).\n So far as his dominion and control were concerned it seems clear that the trust did not effect any substantial change. In substance his control over the corpus was in all essential respects the same after the trust was created, as before. The wide powers which he retained included for all practical purposes most of the control which he as an individual would have. There were, we may assume, exceptions, such as his disability to make a gift of the corpus to others during the term of the trust and to make loans to himself. But this dilution in his control would seem to be insignificant and immaterial, since control over investment remained. If it be said that such control is the type of dominion exercised by any trustee, the answer is simple. We have at best a temporary reallocation of income within an intimate family group. Since the income remains in the family and since the husband retains control over the investment, he has rather complete assurance that the trust will not effect \n\n[309 \nU.S. 331, 336]\n\u00a0\n any substantial change in his economic position. It is hard to imagine that respondent felt himself the poorer after this trust had been executed or, if he did, that it had any rational foundation in fact. For as a result of the terms of the trust and the intimacy of the familial relationship respondent retained the substance of full enjoyment of all the rights which previously he had in the property. That might not be true if only strictly legal rights were considered. But when the benefits flowing to him indirectly through the wife are added to the legal rights he retained, the aggregate may be said to be a fair equivalent of what he previously had. To exclude from the aggregate those indirect benefits would be to deprive  22(a) of considerable vitality and to treat as immaterial what may be highly relevant considerations in the creation of such family trusts. For where the head of the household has income in excess of normal needs, it may well make but little difference to him ( except income-tax-wise) where portions of that income are routed-so long as it stays in the family group. In those circumstances the all-important factor might be retention by him of control over the principal. With that control in his hands he would keep direct command over all that he needed to remain in substantially the same financial situation as before. Our point here is that no one fact is normally decisive but that all considerations and circumstances of the kind we have mentioned are relevant to the question of ownership and are appropriate foundations for findings on that issue. Thus, where, as in this case, the benefits directly or indirectly retained blend so imperceptibly with the normal concepts of full ownership, we cannot say that the triers of fact committed reversible error when they found that the husband was the owner of the corpus for the purposes of  22(a). To hold otherwise would be to treat the wife as a complete stranger; to let mere formalism obscure \n\n[309 \nU.S. 331, 337]\n\u00a0\n the normal consequences of family solidarity; and to force concepts of ownership to be fashioned out of legal niceties which may have little or no significance in such household arrangements.\n The bundle of rights which he retained was so substantial that respondent cannot be heard to complain that he is the 'victim of despotic power when for the purpose of taxation he is treated as owner altogether.' See Du Pont v. Commissioner, \n289 \nU.S. 685, 689\n, 53 S.Ct. 766, 767\n\n\n We should add that liability under  22[a] is not foreclosed by reason of the fact that Congress made specific provision in  166, 26 U.S. C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  166, for revocable trusts, but failed to adopt the Treasury recommendation in 1934, Helvering v. Wood, \n309 \nU.S. 344\n, 60 S.Ct. 551, 84 L.Ed. --, that similar specific treatment should be accorded income from short term trusts. Such choice, while relevant to the scope of  166, Helvering v. Wood, supra, cannot be said to have subtracted from  22(a) what was already there. Rather, on this evidence it must be assumed that the choice was between a generalized treatment under  22(a) or specific treatment under a separate provision3 (such as was accorded revocable trusts under  166); not between taxing or not taxing grantors of short term trusts. In view of the broad and sweeping language of  22(a ), a specific provision covering short terms trusts might well do no more than to carve out of  22(a) a defined group of cases to which a rule of thumb \n\n[309 \nU.S. 331, 338]\n\u00a0\n would be applied. The failure of Congress to adopt any such rule of thumb for that type of trust must be taken to do no more than to leave to the triers of fact the initial determination of whether or not on the facts of each case the grantor remains the owner for purposes of  22(a).\n In view of this result we need not examine the contention that the trust device falls within the rule of Lucas v. Earl, \n281 \nU.S. 111\n, 50 S.Ct. 241, and Burnet v. Leininger, \n285 \nU.S. 136\n, 52 S.Ct. 345, relating to the assignment of future income; or that respondent is liable under  166, taxing grantors on the income of revocable trusts.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and that of the Board of Tax Appeals is affirmed.\n It is so ordered.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS.\n I think the judgment should be affirmed.\n The decision of the court disregards the fundamental principle that legislation is not the function of the judiciary but of Congress.\n In every revenue act from that of 1916 to the one now in force a distinction has been made between income of individuals and income from property held in trust. \n1\n It has been the practice to define income of individuals, and, in separate sections, under the heading 'Estates and Trusts', to provide that the tax imposed upon individuals shall apply to the income of estates or of any kind \n\n[309 \nU.S. 331, 339]\n\u00a0\n of property held in trust. A trust is a separate taxable entity. The trust here in question is a true trust.\n While the earlier acts were in force creators of trusts reserved power to repossess the trust corpus. It became common also to establish trusts under which, at the grantor's discretion, all or part of the income might be paid to him, and to set up trusts to pay life insurance premiums upon policies on the grantor's life. The situation was analogous to that now presented. The Treasury, instead of asking this court, under the guise of construction, to amend the act, went to Congress for new legislation. Congress provided, by  219(g)(h) of the Revenue Act of 1924, that if the grantor set up such a life insurance trust, or one under which he could direct the payment of the trust income to himself, or had the power to revest the principal in himself during any taxable year, the income of the trust, for the taxable year, was to be treated as his. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n After the adoption of these amendments taxpayers resorted to the creation of revocable trusts with a provision that more than a year's notice of revocation should be necessary to termination. Such a trust was held not to be within the terms of  219(g) of the Revenue Act of 1924, 43 Stat. 277, because not revocable within the taxable year. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Again, without seeking amendment in the guise of construction from this court, the Treasury applied to Congress, which met the situation by adopting  166 of the Revenue Act of 1934, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  166, which provided that, in the case of a trust under which the grantor reserved the power at \n\n[309 \nU.S. 331, 340]\n\u00a0\n any time to revest the corpus in himself, the income of the trust should be considered that of the grantor.\n The Treasury had asked that there should also be included in that act a provision taxing to the grantor income from short term trusts. After the House Ways and Means Committee had rendered a report on the proposed bill, the Treasury, upon examination of the report, submitted a statement to the Committee containing recommendations for additional provisions; amongst others, the following: '(6) The income from short-term trusts and trusts which are revocable by the creator at the expiration of a short period after notice by him should be made taxable to the creator of the trust.' Congress adopted an amendment to cover the one situation but did not accept the Treasury's recommendation as to the other. \n4\n The statute, as before, clearly provided that the income from a short term irrevocable trust was taxable to the trust, or the beneficiary, and not to the grantor.\n The regulations under  166 of the Act of 1932, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev. Code,  166, contained no suggestion that term trusts were taxable to the creator though, if the petitioner is right, they would be equally so under that act as under later ones. Thus though the Treasury realized that irrevocable short term trusts did not fall within the scope of  166, instead of going to Congress for amendment of the law it comes here with a plea for interpretation which is in effect such amendment.\n Its claim, in support of this effort, that a reversionary interest in the grantor is a 'power to revest' the corpus within the meaning of  166 so as to render the income taxable to the grantor is plainly untenable. \n5\n That theory \n\n[309 \nU.S. 331, 341]\n\u00a0\n was first advanced in a regulation issued under the 1934 act,6 but was abandoned March 7, 1936, when the regulation was revised to read substantially in its present form. \n7\n The Board of Tax Appeals held a possibility of reverter is not the 'power to revest' described in  166.8 The petitioner acquiesced in the decision. \n9\n The Treasury thereafter ruled that a grantor was not taxable on the income of a trust where he had retained a reversionary interest. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n I think it clear that the administrative interpretation has not been consistent and that reenactment of  166 is, therefore, not a ratification by Congress of the present construction.\n The revised regulations indicating that in some circumstances the separate taxability of the trust may be ignored are said to rest on  166, and also on  22(a) which defines income. The regulation is not only without support in the statute but contrary to the entire statutory scheme and, as it now stands, is vague and meaningless, as respects the taxability to the grantor of income from an irrevocable term trust.\n To construe either  166 or  22(a) of the statute as justifying taxation of the income to respondent in this case is, in my judgment, to write into the statute what is not there and what Congress has omitted to place there.\n If judges were members of the legislature they might well vote to amend the act so as to tax such income in order to frustrate avoidance of tax but, as judges, they exercise a very different function. They ought to read the act to cover nothing more than Congress has specified. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 331, 342]\n\u00a0\n Courts ought not to stop loopholes in an act at the behest of the Government, nor relieve from what they deem a harsh provision plainly stated, at the behest of the taxpayer. Relief in either case should be sought in another quarter.\n No such dictum as that Congress has in the income tax law attempted to exercise its power to the fullest extent will justify the extension of a plain provision to an object of taxation not embraced within it. If the contrary were true, the courts might supply whatever they considered a deficiency in the sweep of a taxing act. I cannot construe the court's opinion as attempting less.\n The fact that the petitioner is in truth asking us to legislate in this case is evident from the form of the existing regulation and from the argument presented. The important portion of the regulation reads as follows: 'In determining whether the grantor is in substance the owner of the corpus, the Act has its own standard, which is a substantial one, dependent neither on the niceties of the particular conveyancing device used nor on the technical description which the law of property gives to the estate or interest transferred to the trustees or beneficiaries of the trust. In that determination, among the material factors are: The fact that the corpus is to be returned to the grantor after a specific term; the fact that the corpus is or may be administered in the interest of the grantor; the fact that the anticipated income is being appropriated in advance for the customary expenditures of the grantor or those which he would ordinarily and naturally make; and any other circumstance bearing on the impermanence and indefiniteness with which the grantor has parted with the substantial incidents of ownership in the corpus.'\n In his brief the petitioner says:\n'On the other hand, the income of a long term irrevocable trust which committed the possession and control \n\n[309 \nU.S. 331, 343]\n\u00a0\n of the corpus to an independent trustee would not likely be taxed to the settlor merely because of a reversionary interest. The question here, as in many other tax problems, is simply one of degree. The grantor's liability to tax must depend upon whether he retains so many of the attributes of ownership as to require that he be treated as the owner for tax purposes, or whether he has given up the substance of his dominion and control over the trust property.\n\n'Under these circumstances, the question of precisely where the line should be drawn between those irrevocable trusts which deprive the grantor of command over the trust property and those which leave in him the practical equivalent of ownership is, in our view, a matter peculiarly for the judgment of the agency charged with the administration of the tax law.' (Italics supplied.)\n\n It is not our function to draw any such line as the argument suggests. That is the prerogative of Congress. As far back as 1922, Parliament amended the British Income Tax Act, so that there would be no dispute as to what short term trust income should be taxable to the grantor, by making taxable to him any income which, by virtue of any disposition, is payable to, or applicable for the benefit of, any other person for a period which cannot exceed six years. \n 11\n\u00a0\n\n If some short term trusts are to be treated as non-existent for income tax purposes, it is for Congress to specify them.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS joins in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] We have not considered here Art. 166-1 of Treasury Regulations 86 promulgated under  166 of the 1934 Act and in 1936 amended (T.D. 4629) so as to rest on  22(a) also, since the tax in question arose prior to that amendment. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See Paul, The Background of the Revenue Act of 1937, 5 Univ.Chic.L.

Eubank \n311 \nU.S. 122\n (1940) ]\n\n\n[311 \nU.S. 122, 124]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a companion case to Helvering v. Horst, \n311 \nU.S. 112\n, 61 S.Ct. 144, decided this day, and presents issues not distinguishable from those in that case.\n Respondent, a general life insurance agent, after the termination of his agency contracts and services as agent, made assignments in 1924 and 1928 respectively of renewal commissions to become payable to him for services which had been rendered in writing policies of insurance under two of his agency contracts. The Commissioner assessed the renewal commissions paid by the companies to the assignees in 1933 as income taxable to the assignor in that year under the provisions of the 1932 Revenue Act, 47 Stat. 169,  22, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 487, of which does not differ in any respect now material from  22 of the 1934 Revenue Act, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 669, involved in the Horst case. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the order of the Board of Tax Appeals sustaining the assessment. 110 F.2d 737; 39 B.T.A. 583. We granted certiorari October 14, 1940. \n311 \nU.S. 630\n, 61 S.Ct. 27, 85 L.Ed. --.\n No purpose of the assignments appears other than to confer on the assignees the power to collect the commis- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 122, 125]\n\u00a0\n sions, which they did in the taxable year. The Government and respondent have briefed and argued the case here on the assumption that the assignments were voluntary transfers to the assignees of the right to collect the commissions as and when they became payable, and the record affords no basis for any other.\n For the reasons stated at length in the opinion in the Horst case, we hold that the commissions were taxable as income of the assignor in the year when paid. The judgment below is\nREVERSED.\n The separate opinion of Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS.\n The cause was decided upon stipulated facts. The following statement taken from the court's opinion discloses the issues:\n'The question presented is whether renewal commissions payable to a general agent of a life insurance company after the termination of his agency and by him assigned prior to the taxable year must be included in his income despite the assignment.\n\n'During part of the year 1924 the petitioner was employed by The Canada Life Assurance Company as its branch manager for the state of Michigan. His compensation consisted of a salary plus certain commissions. His employment terminated on September 1, 1924. Under the terms of his contract he was entitled to renewal commissions on premiums thereafter collected by the company on policies written prior to the termination of his agency, without the obligation to perform any further services. In November 1924 he assigned his right, title and interest in the contract as well as the renewal commissions to a corporate trustee. From September 1, 1924 to June 30, 1927, the petitioner and another, constituting the firm of Hart & Eubank, were general agents in New York City for the Aetna Life Assurance Com- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 122, 126]\n\u00a0\n pany, and from July 1, 1927, to August 31, 1927, the petitioner individually was general agent for said Aetna Company. The Aetna contracts likewise contained terms entitling the agent to commissions on renewal premiums paid after termination of the agency, without the performance of any further services. On March 28, 1928 the petitioner assigned to the corporate trustee all commissions to become due him under the Aetna contracts. During the year 1933 the trustee collected by virtue of the assignments renewal commissions payable under the three agency contracts above mentioned, amounting to some $15,600. These commissions were taxed to the petitioner by the commissioner and the Board has sustained the deficiency resulting therefrom.' (110 F.2d 738.)\n\n The court below declared: 'In the case at bar the petitioner owner a right to receive money for past services; no further services were required. Such a right is assignable. At the time of assignment there was nothing contingent in the petitioner's right, although the amount collectible in future years was still uncertain and contingent. But this may be equally true where the assignment transfers a right to income from investments, as in Blair v. Commissioner, \n300 \nU.S. 5\n, 57 S.Ct. 330, and Horst v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 107 F.2d 906, or a right to patent royalties, as in Nelson v. Ferguson, 3 Cir., 56 F.2d 121, certiorari denied \n286 \nU.S. 565\n, 52 S.Ct. 646. By an assignment of future earnings a taxpayer may not escape taxation upon his compensation in the year when he earns it. But when a taxpayer who makes his income tax return on a cash basis assigns a right to money payable in the future for work already performed, we believe that he transfers a property right, and the money, when received by the assignee, is not income taxable to the assignor.'\n Accordingly, the Board of Tax Appeals was reversed; and this, I think, is in accord with the statute and our opinions. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 122, 127]\n\u00a0\n The assignment in question denuded the assignor of all right to commissions thereafter to accrue under the contract with the insurance company. He could do nothing further in respect of them; they were entirely beyond his control. In no proper sense were they something either earned or received by him during the taxable year. The right to collect became the absolute property of the assignee without relation to future action by the assignor.\n A mere right to collect future payments, for services already performed is not presently taxable as 'income derived' from such services. It is property which may be assigned. Whatever the assignor receives as consideration may be his income; but the statute does not undertake to impose liability upon him because of payments to another under a contract which he had transferred in good faith, under circumstances like those here disclosed.\n As in Helvering v. Horst just decided, the petitioner relies upon opinions here; but obviously they arose upon facts essentially different from those now presented. They do not support his contention. The general principles approved in Blair v. Commissioner, \n300 \nU.S. 5\n, 57 S.Ct. 330, and applied in Helvering v. Horst, are controlling and call for affirmation of the judgment under review.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice ROBERTS concur in this opinion. \n\n\n\n","46":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHELVERING v. FITCH(1940)\nNo. 243\nArgued: Decided: January 29, 1940\n\n\n\n\n[309 \nU.S. 149, 150]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Arnold Raum, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Wm. D. Mitchell, of New York City, and Arnold F. Schaetzle, of Des Moines, Iowa, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner claimed that an amount of $7,128 distributed in 1933 under a so-called alimony trust to respondent's divorced wife should have been included in respondent's taxable income for that year. The Board of Tax Appeals agreed and found a deficiency. 37 B.T.A. 1330. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, and judge dissenting, 8 Cir., 103 F.2d 702. We granted certiorari, \n308 \nU.S. 535\n, 60 S.Ct. 103, 84 L.Ed. --, because of the asserted failure of that court correctly to apply the principle involved in Douglas v. Willcuts, \n296 \nU.S. 1\n, 56 S.Ct. 59, 101 A.L.R. 391.\n The so-called alimony trust in question was created a few years before the divorce, while respondent and his wife were separated, and in settlement of a suit brought by her for separate maintenance. Certain premises (a hair tonic factory and a long term lease thereon) were transferred to a trustee to hold title, collect rents and after deduction of expenses to pay the wife $600 a month during her life and the balance to respondent for his life. \n1\n On the death of either respondent or his wife the de- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 149, 151]\n\u00a0\n ceased's share of the income was to be paid to their children. \n2\n The trust was to continue at least fifteen years. On the death of both respondent and his wife the principal was to be paid over to their children. The trust was irrevocable. And while respondent covenanted to pay off certain encumbrances on the trust property, he did not underwrite in whole or in part the $600 monthly payments to his wife.\n In 1925 she filed suit for a divorce in an Iowa court. A property settlement was agreed upon which included the trust agreement and, in addition, provided for a transfer to her by respondent of certain shares of stock and cash. \n3\n The divorce decree confirmed the property and alimony settlement. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The general rule is clear. 'Amounts paid to a divorced wife under a decree for alimony are not regarded as income of the wife but as paid in discharge of the general obligation to support, which is made specific by the decree'. Douglas v. Willcuts, supra, 296 U.S. at page 8, 56 S.Ct. at page 62, 101 A.L.R. 391. It is plain that there the alimony trust, which was approved by the divorce decree, was merely security for a continuing obli- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 149, 152]\n\u00a0\n gation of the taxpayer to support his dovorced wife. That was made evident not only by his agreement to make up any deficiencies in the $15,000 annual sum to be paid her under the trust. It was also confirmed by the power of the Minnesota divorce court subsequently to alter and revise its decree and the provisions made therein for the wife's benefit. Likewise consistent with the use of the alimony trust as a security device was the provision that on death of the divorced wife the corpus of the trust was to be transferred back to the taxpayer. Respondent insists that in the instant case there is no continuing obligation to which the income of the alimony trust is applied but rather that the property and alimony settlement approved by the Iowa court effected an absolute discharge of any duty or obligation on his part to support his divorced wife. It is true that there is no covenant or guarantee to make up any deficiency in the monthly payment to his divorced wife, as there was in the Douglas case. And unlike that alimony trust, the instant one, though granting the taxpayer a participation in the income, irrevocably alienates the corpus. Other indicia of the use of this alimony trust as a security device for any continuing obligation of respondent are alleged to be absent by reason of the lack of power in the Iowa court to modify the decree confirming the property and alimony settlement.\n The Iowa statute provides: 'When a divorce is decreed, the court may make such order in relation to the children, property, parties, and the maintenance of the parties as shall be right. Subsequent changes may be made by it in these respects when circumstances render them expedient.' \n5\n\u00a0\n\n Admittedly the court under that statute has the power to modifyprovisions in the original decree for the con- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 149, 153]\n\u00a0\n tinued support and maintenance of the wife. \n6\n And it likewise seems well settled by a long line of Iowa cases that where the original decree makes no provision for alimony, there is no power subsequently to modify the decree so as to provide it. \n7\n And, respondent contends, where alimony is allowed in a lump sum or a property settlement is ratified by the decree, the court retains no power to modify.\n Spain v. Spain, 177 Iowa, 249, 158 N.W. 529, L.R.A.1917D, 319, Ann. Cas.1918E, 1225 and McCoy v. McCoy, 191 Iowa, 973, 183 N.W. 377, on which respondent and the Circuit Court of Appeals place reliance are not in point since those divorce decrees, unlike the instant one, made no provision for alimony. In Spain v. Spain, supra, the Supreme Court of Iowa specifically reserved the question of the power to modify a divorce decree involving a property settlement. As to that it said (177 Iowa at pages 260, 261, 158 N.W. at page 533): 'As to an award in gross or a division of the property based upon an equitable approtionment of the property of either of the parties at the time the divorce is granted, we have no occasion to speak, for that matter is not in the case.'\n Likewise Barish v. Barish, 190 Iowa 493, 180 N.W. 724, cited below and urged here in support of respondent's contention, is of little aid, for in spite of a strong concurring opinion that the court had no power to modify an allowance of 'gross' or 'permanent' alimony, the majority applied the statute and concluded (190 Iowa at page 501, 180 N.W. at page 727) 'Whatever the extent of the power of the court may be to make such increase, it is always slow to exercise such \n\n[309 \nU.S. 149, 154]\n\u00a0\n power, except in the presence of extraordinary circumstances, such as are not present here.' To be sure, there is the following strong statement in Kraft v. Kraft, 193 Iowa, 602, 607, 187 N.W. 449, 451: 'We are inclined to the view that where alimony is allowed in a lump sum as permanent alimony, or there is a division of the real property of the parties, as permanent alimony, the statute does not authorize a change therein, except for such reasons which would justify the setting aside or changing a decree in any other case; that the party awarded permanent alimony is not entitled to permanent alimony and support both ....' And in Carr v. Carr, 185 Iowa, 1205, at page 1211, 171 N.W. 785, at page 787, that court stated: 'Alimony is allowed in lieu of dower and the prior duty of support, and a review of the decree awarding or refusing same can be had only for such fraud or mistake as would authorize the setting aside or modification of any other decree.' In that case the divorce decree required the husband, inter alia, to convey certain real estate to a trustee for the exclusive benefit of the wife to be held in trust for five years, during which time the income was to be paid over to the wife and at the end thereof the trustee, on demand, was to convey the property to her. Meanwhile, the trustee had the power to sell the property at not less than $100 an acre. Shortly before the expiration of the five-year period, the divorced husband filed a cross- petition in the divorce suit asking for a modification of the trust in order to protect his former wife from her own extravagance and her inexperience in business affairs. Apparently the relief asked was not based on the Iowa statute giving the court power to make subsequent changes in the divorce decree 'when circumstances render them expedient.' For the court stated that the modification of the decree was sought on the grounds (1) that the donor of the trust was entitled to have it carried out \n\n[309 \nU.S. 149, 155]\n\u00a0\n in accordance with its terms and the real purpose for which it was created; and (2) that, in the alternative, he was entitled to have a guardian of the property appointed.\n However that may be, much of the weight which respondent accords Kraft v. Kraft and Carr v. Carr, supra, seems to have been dissipated by McNary v. McNary, 206 Iowa 942, 221 N.W. 580. In that case the Supreme Court of Iowa had squarely before it the question of whether or not under the foreigoing statute a decree of permanent alimony awarding personal and real property to the wife could be altered. The court after stating that it knew of no case where such a decree had been subsequently modified, added (206 Iowa at page 946, 221 N.W. at page 581): 'This question is not argued by the parties, and we find it unnecessary to make a pronouncement thereon.' And, significantly, it proceeded to apply the statute and finding that its conditions had not been satisfied, it denied the relief asked by the divorced husband.\n On this state of the Iowa authorities we can only speculate as to the power of the Iowa court to modify alimony awarded in a lump sum or a property settlement ratified by a divorce decree. To be sure, Kraft v. Kraft, supra, involved some features common to the instant case, since the wife was to receive the income of $4,000 to be placed in trust by the husband or, until he placed it in trust, 5 per cent on that amount. But the refusal to modify that decree was not placed squarely, or even largely, on the lack of power to do so but on other circumstances. Furthermore, the uncertainty created by McNary v. McNary, supra, makes perhaps for even greater uncertainty where an alimony trust of the kind here involved is concerned. At least respondent has not established a necessary identity in treatment of transfers of personal or real property on the one hand and allow- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 149, 156]\n\u00a0\n ance of income out of this kind of alimony trust on the other. Even on the authority of Kraft v. Kraft, supra, respondent has not clearly shown that in Iowa divorce law the court has lost all jurisdiction to alter or revise the amount of income payable to the wife from an enterprise which has been placed in trust. For all that we know it might retain the power to reallocate the income from that property even though it lacked the power to add to or subtract from the corpus or to tap other sources of income. \n8\n If it did have such power, then it could be said that a decree approving an alimony trust of the kind here involved merely placed upon the preexisting duty of the husband a particular and specified sanction. In that event, the case would be little different from one where the husband was directed to make specified payments to the divorced wife. And we see no reason why the rule of Douglas v. Willcuts, supra, should not then apply.\n Enough has been said to show that respondent has not sustained the burden of establishing that his case falls outside the general rule expressed in Douglas v. Willcuts, supra. If we were to conclude that this case is an exception to that rule we would be acting largely on conjecture as to Iowa law. That we cannot do. For if such a result is to obtain, it must be bottomed on clear and convincing proof, and not on mere inferences and vague conjectures, that local law and the alimony trust have given the divorced husband a full discharge and leave no continuing obligation however contingent. Only in that event can income to the wife from an alimony trust be treated under the revenue acts the same as income accruing from property after a debtor has transferred that property to his creditor in full satisfaction of \n\n[309 \nU.S. 149, 157]\n\u00a0\n his obligation-unless of course Congress decides otherwise.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice REED concurs in the result.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS is of the opinion that the judgment below should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Respondent and his wife separated in 1917. In 1919 respondent purchased a home for his wife, furnished it for her, and gave her an automobile. In the same year F. W. Fitch Co. wasincorporated and acquired the assets of a predecessor partnership in exchange for 2,000 of its shares. Of these shares 1860 were issued to respondent and 10 to his wife. She was also an officer and director of the company, with a monthly salary of $300.\n When the separate maintenance suit was settled in 1923, respondent leased certain premises, owned by him, to the F. W. Fitch Co. for 99 years, at an annual rental of $12,000. These premises and that lease were transferred to the trustee. Upon creation of the trust the wife ceased to be an officer and director of F. W.

Gen., and Arnold Raum, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[310 \nU.S. 69, 71]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Francis W. Cole, of Hartford, Conn., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case raises the question of the circumstances under which income paid to the taxpayer's divorced wife under a trust, the provisions of which have been approved in the divorce decree, is taxable to him. We granted certiorari because of the asserted misapplication by the Circuit Court of Appeals of the rule of Douglas v. Willcuts, \n296 \nU.S. 1\n, 56 S.Ct. 59, 101 A.L.R. 391, to these facts. \n309 \nU.S. 644\n, 60 S.Ct. 511, 84 L.Ed. --.\n On July 25, 1930, respondent and his wife, residing in Connecticut, entered into an agreement in contemplation of divorce which provided, inter alia, for the creation by him of a trust of 60,380 shares of Class A common stock of the Fuller Brush Co. The trust was irrevocable and was to continue for ten years. During that period all trust income was to be used for the maintenance and support of the wife, or in case of her prior decease, then for the children; or in case of their prior decease, then for the heirs of the wife or as she should provide in her will. At the expiration of the ten-year period the trust property was to be transferred to her outright. The agreement provided for other property settlements, for control and custody of the children, and for waiver by respondent and his wife of all claims against each other arising out of the marital relation. It also contained an agreement on the part of respondent to pay the wife $40 per week for five years, and, if at the end of that period his annual net income exceeded by the amount of the weekly payments the sum of $60,000, to continue those weekly payments for an additional five years or for such portion thereof as his annual net income exceeded the above sum. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 69, 72]\n\u00a0\n The wife repaired to Reno, Nevada, and obtained a divorce decree on November 12, 1930, which 'ordered, adjudged, and decreed that said agreement entered into between the plaintiff and the defendant on or about the twenty-fifth day of July, 1930, be and the same hereby is approved.' On December 22, 1930, respondent created the trust provided for in the agreement. \n1\n The corporate trustee thereunder received from the Fuller Brush Co. all the dividends and income from the trusteed shares during 1931, 1932 and 1933 and disbursed them all for the benefit of the divorced wife. On the failure of respondent to include those amounts in his tax returns for the years in question, the Commissioner assessed deficiencies. The decisions of the Board of Tax Appeals (37 B.T.A. 1333), sustaining the action of the Commissioner, were reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 2 Cir., 105 F.2d 903. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 69, 73]\n\u00a0\n I. There can be no doubt but that respondent is taxable on the $40 weekly payment to the wife. That is a continuing personal obligation falling within the rule of Douglas v. Willcuts, supraAs a result of which those payments are taxable to him, not to the wife. Gould v. Gould, \n245 \nU.S. 151\n, 38 S.Ct. 53. But that fact does not make the income from the trust also taxable to him. Although the provisions for the weekly payments and for the trust agreement were embodied in the same separation agreement, they were not so interrelated or interdependent as to make the trust a security for the weekly payments. Functionally they were as independent of each other as were the other property settlements from either of them.\n II. Petitioner does not challenge the conclusion of the Circuit Court of Appeals that, so far as the trust agreement is concerned, the Nevada court retained no power to alter or modify the divorce decree. It seems to be admitted that under Nevada law the wife's allowance once made is final, Sweeney v. Sweeney, 42 Nev. 431, 179 P. 638, unless the decree itself expressly reserves the power to modify it, Lewis v. Lewis, 53 Nev. 398, 2 P.2d 131, or unless the decree approves a settlement which in turn provides for a modification. Aseltine v. Second Judicial District Court, 57 Nev. 269, 62 P.2d 701. Here no such power was reserved in the decree or in the trust agreement approved by the decree. Nor did respondent underwrite the principal or income from the trust or any part thereof or make any commitments, contingent or otherwise, respecting them, beyond his promise to transfer the securities to a trustee. But petitioner argues that the rule of Douglas v. Willcuts, supra, should nonetheless apply since the decree recognized the husband's pre-existing duty to support and defined that duty as coextensive with what the parties had themselves arranged, and since the husband simply carved out future income from property \n\n[310 \nU.S. 69, 74]\n\u00a0\n which he then owned and devoted it in advance to the discharge of his obligation.\n We take a different view. If respondent had not placed the shares of stock in trust but had transferred them outright to his wife as part of the property settlement, there seems to be no doubt that income subsequently accrued and paid thereon would be taxable to the wife, not to him. Under the present statutory scheme that case would be no different from one where any debtor, voluntarily or under the compulsion of a court decree, transfers securities, a farm, an office building, or the like, to his creditor in whole or partial payment of his debt. Certainly it could not be claimed that income thereafter accruing from the transferred property must be included in the debtor's income tax return. If the debtor retained no right or interest in and to the property, he would cease to be the owner for purposes of the federal revenue acts. See Helvering v. Clifford, \n309 \nU.S. 331\n, 60 S.Ct. 554, 84 L.Ed. --. To hold that a different result necessarily obtains where the transfer is made or the trust is created as part of a property settlement attendant on a divorce would be to hold that for purposes of the federal income tax the marital obligation of the husband to support his wife cannot be discharged. But whether or not it can be depends on state law. For other purposes, local law determines the status of the parties and their property after a decree dissolving the matrimonial bonds. See Barrett v. Failing, \n111 \nU.S. 523\n, 4 S.Ct. 598. And while the federal income tax is to be given a uniform construction of national application, Congress frequently has made it dependent on state law. See Thomas v. Perkins, \n301 \nU.S. 655, 659\n, 57 S. Ct. 911, 912, and cases cited. In the instant situation, an inquiry into state law seems inescapable. For the provisions in the revenue acts2 \n\n[310 \nU.S. 69, 75]\n\u00a0\n and regulations3 concerning the non-deductibility of 'family expenses' and of 'alimony' do not illuminate the problem beyond implying the necessity for an examination of local law to determine the marital status and the obligations which have survived a divorce. The Nevada cases tell us that under such a decree as was entered here the obligation to support was pro tanto discharged and ended. And the trust agreement contains no contractual undertaking by respondent, contingent or otherwise, for support of the wife. Hence we can only conclude that respondent's personal obligation is not a continuing one but has been discharged pro tanto. To hold that it was not would be to find substantial differences between this irrevocable trust and an outright transfer of the shares to the wife, where in terms of local divorce law we can see only attenuated ones. This is not to imply that Congress lacks authority to design a different statutory scheme applying uniform standards for the taxation of income of the socalled alimony trusts. A somewhat comparable statute taxing to the grantor income from a trust applied to the payment of premiums upon insurance policies on his life was upheld in Burnet v. Wells, \n289 \nU.S. 670\n, 53 S.Ct. 761. But the reach of Congressional power is one thing; an interpretation of a federal revenue act based on local divorce law, quite another.\n For the reasons we have stated, it seems clear that local law and the trust have given the respondent pro tanto a full discharge from his duty to support his divorced wife and leave no continuing obligation, contingent or otherwise. Hence under Helvering v. Fitch, \n309 \nU.S. 149\n, 60 S.Ct. 427, 84 L.Ed. --, income to the wife from this trust is to be treated the same as income accruing from property after a debtor \n\n[310 \nU.S. 69, 76]\n\u00a0\n has transferred that property to his creditor in full satisfaction of his obligation. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n III. One other observation is pertinent. Though the divorce decree extinguishes the husband's pre-existing duty to support the wife, and though no provision of the trust agreement places such obligation on him, that agreement may nevertheless leave him with sufficient interest in or control over the trust as to make him the owner of the corpus for purposes of the federal income tax. Helvering v. Clifford, supra.\n As we have seen, respondent did retain considerable control over the trusteed shares. But that was not the basis for the assessment of the deficiency by the Commissioner. It was not passed upon by the Board of Tax Appeals or the Circuit Court of Appeals. It was not included in the petition for certiorari among the errors to be urged or the reasons for granting the writ. Nor did petitioner brief or argue the point here. Hence we do not pass on the applicability of the rule of Helvering v. Clifford, supra, to these facts. Cf. Helvering v. Wood, \n309 \nU.S. 344\n, 60 S.Ct. 551, 84 L.Ed. --.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice REED (dissenting).\n The opinion of the Court in this case is made to turn upon the question whether the law of the taxpayer's residence withdraws divorce settlements from the continuing supervision and subsequent modification of the courts. Two trusts, both irrevocable, in words precisely the same, drawn for the purpose of providing maintenance for former wife, recognized or approved by divorce decrees identical in form, are to have different tax results upon the settlor. If income taxes are predominantly important, prospective divorce  must locate in the \n\n[310 \nU.S. 69, 77]\n\u00a0\n states where the finality of the settlement is clearly established. Compare Douglas v. Willcuts,1 Helvering v. Fitch2 and Helvering v. Leonard 3 with this case. The reason given to support such a conclusion is that the liability of the settlor for taxes on trust income is based on the possibility that the settlor may be called upon for additional sums in the future. If the obligation continues, the tax liability continues. If the obligation is ended, the tax liability is ended. In Douglas v. Willcuts continued liability existed. It does not seem to me, however, that this continuing liability was the real basis for the Douglas decision. The basis for that decision was the prior appropriation, by the creation of the trust, of future income to meet an obligation of the taxpayer. The following excerpts from pages 8 and 9 of 296 U.S., 56 S.Ct. page 62, 101 A.L.R. 391, show the foundation for the conclusion:\n'Within the limits prescribed by the statute (and there is no suggestion that the provision here went beyond those limits) the court had full authority to make an allowance to the wife out of her husband's property and to set up a trust to give effect to that allowance.\n\n'Upon the pre-existing duty of the husband the decree placed a particular and adequate sanction, and imposed upon petitioner the obligation to devote the income in question, through the medium of the trust, to the use of his divorced wife.\n\n'The creation of a trust by the taxpayer as the channel for the application of the income to the discharge of his obligation leaves the nature of the transaction unaltered. ... In the present case, the net income of the \n\n[310 \nU.S. 69, 78]\n\u00a0\n trust fund, which was paid to the wife under the decree, stands substantially on the same footing as though he had received the income personally and had been required by the decree to make the payment directly.'\n\n The Fitch case was the first to rely explicitly upon the finality of the settlement. It pushed the idea to the point that the burden was upon the settlor to demonstrate the clear finality of the local settlement. This Court there refused to draw its own conclusion as to what the local law was even though numerous state cases touched upon the subject. In Helvering v. Leonard, this Court continues to apply the finality rule. It interprets the local law and finds that while 'mere property settlements ... may not be modified' the state judicial reserve power may be exercised where 'the provision in the separate agreement, approved by the decree' is for support and maintenance. We are now at the point where the taxability of the settlor depends not only on the 'clear and convincing proof' of the finality of the decree, but the ability to produce that proof depends upon the skill of the draftsman of the settlement. Fine distinctions are necessary in reasoning but most undesirable in a national tax system.\n It is no answer to the problem to say that if the stock had been transferred outright to the wife the husband would not be liable for the tax. If the stock had been kept by the husband and dividends paid as alimony, he would have been liable. \n4\n Either analogy might be logically followed in the trust situation but the choice of taxability of trust income was made in Douglas v. Willcuts. That case determines the 'general rule.' \n5\n\u00a0\n\n It may be assumed that the original obligation of the husband to support a divorced wife depends upon state law and to that extent that the state law is applicable to \n\n[310 \nU.S. 69, 79]\n\u00a0\n the determination of liability under the federal income tax act. But that necessary reliance upon local law need be carried no farther than the determination of obligation to support. Once that is determined the applicability of the theory of constructive receipt of income to discharge the obligation would come into play and would be nationwide in extent.\n The obligation to support exists prior to the divorce decree. It is ended in Nevada only upon getting the court's approval to an arrangement which permits the creation of a fund to meet from year to year the obligation from which the Nevada law then and only then releases the settlor husband. \n6\n It is by the court's approval that the continuing obligation is discharged. Granting that a lump sum payment would terminate both the marital and the tax liability, the creation of a trust, approved by the court, for continuous payments in lieu of alimony seems to bring the trust income much closer to alimony than to the situation of a final settlement by lump sum payment.\n This is particularly true in this present case where the settlement agreement shows that the husband retained voting power over the stock placed in trust. 60,380 shares of Class A Common Stock of the Fuller Brush Company, the only class of voting stock, was placed in the trust. An equal amount was retained by the taxpayer. The aggregate was a majority of the total of voting stock outstanding. This power, retained to the settlor, is of weight in determining that the present trust is more nearly akin to an agreement to pay alimony than it is to a satisfaction of an obligation by an unrestricted transfer.\n The judgment should be reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The trust agreement provided that he was to transfer the $60,380 shares of stock on the books of the company from himself personally to himself as trustee and then to deliver the certificate for such shares to the corporate trustee. Thus was done. Also in accordance with the provisions of the trust respondent executed a dividend order against the shares directing the Fuller Brush Co. to pay all dividends to the corporate trustee. Respondent was the founder of the company and during the years in question was its president. It had outstanding only one class of voting stock, viz. Class A common. The amount outstanding during these years varied between 172,000 and 186,000 shares. Respondent owned 60,380 shares which together with the 60,380 shares under the trust constituted more than a majority of that class of stock. By terms of the trust respondent retained 'exclusive voting power' of the trusteed shares during the term of the trust. If he died before its termination, the voting power would pass to the wife. During that period power to sell the stock was vested jointly in him, the wife, and the corporate trustee and could be exercised only in case all three agreed in writing. In case of such a sale, those three had the power to invest and reinvest the proceeds. They also were given the power to disburse, withhold, and accumulate the principal of the trust at their sole discretion, such power over the income being vested in the wife and the corporate trustee. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Revenue Act of 1928, 45 Stat. 791,  24(a)(1).

In each case the Commissioner of Internal Revenue included the trust property in the decedent's gross estate. In Nos. 110, 111 and 112 his determination was reversed by the Board of Tax Appeals (34 B.T.A. 575) and the Board was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 102 F.2d 1. In No. 183, the taxpayer paid under protest, successfully sued for recovery in the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and his judgment was sustained by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. 103 F.2d 834. In No. 399, the Commissioner was in part successful before the Board of Tax Appeals (36 B.T.A. 669) and the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the Board. 104 F.2d 1011\n\n\n Neither here nor below does the issue turn on the unglossed text of  302(c). In its enforcement, Treasury and courts alike encounter three recent decisions of this Court, Klein v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 231\n, 51 S. Ct. 398, Helvering v. St. Louis Trust Co., \n296 \nU.S. 39\n, 56 S. Ct. 74, 100 A.L.R. 1239, and Becker v. St. Louis Trust Co., \n296 \nU.S. 48\n, 56 S.Ct. 78. Because of the difficulties which lower courts have found in applying the distinctions made by these cases and the seeming disharmony of their results, when judged by the controlling purposes of the estate tax law, we brought the cases here. Helvering v. Hallock, \n308 \nU.S. 532\n, 60 S.Ct. 82, 84 L.Ed. --; Rothensies v. Cassell, \n308 \nU.S. 538\n, 60 S.Ct. 94, 84 L.Ed. --; Bryant v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, \n308 \nU.S. 543\n, 60 S.Ct. 141, 84 L.Ed. --. All involve dispositions of property by way of trust in which the settlement provides for return or reversion of the corpus to the donor upon a contingency terminable at his death. Whether the transfer made by the decedent in his lifetime is 'intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death' by reason of that which he retained, is the crux of the problem. We must put to one side questions that arise under sections of the estate tax law other than  302(c)-sections, that is, relating to transfers taking place at death. Section 302(c) deals with \n\n[309 \nU.S. 106, 111]\n\u00a0\n property not technically passing at death but with interests theretofore created. The taxable event is a transfer inter vivos. But the measure of the tax is the value of the transferred property at the time when death brings it into enjoyment.\n We turn to the cases which beget the difficulties. In Klein v. United States, supra, decided in 1931, the decedent during his lifetime had conveyed land to his wife for her lifetime, 'and if she shall die prior to the decease of said grantor then and in that event she shall by virtue hereof take no greater or other estate in said lands and the reversion in fee in and to the same shall in that event remain vested in said grantor , ....' The instrument further provided, 'Upon condition and in the event that said grantee shall survive the said grantor, then and in that case only the said grantee shall by virtue of this conveyance take, have, and hold the said lands in fee simple, ....' The taxpayer contended that the decedent had reserved a mere 'possibility of reverter' and that such a 'remote interest',2 extinguishable upon the grantor's death, was not sufficient to bring the conveyance within the reckoning of the taxable estate. This Court held otherwise. It rejected formal distinctions pertaining to the law of real property as irrelevant criteria in this field of taxation. 'Nothing is to be gained', it was said, 'by multiplying words in respect of the various niceties of the art of conveyancing or the law of contingent and vested remainders. It is perfectly plain that the death of the grantor was the indispensable and intended event which brought the larger estate into being for the grantee and effected its transmission from the dead to the living, thus satisfying the terms of the taxing act and justifying the tax imposed.' Klein v. United States, supra, 283 U.S. at page 234, 51 S.Ct. at page 399. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 106, 112]\n\u00a0\n The inescapable rationale of this decision, rendered by a unanimous Court, was that the statute taxes not merely those interests which are deemed to pass at death according to refined technicalities of the law of property. It also taxes inter vivos transfers that are too much akin to testamentary dispositions not to be subjected to the same excise. By bringing into the gross estate at his death that which the settlor gave contingently upon it, this Court fastened on the vital factor. It refused to subordinate the plain purposes of a modern fiscal measure to the wholly unrelated origins of the recondite learning of ancient property law. Surely the Klein decision was not intended to encourage the belief that a change merely in the phrasing of a grant would serve to create a judicially cognizable difference in the scope of  302(c), although the grantor retained in himself the possibility of regaining the transferred property upon precisely the same contingency. The teaching of the Klein case is exactly the opposite. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n In 1935 the St. Louis Trust cases came here. A rational application of the principles of the Klein case to the situations now before us calls for scrutiny of the particulars in the St. Louis cases in order to extract their relation to the doctrine of the earlier decision.\n In Helvering v. St. Louis Trust Co., supra, the decedent had conveyed property in trust, the income of which was to be paid to his daughter during her life, but at her death 'If the grantor still be living, the Trustee shall forthwith ... transfer, pay, and deliver the entire estate to the grantor, to be his absolutely.' But 'If the grantor be then not living' then the income was to be \n\n[309 \nU.S. 106, 113]\n\u00a0\n devoted to the settlor's wife if she were living, and upon the death of both daughter and wife, if he were not living, the trust property was to go to the daughter's children, or if she left none, to the grantor's next of kin.\n In Becker v. St. Louis Trust Co., supra, the decedent had declared himself trustee of property with the income to be accumulated or, at his discretion, to be paid over to his daughter during her life. The instrument further provided that (\n296 \nU.S. 48\n, 56 S.Ct. 79) 'If the said beneficiary should die before my death, then this trust estate shall thereupon revert to me and become mine immediately and absolutely, or ... if I should die before her death, then this property shall thereupon become hers immediately and absolutely ....'\n On the authority of the Klein case the Commissioner had included in the taxable estates the gifts to which, in the St. Louis Trust cases, the grantor's death had given definitive measure. If the wife had predeceased the settlor in the Klein case, he would have been repossessed of his property. His wife's interests were freed from this contingency by the husband's prior death, and because of the effect of his death this Court swept the gift into the gross estate. So in Helvering v. St. Louis Trust Co., supra, the grantor would have become repossessed of the granted corpus had his daughter predeceased him. But he predeceased her and by that event her interest ripened to full dominion. The same analysis applies to the Becker case. In all three situations the result and effect were the same. The event which gave to the beneficiaries a dominion over property which they did not have prior to the donor's death was an act of nature outside the grantor's 'control, design, or volition.' Helvering v. St. Louis Trust Co., \n296 \nU.S. 39, 43\n, 56 S.Ct. 74, 76, 100 A. L.R. 1239. But it was no more and no less 'fortuitous', so far as the grantor's 'control, design, or volition' was concerned, in the St. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 106, 114]\n\u00a0\n Louis Trust cases than it was in the Klein case. In none of the three cases did the dominion over property which finally came to the beneficiary fall by virtue of the grantor's will, except by his provision that his own death should establish such final and complete dominion. And yet a mere difference in phrasing the circumstance by which identic interests in property were brought into being-varying forms of words in the creation of the same worldly interests-was found sufficient to exclude the St. Louis Trust settlements from the application of the Klein doctrine.\n Four members of the Court saw no difference. They relied on the governing principle of  302(c) that Congress meant to include in the gross estate inter vivos gifts 'which may be resorted to, as a substitute for a will, in making dispositions of property operative at death.' Helvering v. St. Louis Trust Co., 296 U.S. at page 46, 56 S.Ct. at page 77, 100 A.L.R. 1239. To effectuate this purpose practical considerations applicable to taxation and not the 'niceties of the art of conveyancing' were their touchstone. 'Having in mind', said the dissenters, 'the purpose of the statute and the breadth of its language it would seem to be of no consequence what particular conveyancers' device, what particular string, the decedent selected to hold in suspense the ultimate disposition of his property until the moment of his death. In determining whether a taxable transfer becomes complete only at death we look to substance, not to form. ... However we label the device it is but a means by which the gift is rendered incomplete until the donor's death.' 296 U.S. at page 47, 56 S.Ct. at page 78, 100 A.L.R. 1239. For the majority in the St. Louis Trust Company cases, these practicalities had less significance than the formal categories of property law. The grantor's death, the majority said, in Helvering v. St. Louis Trust Co., supra, 'simply put an end to what, at best, was a mere possibility of a reverter by extinguishing it; that is to say, by converting what was merely possible into an utter impossibility.' 296 U.S. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 106, 115]\n\u00a0\n 39, 43, 56 S.Ct. 74, 76, 100 A.L.R. 1239. This was precisely the mode of argument which had been rejected in Klein v. United States, supra.\n We are now asked to accept all three decisions as constituting a coherent body of law, and to apply their distinctions to the trusts before us.\n In Nos. 110, 111 and 112 (Helvering v. Hallock) the decedent in 1919 created a trust under a separation agreement, giving the income to his wife for life, with this further provision: 'If and when Anne Lamson Hallock shall die and in such event ... the within trust shall terminate and said Trustee shall ... pay Party of the First Part if he then be living any accrued income, then remaining in said trust fund and shall ... deliver forthwith to Party of the First Part, the principal of the said trust fund. If and in the event said Party of the First Part shall not be living then and in such event payment and delivery over shall be made to Levitt Hallock and Helen Hallock, respectively son and daughter of the Party of the First Part, share and share alike ....' When the settlor died in 1932, his divorced wife, the life beneficiary, survived him. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the trust instrument had conveyed the 'whole interest' of the decedent, subject only to a 'condition subsequent,' which left him nothing 'except a mere possibility of reverter.' Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Hallock, 6 Cir., 102 F. 2d 1, 3, 4.\n In No. 183 (Rothensies v. Huston) the decedent by an ante-nuptial agreement in 1925 conveyed property in trust, the income to be paid to his prospective wife during her life, subject to the following disposition of the principal:\n'In trust if the said Rae Spektor shall die during the lifetime of said George F. Uber to pay over the principal and all accumulated income thereof unto the said George F. Uber in fee, free and clear of any trust. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 106, 116]\n\u00a0\n 'In trust if the said Rae Spektor after the marriage shall survive the said George F. Uber to pay over the principal and all accumulated income unto the said Rae Spektor-then Rae Uber-in fee, free and clear of any trust.'\n\n Mrs. Uber outlived her husband, who died in 1934. The Circuit Court of Appeals deemed Becker v. St. Louis Trust Co., supra, controlling against the inclusion of the trust corpus in the gross estate.\n Finally, in No. 399 (Bryant v. Helvering), the testator provided for the payment of trust income to his wife during her life and upon her death to the settlor himself if he should survive her. The instrument, which was executed in 1917, continued: 'Upon the death of the survivor of said Ida Bryant and the party of the first part, unless this trust shall have been modified or revoked as hereinafter provided, to convey, transfer, and pay over the principal of the trust fund to the executors or administrators of the estate of the party hereto of the first part.' There was a further provision giving to the decedent and his wife jointly during their lives, and to either of them after the death of the other, power to modify, alter or revoke the instrument. The wife survived the husband, who died in 1930. The Board of Tax Appeals allowed the Commissioner to include in the decedent's gross estate only the value of a 'vested reversionary interest' which the Board held the grantor had reserved to himself. On appeal by the taxpayer, the Circuit Court of Appeals sustained this determination.\n The terms of these grants differ in detail from one another, as all three differ from the formulas of conveyance used in the Klein and St. Louis Trust cases. It therefore becomes important to inquire whether the technical forms in which interests contingent upon death \n\n[309 \nU.S. 106, 117]\n\u00a0\n are cast should control our decision. If so, it becomes necessary to determine whether the differing terms of conveyance now in issue approximate more closely those used in the Klein case and are therefore governed by it, or have a greater verbal resemblance to those that saved the tax in the St. Louis Trust cases. Such an essay in linguistic refinement would still further embarrass existing intricacies. It might demonstrate verbal ingenuity, but it could hardly strengthen the rational foundations of law. The law of contingent and vested remainders is full of casuistries. There are great diversities among the several states as to the conveyancing significance of like grants; sometimes in the same state there are conflicting lines of decision, one series ignoring the other. Attempts by the Board of Tax Appeals and the Circuit Courts of Appeal to administer  302(c) by reference to these distinctions abundantly illustrate the inevitable confusion. 4 One of the cases at bar, No. 399, reveals vividly the snares which inevitably await an attempt to base estate tax law on the 'niceties of the art of conveyancing.' In connection with the ascertainment of its own death duties, the Supreme Court of Errors of Connecticut defined the nature of the interest which the decedent in that case retained after his inter vivos transfer. Bryant v. Hackett, 118 Conn. 233, 171 A. 664. And yet the nature of that interest under Connecticut law and the scope of the Connecticut Court's adjudication of that interest were made the subject of lively controversy be- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 106, 118]\n\u00a0\n fore us. The importation of these distinctions and controversies from the law of property into the administration of the estate tax precludes a fair and workable tax system. Essentially the same interests, judged from the point of view of wealth, will be taxable or not, depending upon elusive and subtle casuistries which may have their historic justification but possess no relevance for tax purposes. \n5\n These unwitty diversities of the law of property derive from medieval concepts as to the necessity of a continuous seisin. \n6\n Distinctions which originated under a feudal economy when land dominated social relations are peculiarly irrelevant in the application of tax measures now so largely directed toward intangible wealth.\n Our real problem, therefore, is to determine whether we are to adhere to a harmonizing principle in the construction of  302(c), or whether we are to multiply gossamer distinctions between the present cases and the three earlier ones. Freed from the distinctions introduced by the St. Louis Trust cases, the Klein case furnishes such a harmonizing principle. Does, then, the doctrine of stare decisis compel us to accept the distinc- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 106, 119]\n\u00a0\n tions made in the St. Louis Trust cases as starting points for still finer distinctions spun out of the tenuosities of surviving feudal law? We think not. We think the Klein case rejected the presupposition of such distinctions for the fiscal judgments which  302(c) demands.\n We recognize that stare decisis embodies an important social policy. It represents an element of continuity in law, and is rooted in the psychologic need to satisfy reasonable expectations. But stare decisis is a principle of policy and not a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision, however recent and questionable, when such adherence involves collision with a prior doctrine more embracing in its scope, intrinsically sounder, and verified by experience.\n Nor have we in the St. Louis Trust cases rules of decision around which, by the accretion of time and the response of affairs, substantial interests have established themselves. No such conjunction of circumstances requires perpetuation of what we must regard as the deviations of the St. Louis Trust decisions from the Klein doctrine. We have not before us interests created or maintained in reliance on those cases. We do not mean to imply that the inevitably empiric process of construing tax legislation should give rise to an estoppel against the responsible exercise of the judicial process. But it is a fact that in all the cases before us the settlements were made and the settlors died before the St. Louis Trust decisions.\n Nor does want of specific Congressional repudiations of the St. Louis Trust cases serve as an implied instruction by Congress to us not to reconsider, in the light of new experience, whether those decisions in conjunction with the Klein case, make for dissonance of doctrine. It would require very persuasive circumstances enveloping Congressional silence to debar this Court from re-examining its own doctrines. To explain the cause of \n\n[309 \nU.S. 106, 120]\n\u00a0\n non-action by Congress when Congress itself sheds no light is to venture into speculative unrealities. 7 Congress may not have had its attention directed to an undesirable decision; and there is no indication that as to the St. Louis Trust cases it had, even by any bill that found its way into a committee pigeon-hole. Congress may not have had its attention so directed for any number of reasons that may have moved the Treasury to stay its hand. But certainly such inaction by the Treasury can hardly operate as a controlling administrative practice, through \n\n[309 \nU.S. 106, 121]\n\u00a0\n acquiescence, tantamount to an estoppel barring re examination by this Court of distinctions which it had drawn. \n8\n Various considerations of parliamentary tactics and strategy might be suggested as reasons for the inaction of the Treasury and of Congress, but they would only be sufficient to indicate that we walk on quicksand when we try to find in the absence of corrective legislation a controlling legal principle.\n This Court, unlike the House of Lords,9 has from the beginning rejected a doctrine of disability at self-correction. Whatever else may be said about want of Congressional action to modify by legislation the result in the St. Louis Trust cases, it will hardly be urged that the rea- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 106, 122]\n\u00a0\n son was Congressional approval of those distinctions between the St. Louis Trust and the Klein cases to which four members of this Court could not give assent. By imputing to Congress a hypothetical recognition of coherence between the Klein and the St. Louis Trust cases, we cannot evade our own responsibility for reconsidering, in the light of further experience, the validity of distinctions which this Court has itself created. Our problem then is not that of rejecting a settled statutory construction. The real problem is whether a principle shall prevail over its later misapplications. Surely we are not bound by reason or by the considerations that underlie stare decisis to persevere in distinctions taken in the application of a statute which, on further examination, appear consonant neither with the purposes of the statute nor with this Court's own conception of it. We therefore reject as untenable the diversities taken in the St. Louis Trust cases in applying the Klein doctrine-untenable because they drastically eat into the principle which those cases professed to accept and to which we adhere.\n In Nos. 110, 111, 112 and 183, the judgments are\nREVERSED.\n In No. 399, the judgment is\nAFFIRMED.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE concurs in the result upon the ground that each of these cases is controlled by our decision in Klein v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 231\n, 51 S.Ct. 398. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 106, 123]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS.\n There is certainly a distinction in fact between the transaction considered in Klein v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 231\n, 51 S.Ct. 398, and those under review in Helvering v. St. Louis Union Trust Company, \n296 \nU.S. 39\n, 56 S.Ct. 74, 100 A.L.R. 1239, and Becker v. St. Louis Union Trust Company, \n296 \nU.S. 48\n, 56 S.Ct. 78. The courts, the Board of Tax Appeals, and the Treasury have found no difficulty in observing the distinction in specific cases. I believe it is one of substance, not merely of terminology, and not dependent on the niceties of conveyancing or recondite doctrines of ancient property law.\n But if I am wrong in this, I still think the judgments in Nos. 110- 112, and 183 should be affirmed and that in 399 should be reversed. The rule of interpretation adopted in the St. Louis Union Trust Company cases should now be followed for two reasons: First, that rule was indicated by decisions of this court as the one applicable in the circumstances here disclosed, as early as 1927; was progressively developed and applied by the Board of Tax Appeals, the lower federal courts, and this court, up to the decision of McCormick v. Burnet, \n283 \nU.S. 784\n, 51 S.Ct. 343, in 1931; and has since been followed by those tribunals in not less than fifty cases. It ought not to be set aside after such a history. Secondly. The rule was not contrary to any treasury regulation; was, indeed, in accord with such regulations as there were on the subject; was subsequently embodied in a specific regulation, and, with this background, Congress has three times reenacted the law without amending  302(c) in respect of the matter here in issue. The settled doctrine, that reenactment of a statute so construed, without alteration, renders such construction a part of the statute itself, should not be ignored but observed. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 106, 124]\n\u00a0\n 1. The Revenue Act of 1926 lays a tax upon the transfer of the net estate of a decedent. That estate is defined to embrace the value of all his property, real or personal, tangible or intangible (less certain deductions), at the time of his death. \n1\n As the Treasury Department stated in its earliest regulations: 'The statute also includes only property rights existing in the decedent in his lifetime and passing to his estate.' 2 In all the treasury regulations, from the earliest to the one now in force, applicable to the relevant sections of the successive Revenue Acts defining the 'gross estate' of a decedent the Treasury has used this language:3 'The value of a vested remainder should be included in the gross estate. Nothing should be included, however, on account of a contingent remainder where (in the case) the contingency does not happen in the lifetime of the decedent, and the interest consequently lapses at his death.' (Italics supplied.) The next sentence: 'Nor should anything be included on account of a life estate in the decedent,' has been repeated in substance in the corresponding article of all subsequent regulations.\n If by the will of his grandmother A is given a life estate, with remainder to another, his executor is not bound to return anything on account of the life estate because, in respect of it, nothing passes on A's death. The estate simply ceases. The Treasury has never contended the contrary. If, however, A's grandmother gave a life estate to B, and the remainder to A, A has something which, at his death, will pass to someone else under his will, or under the intestate laws. The statute plainly taxes the value of the interest thus transferred at A's death. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 106, 125]\n\u00a0\n If A's grandmother, by her will, gave interests in succession to specific persons and then provided that if A should outlive all these persons the property should pass to him, A would have a chance to receive and enjoy the property. If he did so receive it, it would pass as part of his estate. If he died before the other beneficiaries named by his grandmother his death would deprive him of that chance. The chance would not pass to anyone else. No tax would be laid on the supposed value of his contingent interest or chance, because the chance cannot, at his death, pass by his will, or the intestate laws, to another. I do not understand the Government has ever denied this.\n Subsection (c) of  302 lays down no different rule respecting similar interests created by irrevocable deed or agreement of the decedent. The subsection directs that there shall be included in the gross estate the value, at the time of the decedent's death, of any interest in property of which the decedent has at any time made a transfer 'intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death' ( excluding sales for adequate consideration).\n A transfer can only take effect, within the meaning of the statute, by the shifting of possession or enjoyment from the decedent to living persons. The fact that the terms of the gift bring about some other effect at the decedent's death is immaterial. The fact that something may happen in respect of the beneficial enjoyment of the property conditioned upon the decedent's death is irrelevant so long as that something is not the shifting of possession or beneficial enjoyment from the decedent. This is made clear by Reinecke v. Northern Trust Co., \n278 \nU.S. 339, 347\n, 49 S.Ct. 123, 125, 66 A.L.R. 397.\n If A makes a present irrevocable transfer in trust, conditioned that he shall receive the income for life and, at his death, the principal shall go to B, B is at once legally \n\n[309 \nU.S. 106, 126]\n\u00a0\n invested with the principal. A's life estate ceases at his death. Nothing then passes. There is no tax imposed by the statute because there is no transfer any more than there would be in the case of a similar life estate given A by his grandmother. (This is May v. Heiner, \n281 \nU.S. 238\n, 50 S.Ct. 286, 67 A.L.R. 1244.) If, on the other hand, A creates an estate for years or for life in B, retaining the remaining beneficial interest in the property for himself, and, whether by the terms of the grant, or by the terms of A's will, or under the intestate law, that remainder passes to someone else at his death, such passage renders the transfer taxable. (This is Klein v. United States, supra.) If what A does is to transfer his property irrevocably, with provision that it shall be enjoyed successively by various persons for life and then go absolutely to a named person, but that if he, A, shall outlive that person, the property shall come back to him, and A dies in the lifetime of the person in question, A has merely lost the chance that the beneficial ownership of the property may revert to him. That chance cannot pass under his will or under the interstate laws. As there is no transfer which can become effective at his death by the shifting of any interest from him, no tax is imposed. (This is McCormick v. Burnet, supra, and Helvering v. St. Louis Union Trust Company, supra.)\n\n 2. \nThese governing principles were indicated as early as 19274 and were thereafter developed, in application to specific cases, in a consistent line of authorities.\n In May v. Heiner, supra, it was held that a transfer in trust under which the income was payable to the transferor's husband for his life and, after his death, to the transferor during her life, with remainder to her children, was not subject to tax as a transfer intended to take effect \n\n[309 \nU.S. 106, 127]\n\u00a0\n in possession or enjoyment at or after death. This court said (281 U.S. page 243, 50 S.Ct. page 287, 67 A.L.R. 1244): '... At the death of Mrs. May no interest in the property held under the trust deed passed from her to the living; title thereto had been definitely fixed by the trust deed. The interest therein which she possessed immediately prior to her death was obliterated by that event.' (Italics supplied.) DP It will be noted that this is the equivalent of the Treasury's statement, supra, that such an interest lapses at death.\n That decision is indistinguishable in principle from the St. Louis Union Trust Company cases and the instant cases; and what was there said serves to distinguish the Klein case.\n McCormick v. Burnet followed May v. Heiner, supra. The court there held that neither a reservation by the grantor of a life estate with remainders over, nor a provision for a reverter in case all the beneficiaries should die in the lifetime of the grantor, made the gifts transfers intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after the grantor's death. In the Circuit Court of Appeals the Commissioner urged that the provision for payment of the trust estate to the settlor in case she survived all the beneficiaries rendered the transfer taxable. That court dealt at length with the point and sustained his view. Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. McCormick, 7 Cir., 43 F.2d 277, 279. The Commissioner made the same contention in this court, but it was overruled upon the authority of May v. Heiner, supra.\n Then came the two St. Louis Union Trust Company cases, decided upon the authority of May v. Heiner and McCormick v. Burnet, supra. Finally, the McCormick case was followed in Bingham v. United States, \n296 \nU.S. 211\n, 56 S.Ct. 180.\n Since the opinion of the court appears to treat the St. Louis cases as the origin of the principle there announced, \n\n[309 \nU.S. 106, 128]\n\u00a0\n it is important to emphasize the fact that the rule had been settled by this court as early as 1930; and to note other decisions rendered prior to the St. Louis cases. In seven intervening between May v. Heiner, supra, and the St. Louis cases, the Board of Tax Appeals reached the same conclusion as that announced in the St. Louis cases. \n5\n The Board's action was affirmed in four of them. \n6\n Four other decisions by Circuit Courts of Appeal were to the same effect. \n7\n In practically all, reliance was placed upon Shukert v. Allen, Reinecke v. Northern Trust Company, May v. Heiner, and McCormick v. Burnet, supra, or some of them. Thus, when the question came before this court again in the St. Louis cases, there was a substantial body of authority following and applying the Heiner and McCormick cases.\n Since the St. Louis cases were decided, the principle on which they went has been repeatedly applied by the Board of Tax Appeals and the courts. The Board has followed the cases in no less than seventeen instances. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n[309 \nU.S. 106, 129]\n\u00a0\n The record is the same in the courts. The St. Louis cases have been followed in fourteen cases. \n9\n In some of these the Government has sought review in this court but in none, except those now presented, has it asked the court to overrule those decisions.\n If there ever was an instance in which the doctrine of stare decisis should govern, this is it. Aside from the obvious hardship involved in treating the taxpayers in the present cases differently from many others whose cases have been decided or closed in accordance with the settled rule, there are the weightier considerations that the judgments now rendered disappoint the just expectations of those who have acted in reliance upon the uniform construction of the statute by this and all other federal tribunals; and that, to upset these precedents now, must necessarily shake the confidence of the bar and the public in the stability of the rulings of the courts and make it impossible for inferior tribunals to adjudicate controversies in reliance on the decisions of this court. To nullify more than fifty decisions, five of them by this \n\n[309 \nU.S. 106, 130]\n\u00a0\n court, some of which have stood for a decade, in order to change a mere rule of statutory construction, seems to me an altogether unwise and unjustified exertion of power. As I shall point out, there is no necessity for such action because it has been, and still is open to Congress to change the rule by amendment of the statute, if it deems such action necessary in the public interest.\n\n 3. \n 301 of the Revenue Act of 1926, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 225, imposes a tax upon the value of the net estate of a decedent.  302, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Act, page 227, provides the method for determining the value of the gross estate. Subsections (c)(d)(e)(f) and (g) require inclusion in the gross estate of interests which otherwise might be held not to form a part of the decedent's estate or not to pass from him to others at his death. These subsections sweep such interests into the gross estate in order to forestall tax avoidance.  302(c) was the successor of analogous sections in earlier acts and the predecessor of similar sections in later acts. \n10\n The subsection has been amended in successive Revenue Acts. As a result of the Treasury's experience in the enforcement of the law, Congress has from time to time thought it necessary to extend the scope of the subsection in the interest of more efficient administration. Within constitutional limits such extension is a matter of legislative policy for Congress alone. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n It is familiar practice for Congress to amend a statute to obviate a construction given it by the courts. The legislative history of  302(c) demonstrates that Congress has elected not to make such an amendment to \n\n[309 \nU.S. 106, 131]\n\u00a0\n meet the construction placed upon it by this court in the St. Louis cases.\n May v. Heiner, supra, was decided in 1930. The Treasury was dissatisfied with the decision and in three later cases attacked the ruling, amongst them McCormick v. Burnet, supra. The court announced its judgments in these cases on March 2, 1931, reaffirming May v. Heiner, supra. On the following day Congress adopted a joint resolution amending  302(c) to tax a transfer with reservation of a life estate to the grantor, but, in so doing, it omitted to deal with a contingent interest reserved to the grantor or the possibility of reverter remaining in him, involved in both Heiner and McCormick. See Hassett v. Welch, \n303 \nU.S. 303, 308\n, 309 S., 58 S.Ct. 559, 562. The omission is significant.\n It may be argued that in the haste of preparing and passing the amendment the point was overlooked. But the joint resolution was reenacted by  803 of the Revenue Act of 1932,12 without any alteration to cover the point. The Revenue Act of 193413 amended  302(d) of the Revenue Act of 1926 but did not change  302(c) as it then stood.\n The day the St. Louis cases were decided, this court announced its opinion in White v. Poor, \n296 \nU.S. 98\n, 56 S.Ct. 66, construing  302(d) of the Act of 1926. In order to make the section apply to such a situation as was disclosed in that case14 the Congress, on June 22, 1936, by the Act of 1936,15 amended it to preclude the construction the court had given it. Again Congress let  302(c) stand as before and as construed in the St. Louis cases. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 106, 132]\n\u00a0\n Three revenue acts have since been adopted,16 in none of which has the wording of  302(c) been altered. If there is any life in the doctrine often announced that reenactment of a statute as uniformly construed by the courts is an adoption by Congress of the construction given it, this legislative history ought to be conclusive that the statute, as it now stands, means what this court has said it means.\n Little weight can be given to the argument of the Government that the Treasury has not applied to Congress for alteration of the section because of the difficulty of wording a satisfactory amendment. A moment's reflection will show that it would be easy to phrase such an amendment. Whatever the reason for the failure to amend  302(c), whether hesitancy on the part of the Treasury to recommend such action, or the satisfaction of Congress with the construction put upon the section by this court, or mere inadvertence, the fact remains that the section has been reenacted again and again with the courts' construction plain for all to read.\n\n 4. \nAs shown by the matter above quoted from the Treasury Regulations affecting the estate tax,17 a contingent interest is not to be included in the taxable estate. In the light of this construction, estate tax provisions were reenacted or amended in 1921, 1924, 1926, 1928, 1931, 1932, 1934, 1935, 1936 and 1937.\n At the bar counsel for the Government stated that it had always been the view of the Treasury that the article in question applied only to  302(a) and had no application to  302(c). But we are not concerned with what the Treasury thought about the matter. The regulations were issued to guide taxpayers in complying with the Act. Section 302 is an entirety. Subsections (a) and (c) were \n\n[309 \nU.S. 106, 133]\n\u00a0\n not intended to contradict each other, but the latter was to supplement the former. The gross estate was to be computed according to the section as a whole. It is hard to understand how the taxpayer was expected to discriminate between a contingent interest of a decedent under the will of his grandmother and a similar interest under an absolute deed executed by him inter vivos. If the one did not pass from the decedent at death neither did the other.\n After the decisions in the St. Louis cases, the Treasury rendered its regulations even more explicit. In Regulations 80 (Revised), promulgated October 26, 1937, a new Article 17 was inserted which is:\n'The statutory phrase, 'a transfer ... intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death,' includes a transfer by the decedent ... whereby and to the extent that the beneficial title to the property ... or the legal title thereto ... remained in the decedent at the time of his death and the passing thereof was subject to the condition precedent of his death. ...\n\n'On the other hand, if, as a result of the transfer, there remained in the decedent at the time of his death no title or interest in the transferred property, then no part of the property is to be included in the gross estate merely by reason of a provision in the instrument of transfer to the effect that the property was to revert to the decedent upon the predecease of some other person or persons or the happening of some other event.'\n\n If theretofore doubt could have been entertained, it then must have vanished. And with this regulation in force, Congress reenacted  302(c) as so interpreted.\n What, then, is to be said of the principle that reenactment of a statute which the Treasury, by its regulations, has interpreted in a given sense is an embodiment of the interpretation in the law as reenacted? Surely the principle cannot be avoided, as the Government argues, be- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 106, 134]\n\u00a0\n cause the Treasury felt bound so to interpret  302(c) by reason of this court's decisions. That fact should make application of the principle the more urgent.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS joins in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, as amended by  803 of the Revenue Act of 1932, c. 209, 47 Stat. 169, 279, 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Code,  811(c):\n'The value of the gross estate of the decedent shall be determined by including the value at the time of his death of all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, wherever situated,\n\n'(c) To the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent has at any time made a transfer, by trust or otherwise, in contemplation of or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death, or of which he has at any time made a transfer, by trust or otherwise, under which he has retained for his life or for any period not ascertainable without reference to his death or for any period which does not in fact end before his death (1) the possession or enjoyment of, or the right to the income from the property, or (2) the right, either alone or in conjunction with any person, to designate the persons who shall possess or enjoy the property or the income therefrom: except in case of a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth. Any transfer of a material part of his property in the nature of a final disposition or distribution thereof, made by the decedent within two years prior to his death without such consideration, shall, unless shown to the contrary, be deemed to have been made in contemplation of death within the meaning of this title (subchapter).' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Petitioner's Brief, Klein v.

The confusion apt to be engendered by judicial forays into this field is well illustrated by the use of the term 'possibility of reverter' by the majority in Helvering v. St. Louis Union Trust Co., supra. 'A possibility of reverter' is traditionally defined as the interest remaining in a grantor who has conveyed a determinable fee. The definition has not been thought to have any relation to the reversionary interest of a grantor who has transferred either a vested or contingent remainder in fee. See Gray, Rule Against Perpetuities (2nd Ed.),  13-51. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] We are not unmindful of amendments to the estate tax law to which other decisions of this Court gave rise. Thus by  805 of the Revenue Act of 1936, c. 690, 49 Stat. 1648, 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Acts, page 957, Congress undid the construction which this Court gave the estate tax law in another connection by a decision rendered on the same day as were the St. Louis Trust cases. Cf. White v. Poor, \n296 \nU.S. 98\n, 56 S.Ct. 66. This case arose under  302(d) and not  302(c). But, in any event, the fact of Congressional action in dealing with one problem while silent on the different problems created by the St. Louis Trust cases, does not imply controlling acceptance by Congress of those cases.\n By the Joint Resolution of March 3, 1931, c. 454, 46 Stat. 1516, 26 U. S.C.A.Int.Rev.Acts, page 227, Congress displaced the construction which this Court put upon  302(c) in those cases wherein it was held that the reservation by a decedent of a life estate in property conveyed inter vivos, did not constitute a sufficient postponement of the remainder to bring it into the grantor's gross estate. May v. Heiner, \n281 \nU.S. 238\n, 50 S.Ct. 286, 67 A.L.R. 1244; Burnet v. Northern Trust Co., \n283 \nU.S. 782\n, 51 S.Ct. 342; Morsman v. Burnet, \n283 \nU.S. 783\n, 51 S.Ct. 343; McCormick v. Burnet, \n283 \nU.S. 784\n, 51 S.Ct. 343. The speculative arguments that may be drawn from ad hoc legislation affecting one set of decisions and the want of such legislation to modify another set of decisions dealing with a somewhat different though cognate problem are well illustrated by this remedial amendment. For it may be urged with considerable plausibility that in 1931 Congress had in principle already rejected the general attitude underlying the St. Louis Trust cases, as illustrated by the fact that in those cases the majority, in part at least, relied upon the Congressionally discarded May v. Heiner doctrine.\n Whatever may be the scope of the doctrine that re-enactment of a statute impliedly enacts a settled judicial construction placed upon the re-enacted statute, that doctrine has no relevance to the present problem. Since the decisions in the St. Louis Trust cases, Congress has not re- enacted  302(c). The amendments that Congress made to other provisions of  302 in connection with other situations than those now before the Court, were made without re-enacting  302(c). Nor has Congress, under any rational canons of legislative significance, by its compilation of internal revenue laws to form the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, 53 Stat. 1, 26 U.S.C.A., Internal Revenue Code, impliedly enacted into law a particular decision which, in the light of later experience, is seen to create confusion and conflict in the application of a settled principle of internal revenue legislation.\n Here, unlike the situation in such cases as National Lead Co. v. United States, \n252 \nU.S. 140, 146\n, 147 S., 40 S.Ct. 237, 239, and Murphy Oil Co. v. Burnet, \n287 \nU.S. 299, 302\n, 303 S., 53 S.Ct. 161, 162, we have no conjunction of long, uniform administrative construction and subsequent reenactments of an ambiguous statute to give ground for implying legislative adoption of such construction. See Preface, Internal Revenue Code, 53 Stat. iii; compare Smiley v. Holm, \n285 \nU.S. 355, 373\n, 52 S.Ct. 397, 401, and Warner v. Goltra, \n293 \nU.S. 155, 161\n, 55 S.Ct. 46, 49. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Since the Treasury has amended its regulations in an effort to conform administrative practice to the compulsions of the St. Louis Trust cases, it cannot be deemed to have bound itself by this change.

Gen., and Arnold Raum, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 112, 113]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Selden Bacon, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n\n\n[311 \nU.S. 112, 114]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The sole question for decision is whether the gift, during the donor's taxable year, of interest coupons detached from the bonds, delivered to the donee and later in the year paid at maturity, is the realization of income taxable to the donor.\n In 1934 and 1935 respondent, the owner of negotiable bonds, detached from them negotiable interest coupons shortly before their due date and delivered them as a gift to his son who in the same year collected them at maturity. The Commissioner ruled that under the applicable  22 of the Revenue Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 680, 686, 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Acts, page 669, the interest payments were taxable, in the years when paid, to the respondent donor who reported his income on the cash receipts basis. The circuit court of appeals reversed the order of the Board of Tax Appeals sustaining the tax. 2 Cir., 107 F.2d 906; 39 B.T.A. 757. We granted certiorari, \n309 \nU.S. 650\n, 60 S.Ct. 807, because of the importance of the question in the administration of the revenue laws and because of an asserted conflict in principle of the decision below with that of Lucas v. Earl, \n281 \nU.S. 111\n, 50 S.Ct. 241, and with that of decisions by other circuit courts of appeals. See Bishop v. Commissioner, 7 Cir., 54 F.2d 298; Dickey v. Burnet, 8 Cir., 56 F.2d 917, 921; Van Meter v. Commissioner, 8 Cir., 61 F.2d 817.\n The court below thought that as the consideration for the coupons had passed to the obligor, the donor had, by the gift, parted with all control over them and their payment, and for that reason the case was distinguishable \n\n[311 \nU.S. 112, 115]\n\u00a0\n from Lucas v. Earl, supra and Burnet v. Leininger, \n285 \nU.S. 136\n, 52 S.Ct. 345, where the assignment of compensation for services had preceded the rendition of the services, and where the income was held taxable to the donor.\n The holder of a coupon bond is the owner of two independent and separable kinds of right. One is the right to demand and receive at maturity the principal amount of the bond representing capital investment. The other is the right to demand and receive interim payments of interest on the investment in the amounts and on the dates specified by the coupons. Together they are an obligation to pay principal and interest given in exchange for money or property which was presumably the consideration for the obligation of the bond. Here respondent, as owner of the bonds, had acquired the legal right to demand payment at maturity of the interest specified by the coupons and the power to command its payment to others which constituted an economic gain to him.\n Admittedly not all economic gain of the taxpayer is taxable income. From the beginning the revenue laws have been interpreted as defining 'realization' of income as the taxable event rather than the acquisition of the right to receive it. And 'realization' is not deemed to occur until the income is paid. But the decisions and regulations have consistently recognized that receipt in cash or property is not the only characteristic of realization of income to a taxpayer on the cash receipts basis. Where the taxpayer does not receive payment of income in money or property realization may occur when the last step is taken by which he obtains the fruition of the economic gain which has already accrued to him. Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner, \n279 \nU.S. 716\n, 49 S.Ct. 499; Corliss v. Bowers, \n281 \nU.S. 376, 378\n, 50 S.Ct. 336. Cf. Burnet v. Wells, \n289 \nU.S. 670\n, 53 S.Ct. 761\n\n\n In the ordinary case the taxpayer who acquires the right to receive income is taxed when he receives it, regardless of the time when his right to receive payment \n\n[311 \nU.S. 112, 116]\n\u00a0\n accrued. But the rule that income is not taxable until realized has never been taken to mean that the taxpayer, even on the cash receipts basis, who has fully enjoyed the benefit of the economic gain represented by his right to receive income, can escape taxation because he has not himself received payment of it from his obligor. The rule, founded on administrative convenience, is only one of postponement of the tax to the final event of enjoyment of the income, usually the receipt of it by the taxpayer, and not one of exemption from taxation where the enjoyment is consummated by some event other than the taxpayer's personal receipt of money or property. Cf. Aluminum Castings Co. v. Routzahn, \n282 \nU.S. 92, 98\n, 51 S.Ct. 11, 13. This may occur when he has made such use or disposition of his power to receive or control the income as to procure in its place other satisfactions which are of economic worth. The question here is, whether because one who in fact receives payment for services or interest payments is taxable only on his receipt of the payments, he can escape all tax by giving away his right to income in advance of payment. If the taxpayer procures payment directly to his creditors of the items of interest or earnings due him, see Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner, supra; Bowers v. Kerbaugh-Empire Co., \n271 \nU.S. 170\n, 46 S.Ct. 449; United States v. Kirby Lumber Co., \n284 \nU.S. 1\n, 52 S.Ct. 4, or if he sets up a revocable trust with income payable to the objects of his bounty,  166, 167, Revenue Act of 1934, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code ,  166, 167, Corliss v. Bowers, supra; cf. Dickey v. Burnet, 8 Cir., 56 F.2d 917, 921, he does not escape taxation because he did not actually receive the money. Cf. Douglas v. Willcuts, \n296 \nU.S. 1\n, 56 S.Ct. 59, 101 A.L.R. 391; Helvering v. Clifford, \n309 \nU.S. 331\n, 60 S.Ct. 554.\n Underlying the reasoning in these cases is the thought that income is 'realized' by the assignor because he, who owns or controls the source of the income, also controls the disposition of that which he could have \n\n[311 \nU.S. 112, 117]\n\u00a0\n received himself and diverts the payment from himself to others as the means of procuring the satisfaction of his wants. The taxpayer has equally enjoyed the fruits of his labor or investment and obtained the satisfaction of his desires whether he collects and uses the income to procure those satisfactions, or whether he disposes of his right to collect it as the means of procuring them. Cf. Burnet v. Wells, supra.\n Although the donor here, by the transfer of the coupons, has precluded any possibility of his collecting them himself he has nevertheless, by his act, procured payment of the interest, as a valuable gift to a member of his family. Such a use of his economic gain, the right to receive income, to procure a satisfaction which can be obtained only by the expenditure of money or property, would seem to be the enjoyment of the income whether the satisfaction is the purchase of goods at the corner grocery, the payment of his debt there, or such non-material satisfactions as may result from the payment of a campaign or community chest contribution, or a gift to his favorite son. Even though he never receives the money he derives money's worth from the disposition of the coupons which he has used as money or money's worth in the procuring of a satisfaction which is procurable only by the expenditure of money or money's worth. The enjoyment of the economic benefit accruing to him by virtue of his acquisition of the coupons is realized as completely as it would have been if he had collected the interest in dollars and expended them for any of the purposes named. Burnet v. Wells, supra.\n In a real sense he has enjoyed compensation for money loaned or services rendered and not any the less so because it is his only reward for them. To say that one who has made a gift thus derived from interest or earnings paid to his donee has never enjoyed or realized the fruits of his investment or labor because he has assigned \n\n[311 \nU.S. 112, 118]\n\u00a0\n them instead of collecting them himself and then paying them over to the donee, is to affront common understanding and to deny the facts of common experience. Common understanding and experience are the touchstones for the interpretation of the revenue laws.\n The power to dispose of income is the equivalent of ownership of it. The exercise of that power to procure the payment of income to another is the enjoyment and hence the realization of the income by him who exercises it. We have had no difficulty in applying that proposition where the assignment preceded the rendition of the services, Lucas v. Earl, supra; Burnet v. Leininger, supra, for it was recognized in the Leininger case that in such a case the rendition of the service by the assignor was the means by which the income was controlled by the donor and of making his assignment effective. But it is the assignment by which the disposition of income is controlled when the service precedes the assignment and in both cases it is the exercise of the power of disposition of the interest or compensation with the resulting payment to the donee which is the enjoyment by the donor of income derived from them.\n This was emphasized in Blair v. Commissioner, \n300 \nU.S. 5\n, 57 S.Ct. 330, on which respondent relies, where the distinction was taken between a gift of income derived from an obligation to pay compensation and a gift of income-producing property. In the circumstances of that case the right to income from the trust property was thought to be so identified with the equitable ownership of the property from which alone the beneficiary derived his right to receive the income and his power to command disposition of it that a gift of the income by the beneficiary became effective only as a gift of his ownership of the property producing it. Since the gift was deemed to be a gift of the property the income from it was held to be the income of the owner of the property, \n\n[311 \nU.S. 112, 119]\n\u00a0\n who was the donee, not the donor, a refinement which was unnecessary if respondent's contention here is right, but one clearly inapplicable to gifts of interest or wages. Unlike income thus derived from an obligation to pay interest or compensation, the income of the trust was regarded as no more the income of the donor than would be the rent from a lease or a crop raised on a farm after the leasehold or the farm had been given away. Blair v. Commissioner, supra, \n300 \nU.S. 12, 13\n, 57 S.Ct. 333 and cases cited. See also Reinecke v. Smith, \n289 \nU.S. 172, 177\n, 53 S.Ct. 570, 572. We have held without deviation that where the donor retains control of the trust property the income is taxable to him although paid to the donee. Corliss v. Bowers, supra. Cf. Helvering v. Clifford, supra.\n The dominant purpose of the revenue laws is the taxation of income to those who earn or otherwise create the right to receive it and enjoy the benefit of it when paid. See, Corliss v. Bowers, supra, \n281 \nU.S. 378\n, 50 S. Ct. 336; Burnet v. Guggenheim, \n288 \nU.S. 280, 283\n, 53 S.Ct. 369, 370. The tax laid by the 1934 Revenue Act upon income 'derived from ... wages, or compensation for personal service, of whatever kind and in whatever form paid ...; also from interest ...' therefore cannot fairly be interpreted as not applying to income derived from interest or compensation when he who is entitled to receive it makes use of his power to dispose of it in procuring satisfactions which he would otherwise procure only by the use of the money when received.\n It is the statute which taxes the income to the donor although paid to his donee. Lucas v. Earl, supra; Burnet v. Leininger, supra. True, in those cases the service which created the right to income followed the assignment and it was arguable that in point of legal theory the right to the compensation vested instantaneously in the assignor when paid although he never received it; while here the right of the assignor to receive the income \n\n[311 \nU.S. 112, 120]\n\u00a0\n antedated the assignment which transferred the right and thus precluded such an instantaneous vesting. But the statute affords no basis for such 'attenuated subtleties.' The distinction was explicitly rejected as the basis of decision in Lucas v. Earl. It should be rejected here, for no more than in the Earl case can the purpose of the statute to tax the income to him who earns, or creates and enjoys it be escaped by 'anticipatory arrangements ... however skilfully devised' to prevent the income from vesting even for a second in the donor.\n Nor is it perceived that there is any adequate basis for distinguishing between the gift of interest coupons here and a gift of salary or commissions. The owner of a negotiable bond and of the investment which it represents, if not the lender, stands in the place of the lender. When, by the gift of the coupons, he has separated his right to interest payments from his investment and procured the payment of the interest to his donee, he has enjoyed the economic benefits of the income in the same manner and to the same extent as though the transfer were of earnings and in both cases the import of the statute is that the fruit is not to be attributed to a different tree from that on which it grew. See Lucas v. Earl, supra, \n281 \nU.S. 115\n, 50 S.Ct. 241.\nREVERSED.\n The separate opinion of Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS.\n The facts were stipulated. In the opinion of the court below (107 F. 2d 907), the issues are thus adequately stated: 'The petitioner owned a number of coupon bonds. The coupons represented the interest on the bonds and were payable to bearer. In 1934 he detached unmatured coupons of face value of $25,182.50 and transferred them by manual delivery to his son as a gift. The coupons matured later on in the same year, and the son collected the face amount, $25,182.50, as his own property. There \n\n[311 \nU.S. 112, 121]\n\u00a0\n was a similar transaction in 1935. The petitioner kept his books on a cash basis. He did not include any part of the moneys collected on the coupons in his income tax returns for these two years. The son included them in his returns. The Commissioner added the moneys collected on the coupons to the petitioner's taxable income and determined a tax deficiency for each year. The Board of Tax Appeals, three members dissenting, sustained the Commissioner, holding that the amounts collected on the coupons were taxable as income to the petitioner.' The decision of the Board of Tax Appeals was reversed and properly so, I think.\n The unmatured coupons given to the son were independent negotiable instruments, complete in themselves. Through the gift they became at once the absolute property of the donee, free from the donor's control and in no way dependent upon ownership of the bonds. No question of actual fraud or purpose to defraud the revenue is presented.\n Neither Lucas v. Earl, \n281 \nU.S. 111\n, 50 S.Ct. 241, nor Burnet v. Leininger, \n285 \nU.S. 136\n, 52 S.Ct. 345, support petitioner's view. Blair v. Commissioner, \n300 \nU.S. 5, 11\n, 12 S., 57 S.Ct. 330, 332, 333, shows that neither involved an unrestricted completed transfer of property.\n Helvering v. Clifford, \n309 \nU.S. 331, 335\n, 336 S., 60 S.Ct. 554, 556, 557, decided after the opinion below, is much relied upon by petitioner, but involved facts very different from those now before us. There no separate thing was absolutely transferred and put beyond possible control by the transferor. The court affirmed that Clifford, both conveyor and trustee, 'retained the substance of full enjoyment of all the rights which previously he had in the property.' 'In substance his control over the corpus was in all essential respects the same after the trust was created, as before.' 'With that control in his hands he would keep direct \n\n[311 \nU.S. 112, 122]\n\u00a0\n command over all that he needed to remain in substantially the same financial situation as before.'\n The general principles approved in Blair v. Commissioner, \n300 \nU.S. 5\n, 57 S.Ct. 330, are applicable and controlling. The challenged judgment should be affirmed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice ROBERTS concur in this opinion. \n\n\n\n","50":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHELVERING v. JANNEY(1940)\nNo. 113\nArgued: November 18, 1940Decided: December 9, 1940\n\n\n\n Messrs. Robert H. Jackson, Atty. Gen., and Thomas E. Harris, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner Helvering. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 189, 190]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Bernhard Knollenberg, of New York City, for respondents janney.\n Messrs. Frederick Baum and Frank E. Karelsen, Jr., both of New York City, for petitioner Gaines.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases present the same question, that is, whether under the Revenue Act of 1934, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 664 et seq., in the case of a joint return by husband and wife, and capital losses of one spouse may be deducted from the capital gains of the other.\n In Helvering v. Janney, the wife realized net gains from the sale of capital assets during 1934, and the husband realized net losses from the sale of capital assets during the same year. They filed a joint income tax return reporting the capital gain, which represented the difference between the wife's adjusted capital gains and the husband's adjusted capital losses. The Commissioner ruled that the husband's losses could not be applied to reduce the gains realized by his wife and accordingly determined a deficiency. The Board of Tax Appeals sustained the Commissioner (39 B.T.A. 240) but the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed. 108 F.2d 564.\n In Gaines v. Helvering, the husband realized a net gain from the sale of capital assets during 1934, while his wife sustained a net loss from the sale of capital assets. They filed a joint return reporting a capital loss, which represented the difference between the husband's net capital gain and his wife's net capital loss. The Commissioner, as in the Janney case, decided against this adjustment and the Board of Tax Appeals affirmed. The Circuit \n\n[311 \nU.S. 189, 191]\n\u00a0\n Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the decision of the Board. 111 F.2d 144.\n In view of the conflict between these decisions, we granted certiorari. No. 36, \n310 \nU.S. 617\n, 60 S.Ct. 897; No. 113, October 14, 1940, \n311 \nU.S. 628\n, 61 S.Ct. 13, 85 L.Ed. --.\n Section 51(b) of the Revenue Act of 19341 with respect to the returns of husband and wife provided:\n'(b) Husband and Wife. If a husband and wife living together have an aggregate net income for the taxable year of $2,500 or over, or an aggregate gross income for such year of $5,000 or over-\n\n'(1) Each shall make such a return, or\n\n'(2) The income of each shall be included in a single joint return, in which case the tax shall be computed on the aggregate income'.\n\n The same provision in substance is found in the earlier Revenue Acts from that of 1921.2\n The 'aggregate income', to which paragraph 2 of Section 51[b] refers, is clearly the aggregate net income as it is the aggregate income on which 'the tax shall be computed'. In that view the deductions to which either spouse would be entitled would be taken, in the case of a joint return, from the aggregate gross income.\n That was the construction placed upon the provision for a joint return in the Revenue Act of 1918 by the Solicitor of Internal Revenue in an opinion rendered in \n\n[311 \nU.S. 189, 192]\n\u00a0\n 1921.3 After considering the terms of the statute and the reasonable inference as to the intent of Congress, the Solicitor concluded:\n'From the foregoing it follows that the proper construction of the Revenue Act of 1918 permits a husband and wife living together, at their option, to file separate returns or a single joint return. If a single joint return is filed it is treated as the return of a taxable unit and the net income disclosed by the return is subject to both normal and surtax as though the return were that of a single individual. In cases, therefore, in which the husband or wife has allowable deductions in excess of his or her gross income, such excess may, if joint return is filed, be deducted from the net income of the other for the purpose of computing both the normal and surtax'.\n\n The terms of the Revenue Act of 1921 made this view even clearer. \n4\n Treasury Regulations 62, Article 401, promulgated under the Revenue Act of 1921, apparently followed the same view. That article provided as to joint returns of husband and wife,-\n'Where the income of each is included in a single joint return, the tax is computed on the aggregate income and all deductions and credits to which either is entitled shall be taken from such aggregate income'.5 \n\n[311 \nU.S. 189, 193]\n\u00a0\n The question as to deductions for losses on sales or exchanges of securities arose under Section 23(r)(1) of the Revenue Act of 1932.6 That provided that losses as there described should be allowed only to the extent of gains derived from such sales or exchanges. Nothing was said in this section which in any way affected the provision of the statute as to joint returns by husband and wife. The question in that relation, that is, as to deduction for losses on sales of securities, was submitted to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and was answered by him on December 29, 1932, as follows:\n\n'The specific question presented is whether the loss sustained by the husband may be applied to offset the same amount of gain realized by the wife in rendering joint income tax return for the year. In reply you are advised that, in the case of a husband and wife living together who file a joint income tax return, the tax liability is computed on the aggregate income as provided by section 51(b)(2) of the Revenue Act of 1932 (26 U.S. C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 500), and such joint return is treated as if it was the return of a single individual. The aggregate income in such case would of course embrace the gains as well as the allowable deductions of each spouse. If it is correctly understood from your letter that the gains and losses in the illustration presented are from transactions falling within the same class within the meaning of the statute such as sales of securities not held for a period of more than two years, the loss sustained by the husband would offset the same amount of gain realized by the wife from such source'.7 \n\n[311 \nU.S. 189, 194]\n\u00a0\n This statement by the Commissioner applied the same principle which had previously been followed with respect to deductions in the joint returns of husband and wife, there having been no indication by Congress of any different purpose.\n\n Treasury Regulation No. 77, promulgated under the Act of 1932, contained nothing to the contrary and the regulation theretofore obtaining as to such joint returns was left unchanged. Art. 381.\n The Revenue Act of 1934 continued the prior statutory provisions as to joint returns of husband and wife, and Section 117(d) of that Act, 26 U. S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 708, as to capital losses, did not purport to alter the rule as to the right of the spouses to deductions in their joint return. Section 117(d) merely limited the amount of losses which could be deducted, as follows:\n'(d) Limitation on Capital Losses. Losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets shall be allowed only to the extent of $2,000 plus the gains from such sales or exchanges'.\n\n The conclusion of the Commissioner with respect to the Act of 1932, in the opinion above mentioned, was equally applicable to the new Act.\n It was not until 1935 that the Treasury Department by Article 117-5 of Regulations 86 undertook to provide that 'the allowance of losses of one spouse from sales or exchanges of capital assets is in all cases to be computed without regard to gains and losses of the other spouse upon sales or exchanges of capital assets'.8\n We are of the opinion that under the provision of the Act of 1934 as to joint returns of husband and wife, which embodied a policy set forth in substantially the same terms for many years, Congress intended to provide \n\n[311 \nU.S. 189, 195]\n\u00a0\n for a tax on the aggregate net income and that the losses of one spouse might be deducted from the gains of the other; and that this applied as well to deductions for capital losses as to other deductions. This, we think, was the meaning of the provision of the Revenue Act of 1934 when it was enacted, and it was subject to change only by Congress, and not by the Department.\n In No. 36, the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n In No. 113, the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. It is so ordered.\n Judgment affirmed in No. 36.\n Judgment reversed and remanded in No. 113.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 48 Stat. 697, 26 U.S.C.A.

In 1927, after inquiry concerning his affairs, the Commissioner assessed and collected an additional sum. Respondent waived appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals and became party to a closing agreement under section 1106(b) Revenue Act 1926,1 approved by the Secretary of the Treasury January 27, 1928\n\n\n In 1932 the Commissioner undertook to set aside this agreement and made a deficiency assessment of more than Two Hundred Thousand Dollars, also a fifty per cent penalty. Respondent appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals where he maintained there was no adequate proof \n\n[309 \nU.S. 277, 279]\n\u00a0\n to support the assessment. The Board held the Commissioner had adequately sustained the burden of showing fraud or malfeasance or misrepresentation of fact, and did not err in setting the agreement aside.\n The matter then went to the Circuit Court of Appeals, Third Circuit, which ruled there was no adequate evidence to support the conclusion and judgment of the Board. The facts are much discussed in a majority and dissenting opinion 105 F.2d 552. Another narration of them seems unnecessary.\n Under the rule often announced, the function of the Board of Tax Appeals is to weigh the evidence and declare the result as to matters properly before it. Upon review the court may not substitute its judgment of the facts for that of the Board. When there is substantial evidence to support the conclusion of the latter this must be accepted.

We granted certiorari, \n309 \nU.S. 644\n, 60 S.Ct. 511, 84 L. Ed. --, because of the probable conflict of the decision below with Douglas v. Willcuts, \n296 \nU.S. 1\n, 56 S.Ct. 59, 101 A.L.R. 391, and Helvering v. Fitch, \n309 \nU.S. 149\n, 60 S.Ct. 427, 84 L.Ed. --.\n In 1928 respondent's wife instituted suit in New York for an absolute divorce. On June 4, 1929, while that suit was pending, respondent and his wife entered into a separation agreement and, together with a corporate trustee, executed a trust agreement. Under the latter respondent contributed securities and cash of $650,000, which included $400,000 principal amount of 6% first mortgage bonds of an oil company. Respondent guaranteed the 'payment when due of the principal and interest' on those bonds; and on notice of any default in the payment of any interest on or principal of them, he agreed to substitute cash or securities with a 'market value equal to' the principal, and cash sufficient to cover any accrued interest. \n1\n The trust was irrevocable2 except that \n\n[310 \nU.S. 80, 82]\n\u00a0\n (1) it could be amended by respondent and his wife;3 and (2) respondent retained a limited power of substitution as respects certain bank stock which was part of the corpus. The trustee agreed to use 'reasonable efforts to consult' with respondent with respect to 'the character of the investments' though it was not bound to follow his advice. Respondent retained no right to either the corpus or the income, or any part thereof, except as indicated above. The net income was to be paid as follows: $5, 000 a year to each of three children; the remaining amount to the wife during her life for her maintenance and support, and in her sole discretion for the support, maintenance and education of the children. On death of the wife, the corpus was to be held for the children.\n The separation agreement incorporated the trust agreement by reference; stated that the wife's income from the trust and from other property received from the husband would aggregate $30,000 a year; provided that respondent would pay his wife an additional $35,000 each year during her life so that her aggregate net income for the maintenance and support of herself and the children would approximate $65,000 a year, and would further pay any 'extraordinary medical or surgical expenses' incurred by the wife or on behalf of the children until they attained the age of twenty-five years; stated that in the event that respondent's ability to pay the above $35,000 became impaired, he might apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for a reduction of his obligation to not less than $10,000 a year; made other property settlements; provided for care and custody of the children; released dower, etc.\n The decree of divorce became final in October 1929. It 'approved and affirmed and made a part of the judgment herein' the separation agreement ( which as we \n\n[310 \nU.S. 80, 83]\n\u00a0\n have said incorporated the trust agreement) 'providing for the support and maintenance of the plaintiff', and in addition directed respondent to pay her $35,000 a year for the rest of her life. From June 4, 1929 to December 31, 1929, the trustee received $16,191.34 as dividends and interest from the trust property. It distributed $5,200 to the wife and $2,083.33 to each of the three children, leaving an undistributed balance for that period of about $4,700. Respondent did not include any of that income in his return for 1929. The Commissioner determined a deficiency. The Board of Tax Appeals held that only the amounts actually distributed to respondent's wife and minor children were taxable to him. 36 B.T.A. 563. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding that respondent, though taxable on income payable to his minor children, was not taxable on income payable to the wife. 2 Cir., 105 F.2d 900.\n Here, as in the Circuit Court of Appeals, it was urged by the petitioner that this alimony trust was merely security for respondent's continuing obligation to support his wife and, therefore, that the trust income payable to her was taxable to him under the rule of Douglas v. Willcuts, supra. In support of that position it was urged, inter alia, that under New York law respondent's obligation was not discharged since the New York court retained the power to modify the decree; and that the promise by respondent to pay the wife $35,000 (or in no event less than $ 10,000) a year converted the trust into at least partial security for the total allowance to her. In either of such events the rule of Douglas v. Willcuts, supra, would apply. See Helvering v. Fitch, supra. The Circuit Court of Appeals, however, decided these two questions adversely to petitioner. But there is one matter not touched on by that court which we think is determinative of one phase of the case. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 80, 84]\n\u00a0\n The trust agreement contains an express personal obligation of respondent in the form of a guarantee of payment of the principal and interest on $400,000 of the 6% bonds which were part of the trust corpus. To be sure, that personal obligation was contingent. But we do not deem that to be material. We recently stated in Helvering v. Fitch, supra, \n309 \nU.S. 149\n, 60 S.Ct. at page 430, 84 L.Ed. --, that under this statutory scheme escape from the rule of Douglas v. Willcuts, supra, may be had only on 'clear and convincing proof' that 'local law and the alimony trust have given the divorced husband a full discharge and leave no continuing obligation however contingent.' Whatever may be the correct view on the other aspects of the case, the guarantee was such a continuing obligation. The fact that the wife or other beneficiaries looked primarily to the trust and only secondarily to respondent for payment of $24,000 annually, the fact that respondent's obligation might be enforceable by the trustee, the fact that respondent might never have to make good on his promise are beside the point. The existence of wholly contingent obligations, whether contractual or otherwise, is adequate to support the results reached in Douglas v. Willcuts, supra. For in that case it was manifest that at the time of the creation and approval of the trust the divorce court might never exercise its reserved power to revise or alter the decree and the husband might never have to make good on his promise to make up deficiencies in the estimated trust income. Likewise in the instant case, it cannot be said that the divorce decree and the alimony trust gave respondent an absolute discharge from his prior obligation. So far as the guarantee alone is concerned, they permitted his pre-existing unconditional duty to be transformed into a limited contingent one. But nonetheless they placed a specific and adequate sanction on that duty, so that respondent's personal obligation would not be fully discharged at least until complete payment \n\n[310 \nU.S. 80, 85]\n\u00a0\n of the principal and interest on the 6% bonds had been made. Thus in effect, if not in form, the trust agreement was security for his continuing obligation which would be discharged at least pro tanto as income from those bonds was received by the trustee. Hence the case in substance is the same as those where pursuant to contract or arrangement an obligation is discharged by another for the taxpayer's benefit; see Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner, \n279 \nU.S. 716\n, 49 S.Ct. 499; United States v. Boston & Maine Railroad, \n279 \nU.S. 732\n, 49 S.Ct. 505, or where the taxpayer creates a trust, the income of which is applied to the discharge of his debt. See Helvering v. Blumenthal, \n296 \nU.S. 552\n, 56 S.Ct. 305. Here, as there, the taxpayer received a benefit by the payments. The catalogue of benefits is not depleted when primary obligations are discharged. For these reasons that portion of the trust income which was received from the guaranteed bonds was clearly taxable to respondent.\n Apparently, however, a portion of that income was received from other trust property. But we think that was also taxable to respondent though for another reason.\n As we have seen the divorce decree approved, affirmed and made part of the judgment the separation agreement providing for the 'support and maintenance' of the wife. Her maintenance and support were secured not only by the trust agreement and other property settlements but also by the personal obligation of the husband to contribute an annual sum. The Circuit Court of Appeals (105 F.2d 902) held that under New York law the terms of the trust would not be changed 'unless the wife can disaffirm it for fraud, overreaching, or the like', citing Galusha v. Galusha, 116 N.Y. 635, 22 N.E. 1114, 6 L.R.A. 487, 15 Am.St.Rep. 453; Id., 138 N.Y. 272, 33 N.E. 1062; Cain v. Cain, 188 App.Div. 780, 177 N.Y.S. 178; Hamlin v. Hamlin, 224 App.Div. 168, 230 N.Y.S. 51. If the case was here on application of local law under the rule of Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n, 58 S.Ct. 817, 114 A.L.R. 1487, we would not be \n\n[310 \nU.S. 80, 86]\n\u00a0\n inclined to disturb that finding. But it is not. Here respondent is seeking to escape one of the normal incidents of the federal income tax. For that purpose he invokes the aid of New York law. In Helvering v. Fitch, supra, we stated that where the divorced husband desires to avoid the general rule expressed in Douglas v. Willcuts, supra, he carries a distinct burden of establishing not by mere inference and conjecture but by 'clear and convincing proof' that local law and the alimony trust have given him a full discharge. We do not think that respondent has sustained that burden.\n As stated by the Circuit Court of Appeals, it does seem clear that mere property settlements, though incorporated into the decree, may not be modified pursuant to the reserved statutory powers of the court, contained in N.Y.Civil Practice Act  1155, 1170. See Cain v. Cain, supra; Goldfish v. Goldfish, 193 App.Div. 686, 184 N.Y.S. 512; Schnitzer v. Buerger, 237 App.Div. 622, 262 N.Y.S. 385. Nevertheless these settlements may be re- made by the court not only where an ordinary contract may be set aside, but also where they are unfair, inequitable and unjust. Hamlin v. Hamlin, supra. Cf. Tirrell v. Tirrell, 232 N.Y. 224, 133 N.E. 569. As stated by the court in the Hamlin case (224 App.Div. at page 171, 230 N.Y.S. at page 56) the requirement is that 'such contracts be not only free from taint of actual fraud or coercion, but also fair and reasonably sufficient, having regard to the station in life and circumstances of the parties.' More important to this case, however, are Kunker v. Kunker, 230 App.Div. 641, 246 N.Y.S. 118 and Holahan v. Holahan, 234 App.Div. 572, 255 N.Y.S. 693. They make it plain that the covenants of a separation agreement are not 'an insuperable obstacle to obtaining relief by modification of the allowances.' Holahan v. Holahan, supra, 234 App.Div. at page 574, 255 N.Y. S. at page 695. Cf. Severance v. Severance, 260 N.Y. 432, 183 N.E. 909. The reserved power apparently may be exercised where \n\n[310 \nU.S. 80, 87]\n\u00a0\n the provision in the separate agreement, approved by the decree, is for support and maintenance (Kunker v. Kunker and Holahan v. Holahan, supra) but not where it is in settlement of claims of ownership to specified property. Goldfish v. Goldfish and Schnitzer v. Buerger, supra. The provisions of the separation agreement and the trust agreement here in question specifically relate to and were designed to afford support and maintenance for the wife. Unlike the purpose of the trust agreement in Schnitzer v. Buerger, supra, the purpose here apparently was not to compose any controversies over the securities. We need not decide whether the court retained the power to require respondent to make additional payments to the wife in case, say, all the securities in trust turned out to be worthless. All we do hold is that respondent has not shown by 'clear and convincing proof' that the court lacks the power to add to his personal obligations in any such circumstances.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice REED concurs in the result for the reasons stated in the dissent in Helvering v.

NORTHWEST STEEL ROLLING MILLS(1940)\nNo. 121\nArgued: October 23, 1940Decided: November 12, 1940\n\n\n\n\n[311 \nU.S. 46, 47]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert H. Jackson, Atty. Gen., and Richard H. Demuth, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Walser S. Greathouse, of Seattle, Wash., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent corporation, because of a previously existing deficit, was prohibited by state law1 from distributing \n\n[311 \nU.S. 46, 48]\n\u00a0\n as dividends its profits earned in 1936. Notwithstanding this state prohibition, the Commissioner held respondent liable under the 1936 Revenue Act2 for surtax on undistributed profits. The Board of Tax Appeals sustained the Commissioner;3 the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. \n4\n On a similar state of facts the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held undistributed profits taxable. \n5\n We granted certiorari in both cases to resolve this conflict. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n Section 14 of the 1936 Act imposed a general surtax on corporate profits earned but not distributed as dividends during the tax year. Section 26(c)(1) of the Act relieved from such surtax all undistributed profits which the corporation could not distribute as dividends 'without violating a provision of a written conract executed by the corporation prior to May 1, 1936, which provision expressly deals with the payment of dividends.'\n The only 'witten contract executed by the corporation' upon which respondent relies for its claimed exemption is its corporate charter, granted by the state of Washington. Upon the premises that respondent's Washington charter was a written contract, and that the Washington laws prohibiting dividends payments were by operation of law a part of that contract, the court below concluded that the taxpayer had satisfied the requirements of section 26(c)(1).\n We must therefore decide whether section 26(c)(1) authorized a credit or deduction to corporations prohibited by \n\n[311 \nU.S. 46, 49]\n\u00a0\n state law from distributing dividends. And respondent strongly urges that the act, if construed to deny such credit, is unconstitutional.\n First. It is material that we are dealing here with a generally imposed surtax upon the undistributed net income of corporations, and that respondent's claim is for a credit in the nature of a specially permitted deduction. It has been said many times that provisions granting special tax exemptions are to be strictly construed. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n Measured by this sound standard it is probably not necessary to go beyond the plain words of section 26(c)(1) in search of the legislative meaning. Certainly, at first blush, few would suppose that when Congress granted a special exemption to corporations whose dividend payments were prohibited by executed written contracts, it thereby intended to grant an exemption to corporations whose dividend payments were prohibited by state law. The natural impression conveyed by the words 'written contract executed by the corporation' is that an explicit understanding has been reached, reduced to writing, signed and delivered. True, obligations not set out at length in a written contract may be incorporated by specific reference, or even by implication. But Congress indicated that any exempted prohibition against dividend payments must be expressly written in the executed contract. It did this by adding a precautionary clause that the granted credit can only result from a provision which 'expressly deals with the payment of dividends.'\n That the language used in section 26(c)(1) does not authorize a credit for statutorily prohibited dividends is further supported by a consideration of section 26(c)(2). By this section, a credit is allowed to corporations contractually \n\n[311 \nU.S. 46, 50]\n\u00a0\n obligated to set earnings aside for the payment of debts. \n8\n That this section referred to routine contracts dealing with ordinary debts and not to statutory obligations is obvious-yet the words used to indicate that the section had reference only to a 'written contract executed by the corporation' are identical with those used in section 26(c)(1). There is no reason to believe that Congress intended that a broader meaning be attached to these words as used in section 26(c)(1) than attached to them under the necessary limitations of 26(c)(2).\n Respondent urges that the legislative history of section 26(c)(1) supports its contention. But, on the contrary, that history points in the other direction. The original House Bill contained separate relief provisions (1) for deficit corporations such as respondent; (2) for corporations contractually obligated to pay debts; and (3) for corporations contractually prohibited from paying dividends. \n9\n The Senate Finance Committee struck out all three of these House provisions, but substituted an equivalent for the third. \n10\n An amendment from the Senate floor restored an equivalent of the second. \n11\n But the bill as finally passed contained no express relief provision relating to deficit corporations.\n It is true, as respondent contends, that a charter has been judicially considered to be a contract insofar as it \n\n[311 \nU.S. 46, 51]\n\u00a0\n grants rights, properties, privileges and franchises. \n12\n To this extent it has been said that an act of incorporation is a contract between the state and the stockholders. \n13\n But it does not follow that Congress intended to include corporate charters and related state laws in the cautiously limited area permissible for tax credits and deductions under this section. Nor have the courts considered that all the provisions of laws providing for the grant of corporate franchises are necessarily contractual in their nature. The same legislative act is a law as well as a grant, and this court has held that the same legislative enactment may be both a contract- which cannot be impaired-and a law, subject to repeal, modification, alteration, or amendment within the general legislative powers. 14 Respondent's chief reliance is upon that charter provision which required that it conform to the existing and future laws of Washington. But that provision is not a grant and is not a contract. With or without such a charter provision, it was the duty of the corporation to conform to valid Washington statutes. The corporation was subject to the law of Washington; it could not rise above it. A corporate charter to operate a particular business in a particular manner does not deprive the state of its inherent power of legislation touching corporate activities. And the grant of a franchise does not exempt the corporation from the requirement that it obey state legislation validly adopted in the interests of the public welfare. \n15\n It cannot be said, therefore, that the charter provision that the corporation should obey Washington law, including the statutory prohibition \n\n[311 \nU.S. 46, 52]\n\u00a0\n against distributing dividends, was a provision of a written contract executed by respondent. More, the Constitution of the State of Washington under which the general corporation laws were enacted provides that 'All laws relating to corporations may be altered, amended, or repealed by the legislature at any time, and all corporations doing business in this state may, as to such business, be regulated, limited, or restrained by law.' \n16\n It is clear, therefore, that what prohibited respondent from distributing dividends was not the provision of an executed written contract expressly dealing with the payment of dividends. On the contrary, what prohibited respondent from paying dividends was a valid law of the State of Washington. \n17\n\u00a0\n\n Second. Respondent contends that the tax statute, as construed, offends the Fifth, Tenth and Sixteenth Amendments. None of those contentions is valid. \n 18\n\u00a0\n\n It is argued that the act offends the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment because it permits credits or deductions in the case of corporations restrained from a distribution of dividends under a given type of written contract, while not permitting any credit or deduction to corporations restrained from distribution by oral contracts or by the laws of a state. This contention is without merit. It is not necessary to point out the many obvious reasons that might underlie the distinctions here drawn in granting special deductions from a generally imposed tax.\n Respondent also urges that the tax as applied to it amounts to a confiscation of its property without due process of law because the tax is imposed, not on income, \n\n[311 \nU.S. 46, 53]\n\u00a0\n but only on undistributed income, and that there can be no undistributed income so long as the corporation has an existing deficit. But the surtax here is imposed upon the undistributed net income of the corporation 'for each taxable year.' It is true that the surtax is imposed upon the annual income only if it is not distributed, but this does not serve to make it anything other than a true tax on income within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment. Nor is it true, as respondent urges, that because there might be an impairment of the capital stock, the tax on the current annual profit would be the equivalent of a tax upon capital. Whether there was an impairment of the capital stock or not, the tax here under consideration was imposed on profits earned during a definite period-a tax year-and therefore on profits constituting income within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment.\n It is contended that the statute as here applied violates the Tenth Amendment because it interferes with the authority of the states to prescribe the powers of corporations and the conditions under which their powers may be exercised. But the statute in no way limits the powers of the corporation. It imposes a tax as authorized by the Sixteenth Amendment and does not infringe upon the powers reserved to the state by the Tenth Amendment. \n19\n The court below was in error; its judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded, with directions to affirm the judgment of the Board of Tax Appeals. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'No corporation shall pay dividends ... except from the surplus of the aggregate of its assets over the aggregate of its liabilities ....'

OREGON MUT. LIFE INS. CO.(1940)\nNo. 564\nArgued: November 19, 1940Decided: December 9, 1940\n\n\n\n Messrs. Robert H. Jackson, Atty. Gen., and Arnold Raum, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. William Marshall Bullitt, of Louisville, Ky., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In computing its net taxable income for 1933 and 1934, respondent took a deduction of 3 3\/4% of the reserves it had set aside with respect to its combined policies of life, health, and accident insurance. Section 203(a)(2) \n\n[311 \nU.S. 267, 268]\n\u00a0\n of the 1932 and 1934 Revenue Acts permits a life insurance company to deduct from its gross income 'An amount equal to (3 3\/4%) of the mean of the reserve funds required by law ....'1 That respondent was a life insurance company as defined by the Revenue Acts and that it was required by law to maintain reserves to protect both death and disability benefits were conceded. The Commissioner allowed a deduction for death reserves, but disallowed as to disability reserves, on the hypothesis that the words 'reserve funds required by law' should be construed to apply only to reserves for death losses-thereby excluding disability reserves. The Board of Tax Appeals held the deductions allowable in both respects and reversed the Commissioner. \n2\n The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed;3 certiorari was granted because the Court of Claims had reached an opposite result on the same question. \n4\n\u00a0\n311 \nU.S. 640\n, 61 S.Ct. 143, 85 L.Ed. --.\n Legislative history discloses that a deduction similar to that allowed by section 203(a)(2) first appeared in the Revenue Act of 1921,5 and has reappeared in every revenue measure since, including that of 1939. 6 Prior to 1921, insurance companies had not been allowed such a deduction, but had been subject to the same tax plan as corporations generally; the 1921 Act, however, wholly exempted insurance companies from the general scheme \n\n[311 \nU.S. 267, 269]\n\u00a0\n of corporate taxation and set up special systems applicable to them alone. 7 The new plan, as it related to life insurance companies, had as a major objective the elimination of premium receipts from the field of taxable income. It had long been pointed out to Congress that these receipts, except as to a very minor proportion of each premium, were not true income but were analogous to permanent capital investment. \n8\n In all the Revenue Acts from 1921 through 1939, the gross income of life insurance companies no longer included premium receipts, but was limited to income 'from interest, dividends, and rents.' \n9\n And, pursuant to the conceived analogy of reserves to capital investment, net income was to be determined by permitting, among other deductions from gross income, that same deduction here in dispute-a percentage of the 'reserve funds required by law.'\n As entirely new and separate tax provisions relating only to life insurance companies were thus enacted, it became necessary specifically to define what constituted a 'life insurance company' within the meaning of the Act. Therefore, it was declared in the 1921 Act and all its successors that 'when used in this title (chapter) the term 'life insurance company' means an insurance company engaged in the business of issuing life insurance, and annuity contracts (including contracts of combined life, health, and accident insurance), the reserve funds of which held for the fulfillment of such contracts comprise more than 50 per centum of its total reserve funds.' \n10\n\u00a0\n\n[311 \nU.S. 267, 270]\n\u00a0\n Under the Congressional plan, there is granted a deduction based on those 'reserve funds required by law.' Section 203(a)(2) grants this deduction; section 201 defines life insurance companies. It seems clear that Congress intended to permit the deduction of reserves based on those policies that make a company a 'life insurance company' under the Act, which, by definition, includes policies of 'combined life, health, and accident insurance.' The reserves here related to the disability provisions of such combined policies. The same underlying considerations that prompted the deduction for death reserves are applicable to the reserves for disability in these combined policies. And disability as well as death reserves fall literally within the language of the deduction provision. It is not disputed that administrative regulations promulgated under every Revenue Act from 1921 through 1932 recognized the right of life insurance companies to take deductions both for death and for disability reserves on policies such as those here involved. \n11\n Nor is it denied that the 1934 reenactment of section 203(a)(2) followed thirteen years of administrative regulation and practice under which substantially identical provisions had been so construed and applied that life insurance companies could and did obtain these deductions. During that entire period, the Treasury found no ambiguity in section 203(a)(2), and expressed no doubt as to a life insurance company's right to make such deductions. But on February 11, 1935, regulations were promulgated asserting disability reserves to be non-deductible under the 1934 Act;12 and \n\n[311 \nU.S. 267, 271]\n\u00a0\n on December 18, 1935, a Treasury Decision declared that this regulation applied retroactively to the 1932 and earlier Acts. \n13\n Petitioner now says that its former practice in permitting disability reserve deductions was erroneous,14 and that the new regulation should be given full retroactive effect.\n It is the government's contention that the change in the regulations was particularly appropriate because induced by judicial decision. \n15\n And it is true that this Court has held that reserves set aside by life insurance companies to protect payment of policy investment purchases cannot be used as the basis for deductions. \n16\n But those decisions rested upon the conclusion that the investment fund features had no relation to the insurance risks. Here, in the combined life and health and accident policies, the health and accident reserves are based upon contingencies of the commencement and continuance of disability. They have a direct and inseparable relationship to the very insurance contracts which bring respondent under a special tax scheme. 17 Nor is there a distinction, as petitioner urges, between that part of the reserve set aside to protect policy holders not yet disabled and that part set aside to protect those already disabled. The liability to those who have incurred disability is not a fixed sum, but remains a contingency, still uncertain in \n\n[311 \nU.S. 267, 272]\n\u00a0\n duration and amount. Reserves held for such a contingent liability are true reserves in the insurance sense.\n We find it unnecessary to discuss the extent to which such a regulation might, under different circumstances, be given retroactive effect by virtue of the statutory power of the Commissioner. \n18\n Nor do we find it necessary to discuss the argument that the policy behind the special treatment afforded life insurance companies does not warrant allowing this deduction. For it is our conclusion that by section 203(a)(2) of the 1932 and 1934 Acts, Congress has granted life insurance companies a deduction for disability reserves which only Congress can take away. \n19\n\u00a0\n\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 47 Stat. 224, 48 Stat. 732, 26 U.S.C.A.

Burnet, \n283 \nU.S. 140\n, 51 S.Ct. 373; Jenkins v. Bitgood, 2 Cir., 101 F.2d 17, and Ferris v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 102 F.2d 985, we granted certiorari, January 15, 1940, \n308 \nU.S. 548\n, 60 S.Ct. 385, 84 L.Ed. --.\n The facts as found may be thus summarized: In 1929 the Atlantic Bank and Trust Company of Greensboro, North Carolina, was merged with the North Carolina Bank and Trust Company. The latter accepted conditionally certain assets of the Atlantic Bank called 'A' assets, and certain other assets, called 'B' assets, were pledged to that Bank with authority to charge against them any losses which might be established in realizing upon the 'A' assets. Respondent and three other stockholders of the Atlantic Bank executed an agreement of guaranty, to the effect that if the North Carolina Bank failed to realize a certain sum from the 'A' assets within two years they would make up the deficiency in an amount not exceeding $ 500,000. The agreement provided that any sum realized from the 'B' assets were to be applied first to any losses occurring in the 'A' assets and then to the reimbursement of the four guarantors. The period for realizing upon the 'A' assets was extended until September, 1932. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 409, 411]\n\u00a0\n In June, 1931, the North Carolina Bank advised the guarantors that the 'B' assets were not in such shape that the Bank could use them to the extent necessary for banking purposes and requested the guarantors to put their guaranty into a bankable form so that it could be used by the Bank to obtain credit. Respondent accordingly gave to the Bank his note for $ 125,000 and endorsed the note of C. W. Gold, another guarantor, for a like amount and assigned certain securities to the Bank as collateral for the payment of his guaranty. The Bank agreed that respondent's ultimate liability should not exceed $250,000. At the end of 1931, the guaranty agreement was still in effect. The 'B' assets were still in the process of collection. No demand had been made upon respondent. While it was known that there would be some loss to the guarantors, it was not definitely known in 1931 what the loss would be, and the guarantors had reason to believe that there would be a substantial reimbursement from the 'B' assets of any losses.\n In the early part of 1932, financial conditions being worse, the Bank concluded that it would have to collect upon the guaranty and called upon respondent to make a final settlement of his obligations. Accordingly, in March, 1932, respondent made his note to the Bank for $250,000 and received back the two notes. The Board of Tax Appeals found that both respondent and the Bank considered this to be a final payment of the two notes which had been given under the guaranty. The Bank retained the same collateral for the $250,000 note that it had previously held, and in December, 1932, respondent substituted therefor certain securities of his own.\n Respondent claimed a loss in 1932 in the amount of $125,000, that is, for his one-half of the guaranty. He did not then claim a loss on the other one-half because he still had a claim against the estate of Gold ( who had died in 1932) for reimbursement. For that one-half, representing Gold's part of the guaranty, respondent \n\n[309 \nU.S. 409, 412]\n\u00a0\n claimed a loss in 1933 and that deduction is not here involved.\n Respondent kept his accounts upon a cash basis. The Board of Tax Appeals ruled that respondent was not entitled to the deduction of $125, 000 in 1932, upon the ground that 'he made no outlay of cash' in the purported payment; he had satisfied his liability as guarantor 'by a shifting of the form of his liability'. His loss would be deductible 'in the year in which he pays the note'.\n Respondent insists initially that the transaction in 1932 was considered by the parties as constituting a payment of respondent's liability under the guaranty, and that this payment is a fact found by the Board of Tax Appeals and is not open to review. But the findings of the Board disclose the entire transaction, and its legal effect in the application of Section 23(e) of the Revenue Act of 1932, 26 U.S.C.A. Int. Rev.Acts, page 490, as to the deduction of losses sustained during the taxable year, was reviewable by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Its decision on that point is reviewable here.\n Both the Commissioner and the Board of Tax Appeals relied upon our decision in Eckert v. Burnet, supra. In that case, the taxpayer's return was on the cash basis, and the question was as to a claim of deduction for the year 1925. The taxpayer and his partner were joint endorsers of notes issued by a corporation they had formed. In 1925, in settlement of their liability for an ascertained amount, they made a joint note for the amount due to the bank that held the corporation's paper, 'received the old notes, marked paid, and destroyed them'. We affirmed the ruling that the deduction should not be allowed.\n The court below considered that decision as definite authority only for the holding that a loss of the sort set forth was not deductible under the 'bad debt' provision of the statute. That indeed was stated in the opinion as \n\n[309 \nU.S. 409, 413]\n\u00a0\n the taxpayer's claim. But the taxpayer had also presented here as an alternative ground the theory of a loss sustained during the taxable year, a ground which the Board of Tax Appeals had considered and held to be untenable. Eckert v. Commissioner of Int. Rev., 17 B.T.A. 263, 265, 266. And the Government argued both questions. The Government did not contend that the taxpayer might not at some time be entitled to a deduction 'either on account of a bad debt or for a business loss'; the 'sole question in dispute was whether he was entitled to the deduction in 1925, the year in which his note was given, or in the later year in which the taxpayer's liability on the note is actually liquidated by payment'.\n The reasoning of this Court was broad enough to cover both aspects of the case. We said (\n283 \nU.S. 140\n, 51 S.Ct. 374):\n'For the purpose of a return upon a cash basis there was no loss in 1925. As happily stated by the Board of Tax Appeals the petitioner 'merely exchanged his note under which he was primarily liable for the corporation's notes under which he was secondarily liable, without any outlay of cash or property having a cash value.' A deduction may be permissible in the taxable year in which the petitioner pays cash. The petitioner says that it was definitely ascertained in 1925 that the petitioner would sustain the losses in question. So it was, if the petitioner ultimately pays his note'.\n\n We think that this decision is controlling in the instant case. As the return was on the cash basis, there could be no deduction in the year 1932, unless the substitution of respondent's note in that year constituted a payment in cash or its equivalent. There was no cash payment and under the doctrine of the Eckert case the giving of the taxpayer's own note was not the equivalent of cash to entitle the taxpayer to the deduction.\n Respondent urges that his note was secured, but the collateral was not payment. It was given to secure re- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 409, 414]\n\u00a0\n spondent's promise to pay, and if that promise to pay was not sufficient to warrant the deduction until the promise was made good by actual payment, the giving of security for performance did not transform the promise into the payment required to constitute a deductible loss in the taxable year. See Jenkins v. Bitgood, 2 Cir., 101 F.2d 17, 19.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals is affirmed. It is so ordered.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS took no part in the decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","57":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHELVERING v. WOOD(1940)\nNo. 384\nArgued: February 5, 1940Decided: February 26, 1940\n\n\n\n Robert H. Jackson, Atty. Gen., and Warner W. Gardner, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. George M. Wolfson, of New York City, and Dean G. Acheson, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case, like Helvering v. Clifford, \n309 \nU.S. 331\n, 60 S.Ct. 554, 84 L.Ed. --, is here on certiorari, the problems in the two cases being the same \n\n[309 \nU.S. 344, 345]\n\u00a0\n in certain essential respects. In April 1931 respondent, who owned twenty- five shares of stock of Book-of-the-Month Club, Inc., made himself trustee of those shares under an agreement which was to expire in three years1 or earlier on the death of either him or his wife. By the trust he was to 'hold, invest, and reinvest' the shares, to 'collect the net income therefrom' and to pay it to his wife. He had the power to 'retain' the stock or to 'sell' it or 'any part thereof' at such 'time and on such terms' as he should 'deem proper'.2 It was provided that his power of investment or reinvestment of 'any of the property or moneys held in trust' was not to be restricted by any law governing investments by trustees. He was also given power to 'fix and determine' the value of the property for all purposes of the trust and to determine 'whether any property or money received or held in trust shall be treated as capital or income, and the mode in which any expense incidental to the execution of the trust is to be borne as between capital and income,' with the proviso, however, that stock dividends and subscription rights should be treated as principal. He was prohibited from receiving any commissions with respect to principal or income; and an exculpatory clause purported to protect him against any loss except that occasioned by his wilful misconduct. He had the power to appoint a substitute trustee. \n3\n On termination of the trust 'all property then held in trust' was to go to him. The trust contained no power of revocation nor any power to revest in the grantor at any time, prior to the date of termination, title to any part of the corpus. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 344, 346]\n\u00a0\n During 1934 respondent paid over to his wife $8,750, which was the entire income from the trust for that year. She included it in her income tax return. The Commissioner, being of the opinion that the income was taxable to respondent, determined a deficiency in his 1934 return. Respondent appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals which held that petitioner was in error, 37 B.T.A. 1065. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, 2 Cir ., 104 F.2d 1013, on the authority of United States v. First National Bank of Birmingham, 5 Cir., 74 F.2d 360.\n Petitioner maintains that the trust income is taxable to respondent either under  166 or  22(a) of the Revenue Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 680, 686, 729, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  166, and 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Acts, page 669 or both.\n By  166 the income from a trust is taxable to the grantor where 'at any time the power to revest in the grantor title to any part of the corpus of the trust is vested' in him or in any person 'not having a substantial adverse interest in the disposition of such part of the corpus or the income therefrom.' \n4\n Petitioner has not undertaken to establish that under New York law, which governs this trust, respondent had the power to revoke it prior to the end of the term. But in his contention that the trust here involved is covered by  166, petitioner points out that there is no practical difference between a revocable trust and one certain to be terminated soon. And he argues that it would not be sensible \n\n[309 \nU.S. 344, 347]\n\u00a0\n to impute to Congress a purpose to impose the tax when the grantor has an executory power to revest title in himself but to withhold the tax when the grantor, by provisions in the trust deed, has already exercised that power.\n Our difficulty lies not in an inability to see the similarity of those situations but in being able to say that Congress treated them the same under  166. A power to revest or revoke may in economic fact be the equivalent of a reversion. But at least in the law of estates they are by no means synonymous. For, generally speaking, the power to revest or to revoke an existing estate is discretionary with the donor; a reversion is the residue left in the grantor on determination of a particular estate. See Tiffany, Real Property (2nd ed.)  129 et seq.,  316 et seq. Congress seems to have drawn  166 with that distinction in mind, for mere reversions are not specifically mentioned. Whether as a matter of policy such nice distinctions should be perpetuated in a tax law by selecting one type of trust but not the other for special treatment is not for us. We have only the responsibility of carrying out the Congressional mandate. And where Congress has drawn a distinction, however nice, it is not proper for us to obliterate it. That seems to us to be the case here. Whether wisely or not, Congress confined  166 to trusts where there was a 'power to revest'. The problem of interpretation under  166 is therefore quite different from that under  22(a). The former is narrowly confined to a special class; the latter by broad, sweeping language is all inclusive. Helvering v. Clifford, supra. Accordingly, the wide range for definition and specification under the latter is lacking under  166. And so far as  166 is concerned no apparent or lurking ambiguity requires or permits us to divine a broader purpose than that expressed. The legis- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 344, 348]\n\u00a0\n lative history corroborates this conclusion. When the 1934 Act was before the House Committee, the Treasury recommended that income from short term trusts and from revocable trusts should be taxable to the creator. \n5\n The Congress adopted the latter6 by an appropriate amendment to  166; but it did not select the former for special treatment. When such clear choice of ideas has been made in the drafting of a specific provision of the law, its language must be taken at its face value. Sec. 166 is therefore not applicable to this trust since respondent is given no power to recall the corpus. He or his estate gets it at the end of the term, on the death of his wife, or on his own death-whichever is the earliest.\n For a wholly different reason, petitioner's argument based on  22(a) must fail. The Board of Tax Appeals purported to place its decision solely on  166 and  167 of the Act, 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Code,  166, 167. Petitioner in his assignments of error specifically mentioned only  166 and  167, not  22(a). In his brief before the Circuit Court of Appeals petitioner expressly waived reliance upon any section other than \n\n[309 \nU.S. 344, 349]\n\u00a0\n s 166. Though petitioner in his petition for certiorari relied on  22(a), respondent in opposition thereto took the position that that point was not available to petitioner here as it was not raised below. In view of these facts, especially the express waiver below, we do not think that petitioner should be allowed to add here for the first time another string to his bow. As we have indicated, the issues under  166 and  22(a) are not coterminous. Though both deal with concepts of ownership, the range of inquiry under the latter is broad, under the former confined. To open here for the first time and in face of the express disclaimer an inquiry into the broader field is not only to deprive this Court of the assistance of a decision below but to permit a shift to ground which the taxpayer had every reason to think was abandoned in the earlier stages of this litigation. \n7\n See Burnet v. Commonwealth Improvement Co., \n287 \nU.S. 415, 418\n, 53 S.Ct. 198. It is not apparent why a less strict rule is necessary in order adequately to protect the revenue.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS concurs in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In 1932 the term was extended to five years from April, 1931. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] His right to sell was subject to a collateral agreement, not material here, with one Scherman, granting Scherman a preemptive right in case respondent decided to sell. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] No substitute trustee was, however, appointed, respondent continuing to act as trustee until termination of the trust in 1936. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Sec. 166 reads in full:\n'Where at any time the power to revest in the grantor title to any part of the corpus of the trust is vested-\n\n'(1) in the grantor, either alone or in conjunction with any person not having a substantial adverse interest in the disposition of such part of the corpus or the income therefrom, or\n\n'(2) in any person not having a substantial adverse interest in the disposition of such part of the corpus or the income therefrom,\n\n then the income of such part of the trust shall be included in computing the net income of the grantor.' \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Revenue Revision, 1934, Hearings before the Committee on Ways & Means, H.R. 73rd Cong., 2nd Sess., p. 151.

No. 1385, H.R. 73rd Cong., 2nd Sess., p. 24: 'Under existing law, the income from a revocable trust is taxable to the grantor only where such grantor (or a person not having a substantial adverse interest in the trust) has the power within the taxable year to revest in the grantor title to any part of the corpus of the trust. Under the terms of some trusts, the power to revoke cannot be exercised within the taxable year, except upon advance notice delivered to the trustee during the preceding taxable year. If this notice is not given within the preceding taxable year, the courts have held that the grantor is not required under existing law to include the trust income for the taxable year in his return. The Senate amendments require the income from trusts of this type to be reported by the grantor. The House recedes.' \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Art. 166-1 of Treasury Regulations 86, originally promulgated under  166, was not promulgated under  22(a) until 1936 (T.D. 4629), two years after the tax liability here in issue occurred. Hence we do not have a case of reliance by the government on a regulation which during the taxable year in question rested on two legs, one of which was  22(a). \n\n\n\n\n","58":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHELVERING v.

SMITH(1940)\nNo. 146\nArgued: December 5, 1939Decided: January 8, 1940\n\n\n\n Mr. Samuel O. Clark, Jr., Asst. Atty. Gen., for petitioner.\n Mr. David Sher, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice REED, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Certiorari was allowed1 from the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit2 on account of an asserted conflict between the decision below and that \n\n[308 \nU.S. 473, 474]\n\u00a0\n of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Commissioner v. Griffiths. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The issue considered here is whether a taxpayer under the circumstances of this case is entitled to deduct a loss arising from the sale of securities to a corporation wholly owned by the taxpayer. The statute involved is Section 23(e) of the Revenue Act of 1932.4\n The Innisfail Corporation was wholly owned by the taxpayer, Mr. Smith. It was organized in 1926 under the laws of New Jersey. The officers and directors of the corporation were subordinates of the taxpayer. Its transactions were carried on under his direction and were restricted largely to operations in buying securities from or selling them to the taxpayer. While its accounts were kept completely separate from those of the taxpayer, there is no doubt that Innisfail was his corporate self. As dealings by a corporation offered opportunities for income and estate tax savings, Innisfail was created to gain these advantages for its stockholder. One of its first acts was to take over an option belonging to the taxpayer for the acquisition by exchange of a block of Chrysler common stock. Through mutual transactions in buying and selling securities, and receiving dividends, the balance of accounts between Innisfail and the taxpayer resulted, on December 29, 1932, in an indebtedness from him to Innis- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 473, 475]\n\u00a0\n fail of nearly $70,000. On that date, as a partial payment on this indebtedness, a number of shares of stock were sold to the corporation by the taxpayer at market. The securities sold had cost the taxpayer more than the price charged to the corporation, and in carrying out the transaction the taxpayer had in mind the tax consequences to himself.\n In computing his net taxable income for 1932, the taxpayer deducted as a loss the difference between the cost of these securities and their sale price to his wholly owned corporation. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue ruled against the claim, whereupon respondent paid the tax and brought this suit for refund in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The case was tried before a jury and the verdict was adverse to the taxpayer's claim that the purported sales of these securities to Innisfail marked the realization of loss on their purchase. On appeal the judgment was reversed and the case remanded to the District Court for a new trial. It was the opinion of the Court of Appeals that the facts as detailed above, as a matter of law, established the transfer of the securities to Innisfail as an event determining loss.\n Under Section 23(e) deductions are permitted for losses 'sustained during the taxable year.' The loss is sustained when realized by a completed transaction determining its amount. \n5\n In this case the jury was instructed to find whether these sales by the taxpayer to Innisfail were actual transfers of property 'out of Mr. Smith and into something that existed separate and apart from him' or whether they were to be regarded as simply 'a transfer by Mr. Smith's left hand, being his individual hand, into his right hand, being his corporate hand, so that in truth and fact there was no transfer at all.' The jury agreed the latter situation existed. There was sufficient evidence \n\n[308 \nU.S. 473, 476]\n\u00a0\n of the taxpayer's continued domination and control of the securities, through stock ownership in the Innisfail Corporation, to support this verdict, even though ownership in the securities had passed to the corporation in which the taxpayer was the sole stockholder. Indeed this domination and control is so obvious in a wholly owned corporation as to require a peremptory instruction that no loss in the statutory sense could occur upon a sale by a taxpayer to such an entity.\n It is clear an actual corporation existed. Numerous transactions were carried on by it over a period of years. It paid taxes, state and national, franchise and income. But the existence of an actual corporation is only one incident necessary to complete an actual sale to it under the revenue act. Title, we shall assume, passed to Innisfail but the taxpayer retained the control. Through the corporate forms he might manipulate as he chose the exercise of shareholder's rights in the various corporations, issuers of the securities, and command the disposition of the securities themselves. There is not enough of substance in such a sale finally to determine a loss.\n The Government urges that the principle underlying Gregory v. Helvering6 finds expression in the rule calling for a realistic approach to tax situations. As so broad and unchallenged a principle furnishes only a general direction, it is of little value in the solution of tax problems. If, on the other hand, the Gregory case is viewed as a precedent for the disregard of a transfer of assets without a business purpose but solely to reduce tax liability, it gives support to the natural conclusion that transactions, which do not vary control or change the flow of economic benefits, are to be dismissed from consideration. There is no illusion about the payment of a tax exaction. Each tax, according to a legislative plan, raises funds to carry \n\n[308 \nU.S. 473, 477]\n\u00a0\n on government. The purpose here is to tax earnings and profits less expenses and losses. If one or the other factor in any calculation is unreal, it distorts the liability of the particular taxpayer to the detriment or advantage of the entire taxpaying group. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n The taxpayer cites Burnet v. Commonwealth Improvement Company8 as a precedent for treating the taxpayer and his solely owned corporation as separate entities. In that case the corporation sold stock to the sole stockholder, the Estate of P.A.B. Widener. The transaction showed a book profit and the corporation sought a ruling that a sale to its sole stockholder could not result in a taxable profit. This Court concluded otherwise and held the identity of corporation and taxpayer distinct for purposes of taxation. 9 In the Commonwealth Improvement Company case, the taxpayer, for reasons satisfactory to itself voluntarily had chosen to employ the corporation in its operations. A taxpayer is free to adopt such organization for his affairs as he may choose and having elected to do some business as a corporation, he must accept the tax disadvantages. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n On the other hand, the Government may not be required to acquiesce in the taxpayer's election of that form for doing business which is most advantageous to him. The Government may look at actualities and upon determination that the form employed for doing business or carrying out the challenged tax event is unreal or a sham may sustain or disregard the effect of the fiction as best serves the purposes of the tax statute. To hold otherwise would permit the schemes of taxpayers to supersede legislation in the determination of the time and \n\n[308 \nU.S. 473, 478]\n\u00a0\n manner of taxation. It is command of income and its benefits which marks the real owner of property. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n Such a conclusion, urges the respondent, is inconsistent with the prior interpretations of the income tax laws and consequently unfair to him. He points to the decisions of four courts of appeals which have held losses determined by sales to controlled corporations allowable12 and further calls attention to the fact that the Board of Tax Appeals has consistently reached the same conclusion. \n13\n But this judicial and administrative construction has no significance for the respondent. The Bureau of Internal Revenue has insistently urged since February 18, 1930, the date of the Board of Tax Appeals' decision in Jones v. Helvering,14 that a transfer from a taxpayer to a controlled corporation was ineffective to close a transaction for the determination of loss. Every case cited by respondent in the courts of appeals and before the Board of Tax Appeals found the Government supporting that contention. The Board's ruling in the Jones case was \n\n[308 \nU.S. 473, 479]\n\u00a0\n standing unreversed at the time of the transaction here involved, December 29, 1932. It was only after the transactions here involved and after the reversal of the Board in the Jones case on April 23, 1934, or this Court's refusal of certiorari on October 8, 1934, that the Board of Tax Appeals and the courts of appeals, over Government protests, ruled in line with the opinion of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia in the Jones case. If the Bureau's stand in the Jones case represented a change in administrative practice, there can be no doubt that the change operated validly at least from 1930 on. \n15\n After the Jones defeat the Government sought relief in Congress and after the judgment in Commissioner v. Griffiths, supra, certiorari here on a conflict in principle between circuits. Certainly there was no acquiescence by the Government which would justify the taxpayer in relying upon prior interpretations of the law. \n 16\n\u00a0\n\n Respondent makes the further point that the passage of Section 24(a)( 6) of the Revenue Act of 193417 which explicitly forbids any deduction for losses determined by sales to corporations controlled by the taxpayer is convincing proof that the law was formerly otherwise. This \n\n[308 \nU.S. 473, 480]\n\u00a0\n does not follow. At most it is evidence that a later Congress construed the 1932 Act to recognize separable taxable identities between the taxpayer and his wholly owned corporation. As the new provision goes much farther than the former decisions in disregarding transfers between members of the family it may well have been passed to extend as well as clarify the existing rule. The suggestion is not sufficiently persuasive to give vitality to a futile transfer.\n The taxpayer has preserved two objections to the district judge's rulings on the evidence. He claims that evidence as to transactions between the taxpayer and the corporation which took place prior to the sale here involved was remote and highly prejudicial. We think it apparent that this evidence was entirely relevant to the present issue; the history of the taxpayer's relations with the corporation shed considerable light on the actual effect of the sale in question. The second contention is that the district judge charged the jury to give less effect to the book entries of Smith and the corporation than they were entitled to under the applicable book entry statute. \n18\n The alleged departure from the statute has but dubious support in the record, resting on a single statement of the judge lifted from its context as part of an extended colloquy with counsel. In the circumstances there is no merit in the claim of prejudice to the taxpayer.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and that of the District Court affirmed.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS.\n I think the judgment should be affirmed. To reverse it is to disregard a rule respecting the separate entity of corporations having basis in logic and practicality and \n\n[308 \nU.S. 473, 481]\n\u00a0\n which has long been observed in the administration of the revenue acts.\n Since the inception of the system of federal income taxation, capital gains have been taxed and certain capital losses have been allowed as credits against such gains. In order that this system might be practical it has been necessary to select some event as the criterion of realization of gain or loss. The revenue laws have selected the time of the closing of a capital transaction as the occasion for reckoning gain or loss on a capital asset. A typical method of closure is a sale of the asset.\n As the sale is voluntarily made by the taxpayer, his determination when he shall sell affects his capital gain or loss. He, therefore, in a sense, controls the question whether, in a given taxable year, he must pay tax on a realized gain or may claim credit for a realized loss. Of course such a sale must be bona fide and title must pass absolutely. In the present instance the sale and transfer were such, and, as the Circuit Court of Appeals held, there was not a scintilla of evidence to the contrary for the jury's consideration. A taxpayer who pretends he has made a sale when in fact he has a secret agreement which leaves him still, for all practical purposes, the owner of the thing sold, is but committing a fraud upon the revenue.\n If the sale is bona fide, if title in fact passes irrevocably to another, that other takes as his basis, in reckoning his gain and loss, the price he paid for the asset; and upon his future disposition of it there will be a new reckoning of gain or loss with respect to such disposition. Here, if Innisfail either sold to the respondent or to a third party it would have to reckon gain or loss on the sale. If it distributed the asset in liquidation the respondent would be subject to a tax liability on the receipt of his dividend. The sole question, then, is whether, as matter of law, a bona fide and absolute sale to a wholly owned corporation \n\n[308 \nU.S. 473, 482]\n\u00a0\n can constitute a completed transaction, determining a loss.\n The problem as to how a sale to a corporation wholly owned or wholly controlled by an individual taxpayer is to be treated is not a new one. The existence of such corporations and the dealings between them and their stockholder or stockholders have long been understood. Congress was not ignorant of the problem. \n1\n At the outset Congress might well have adopted the policy that a sale by the stockholder to the corporation, or vice versa, should be disregarded, and the stockholder treated as in effect the owner of the capital asset until its sale to a stranger. On the other hand, it would be a practical policy to recognize the separate entity of the corporation, to treat a transfer at current value for adequate consideration occurring between it and its sole stockholder as closing a transaction for the purpose of reckoning either gain or loss, and then to tax the vendee upon his or its gain or loss upon a subsequent transfer by comparison of the basis on which the asset was acquired and the amount realized on final disposition by the vendee. In fact, the latter course was adopted and was consistently followed until 1934 when Congress dealt with the subject.\n This court, speaking by Mr. Justice Holmes, said, in Klein v. Board of Supervisors, \n282 \nU.S. 19, 24\n, 51 S.Ct. 15, 16, 73 A.L.R. 679: '... But it leads nowhere to call a corporation a fiction. If it is a fiction it is a fiction created by law with intent that it should be acted on as if true. The corporation is \n\n[308 \nU.S. 473, 483]\n\u00a0\n a person and its ownership is a nonconductor that makes it impossible to attribute an interest in its property to its members.'\n In this view assets received on the liquidation of a one-man corporation constitute taxable income to the sole stockholder. \n2\n Likewise, losses sustained by a corporation wholly owned by one individual may not be reported and claimed in the individual tax return of the latter. \n3\n And the sole stockholder and his controlled corporation may not tack successive periods of ownership to make up the two years required for an asset to become, within the meaning of the statute, a capital asset. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n This court has found that a taxable gain was realized in a case where a wholly owned corporation sold securities to its sole stockholder. \n5\n Every element appearing in that case is paralleled here, as a comparison of the facts stated in the opinions in the two cases will demonstrate. This court said, in the earlier case, referring to the corporation: 'The fact that it had only one stockholder seems of no legal significance,' and held the corporation a separate taxable entity. It is now said, however, that there is no inequity in not applying the same rule to losses as to gains because the taxpayer who exercises the option to conduct a portion of his business through the instrumentality of a wholly owned corporation does so in the full knowledge that, if he does, gains shown on sales by him to the corporation will be taxed whereas losses on such sales will not be allowed as deductions. As hereafter will be shown, this is now true in virtue of the amendment \n\n[308 \nU.S. 473, 484]\n\u00a0\n embodied in the Revenue Act of 1934 but it was not true as the law stood before the adoption of that amendment.\n In 1921 the Treasury was first called upon to deal with a loss deduction arising out of a sale to a wholly owned corporation. In that year it published Law Opinion 1062.6 It was held that if the sale was bona fide and passed title absolutely to the controlled corporation, even though the sale was made with the intent of reducing the tax liability of the vendor it fell within the provisions of the revenue act concerning the reckoning of gain or loss upon a closed transaction. So far as I am informed, the Treasury followed this rule in administering the various revenue acts for years after it was issued. The first evidence of a change in its position was the refusal of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to recognize losses resulting to taxpayers from a bona fide sale of bonds owned by them to a wholly owned corporation at the current market price. \n7\n The Board of Tax Appeals sustained the Commissioner, but the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia reversed the Board in Jones v. Helvering, 63 App.D.C. 204, 71 F.2d 214. The decision was rendered April 23, 1934. The Commissioner sought certiorari which was denied October 8, 1934. 8 The same result has been reached by three other Circuit Courts of Appeal. 9 The Board of Tax Appeals followed these decisions. \n10\n In the \n\n[308 \nU.S. 473, 485]\n\u00a0\n meantime the Circuit Courts of Appeal had decided numerous cases which are, in principle, indistinguishable. \n11\n This court having denied certiorari in Jones v. Helvering, supra, decided Gregory v. Helvering, \n293 \nU.S. 465\n, 55 S.Ct. 266, 97 A.L.R. 1355, in the following January. It cited the Jones case with approval, 293 U.S. at page 469, 55 S.Ct. at page 267, 97 A.L.R. 1355, saying: '... The legal right of a taxpayer to decrease the amount of what otherwise would be his taxes, or altogether avoid them, by means which the law permits, cannot be doubted.'\n So well settled had the judicial interpretation become that the Treasury determined to recommend that Congress amend the statute. \n12\n The result was the adoption of Sec. 24(a)(6) of the Revenue Act of 1934.13 The Committee reports disclose that Congress thought it necessary to change the statute in order to render non-deductible a loss claimed on a sale to a wholly owned or a controlled corporation. \n14\n Subsequent hearings before the Joint Commission on Tax Evasion and Avoidance, 1937, p. 207, indicate the same understanding on the part of the Bureau of Internal Revenue and of Congress that the rule \n\n[308 \nU.S. 473, 486]\n\u00a0\n of law in effect prior to the adoption of the amendment in 1934 was changed by that legislation. The amendment lists among items not deductible the following:\n'(6) Loss from sales or exchanges of property, directly or indirectly , (A) between members of a family, or (B) except in the case of distributions in liquidation, between an individual and a corporation in which such individual owns, directly or indirectly, more than 50 per centum in value of the outstanding stock. For the purpose of this paragraph-(C) an individual shall be considered as owning the stock owned, directly or indirectly, by his family; and (D) the family of an individual shall include only his brothers and sisters (whether by the whole or half blood), spouse, ancestors, and lineal descendants.'\n\n Plainly, prior to 1934, taxpayers were justified in relying, first, upon the Treasury ruling on the subject and, secondly, upon the uniform decisions of the courts in claiming deductions for losses on sales to controlled corporations. After the passage of the amendment they were on notice that this was no longer permissible.\n I turn then to the situation here presented. The claims of this taxpayer, as I have said, had been sustained for prior years by the Board of Tax Appeals. 15 The Congress had enacted that subsequent to 1934 the taxpayer could not claim such losses. Notwithstanding the earlier decisions of the respondent's case and those of other taxpayers against the Government's present contention, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, after the adoption of the Act of 1934, namely on March 11, 1935, served a notice of deficiency upon the respondent respecting losses claimed in his return for the year 1932 on sales to Innisfail. Thus the Treasury repudiated the position it had taken in asking that the law be amended to cover cases of this kind; reversed its position in acquiescing in the \n\n[308 \nU.S. 473, 487]\n\u00a0\n adjudication of the respondent's tax liability for earlier years and sought, now that it had obtained an amendment of the law operating prospectively, to reach back into sundry unclosed ones,-this one amongst others,-and to attempt to obtain decisions reversing the settled course of decision. I think this court should not lend its aid to the effort.\n I am of opinion that where taxpayers have relied upon a long unvarying series of decisions construing and applying a statute, the only appropriate method to change the rights of the taxpayers is to go to Congress for legislation. In my view, the resort to Congress, on the one hand, for amendment, and the appeal to the courts, on the other, for a reversal of construction, which, if successful, will operate unjustly and retroactively upon those who have acted in reliance upon oft-reiterated judicial decisions, are wholly inconsistent.\n I am of opinion that the courts should not disappoint the well- founded expectation of citizens that, until Congress speaks to the contrary, they may, with confidence, rely upon the uniform judicial interpretation of a statute. The action taken in this case seems to me to make it impossible for a citizen safely to conduct his affairs in reliance upon any settled body of court decisions.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS joins in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \n308 \nU.S. 536\n, 60 S.Ct. 88, 84 L.Ed. --. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 102 F.2d 456. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 103 F.2d 110, affirmed sub nom.

Helsell, of Fort Dodge, Iowa, for appellant.\n Mr. John A. Weeks, of Minneapolis, Minn., for appellee.\n\n\n\n[309 \nU.S. 157, 159]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Minnesota imposes on every railroad company owning or operating lines within its borders a five per cent tax on gross earnings derived from its operation within the state. This tax, payable in lieu of all other taxes,1 has been sustained by this Court, in various applications, as a property tax. \n2\n In this case, which is here on appeal (28 U.S.C.  344(a), 28 U.S.C. A.  344(a) from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Minnesota (205 Minn. 1, 284 N.W. 360; 205 Minn. 621, 286 N.W. 359), appellant contends that the statute as construed and applied to it violates the Fourteenth Amendment and the commerce clause of the federal Constitution U.S.C.A.Const. art. 1 ,  8, cl. 3; Amend. 14.\n Appellant, an Illinois railroad corporation, owns no lines in Minnesota but operates leased lines with 30.15 \n\n[309 \nU.S. 157, 160]\n\u00a0\n miles of trackage in that state. \n3\n It owns or operates about 5,000 miles in other states. The item of gross earnings which the state seeks here to tax arises out of debits and credits for exchange of freight cars which appellant makes with other railroads, the using road being charged $1 per day per car. During the years here involved appellant had credits in its favor for such use of its cars by other roads operating in Minnesota of $ 17,427,862; and debits owing such roads of $14,924,508, leaving a net credit balance in favor of appellant of $2,503,353. These debits and credits represented use of cars in other states as well as in Minnesota. In absence of adequate and accurate records their use was apportioned to Minnesota pursuant to the following formula:\n Each reporting road was charged with such percentage of the credit balance owing from each using railroad as was determined by ascertaining the ratio of each using railroad's Minnesota revenue freight car miles to its system car miles.\n Each reporting road was given credit for such percentage of the debit balance owing each other road as was determined by ascertaining the ratio of the reporting railroad's Minnesota revenue freight car miles to its system car miles.\n The credit and debit balances were computed and apportioned annually; and the net credits were then ascertained, to which the statutory tax of 5 per cent was applied.\n Thus for the year 1922 appellant had credit balances of $691,433.97 owing from 13 other roads. Their Minnesota revenue freight car miles varied from 2.3% to 100% of their system car miles, making Minnesota's proportion of the credit balances $95,359.49. For the same year appellant had debit balances from freight car hire owing to 8 other roads of $215, 863.05. Appellant's Minnesota revenue freight car miles were only .11% of its system car \n\n[309 \nU.S. 157, 161]\n\u00a0\n miles for that year. Hence, it was permitted to deduct only .11% of $215, 863.05 or $237.43, leaving $95,122.06 to which the tax was applicable. On similar computations for each of the following seven years the tax for which the state brought suit totalled $26,414.59.\n Appellant's contention under the Fourteenth Amendment is that the statute as applied in the foregoing formula denies it equal protection of the law and due process. We do not think that contention is tenable.\n First as to the credit balances. These represent payments to appellant for use of its freight cars by other roads which operate in Minnesota. Minnesota does not seek to reach all of those receipts. As the statute reaches only revenues derived from operations in the state, the formula effects an apportionment. Certainly the ratio of Minnesota revenue freight car miles to system car miles is consistent with the statutory scheme of ascertaining what payments represent use in Minnesota. That the apportionment may not result in mathematical exactitude is certainly not a constitutional defect. \n4\n Rough approximation rather than precision is, as a practical matter, the norm in any such tax system. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n Second as to the debit balances. As we have said, appellant is not taxed on all of its credit balances but only on that portion which accrues as a result of the use of its cars by others in Minnesota. Hence it is not permitted under the formula to deduct all of its debit balances but only the portion thereof which it pays others for the use of their cars in Minnesota. Certainly if appellant receives $50,000 from one road for use of appellant's cars in Minnesota and pays another road $50,000 for appellant's use of that road's cars outside of Minnesota, it cannot realistically be said that no part of the \n\n[309 \nU.S. 157, 162]\n\u00a0\n $50,000 received by appellant has a Minnesota origin. On the contrary, the whole $50,000 paid appellant derives from use of its cars in Minnesota. For Minnesota then to lay a tax on the whole amount (as it does under this formula) is to exercise a jurisdiction which constitutionally is hers. Similarly to permit under the formula a deduction of only those debit balances owing by virtue of the use by appellant in Minnesota of cars of other roads results in determining a net credit balance for its Minnesota activity of renting out and borrowing freight cars. To hold that that net cannot constitutionally be taxed by Minnesota but must be reduced by the amount of payments made by appellant for its use of cars in other states would be to deprive Minnesota of her jurisdiction over property within her borders. \n6\n For as appellant's cars move over tracks of other roads in Minnesota and as cars of other roads move over its tracks in Minnesota, certain credits and debits accrue. To say that the resultant net credit balance does not derive wholly from operations within Minnesota is to deny the fact.\n But the nub of appellant's objection seems to rest on the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Most of its contentions come back to the point that it has only 30 odd mils of tracks in the state. On this phase, appellant makes two points. First, as compared with other roads having extensive mileage in Minnesota, it is permitted to deduct only a small fraction (between .1% and .13%) of its debit balances. Second, it is penalized for having nominal trackage in Minnesota, for roads with no trackage in the state pay no tax on these items though they may have substantial revenues from rentals of cars for use in Minnesota. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 157, 163]\n\u00a0\n We have in substance already dealt with the first of these contentions. All roads operating in Minnesota are taxed on precisely the same, not on different bases. So far as the present incidence of the statute is concerned, the tax is laid on the net credit balances from the business of renting and borrowing cars used in Minnesota. The fact that appellant receives a larger net than others from its Minnesota activity of renting and borrowing cars and hence must pay a larger tax does not mean that Minnesota has overstepped her constitutional bounds. Appellant is not single out for special treatment. \n7\n It is not taxed on one formula; the others, on another. They are all taxed pursuant to the same formula; and the formula is adapted to ascertainment of value of property situated in Minnesota. And appellant's contention that the tax is discriminatory because it has only 30 miles of track yet must pay a tax, while others with hundreds of miles may pay none, is beside the point. The business taxed is not adequately measured by trackage alone. Though appellant has but few miles of track in the state, nevertheless its cars are constantly moving over revenue. A tax on that revenue certainly bears a close relationship to appellant's property in the state which no computation based on trackage can alter.\n As to appellant's second objection under this head, little need be said. Companies not owning or operating roads within the state are not reached by this tax statute; roads that do, are. That certainly is not discrimination in the constitutional sense. Appellant has subjected itself to the jurisdiction of Minnesota. Those doing likewise are similarly treated by the state, as are domestic companies engaged in that business. The fact that that \n\n[309 \nU.S. 157, 164]\n\u00a0\n entails burdens is a part of the price for enjoyment of the privileges which Minnesota extends. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n Appellant makes some point of double taxation. But the flaw in that argument is exposed by the familiar doctrine, aptly phrased by Mr. Justice Holmes, that the 'Fourteenth Amendment no more forbids double taxation that it does doubling the amount of a tax; short of confiscation or proceedings unconstitutional on other grounds.' \n9\n\u00a0\n\n Appellant's constitutional objection based on the commerce clause has been adequately answered in the prior decisions of this Court sustaining other taxes levied under this statute. \n10\n The right of a state to tax property, although it is used in interstate commerce, is well settled. And certainly if such tax has a fair relation to the property employed in the state (as this tax clearly does) it cannot be said to run afoul of the prohibition against state taxation on interstate commerce. As Chief Justice Fuller once said on that point, '... by whatever name the exaction may be called, if it amounts to no more than the ordinary tax upon property, or a just equivalent therefor, ascertained by reference thereto, it is not open to attack as inconsistent with the constitution.' \n 11\n\u00a0\n\n As to appellant's claim of retroactivity, little need be said. We have here at most a mere recomputation by the state of taxes payable under a statute which was existent throughout the whole period in question. Neglect of administrative officials, misunderstanding of the law, lack of adequate machinery have never been constitutional barriers to a state reaching backward for \n\n[309 \nU.S. 157, 165]\n\u00a0\n taxes. \n12\n Hence the case falls far short of types of retroactive tax legislation which have repeatedly been sustained by this Court,13 in recognition of the principle that liability for retroactive taxes is 'one of the notorious incidents of social life.' \n14\n Certainly where opportunity to be heard is afforded, as here, there can be no complaint for lack of due process of law. \n15\n\u00a0\n\n In conclusion, appellant contends that the Supreme Court of Minnesota erred in holding that the credits here taxed are 'gross earnings' within the meaning of the statute. But on such matters of construction we defer to the state court's interpretation. \n16\n\u00a0\n\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 2246, Mason's Minn.Stats.1927, provides in part: 'Every railroad company owning or operating any line of railroad situated within or partly within this state, shall, during the year 1913 and annually thereafter, pay into the treasury of the state, in lieu of all taxes, upon all property within this state owned or operated for railway purposes, by such company, including equipment, appurtenances, appendages and franchises thereof, a sum of money equal to five per cent of the gross earnings derived from the operation of such line of railway within this state.'\n Sec. 2247 defines 'gross earnings' as follows: 'The term 'the gross earnings derived from the operation of such line of railway within this state,' as used in section 1 of this act is hereby declared and shall be construed to mean, all earnings on business beginning and ending within the state, and a proportion, based upon the proportion of the mileage within the state to the entire mileage over which such business is done, of earnings on all interstate business passing through, into or out of the state.' \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Great Northern Railway Co. v.

Atty. Gen., for petitioners.\n Messrs. Swagar Sherley and George B. Springston, both of Washington, D.C., for respondent. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 517, 518]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question before us is whether a national bank may pledge assets to secure deposits of funds made by governmental agencies, even though they may not be 'public money' within the scope of  45 of the National Banking Act, 13 Stat. 99, 113, 12 U.S.C.  90, 12 U.S.C.A.  90.\n The deposits in question were made with the Commercial National Bank by three separate governmental agencies-by the Inland Waterways Corporation and the \n\n[309 \nU.S. 517, 519]\n\u00a0\n United States Shipping Board Merchant Eleet Corporation,1 and by the Secretary of War on behalf of the Panama Canal Zone. After the bank's insolvency the present suit was instituted by the receiver, respondent here, for the recovery of the pledged assets or their proceeds to the extent of the amount in excess of the dividends paid to the general depositors. The District Court granted respondent's motion to strike out portions of the petitioners' answers asserting the validity of the pledges. The petitioners stood their ground, and decrees pro confesso far the respondent followed. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia affirmed, Inland Waterways Corp. v. Hardee, 69 App.D.C. 268, 100 F.2d 678, and we granted certiorari, \n306 \nU.S. 626\n, 59 S.Ct. 589, because the controversy raised matters of importance in the administration of the National Banking Act, 12 U.S.C.A.  21 et seq.\n At the threshold we are met by two recent decisions of this Court, Texas & Pacific Ry. v. Pottorff, \n291 \nU.S. 245\n, 54 S.Ct. 416, and Marion v. Sneeden, \n291 \nU.S. 262\n, 54 S.Ct. 421. In view of the thorough consideration which these two cases received and the added weight which they derive from the authority, in the field of banking, of Mr. Justice Brandeis, the writer of the opinions, we start with full acceptance of what they decided.\n The Pottorff case held that a national bank was without authority to pledge its assets as security for private deposits. In the absence of specific authority to make such pledges, the general policy of the Act and principles of sound banking practice were drawn upon to establish the prohibition. To allow the withdrawal of assets of the bank from general availability would impair the bank's liquidity-its ability to meet unexpected demands by depositors-and thereby restrict the national banking system as a reliable instrument of national finance. In the Sneeden case the banking standards relied upon in \n\n[309 \nU.S. 517, 520]\n\u00a0\n the Pottorff case were applied likewise to deny to national banks power to pledge their assets as security for deposits by state and local governmental agencies except where permission is given by the Act of June 25, 1930, 46 Stat. 809, 12 U.S.C.  90, 12 U.S.C.A.  90.2\n But the function of national banks as depositaries of federal funds was not before the Court in the Pottorff and Sneeden cases, and the power of the banks in relation to such funds could not have been decided there. That power is the exact issue here. The solution of this problem, however, must be found by application of those standards for judgment which were decisive in the former cases. In other words, the history and purposes of the statute and the traditional policy of the National Government in utilizing the national banks as fiscal agencies must give meaning to the silence of the Act.\n Congress has necessarily been concerned from the beginning to provide appropriate safeguards for government funds. One of the motives in the establishment of the first Bank of the United States was its availability as a safe depositary for such funds. They were kept there until the expiration of that Bank's charter in 1811. Thereafter and until the second Bank of the United States was chartered, government monies were kept in state banks. These deposits were without security, and as a consequence severe losses followed the financial dislocation which came with the War of 1812. This experience led the Government to exact security, and losses became negligible. Phillips, Methods of Keeping the \n\n[309 \nU.S. 517, 521]\n\u00a0\n Public Monies of the United States, pp. 620; H. Rep. No. 358, 21 Cong., 1st Sess., Vol. 3, p. 12; IV McMaster, History of the People of the United States, p. 295 et seq.; III American State Papers, Finance, p. 11. The second Bank of the United States, established partly to serve as a Government depositary, kept most of the federal funds until their withdrawal in 1833 by Secretary Taney. But as a condition to their deposit in various state banks after 1833, Taney, acting upon the earlier experience of the Treasury under Secretaries Gallatin and Crawford, exacted appropriate security. \n3\n By the Act of June 23, 1836, 5 Stat. 52, Congress translated Treasury practice into legislative policy. It thereby became the Secretary's duty, whenever wisdom dictated, to require collateral for Government funds. As a result security was demanded of almost all the depositaries. Phillips, op cit., p. 63. The panic of 1837 brought another modification. Government monies were held by the local collectors and by the Treasury itself, and a little later deposited in the new Sub-Treasury. But in 1841 the old method of deposit in state banks was resumed under the practice which had been introduced in 1833. Exec. Doc. No. 123, 27th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 2; Phillips, op cit., p. 113. This arrangement-that is, deposits secured by collateral-continued until the Sub-Treasury Act of 1846, 9 Stat. 59, led to the withdrawal of Government funds from private banks. The sub-treasury system persisted until the establishment of the modern national banking system. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 517, 522]\n\u00a0\n The policy of securing Government deposits thus antedates the National Banking Act. It was the practical response to disastrous experience. It began without any statutory authorization, and was continued both with and without specific Congressional sanction. Long practice and Congressional approval lodged in the Secretary of the Treasury authority to take appropriate measures to safeguard the nation against loss of its funds. The integrity of Government monies was naturally considered an object of great national importance, the attainment of which properly belonged to those entrusted with their disposition.\n It is against this background that the National Banking Act of 1864, 13 Stat. 99, must be projected, intended as it was to provide facilities for the deposit of Government funds. Congress was alive to the Treasury's experience with deposits, secured and unsecured, during the preceding decades, together with the policy which had evolved from that experience. Cong.Globe, 37th Cong., 3d Sess., Pt. I, pp. 843-845. The banking system which Congress thus established embodied a blend of governmental and private purposes. See Mercantile Bank v. New York, \n121 \nU.S. 138, 154\n, 7 S. Ct. 826, 834; Davis, The Origin of the National Banking System, S. Doc. No. 582, 61st Cong., 2d Sess.\n By  45 of the Act, Congress specifically commanded the Secretary of the Treasury to exact security for 'public monies' deposited by him in national banks. R.S.  5153, 12 U.S.C.  90, 12 U.S.C.A.  90. We read this as an exaction of duty from the Secretary as to monies subject to his control, see Cook County Nat. Bank v. United States, \n107 \nU.S. 445, 449\n, 2 S.Ct. 561, 564, and not as a limitation upon the power of the bank to give security when it may be required by other Government officers and agencies charged with the custody of federal funds. Placing  45 in the setting of its history, we do not think it should be read in a nig- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 517, 523]\n\u00a0\n gardly spirit, as though it expressed a gingerly departure from public policy. On the contrary, it is a manifestation of historic national practice, which is to be given scope consonant with the reason for its development. Compare Keifer & Keifer v. R.F.C., \n306 \nU.S. 381\n, 59 S.Ct. 516. By a series of specific statutory commands, Congress has recognized the power of national banks to give security for deposits of a governmental nature by laying upon various agencies, charged with the custoody of such funds, a duty to exact collateral. See  61 of the Bankruptcy Act, 30 Stat. 562, 11 U.S.C.A.  101;  9 of the Postal Savings Act, 36 Stat. 816, 39 U.S.C.A.  759; and Acts relating to Insolvent Bank Funds, 39 Stat. 121, 12 U.S.C.A.  192; Porto Rican Funds, 39 Stat. 951; Government Obligations, 40 Stat. 291, 31 U.S.C.A.  771, and Indian Monies, 40 Stat. 591, 25 U.S.C.A.  162. With one exception all these special statutory requirements pertain to funds held by the Government for the benefit of others. It is difficult to suppose that what Congress has commanded with respect to funds held by its agencies in an immediate fiduciary capacity, it would deem a violation of law if done with respect to funds beneficially owned by the United States itself. What may be inimical to the private aspects of the national banking system, and therefore ultra vires, has no such relevance to the public aspect of national banks, and to the enforcement of the public interest by those charged with primary responsibility for its guardianship.\n So far as the powers of a national bank to pledge its assets are concerned, the form which Government takes-whether it appears as the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of War, or the Inland Waterways Corporation-is wholly immaterial. The motives which lead Government to clothe its activities in corporate form are entirely unrelated to the problem of safeguarding governmental deposits, and therefore irrelevant to the issue of ultra vires. Compare Skinner & Eddy Corp. v. Mc- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 517, 524]\n\u00a0\n Carl, \n275 \nU.S. 1, 8\n, 48 S.Ct. 12, 14.4 The true nature of these modern devices for carrying out governmental functions is recognized in other legal relations when realities become decisive. Compare Clallam County v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 341\n, 44 S.Ct. 121; Emergency Fleet Corp. v. Western Union, \n275 \nU.S. 415\n, 48 S.Ct. 198. The funds of these corporations are, for all practical purposes, Government funds; the losses, if losses there be, are the Government's losses. Compare United States Grain Corp. v. Phillips, \n261 \nU.S. 106, 113\n, 43 S.Ct. 283, 285. See Seventeenth Annual Report, U.S. Shipping Board, 1933, pp. 88-89, for summary of losses borne by Treasury on behalf of the Merchant Fleet Corporation, and compare Annual Report, Inland Waterways Corporation, 1936, pp. 16-22.\n The policy underlying Congressional legislation and reflected in the history of governmental deposits is confirmed by the explicit recognition of that official in whom is centered oversight of the administration of the National Banking Act. S. Doc . 175, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. The Comptroller of the Currency, to be sure, must himself move within the orbit of the National Banking Act. Illegality cannot attain legitimacy through practice. But when legality itself is in dispute-when Congress has spoken at best with ambiguous silence-a long continued practice pursued with the knowledge of the Comptroller of the Currency is more persuasive than considerations of abstract conflict between such a practice and purposes attributed to Congress. More than half a dozen agencies have thought it their duty to safeguard deposits in nearly a hundred banks by transactions similar to those before us. This practice had the approval of the Comptroller because he believed it within the scope of the National \n\n[309 \nU.S. 517, 525]\n\u00a0\n Banking Act. Even constitutional power, when the text is doubtful, may be established by usage. See United States v. Midwest Oil Co., \n236 \nU.S. 459, 473\n, 35 S.Ct. 309, 313. When dealing with such necessarily argumentative concepts as those of which the law of ultra vires is so largely composed, the responsible and pervasive practice of public officers bent on safeguarding the public interests ought to carry the day even were the issue more in doubt than we believe it to be.\n Deeming the challenged pledges to have been validly made, we think petitioners were entitled to judgment. It is therefore unnecessary for us to consider the other arguments here urged in their behalf. The judgments below should be reversed.\n Mr. Justice REED and Mr. Justice MURPHY took no part in the disposition of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS dissenting.\n The court below followed and applied the decisions of this court in Texas & Pacific Railway v. Pottorff, \n291 \nU.S. 245\n, 54 S.Ct. 416, Marion v. Sneeden, \n291 \nU.S. 262\n, 54 S.Ct. 421, and Lewis v. Fidelity & Deposit Co., \n292 \nU.S. 559\n, 54 S.Ct. 848, 850, 92 A.L.R. 794.\n It is true that those cases presented the question whether national banks are authorized to give security for private deposits and those of state agencies. But the basis of each of the decisions was that national banks are without power to pledge assets as security for any deposits, in the absence of express legislative sanction. Paradoxically, the opinion of the court, while recognizing the authority, in the field of banking, of Mr. Justice Brandeis, who announced the opinions in all three cases for a unanimous court, rejects the fundamental principle of the opinions. Whereas in the Lewis case Mr. Justice Brandeis announced in plain terms that, in the absence of express authorization, a national bank has 'no power \n\n[309 \nU.S. 517, 526]\n\u00a0\n to make any pledge to secure deposits except the federal deposits specifically provided for by acts of Congress', the opinion of the court spells out such power despite 'the silence of the act.'\n In the Texas & Pacific and Marion cases the opinions point out that whenever Congress has intended that security should be taken for deposits of government funds specific authority has been granted. \n1\n That what was thus said by Mr. Justice Brandeis was deemed necessary to the decisions and was the deliberate conclusion of the court is evidenced by his statement in Lewis v. Fidelity & Deposit Co., 292 U.S. at page 564, 54 S. Ct. at page 850, 92 A.L.R. 794.\n'In Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Pottorff, \n291 \nU.S. 245\n, 54 S.Ct. 416, and Marion v. Sneeden, \n291 \nU.S. 262\n, 54 S.Ct. 421, ... we held that a national bank had, prior to the Act of June 25, 1930, no power to make any pledge to secure deposits except the federal deposits specifically provided for by acts of Congress.'\n\n Now it is said that these cases incorrectly state the governing principle. That principle is now said to be that Congress cannot have intended to limit the authority of banks to give security in cases where administrative officers in charge of government funds have deemed it appropriate that security should be given. In other words, despite the withholding of any grant of power to institutions whose powers are only those granted,2 a power is spelled out.\n The attempt to buttress the implication of the power from the fact that federal agencies have heretofore exacted security, and that the Comptroller of the Currency has been of the view that such pledges were not \n\n[309 \nU.S. 517, 527]\n\u00a0\n in violation of the Act, is answered by what was said in Marion v. Sneeden, 291 U.S. page 269, 54 S.Ct. page 422: 'comptrollers of the currency knew that this was being done; and they assumed that the banks had the power so to do. But the assumption was erroneous.'\n I think that as the Court of Appeals followed the principle rightly applied in the decisions of this court its judgment should be affirmed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Both these corporations are wholly owned by the United States. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Lewis v. Fidelity & Deposit Co., \n292 \nU.S. 559\n, 54 S.Ct. 848, 92 A.L.R. 794, involved merely the application of the Sneeden doctrine to the special circumstances presented by Georgia legislation in the case of national banks situated in that State. The Lewis case, like the Pottorff and Sneeden cases, did not bring into issue the power of national banks with reference to federal deposits. Of course, the Lewis case neither professed to enlarge, nor could it, the scope of the Pottorff and Sneeden decisions. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] These conditions, incorporated in contracts between the Treasury and the banks, required collateral to be pledged for all deposits in excess of one-half the bank's paid-in capital. In addition the Treasury reserved the right to demand additional security whenever it was thought prudent. Exec.Doc.

Watts, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n There are two questions here for decision: (1) whether on the facts of this case the National Labor Relations Board was without authority in finding that an industrial unit was appropriate for collective bargaining purposes to the exclusion of a craft unit; and (2) \n\n[311 \nU.S. 72, 74]\n\u00a0\n whether the Board had authority to require the employer to bargain with that industrial unit, despite a claim submitted to the Board by the craft unit before the order issued that the latter then had been designated by a majority of all the employees. We granted certiorari, \n309 \nU.S. 649\n, 60 S. Ct. 721, because of the importance of these questions in the administration of the National Labor Relations Act, 49 Stat. 449, 29 U. S.C.A.  151 et seq., and because of an asserted conflict between the decision below, 71 App.D.C. 175, 110 F.2d 29, and Hamilton-Brown Shoe Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 8 Cir., 104 F.2d 49, on the second question.\n The Board found, in proceedings duly had under  10 of the Act, that the employer, Serrick Corporation, had engaged in unfair labor practices within the meaning of the Act. It ordered the employer to cease and desist from those practices and to take certain affirmative action. More specifically, it directed the employer to cease giving effect to a closed- shop contract with petitioner1 covering the tool room employees; to deal with U.A.W., an industrial unit,2 as the exclusive bargaining agent of its employees, including the toolroom men; to desist from various discriminatory practices in favor of petitioner and against U.A.W.; and to reinstate and make whole certain employees who had been improperly discharged. The employer has complied with the Board's order. But petitioner, an intervener in the proceedings before the Board, filed a petition in the court below to review and set aside those portions of the order which direct the employer to cease and desist from giving effect to its closed-shop contract with petitioner and to bargain exclusively with U. A.W. The court below affirmed the order of the Board. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 72, 75]\n\u00a0\n Abrogation of petitioner's closed-shop contract. The Board found that the closed-shop contract between petitioner and the employer was invalid under  8(3) of the Act3 because it had been 'assisted' by unfair labor practices of the employer, because petitioner did not represent an uncoerced majority of the toolroom employees at the time the contract was executed, and because for this and other reasons it was not an appropriate bargaining unit. We think there was substantial evidence that petitioner had been assisted by unfair labor practices of the employer and that therefore the Board was justified in refusing to give effect to its closed- shop contract.\n Since the court below has confirmed the findings of the Board there is no need to review the evidence in detail. National Licorice Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, \n309 \nU.S. 350, 357\n, 60 S.Ct. 569, 574. It is clear that the employer had an open and avowed hostility to U.A.W. It is plain that the employer exerted great effort, though unsuccessfully, to sustain its old company union, the Acme Welfare Association, as a bulwark against U.A.W. And it is evident that the employer, while evincing great hostility to U.A.W. in a contest to enlist its production force, acqui- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 72, 76]\n\u00a0\n esced without protest in the organization by petitioner of the toolroom employees. The main contested issue here is narrowly confined. It is whether or not the employer 'assisted' the petitioner in enrolling its majority.\n Fouts, Shock, Dininger, Bolander, By-road and Baker were all employees of the toolroom. Four of these-Fouts, Shock, Byroad and Bolander- were old and trusted employees. Fouts was 'more or less an assistant foreman', having certain employees under him. Shock was in charge of the toolroom during the absence of the foreman. Dininger and Bolander were in charge of the second and third shifts, respectively, working at night. Prior to mid-July, 1937, they had been actively engaged on behalf of the company union. When it became apparent at that time that the efforts to build up that union were not successful, Fouts, Shock, Byroad and Bolander suddenly shifted their support from the company union to petitioner and moved into the forefront in enlisting the support of the employees for petitioner. The general manager told Shock that he would close the plant rather than deal with U.A.W. The superintendent and Shock reported to toolroom employees that the employer would not recognize the C.I.O. The superintendent let it be known that the employer would deal with an A.F. of L. union. At the same time the superintendent also stated to one of the employees that some of the 'foremen don't like the C.I.O.' and added, with prophetic vision, that there was 'going to be quite a layoff around here and these fellows that don't like the C.I.O. are going to lay those fellows off first.' During working hours, Byroad conducted a straw vote among the employees and under the direction of Fouts and Shock left the plant to seek out an organizer for petitioner. Fouts solicited among workmen in the toolroom stating that his purpose was to 'beat' the U.A.W. For a week preceding August 13, Shock spent much time, as did Byroad, going 'from one \n\n[311 \nU.S. 72, 77]\n\u00a0\n bench to another soliciting' for petitioner. Baker likewise solicited. Dininger offered an employee a 'good rating' if he would join petitioner. Not less than a week before August 13, the personnel director advised two employees to 'join the A.F. of L.' Byroad spent considerable time during working hours soliciting employees, threatening loss of employment to those who did not sign up with petitioner and representing that he was acting in line with the desires of the toolroom foreman, McCoy. This active solicitation for petitioner was on company time and was made openly in the shop. Much of it was made in the presence of the toolroom foreman, McCoy, who clearly knew what was being done. Yet the freedom allowed solicitors for petitioner was apparently denied solicitors for U.A.W. The plant manager warned some of the latter to check out their time for a conference with him on U.A.W. and questioned their right to discuss U.A.W. matters on company property. The inference is justified that U.A.W. solicitors were closely watched, while those acting for petitioner were allowed more leeway.\n Five U.A.W. officials had been discharged in June, 1937, because of their union activities. The known antagonism of the employer to U.A.W. before petitioner's drive for membership started made it patent that the employees were not free to choose U.A.W. as their bargaining representative. Petitioner started its drive for membership late in July, 1937, and its closed-shop contract was signed August 11, 1937.4 On August 10, 1937, the U.A.W., having a clear majority of all the employees, presented to the employer a proposed written contract for collective bargaining. This was refused. On August 13, 1937, all toolroom employees who refused membership in petitioner, some 20 in number, were discharged. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 72, 78]\n\u00a0\n On August 15, 1937, the management circulated among the employees a statement which, as found by the Board, was a thinly veiled attack on the U.A.W. and a firm declaration that the employer would not enter into any agreement with it.\n Petitioner insists that the employer's hostility to U.A.W. cannot be translated into assistance to the petitioner and that none of the acts of the employees above mentioned, who were soliciting for petitioner, can be attributed to the employer.\n We disagree with that view. We agree with the court below that the toolroom episode was but an integral part of a long plant controversy. What happened during the relatively brief period from late July to August 11, 1937, cannot properly be divorced from the events immediately preceding and following. The active opposition of the employer to U.A.W. throughout the whole controversy has a direct bearing on the events during that intermediate period. Known hostility to one union and clear discrimination against it may indeed make seemingly trivial intimations of preference for another union powerful assistance for it. Slight suggestions as to the employer's choice between unions may have telling effect among men who know the consequences of incurring that employer's strong displeasure. The freedom of activity permitted one group and the close surveillance given another may be more powerful support for the former than campaign utterances.\n To be sure, it does not appear that the employer instigated the introduction of petitioner into the plant. But the Board was wholly justified in finding that the employer 'assisted' it in its organizational drive. Silent approval of or acquiescence in that drive for membership and close surveillance of the competitor; the intimations of the employer's choice made by superiors; the fact that the employee-solicitors had been closely identified with \n\n[311 \nU.S. 72, 79]\n\u00a0\n the company union until their quick shift to petitioner; the rank and position of those employee-solicitors; the ready acceptance of petitioner's contract and the contemporaneous rejection of the contract tendered by U.A.W.; the employer's known prejudice against the U.A.W., were all proper elements for it to take into consideration in weighing the evidence and drawing its inferences. To say that the Board must disregard what preceded and what followed the membership drive would be to require it to shut its eyes to potent imponderables permeating this entire record. The detection and appraisal of such imponderables are indeed one of the essential functions of an expert administrative agency.\n Petitioner asserts that it had obtained its majority of toolroom employees by July 28, 1938, and that there was no finding by the Board that that majority was maintained between then and the date of execution of the closed-shop contract by unfair labor practices. In this case, however, that is an irrelevant refinement. The existence of unfair labor practices throughout this whole period permits the inference that the employees did not have that freedom of choice which is the essence of collective bargaining. And the finding of the Board that petitioner did not represent an uncoerced majority of toolroom employees when the closed- shop contract was executed is adequate to support the conclusion that the maintenance as well as the acquisition of the alleged majority was contaminated by the employer's aid.\n Petitioner attacks the Board's conclusion that its membership drive was headed by 'supervisory' employees-Fouts, Shock, Dininger and Bolander. According to petitioner these men were not foremen, let alone supervisors entrusted with executive or directorial functions, but merely 'lead men' who by reason of long experience were skilled in handling new jobs and hence directed the set-up of the work. Petitioner's argument is that since these \n\n[311 \nU.S. 72, 80]\n\u00a0\n men were not supervisory their acts of solicitation were not coercive and not attributable to the employer.\n The employer, however, may be held to have assisted the formation of a union even though the acts of the so-called agents were not expressly authorized or might not be attributable to him on strict application of the rules of respondeat superior. We are dealing here not with private rights (Amalgamated Utility Workers v. Consolidated Edison Co., \n309 \nU.S. 261\n, 60 S.Ct. 561) nor with technical concepts pertinent to an employer's legal responsibility to third persons for acts of his servants, but with a clear legislative policy to free the collective bargaining process from all taint of an employer's compulsion, domination, or influence. The existence of that interference must be determined by careful scrutiny of all the factors, often subtle, which restrain the employees' choice and for which the employer may fairly be said to be responsible. Thus where the employees would have just cause to believe that solicitors professedly for a labor organization were acting for and on behalf of the management, the Board would be justified in concluding that they did not have the complete and unhampered freedom of choice which the Act contemplates. \n5\n Here there was ample evidence to support that inference. As we have said, Fouts, Shock, Dininger and Bolander all had men working under them. To be sure, they were not high in the factory hierarchy and apparently did not have the power to hire or to fire. But they did exercise general authority over the employees and were in a strategic position to translate to their subordinates the policies and desires of the management. It is clear that they did exactly that. Moreover, three of them-Fouts, Shock and Bolander-had been actively engaged during the preceding \n\n[311 \nU.S. 72, 81]\n\u00a0\n weeks in promoting the company union. During the membership drive for petitioner they stressed the fact that the employer would prefer those who joined petitioner to those who joined U.A.W. They spread the idea that the purpose in establishing petitioner was 'to beat the C.I.O.' and that the employees might withdraw from the petitioner once this objective was reached. And in doing these things they were emulating the example set by the management. The conclusion then is justified that this is not a case where solicitors for one union merely engaged in a zealous membership drive which just happened to coincide with the management's desires. Hence the fact that they were bona fide members of petitioner did not require the Board to disregard the other circumstances we have noted.\n By  8(3) of the Act discrimination upon the basis of union membership constitutes an unfair labor practice unless made because of a valid closed-shop contract. But that section authorizes an order under  10 abrogating such a contract with a labor organization which has been assisted by unfair labor practices. The presence of such practices in this case justified the Board's conclusion that petitioner did not represent an uncoerced majority of the toolroom employees. Secs. 7, 8(1). This conclusion makes it unnecessary to pass upon the scope of the Board's power to determine the appropriate bargaining unit under  9(b).\n Alleged change in status of petitioner. Petitioner challenges the order directing the employer to bargain exclusively with U.A.W., on the ground that prior to the issuance of the order petitioner had obtained an overwhelming majority of the production employees and had so notified the Board. Petitioner made no showing at the hearing that a majority of the employees had shifted to it after the employer refused to bargain with U.A. W. Nor did it seek leave from the court below to adduce \n\n[311 \nU.S. 72, 82]\n\u00a0\n such additional evidence pursuant to  10(e). Nevertheless it contends that the Board on receipt of the notification should have ordered an election or at least have made an investigation.\n We agree with the court below that the Board in failing to act on this request did not commit error. This was not a certification proceeding 6 under  9(c); it was an unfair labor practice proceeding under  10. Where as a result of unfair labor practices a union cannot be said to represent an uncoerced majority, the Board has the power to take appropriate steps to the end that the effect of those practices will be dissipated. That necessarily involves an exercise of discretion on the part of the Board-discretion involving an expert judgment as to ways and means of protecting the freedom of choice guaranteed to the employees by the Act. It is for the Board not the courts to determine how the effect of prior unfair labor practices may be expunged. National Labor Relations Board v. Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines, Inc., \n303 \nU.S. 261, 271\n, 58 S.Ct. 571, 576, 115 A.L.R. 307; National Labor Relations Board v. Falk Corp., \n308 \nU.S. 453, 461\n, 60 S.Ct. 307, 311. It cannot be assumed that an unremedied refusal of an employer to bargain collectively with an appropriate labor organization has no effect on the development of collective bargaining. See National Labor Relations Board v. Pacific Greyhound Lines, Inc., \n303 \nU.S. 272, 275\n, 58 S.Ct. 577, 578. Nor is the conclusion unjustified that unless the effect of the unfair labor practices is completely dissipated, the employees might still be subject to improper restraints and not have the complete freedom of choice which the Act contemplates. Hence for failure of the Board to recognize petitioner's notice of change was wholly proper. National Labor Relations Board v. Bradford Dyeing Assn., \n310 \nU.S. 318, 339\n, 340 S., 60 S.Ct. 918, 929. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 72, 83]\n\u00a0\n Sec. 9 of the Act provides adequate machinery for determining in certification proceedings questions of representation after unfair labor practices have been removed as obstacles to the employees' full freedom of choice.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Petitioners, labor organizations affiliated with the American Federation of Labor, are treated herein in the singular. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] United Automobile Workers of America, Local No. 459 (herein called U.A.W.) is affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations (C.I.O .). \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Sec. 8(3) provides:\n'It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer-...\n\n'(3) By discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization: Provided, That nothing in this Act (chapter), or in the National Industrial Recovery Act (sections 701 to 712 of Title 15) (U.S.C., Supp. VII, title 15, secs. 701-712), as amended from time to time, or in any code or agreement approved or prescribed thereunder, or in any other statute of the United States, shall preclude an employer from making an agreement with a labor organization (not established, maintained, or assisted by any action defined in this Act (chapter), as an unfair labor practice) to require as a condition of employment membership therein, if such labor organization is the representative of the employees as provided in section 9(a) (159(a) of this title), in the appropriate collective bargaining unit covered by such agreement when made.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The contract, though dated August 6, 1937, was actually executed on August 11, 1937. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] See Consumers Power Co. v.

COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE(1940)\nNo. 50\nArgued: October 25, 1940Decided: November 12, 1940\n\n\n\n\n[311 \nU.S. 55, 56]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert Ash and William J. Sebald, both of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Richard H. Demuth, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here on certiorari to resolve the conflict of the decision below (9 Cir., 110 F.2d 655) with C. H. Mead Coal Co. v. Commissioner, 4 Cir., 106 F.2d 388.\n Petitioner is engaged in the business of mining gold at Flat, Alaska. The winter mail service to and from that remote place was so uncertain and slow that, in order to avoid delinquency in income tax returns, petitioner's officers were accustomed to use the forms for an earlier year. Consequently petitioner's original return for the calendar year 1934 was filed on a 1933 form which had been mailed to petitioner by the Collector at Tacoma, Washington, This return was executed on January 2, 1935, and reached Tacoma on January 29, 1935. When it was executed petitioner did not know of the provision1 in the Revenue \n\n[311 \nU.S. 55, 57]\n\u00a0\n Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 680, allowing percentage depletion. But petitioner did know that unless the law had been changed it was not entitled to depletion, as it had no basis for cost depletion. The Collector in sending the 1933 forms had not advised petitioner with respect to percentage depletion. And it was found that if petitioner had known of the statutory provision for percentage depletion, it would have elected to take advantage of it. Petitioner first actually learned of the provision in August, 1935. On March 3, 1936, petitioner filed an amended return for 1934 upon which a deduction of percentage depletion was taken; and it asked for a refund. The Board of Tax Appeals, 39 B.T.A. 1243, upheld the Commissioner's ruling denying percentage depletion and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.\n Sec. 114(b)(4) of the 1934 Act required the taxpayer to elect in his 'first return' whether the depletion allowance was to be computed with or without regard to percentage depletion. The method so elected is applicable not only to the year in question but to all subsequent taxable years.\n We think that petitioner's amended return, filed on March 3, 1936, was not a 'first return' within the meaning \n\n[311 \nU.S. 55, 58]\n\u00a0\n of  114(b)(4). By  53(a)(1) of the 1934 Act, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  53(a)(1), the return was due on or before March 15, 1935. By  53(a)(2) the Commissioner was empowered to grant a reasonable extension for filing returns2 but, so far as applicable here, not exceeding six months. Haggar Co. v. Helvering, \n308 \nU.S. 389\n, 60 S.Ct. 337, would compel the conclusion that had the amended return been filed within the period allowed for filing the original return, it would have been a 'first return' within the meaning of  114(b)(4). But we can find no statutory support for the view that an amendment making the election provided for in that section may be filed as of right after the expiration of the statutory period for filing the original return.\n We are not dealing with an amendment designed merely to correct errors and miscalculations in the original return. Admittedly the Treasury has been liberal in accepting such amended returns even though filed after the period for filing original returns. \n3\n This, however, is not a case where a taxpayer is merely demanding a correct computation of his tax for a prior year based on facts as they existed. Petitioner is seeking by this amendment not only to change the basis upon which its taxable income was computed for 1934 but to adopt a new method of computation for all subsequent years. That opportunity was afforded as a matter of legislative grace; the election had to be made in the manner and in the time prescribed by Congress. The offer was liberal. But the method of its acceptance was restricted. The offer permitted an election only in an original return or in a timely amendment. An amendment for the purposes of  114(b)(4) would be timely only if filed within the \n\n[311 \nU.S. 55, 59]\n\u00a0\n period provided by the statute for filing the original return. No other time limitation would have statutory sanction. To extend the time beyond the limits prescribed in the Act is a legislative not a judicial function.\n Strong practical considerations support this position.\n If petitioner's view were adopted, taxpayers with the benefits of hindsight could shift from one basis of depletion to another in light of developments subsequent to their original choice. It seems clear that Congress provided that the election must be made once and for all in the first return in order to avoid any such shifts. And to require the administrative branch to extend the time for filing on a showing of cause for delay would be to vest in it discretion which the Congress did not see fit to delegate.\n Petitioner urges that this result will produce a hardship here. It stresses the fact that it had no actual knowledge of the new opportunity afforded it by  114(b)(4) of the 1934 Act and that equitable considerations should therefore govern. That may be the basis for an appeal to Congress in amelioration of the strictness of that section. But it is no ground for relief by the courts from the rigors of the statutory choice which Congress has provided.\n Finally, petitioner asserts that we cannot consider the question of the timeliness of the amended return since before the Board of Tax Appeals and the Circuit Court of Appeals respondent urged only that petitioner's claim was based upon an amended, rather than an original, return. But even on the assumption that that issue did not embrace the question of timeliness, the Circuit Court of Appeals was justified in affirming the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals. Where the decision below is correct it must be affirmed by the appellate court though the lower tribunal gave a wrong reason for its action. Helvering v. Gowran, \n302 \nU.S. 238, 245\n, 246 S., 58 S.Ct. 154, 157, 158.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 114(b)(4), 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  114(b)(4), provided: 'The allowance for depletion under section 23(m) shall be, in the case of coal mines, 5 per centum, in the case of metal mines, 15 per centum, and, in the case of sulphur mines or deposits, 23 per centum, of the gross income from the property during the taxable year, excluding from such gross income an amount equal to any rents or royalties paid or incurred by the taxpayer in respect of the property. Such allowance shall not exceed 50 per centum of the net income of the taxpayer (computed without allowance for depletion) from the property. A taxpayer making his first return under this title (chapter) in respect of a property shall state whether he elects to have the depletion allowance for such property for the taxable year for which the return is made computed with or without regard to percentage depletion, and the depletion allowance in respect of such property for such year shall be computed according to the election thus made. If the taxpayer fails to make such statement in the return, the depletion allowance for such property for such year shall be computed without reference to percentage depletion. The method, determined as above, of computing the depletion allowance shall be applied in the case of the property for all taxable years in which it is in the hands of such taxpayer, or of any other person if the basis of the property (for determining gain) in his hands is, under section 113, determined by reference to the basis in the hands of such taxpayer, either directly or through one or more substituted bases, as defined in that section.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See Treasury Regulations No. 86, Arts. 53-1-53-4 inc. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] See, for example, Treasury Regulations No. 86, Art. 43-2, governing the filing of amended returns for the purpose of deducting losses which were sustained during a prior taxable year.

New York Labor Law,  242. Cf. Oklahoma City v. Sanders, 10 Cir., 94 F.2d 323, 328, 115 A.L.R. 363. In this case an injunction was obtained in the federal district court enjoining a city and certain of its officers from enforcing ordinances relating to licenses, bonds and inspections by daily arrests on account of violations of these ordinances by a contractor doing construction work on a low-cost housing project. The decree was affirmed by the circuit court of appeals after consideration of the Act of June 29, 1936, which reads that 'The acquisition by the United States of any real property ... in connection with any low-cost housing ... project ... shall not be held to deprive any State or political subdivision thereof of its civil and criminal jurisdiction in and over such property ....' 40 U.S.C.A.  421. Except as affected by the act just quoted in part, the area was federal territory through a consent statute. The Court, speaking of the recession, said:\n'It was not the purpose that the state should have the right to exert police power there through application of municipal ordinances relating to licenses, bonds, and inspections in the course of construction thereon of buildings by the United States government, no such legislative intent or desire being indicated by the act.'\n\n It also quoted with approval an excerpt from an opinion of the Director, Legal Division, Federal Emergency Administration of Public Works:\n'I am, therefore, of the opinion that the state or local government may not supervise the work of a contractor performing work on property owned by the United States of a contract with the United States.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] \n304 \nU.S. 518, 532\n, 58 S.Ct. 1009, 1016. \n[\nFootnote 18\n] We do not overlook the language in Murray v.

The compensation fund, collected and administered by state officers, was not effective in federal territory. Cf. Atkinson v. State Tax Commission, \n303 \nU.S. 20, 25\n, 58 S.Ct. 419, 421. As the fund was not augmented by assessments against the federal contractor, the Court held the procedural provisions of the state compensation act did not apply. \n[\nFootnote 19\n] Pittman v.

It declared that Section 2 of a Nevada consent statute, Laws Nev. 1935, c. 142, was clearly incompatible with exclusive jurisdiction. The section read:\n'In the erection of such federal building by contract or otherwise, or in case of any subsequent reconstruction or alteration of such building, it is hereby reserved and provided that the state labor laws, the state labor safety laws, and the state health laws shall apply to all persons, firms, associations, or corporations having contracts for such construction or reconstruction as to all provisions contained therein, and no contractor having any such contract shall have the right to claim to be or to declare himself to be a government instrumentality.'\n\n The opinion however further stated:\n'It is to be observed that there is nothing in what has been said concerning Sections 2 and 3 of the Nevada Statute inconsistent with the doctrine that state laws regulating private civil rights (as distinguished from state criminal laws * * continue in force, as laws of the United States, on lands ceded by consent of the state to the United States, if not in conflict with the laws of the new sovereignty or the purpose for which the land is acquired, until superseded by laws enacted by the United States. ... The difficulty with Sections 2 and 3 of the Nevada Act is that they do not merely occupy a vacant field until filled by the Federal Government-they withhold and reserve jurisdiction, present and future, over the matters specified in them, howsoever inconsistent with existing or future laws of the United States. That precludes exclusive jurisdiction from vesting in the United States.' \n\n\n\n\n\n","65":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKALB v. FEUERSTEIN(1940)\nNo. 120\nArgued: December 15, 1939Decided: January 2, 1940\n\n\n\n Mandate Conformed to May 7, 1940\n\n\n See 291 N.W. 840; 291 N.W. 841.\n - \n\n[308 \nU.S. 433, 434]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William Lemke, of Fargo, N.D., and Elmer McClain, of Lima, Ohio, for appellants.\n Messrs. J. Arthur Moran, of Delavan, Wis., and Arthur T. Thorson, of Elkhorn, Wis., for appellees.\n\n\n\n[308 \nU.S. 433, 435]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellants are farmers. Two of appellees, as mortgagees, began foreclosure on appellants' farm1 March 7, 1933, in the Walworth (Wisconsin) County Court; judgment of foreclosure was entered April 21, 1933; July 20, 1935, the sheriff sold the property under the judgment; September 16, 1935, while appellant Ernest Newton Kalb had duly pending2 in the bankruptcy court a petition for \n\n[308 \nU.S. 433, 436]\n\u00a0\n composition and extension of time to pay his debts under section 75 of the Bankruptcy Act (Frazier-Lemke Act),3 the Walworth County Court granted the mortgagees' motion for confirmation of the sheriff's sale; no stay of the foreclosure or of the subsequent action to enforce it was ever sought or granted in the State or bankruptcy court; December 16, 1935, the mortgagees, who had purchased at the sheriff's sale, obtained a writ of assistance from the State court; and March 12, 1936, the sheriff executed the writ by ejecting appellants and their family from the mortgaged farm.\n The questions in both No. 120 and No. 121 are whether the Wisconsin, County Court had jurisdiction, while the petition under the Frazier-Lemke Act was pending in the bankruptcy court, to confirm the sheriff's sale and order appellants dispossessed, and, if it did not, whether its action in the absence of direct appeal is subject to collateral attack. \n No. 120.\n After ejection from their farm, appellants brought an action in equity in the Circuit Court of Walworth County, Wisconsin, against the mortgagees who had purchased at the sheriff's sale, for restoration of possession, for cancellation of the sheriff's deed and for removal of the mortgagees from the farm. Demurrer was sustained for failure to state a cause of action and the complaint was dismissed. The Supreme Court of Wisconsin affirmed. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n No. 121 is a suit at law in the State court by appellant Ernest Newton Kalb against the mortgagees, the sheriff and the County Court judge who confirmed the foreclosure sale and issued the writ of assistance. Damages are sought for conspiracy to deprive appellant of posses- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 433, 437]\n\u00a0\n sion, for assault and battery, and for false imprisonment. As in No. 120, demurrer was sustained, and the Supreme Court of Wisconsin affirmed. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n In its first opinion the Supreme Court of Wisconsin said: 'It is the contention of the plaintiff (mortgagor) that this statute is self executing-that is, that it requires no application to the state or federal court in which foreclosure proceedings are pending for a stay; in other words, that it provides for a statutory and not for a judicial stay. Plaintiff's claims under the Bankruptcy Act present a question which clearly arises under the laws of the United States and therefore present a federal question upon which determination of the federal courts is controlling.' Addressing itself solely to this Federal question of construing the Frazier-Lemke Act, the Wisconsin court decided that the Federal Act did not itself as an automatic statutory stay terminate the State court's jurisdiction when the farmer filed his petition in the bankruptcy court. Since there had been no judicial stay, it held that the confirmation of sale and writ of assistance were not in violation of the Act.\n Appellees insist, however, that the Wisconsin court on rehearing rested its judgment on an adequate non-federal ground. If that were the fact, we would not, under accepted practice, reach the State court's construction of the Federal statute. \n6\n The statement on rehearing relied \n\n[308 \nU.S. 433, 438]\n\u00a0\n on as constituting the non-federal ground was: 'We need not consider nor discuss the question whether the congress has power to divest the jurisdiction of a state court which has once attached. That question is not presented by this record. It would seem from a consideration of sec. 75 as amended, 11 U.S.C.A.  203, that the filing of the petition automatically operated to extend the period of redemption. It is possible that that state of facts if made to appear would make the order of the trial court erroneous but the order would be within the power of the court to make. No appeal having been taken, no showing having been made in the state court, an order of sale having been confirmed and the purchaser put in possession, the plaintiff is in no position to claim that the order of the circuit court is void.'\n But if appellants are right in their contention that the Federal Act of itself, from the moment the petition was filed and so long as it remained pending, operated, in the absence of the bankruptcy court's consent, to oust the jurisdiction of the State court so as to stay its power to proceed with foreclosure, to confirm a sale, and to issue an order ejecting appellants from their farm, the action of the Walworth County Court was not merely erroneous but was beyond its power, void, and subject to collateral attack. And the determination whether the Act did so operate is a construction of that Act and a Federal question.\n It is generally true that a judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction bears a presumption of regularity and is not thereafter subject to collateral attack. \n7\n But Congress, because its power over the subject of bankruptcy \n\n[308 \nU.S. 433, 439]\n\u00a0\n is plenary, may by specific bankruptcy legislation create an exception to that principle and render judicial acts taken with respect to the person or property of a debtor whom the bankruptcy law protects nullities and vulnerable collaterally. \n8\n Although the Walworth County Court had general jurisdiction over foreclosures under the law of Wisconsin,9 a peremptory prohibition by Congress in the exercise of its supreme power over bankruptcy that no State court have jurisdiction over a petitioning farmer- debtor or his property, would have rendered the confirmation of sale and its enforcement beyond the County Court's power and nullities subject to collateral attack. \n10\n The States cannot, in the exercise of control over local laws and practice, vest State courts with power to violate the supreme law of the land. \n11\n The Constitution grants Congress exclusive power to regulate bankruptcy and under this power Congress can limit that jurisdiction which courts, State or Federal, can exercise over the person and property of a debtor who duly invokes the bankruptcy law. If Congress has vested in the bankruptcy courts exclusive jurisdiction over farmer- debtors and their property, and has by its Act withdrawn from all other courts all power under any circumstances to maintain and enforce foreclosure proceedings against them, its Act is the supreme law of the land which all courts-State and Federal-must observe. The wisdom and desirability of an automatic statutory ouster of jurisdiction of all except bankruptcy courts over farmer-debtors and their property were considerations for Congress alone. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 433, 440]\n\u00a0\n We think the language and broad policy of the Frazier-Lemke Act conclusively demonstrate that Congress intended to, and did deprive the Wisconsin County Court of the power and jurisdiction to continue or maintain in any manner the foreclosure proceedings against appellants without the consent after hearing of the bankruptcy court in which the farmer's petition was then pending. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n The Act expressly provided:\n'(n) The filing of a petition ... shall immediately subject the farmer and all his property, wherever located, ... to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court, including ... the right or the equity of redemption where the period of redemption has not or had not expired, ... or where the sale has not or had not been confirmed,' and 'In all cases where, at the time of filing the petition, the period of redemption has not or had not expired, ... or where the sale has not or had not been confirmed, ... the period of redemption shall be extended or the confirmation of sale withheld for the period necessary for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this section'; and\n\n'(o) Except upon petition made to and granted by the judge after hearing and report by the conciliation commissioner, the following proceedings shall not be instituted, or if instituted at any time prior to the filing of a petition under this section, shall not be maintained, in any court or otherwise, against the farmer or his property, at any time after the filing of the petition under this section, and prior to the confirmation or other disposition of the composition or extension proposal by the court: ... \n\n[308 \nU.S. 433, 441]\n\u00a0\n '(2) Proceedings for foreclosure of a mortgage on land, or for cancellation, rescission, or specific performance of an agreement for sale of land or for recovery of possession of land; ...\n\n'(6) Seizure, distress, sale, or other proceedings under an execution or under any lease, lien, chattel mortgage, conditional sale agreement, crop payment agreement, or mortgage.\n\n'(p) The prohibitions ... shall apply to all judicial or official proceedings in any court or under the direction of any official, and shall apply to all creditors, public or private, and to all of the debtor's property, wherever located. All such property shall be under the sole jurisdiction and control of the court in bankruptcy, and subject to the payment of the debtor farmer's creditors, as provided for in (this section) section 75 of this Act.' (Italics supplied.)\n\n Thus Congress repeatedly stated its unequivocal purpose to prohibit- in the absence of consent by the bankruptcy court in which a distressed farmer has a pending petition-a mortgagee or any court from instituting, or maintaining if already instituted, any proceeding against the farmer to sell under mortgage foreclosure, to confirm such a sale, or to dispossess under it.\n This congressional purpose is more apparent in the light of the Frazier-Lemke Act's legislative history. Clarifying and altering the sweeping provisions for exclusive Federal jurisdiction in the original Act, 13 Congress made several important changes in 1935.14 It was then that subsection (p) was amended so that the prohibitions in subsection (o) of any steps against a farmer-debtor or his property once his petition is filed were made specifically applicable 'to all judicial or official proceed- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 433, 442]\n\u00a0\n ings in any court or under the direction of any official, and ... to all creditors, public or private, and to all of the debtor's property, wherever located. All such property shall be under the sole jurisdiction and control of the court in bankruptcy, and subject to the payment of the debtor farmer's creditors, as provided for in (this section) Section 75 ....'\n As stated by the Senate Judiciary Committee in reporting these amendments: '... subsection (n) brings all of the bankrupt's property, wherever located, under the absolute jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court, where it ought to be. Any farmer who takes advantage of this act ought to be willing to surrender all his property to the jurisdiction of the court, for the purpose of paying his debts, and for the sake of uniformity.\n'The amendment to subsection (p) further carries out the amendment to subsection (n), and places the sole jurisdiction of the bankrupt's estate and of his obligations all in the bankruptcy court, without exception.'15\n\n The Congressional purpose is similarly set out in the House Judiciary Committee's Report: 'The amendment to subsection (n) in fact construes, interprets, and clarifies both subsections (n) and (o) of section 75. By reading subsections (n) and (o) as now amended in this bill, it becomes clear that it was the intention of Congress when it passed section 75, that the farmer-debtor and all of his property should come under the jurisdiction of the court of bankruptcy, and that the benefits of the act should extend to the farmer, prior to confirmation of sale, during the period of redemption, and during a moratorium; and that no proceedings after the filing of the petition should be instituted, or if instituted prior to the filing of the petition, should not be maintained in any court, or otherwise.' \n16\n\u00a0\n\n[308 \nU.S. 433, 443]\n\u00a0\n Congress set up in the Act an exclusive and easily accessible statutory means for rehabilitating distressed farmers who, as victims of a general economic depression, were without means to engage in formal court litigation. To this end, a referee or Conciliation Commissioner was provided for every county in which fifteen prospective farmer-debtors requested an appointment; and express provision was made that these Commissioners should 'upon request assist any farmer in preparing and filing a petition under this section and in all matters subsequent thereto arising under this section and farmers shall not be required to be represented by an attorney in any proceeding under this section.' \n17\n In harmony with the general plan of giving the farmer an opportunity for rehabilitation, he was relieved-after filing a petition for composition and extension-of the necessity of litigation elsewhere and its consequent expense. This was accomplished by granting the bankruptcy court exclusive jurisdiction of the petitioning farmer and all his property with complete and self-executing statutory exclusion of all other courts.\n The mortgagees who sought to enforce the mortgage after the petition was duly filed in the bankruptcy court, the Walworth County Court that attempted to grant the mortgagees relief, and the sheriff who enforced the court's judgment, were all acting in violation of the controlling Act of Congress. Because that State court had been deprived of all jurisdiction or power to proceed with the foreclosure, the confirmation of the sale, the execution of the sheriff's deed, the writ of assistance, and the ejection of appellants from their property-to the extent based upon the court's actions-were all without authority of law. Individual responsibility for such unlawful acts must be decided according to the law of the State. We therefore express no opinion as to other contentions based \n\n[308 \nU.S. 433, 444]\n\u00a0\n upon State law and raised by appellees in support of the judgments of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin.\n Congress manifested its intention that the issue of jurisdiction in the foreclosing court need not be contested or even raised by the distressed farmer-debtor. The protection of the farmers was left to the farmers themselves or to the Commissioners who might be laymen, and considerations as to whether the issue of jurisdiction was actually contested in the County Court,18 or whether it could have been contested, 19 are not applicable where the plenary power of Congress over bankruptcy has been exercised as in this Act.\n The judgments in both cases are reversed and the causes are remanded to the Supreme Court of Wisconsin for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In both No. 120 and No. 121, the complaints alleged that appellant Kalb and his wife executed the mortgage.

June 27, 1935, the petition was dismissed, but September 6, 1935, it was reinstated and the order of dismissal was vacated pursuant to the second Frazier-Lemke Act, 11 U.S.C.  203, sub. s(5), 11 U.S.C.A.  203, sub. s(5). \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 11 U.S.C.  203, 11 U.S.C.A.  203. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] 285 N.W. 431. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Demurrer to one count against the sheriff for assault and battery was overruled, but the Supreme Court of Wisconsin reversed as to this count.

George B. Rose and George Rose Smith, both of Little Rock, Ark., for petitioners.\n\n\n\n[309 \nU.S. 485, 487]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Walter G. Riddick, of Little Rock, Ark., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Kersh Lake Drainage District was organized, in 1912, under the general drainage law of Arkansas. \n1\n An assessment of the value of benefits to accrue to each of the tracts of land embraced in the District was duly made, upon the basis of which annual levies were extended against each tract. And the District issued interest bearing certificates of indebtedness in payment of construction work done for it by contract.\n Respondent Johnson, a landowner in the District, brought suit against the District and its Commissioners in the Lincoln Chancery Court of the State of Arkansas in order to establish that he had fully paid the share of benefit taxes apportioned to his land and was therefore entitled under Arkansas law to have his land declared free from any further drainage tax liability. In 1931, that State court rendered its final decree to the effect that the lien of the District for such taxes had already been 'fully satisfied and released', and enjoined further extension of drainage taxes against his lands. In 1932, the same State court rendered a like decree in favor of W. A. Fish and other named landowners of the District. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 485, 488]\n\u00a0\n November 1, 1935, a judgment against the District was obtained by certificate holders in the federal court for the Eastern District of Arkansas. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. \n2\n To enforce their judgment, these creditors then instituted proceedings in the same Federal District Court, for mandatory injunction to require the appropriate County clerks to extend drainage benefit taxes for the District upon their tax books; to require County officials to collect these taxes; and to provide that 'if any property owners fail to pay their drainage tax the defendant, Kersh Lake Drainage District and its Commissioners be required to institute suit for the collection of the delinquent taxes, and to prosecute the same with due diligence to a conclusion, and to see that the delinquent lands are sold promptly under the decree of foreclosure, ....' Answering, the District set up among other defenses that 'a large number of tracts of land in the District have fully paid the entire value of assessed benefits against said lands and that said property owners obtained a decree in the Lincoln Chancery Court in the case of W. A. Fish, et al. v. Kersh Lake Drainage District on June 15, 1932, enjoining and restraining the Commissioners of the defendant District from levying or extending any tax against these lands, the assessed benefits of which have been fully paid.'\n The District Court decreed that a mandatory injunction issue compelling the 'County clerks and County collectors to perform their duties in the collection of the drainage taxes upon the lands in suit'; that there be extended taxes 'of six and one-half per cent of the benefits assessed against each tract of land ... until the whole of the decree has been satisfied'; that the 'Commissioners ... be required to institute suits for the collection of all delinquent taxes of said District, and to prosecute the same forthwith to a conclusion, ...'; and \n\n[309 \nU.S. 485, 489]\n\u00a0\n that 'the said Commissioners are deemed receivers of this court ....' And the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Pursuant to this mandatory injunction, the drainage taxes were extended on the tax books but respondent Johnson and other landowners in whose favor the decrees of the Lincoln Chancery Court had been rendered, refused to pay. Suit for collection was filed against their lands in the Lincoln Chancery Court by the Commissioners. In reliance upon the 1931 and 1932 State Chancery Court decrees as final determinations that the assessments apportioned to their respective tracts of lands had been discharged, pleas of res judicata were interposed by the landowners. Referring to this answer of the landowners, the Commissioners amended their complaint and alleged (1) that the State court decrees of 1931 and 1932 were void because certificate holders had not been made parties, and ( 2) that the certificate holders' judgment against the District and the mandatory injunction decree of the federal court were 'res judicata of all the questions ... raised by the' landowners. The trial court decided against the landowners, but the Supreme Court of Arkansas reversed and held that the unappealed Chancery Court decrees in 1931 and 1932 amounted to conclusive adjudications that the particular lands here involved were responsible for no further benefit taxes, thus sustaining the landowners' pleas of res judicata. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n As stated by the Supreme Court of Arkansas, the general jurisdiction of the Lincoln Chancery Court, under the State law, to render the 1931 and 1932 decrees is 'acknowledged',5 and this determination by the State's highest court is binding upon us. However, petitioners' argu- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 485, 490]\n\u00a0\n ment is that these decrees were void because certificate holders were not made parties in and had no notice of the chancery proceedings. Therefore, they contend that in giving effect to the State court decrees and treating them as res judicata in the present proceeding the court below deprived certificate holders of their property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. 6 Petitioners also add the contention that the 1932 State court decree was 'collusive as a matter of law.'\n Although the Drainage District was not in terms legislatively declared to be a corporation, its powers and limitations were similar to those of corporations and its Commissioners were comparable to corporate directors. \n7\n Among the duties of the Commissioners-as provided by the very statute upon which the certificates involved here rest-were those of protecting and enforcing creditors' rights on obligations issued by the District. \n8\n And the Commissioners in 1931 and 1932 litigated with the land owners the disputed question of proportionate amounts of taxes due the District by virtue of drainage benefits received by the particular tracts here in question. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 485, 491]\n\u00a0\n When these certificates were issued, purchasers were charged with notice of and bound by Arkansas statutes in existence when, and pursuant to which, the debt was contracted and which provided for determination of the proportionate liabilities of lands in the District by chancery proceedings between the Commissioners and landowners with no requirement of notice to creditors of the District. \n9\n Thus, the very statutory plan from which the certificate obligations sprang contemplated that the Commissioners should represent the collective and corporate interests of the District, in litigation between the District and the landowner involving matters personal to the landowner.\n These certificate holders were not entitled to be made parties in the Lincoln chancery proceedings just as in practice creditors of a corporation are not, unless otherwise provided by statute, made parties in a suit between a stockholder and the corporation to determine liability on a stock subscription, between the corporation and a third person to recover corporate assets, or in a suit brought against the corporation by creditors, stockholders or officers. It has been held that bondholders are not necessary parties to and are bound by the decree-even if adverse to their interests-in litigation wherein an indenture trustee under a bond issue is a party and exercises in good faith and without neglect his contractual authority to represent and assert the lien securing the issue. 10 And so are these petitioners bound by the decrees in the chancery suit in which the Commissioners as parties appropriately asserted the lien for benefit of certificate holders-unless there was fraud or collusion. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 485, 492]\n\u00a0\n It is sufficient to state as to this contention that the issues of fraud and collusion raise no questions which the Supreme Court of Arkansas was not competent finally to decide. And the Supreme Court of Arkansas points out that under controlling Arkansas law the chancery decrees 'could only have been set aside on appeal or by direct action to annul them on the ground of fraud, and as we have said no appeals were taken, and no fraud on the court in which the decrees were rendered, is reflected by this record.' \n11\n\u00a0\n\n But petitioners nevertheless insist that the State court's chancery decrees cannot avail the landowners because of the subsequent judgments of the Federal District Court.\nSecond. The Judgments of the Federal District Court.\n Petitioners pleaded the final judgments of the Federal District Court as conclusive adjudications of the issues raised by the landowners' defense based upon the chancery decrees. The refusal of the court below to accept the District Court's judgments as determinative of the individual landowners' liabilities constituted, petitioners claim, a denial of full faith and credit to those federal judgments. With this contention we do not agree.\n In order that the District might be afforded a basis for suits in the State courts to recover taxes with which to pay the judgment against it, the District Court ordered a mandatory injunction requiring County officials to extend on their books drainage taxes against all the lands in the District as a whole, including those here involved. This preliminary to State court suits in which the actual respective liabilities of the individual landowners could be determined was performed, and thereby this provision of the injunction was carried out. The Commissioners were also enjoined to file and prosecute suits in the State \n\n[309 \nU.S. 485, 493]\n\u00a0\n courts to collect all such taxes that were delinquent. This was done. Irrespective of whether the District was empowered to represent the landowners when the extension of taxes as a whole was ordered, by its mandatory injunction the District Court did not attempt to foreclose the State court from hearing all matters of personal defense which individual landowners might plead in the suits for collection. Instead, the District Court appropriately left for the State court's determination any such personal defenses available under Arkansas law. \n12\n And here the Supreme Court of Arkansas has sustained as personal defenses the decrees of payment and discharge obtained by individual landowners in Arkansas courts of competent jurisdiction. Accordingly, petitioners misconstrue entirely the decree of the District Court in arguing that unless its injunction is carried out without any reference to the prior State court decrees, injunctions by a State court will be permitted to obstruct the execution of a federal court's judgment. \n13\n In view of our construction of the mandatory injunction and the fact that its mandates have been fully carried out, it is unnecessary for us to consider the existence or present vitality of the doctrine said to be established by the cases relied upon by petitioners. \n14\n\u00a0\n\n The substantial effect of the District Court's judgments was no more than a determination that a total balance was still due the complaining certificate holders by the District; that drainage taxes sufficient to discharge this \n\n[309 \nU.S. 485, 494]\n\u00a0\n balance should be extended on the proper County tax books in accordance with Arkansas law; and that suits against individual landowners be filed for judicial ascertainment of their proportionate shares of the total. Neither the adjudication of the total liability nor the order for extension of drainage taxes on the local tax books was an adjudication of the varying proportionate liabilities of the respective landowners. Determination of these liabilities was properly left for the State court. A decreed total liability for the District was still consistent with the principle that 'when the proportion (taxable against a particular tract) is ascertained and paid, it is no longer or further liable. It is discharged. The residue of the tax is to be obtained from other sources.' \n 15\n\u00a0\n\n These landowners were neither served with process nor heard in either the certificate holders' suit against the District or the mandatory injunction proceeding. No relief against them as individuals was either sought or adjudged. The Commissioners did represent all landowners in unsuccessfully defending the certificate holders' suit for an adjudication of the total collective corporate obligation of the District as an entity. In the present suit the landowners have not asserted, and the Supreme Court of Arkansas has not upheld, any attack upon that judgment, which might be valid although uncollectible against the District or any individual landowners. \n16\n The fact that the Commissioners, in the injunction proceedings against the District, unsuccessfully attempted to interpose defenses peculiar and personal to the individual landowners cannot foreclose the individual landowners, who were not present, from thereafter pleading a defense otherwise valid. Certainly, the decree in the injunction suit in the federal court would not prevent an individual property owner from subsequently interposing the de- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 485, 495]\n\u00a0\n fense that his property was not in fact included within the Drainage District. \n17\n Cognate personal defenses, such as the one that a landowner's proportionate drainage tax liability has been declared by the judgment of a competent tribunal to have been 'ascertained and paid', were not foreclosed by the Federal District Court's judgments.\n The judgments of the federal court were not denied full faith and credit by the Supreme Court of Arkansas.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS took no part in the decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Acts of Ark.1909, p. 829. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Kersh Lake Drainage Dist. v.

Edward W. Kelsey, Jr., and Fred A. Smith, both of Toledo, Ohio, and Charles J. Faulkner, Jr., of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondents, Armour & Company, a Kentucky corporation, by petition obtained from the Circuit Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit, Armour & Co. v. Kloeb, 109 F.2d 72, 74, an order directing the U.S. District Judge, Northern District of Ohio, to set aside the remands of five separate actions. The opinion of the Court made the following statement concerning the basic issue:\n'A number of persons, including George E. Kniess, brought suit against Armour and Company in the Court of Common Pleas of Lucas County for damages claimed to have been suffered in the consumption of food products, materials for which were prepared by Armour and Company, but which were processed by a retailer in Toledo by the name of Burmeister. In each of the five cases, and upon identical petitions, the plaintiffs joined Burmeister as a defendant on the theory that he and the Armour Company were joint tort-feasors. Armour and Company filed its petitions for removal with the Court of Common Pleas accompanied by proper removal bonds. Its petitions were contested by the plaintiffs and were denied. The Kniess case proceeded to trial while the other cases were held in abeyance and it eventually reached the Supreme Court of Ohio, Kniess v. Armour & Co ., 134 Ohio St. 432, 17 N.E.2d 734, 119 A.L.R. 1348. That court disposed of the case upon the sole ground that the removal petition should have been allowed, because a separable controversy existed as between plaintiff \n\n[311 \nU.S. 199, 201]\n\u00a0\n and Armour. It stated the law of Ohio to be that where the responsibility of two tort-feasors differs in degree and in nature, liability cannot be joint and the alleged torts are not concurrent. Holding that the defendant Armour and Company had adequately preserved its exceptions to the ruling of the lower court, the cause was reversed and remanded to the Court of Common Pleas with instructions to grant the removal petition, and the mandate directed the Court of Common Pleas to remove the cause to the District Court of the United States.\n\n'When the case came before the respondent the plaintiff moved to remand and, notwithstanding the adjudication by the Ohio Supreme Court which had become final, the respondent proceeded to take evidence upon the question of a separable controversy, decided there was none, that the cause was not removable under the statute, entered an order to remand the case to the Court of Common Pleas of Lucas County, and denied petitions for rehearing.'\n\n The District Judge rendered no opinion to support his actions; but responding to the rule from the Circuit Court of Appeals to show cause, he cited McNutt v. General Motors Acceptance Corporation, \n298 \nU.S. 178\n, 56 S. Ct. 780, referred to affidavits filed in support of the motions and said that upon consideration of the entire record, he became satisfied that none of the five suits 'really and substantially involved a dispute or separable controversy wholly between citizens of different states which could be fully determined as between them, and therefore none of said causes were within the jurisdiction of the District Court of the United States, and further that plaintiff Kniess is an alien.'\n Title 28, U.S.Code, 28 U.S.C.A.  71, 80, provides-\n'Section 71. ... Whenever any cause shall be removed from any State court into any district court of the United \n\n[311 \nU.S. 199, 202]\n\u00a0\n States, and the district court shall decide that the cause was improperly removed, and order the same to be remanded to the State court from whence it came, such remand shall be immediately carried into execution, and no appeal or writ of error from the decision of the district court so remanding such cause shall be allowed.'\n\n'Section 80. If in any suit commenced in a district court, or removed from a State court to a district court of the United States, it shall appear to the satisfaction of the said district court, at any time after such suit has been brought or removed thereto, that such suit does not really and substantially involve a dispute or controversy properly within the jurisdiction of said district court, or that the parties to said suit have been improperly or collusively made or joined, either as plaintiffs or defendants, for the purpose of creating a case cognizable or removable under this chapter, the said district court shall proceed no further therein, but shall dismiss the suit or remand it to the court from which it was removed, as justice may require, and shall make such order as to costs as shall be just.'\n\n Employers Reinsurance Corporation v. Bryant, \n299 \nU.S. 374, 380\n, 381 S., 57 S.Ct. 273, 276, says of these sections: 'They are in pari materia, are to be construed accordingly rather than as distinct enactments, and, when so construed, show, as was held in Morey v. Lockhart, \n123 \nU.S. 56, 58\n, 8 S.Ct. 65, that they are intended to reach and include all cases removed from a state court into a federal court and remanded by the latter.'\n The Court below concluded: 'The District Court had no power to determine the issue of separable controversy entitling the petitioner to remove because that issue had already been adjudicated by the Supreme Court of Ohio, and the District Court, upon familiar principles, was bound by such adjudication.' \n\n[311 \nU.S. 199, 203]\n\u00a0\n And it said-'It would seem that in the use in Section 71 of the words 'the district court shall decide,' and in the employment in Section 80 of the phrase 'it shall appear to the satisfaction of the said district court,' it was within the contemplation of the Congress that the statute should apply to those cases in which there was some issue which, as a matter of primary decision, was submitted to the District Judge. It certainly could not have been intended to apply to decision of a question which was not properly at issue before the District Judge since it had already been adjudicated by the Supreme Court of Ohio in the same proceeding, between the same parties, and upon the plaintiff's petition. To hold otherwise would be to permit the District Court to defy the statute 28 U.S.C.A.  687, which provides: 'The records and judicial proceedings of the courts of any State ... shall have such faith and credit given to them in every court within the United States as they have by law or usage in the courts of the State from which they are taken.\"\n Also-'The decisions in Employers Reinsurance Corporation v. Bryant, District Judge, supra, and in Re Pennsylvania Company, supra (\n137 \nU.S. 451\n, 11 S.Ct. 141), must not, in our judgment, be extended beyond the situations requiring the application of the rule there announced, that is to say, to cases where the issue of the petition to remand called for original and primary decision by the District Court unfettered by the doctrine of res judicata or the mandate of the 'full faith and credit' statute. ...\n'That the decision of the Ohio Court was res judicata notwithstanding the issue was one involving the jurisdiction of a federal Court, is settled by American Surety Co. v. Baldwin, \n287 \nU.S. 156\n, 53 S.Ct. 98, 86 A.L.R. 298; Baldwin v. Iowa State Traveling Men's Ass'n, \n283 \nU.S. 522\n, 51 S.Ct. 517, and the decision in Evelyn Treinies, Petitioner, v.

(85), announced as recently as November 6, 1939\n\n\n\n'While the precise question here involved is one of first impression, the Supreme Court in Re Metropolitan Trust Company, \n218 \nU.S. 312\n, 31 S.Ct. 18, has drawn the distinctions between orders to remand erroneously issued and those issued by a District Judge in excess of his authority. The former may not be challenged by appeal or writ of mandamus- the latter are a nullity. We think it follows that under general supervisory powers they may be set aside.'\n\n We cannot accept the conclusion of the Circuit Court of Appeals. It derives from an inadequate appraisal of the record and of sections 71 and 80 U.S.Code, supra, 28 U.S.C.A.  71, 80.\n These sections were designed to limit possible review of orders remanding causes and thus prevent delay. In re Pennsylvania Co., \n137 \nU.S. 451, 454\n, 11 S.Ct. 141, 142. They entrust determination concerning such matter to the informed judicial discretion of the district court and cut off review.\n In this cause the district judge weighed the petitions and relevant affidavits and concluded that the controversy was not within the jurisdiction of that court. His clear duty was to proceed no further and to dismiss or remand the causes. The statute exempted his action from review.\n The suggestion that the federal district court had no power to consider the entire record and pass upon the question of separability, because this point had been finally settled by the Supreme Court of Ohio, finds no adequate support in the cases cited by the opinion below: Baldwin v. Iowa State Traveling Men's Association, \n283 \nU.S. 522\n, 51 S.Ct. 517, American Surety Company v. Baldwin, \n287 \nU.S. 156\n, 53 S.Ct. 98, 86 A.L.R. 298 and Treinies v. Sunshine Mining Company, \n308 \nU.S. 66\n, 60 S.Ct. 44. None of these causes involved a situation comparable to the one here presented. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 199, 205]\n\u00a0\n Section 72, Title 28, U.S.Code, 28 U.S.C.A.  72, provides the requisites for removing causes from state to federal courts and directs that when complied with, the state court shall proceed no further. The Supreme Court of Ohio declared (134 Ohio St. 432, 17 N.E.2d 737, 119 A.L.R. 1348.): 'In passing upon the question of removal, unfortunately we are limited solely to a consideration of the facts stated in the petition.' It held that upon them the trial court should have relinquished jurisdiction.\n The causes went to the federal district court and additional facts were there presented. As required by the statute, that court considered all the relevant facts, petitions and affidavits, exercised its discretion and ordered the remands. Jurisdiction to decide, we think, is clear; the Circuit Court of Appeals lacked power to review the remand.\n The challenged order must be reversed.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","68":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nL.

Said market is now and for a long period of time has been served by existing transportation facilities of various trunk line railroads, and said existing transportation facilities are suitable, convenient and adequate to meet the requirements of the market. The market is easily accessible to its customers through the facilities of said railroads and also by the use of streets and hard-surfaced highways radiating in every direction therefrom.'\n Answering, the respondent alleged that petitioners were not parties 'in interest' within Paragraph 20, Sec. 402, Transportation Act and had no right to sue. The District Court sustained this defense and dismissed the bill. Upon appeal its action was affirmed. The matter is here by certiorari.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, 8 Cir., 109 F.2d 493, 495, made the following summation of the bill-'The complaint of the plaintiffs shows that they are commission merchants doing business on the Kansas City, Missouri, produce market, an old and well-estab- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 295, 299]\n\u00a0\n lished market which adequately serves the consuming public in its vicinity and receives produce from, and ships produce to, other states; that Kansas City, Missouri, is now engaged in constructing new market buildings for this market at a cost of about $500,000; that the market has suitable and adequate transportation facilities of all kinds; that the adjoining city of Kansas City, Kansas, proposes to build and is building a 'food Terminal' or produce market on a tract of land which it owns, at a cost of about $4,000,000, of which $1,710,000 is a grant from the Public Works Administration of the United States, and that the balance of the necessary funds will be procured by a sale of the City's bonds to the defendant railroad company; that the defendant proposes, at an expense of some $500, 000, to furnish trackage to serve this Kansas City, Kansas, market; that this trackage constitutes an extension of the defendant's lines of railroad, for the construction of which it has procured no certificate of convenience and necessity from the Interstate Commerce Commission as required by law; that the construction and operation of the proposed extension in Kansas City, Kansas, will adversely affect and will destroy the business and properties of the plaintiffs and the large investments which they have made in and adjacent to the Kansas City, Missouri, produce market; that it will create an unnecessary and uncalled for rival market at an inconvenient place without creating any more produce to be handled or any more customers to be served; that it will result in the unnecessary duplication of railroad facilities at a cost of $500,000 without increasing the amount of freight to be handled; that it will divert traffic from other railroads which are now adequately handling the traffic to the Kansas City, Missouri, produce market, and will cause destructive competition between the defendant and other railroads and will cause a wasteful and needless expendi- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 295, 300]\n\u00a0\n ture of money by the defendant; that 'for each and all of the reasons aforesaid, the construction and operation, or the construction, or the operation of the said extension or extensions of railroad by the defendant to said proposed produce market in Kansas City, Kansas, will directly and adversely affect the property interests of the plaintiffs and the public generally by bringing about a material change in the transportation situation, and will constitute an unnecessary burden upon interstate commerce, directly and adversely affecting the welfare of plaintiffs and the public interest.\"\n It is not alleged that the respondent has ever served the produce market in Kansas City, Missouri, or that petitioners make or receive shipments over its lines or that the proposed extension will deprive them of any shipping facilities. Evidently the real purpose was to obstruct construction of a competitor and the theory upon which the proceeding rests would permit petitioners to sue if any railroad should extend its lines to any market competing with the market at Kansas City, Missouri.\n Concerning the purport of the allegations of the bill, the Circuit Court of Appeals rightly said: 'It is obvious that the only basis for the plaintiffs' claim that the alleged extension of the lines of the defendant to the Kansas City, Kansas, market will particularly injure them is that they do business upon the Kansas City, Missouri, market, and that if the proposed rival market in Kansas City, Kansas, functions, it will divert business from the market upon which they operate and will thus hurt them, their business, and their investments in Kansas City, Missouri, and that, since the proposed extension of its tracks by the defendant is necessary to enable the rival market to function, such extension will therefore injure the plaintiffs. It seems equally obvious that, except for the fact that the pro- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 295, 301]\n\u00a0\n posed extension is essential to the operation of the rival market in Kansas, it could not possibly have any direct or immediate effect upon the plaintiffs, their property or their business in Missouri, other than the effect which a wasteful expenditure by the defendant of its money would have upon the public generally. The proximate cause of the injury to the plaintiffs will be the competition created by the construction and operation of the rival market, and not the construction or operation of the transportation facilities furnished to it by the defendant or by others engaged in the transportation business.'\n It declared that the question whether petitioners were 'parties in interest' within Paragraph 20 must be determined upon consideration of Western Pacific California R. Co. v. Southern Pacific, \n284 \nU.S. 47\n, 52 S. Ct. 56, and concluded-'The plaintiffs have no definite legal right which is threatened. They are, however, persons whose welfare may be adversely affected by the bringing about of a material change in the transportation situation, in the sense that the extension proposed by the defendant, if built and operated, will enable a competitive market to function to their detriment. In that sense, we think it may safely be said that the proposed extension of defendant's lines may adversely affect the plaintiffs' welfare. We are of the opinion, however, that their complaint discloses that their welfare cannot be directly, but only indirectly and consequentially, affected by the proposed extension. They are not in competition with the defendant. They are not engaged in the transportation business. Their only peculiar interest in that business is in the effect which changes in it may have upon the market where they do business and upon rival markets now or hereafter established in the territory which the plaintiffs serve. ... We conclude that the statute is not to be so liberally construed as to enable \n\n[311 \nU.S. 295, 302]\n\u00a0\n those who fear adverse effects upon their business from the establishment of competitive enterprises requiring transportation facilities, to maintain suits to enjoin railroads from constructing what are claimed to be unauthorized extensions to serve such enterprises.'\n A dissenting opinion by Judge Stone likewise relied upon Western Pacific California Railroad Co. v. Southern Pacific Company, but took the view that the challenged action might directly and substantially affect petitioners' welfare since their financial interests would suffer from the proposed rival market which could not come into existence without the proposed extension.\n The purpose and effect of paragraphs 18, 20 and 21 were much considered in Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Ry. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 266\n, 46 S.Ct. 263, and Western Pacific California Railroad Co. v. Southern Pacific Company, \n284 \nU.S. 47\n, 52 S.Ct. 56.\n In the first of these causes a railroad sought to prevent another from building an extension. The meaning of the term 'party in interest' was not discussed. But the opinion asserts that by the Transportation Act of 1920, 'Congress undertook to develop and maintain, for the people of the United States, an adequate railway system. It recognized that preservation of the earning capacity, and conservation of the financial resources, of individual carriers, is a matter of national concern; that the property employed must be permitted to earn a reasonable return; that the building of unnecessary lines involves a waste of resources, and that the burden of this waste may fall upon the public; that competition between carriers may result in harm to the public, as well as in benefit; and that, when a railroad inflicts injury upon its rival, it may be the public which ultimately bears the loss.' (\n270 \nU.S. 266\n, 46 S.Ct. 266.)\n Also 'the prohibition of paragraph 18 is absolute. If the proposed track is an extension, and no certificate has \n\n[311 \nU.S. 295, 303]\n\u00a0\n been obtained, the party in interest opposing construction is entitled as of right to an injunction.'\n In the second cause, (\n284 \nU.S. 47\n, 52 S.Ct. 57), it was claimed that the Western Pacific was not a 'party in interest' within the statute. The Circuit Court of Appeals, 9 Cir., 46 F.2d 729, accepted that view; we concluded otherwise but did not undertake to announce an inclusive and exclusive definition of the term. The circumstances disclosed a special interest in that complainant with probability of direct loss from what the defendant-not another-proposed to do. The portion of the opinion, presently specially important, follows-'If, as the court below seems to have assumed, a 'party in interest' must possess some clear legal right for which it might ask protection under the rules commonly accepted by courts of equity, the paragraphs under consideration would not materially aid the Congressional plan for promoting transportation. On the other hand, there was no purpose to permit any individual so inclined to institute such a proceeding. The complaint must possess something more than a common concern for obedience to law. See Massachusetts v. Mellon, \n262 \nU.S. 447, 488\n, 43 S.Ct. 597 (601). It will suffice, we think, if the bill discloses that some definite legal right possessed by complainant is seriously threatened, or that the unauthorized and therefore unlawful action of the defendant carrier may directly and adversely affect the complainant's welfare by bringing about some material change in the transportation situation.'\n The Transportation Act, 1920 was designed to protect the public against action which might endanger its interest. In order to aid that general purpose, Paragraph 20, Section 402, provides that suit for an injunction may be instituted by the United States, the Commission (I.C.C.), any Commission or Regulative Body of the state or states affected, or any 'party in interest.' Such \n\n[311 \nU.S. 295, 304]\n\u00a0\n a suit cannot be instituted by an individual unless he 'possesses something more than a common concern for obedience to law.' The general or common interest finds protection in the permission to sue granted to public authorities. An individual may have some special and peculiar interest which may be directly and materially affected by alleged unlawful action. See Detroit & M. Ry. v. Boyne City, etc., Co., D.C., 286 F. 540. If such circumstances are shown he may sue; he is then 'party in interest' within the meaning of the statute. In the absence of these circumstances he is not such a party.\n We cannot think Congress supposed that the development and maintenance of an adequate railway system would be aided by permitting any person engaged in business within or adjacent to a public market to demand an injunction against a carrier seeking only to serve a competing market by means of an extension not authorized by the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n The right to sue under the statute is individual. Petitioners are not helped by uniting.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals after reviewing all the facts reached the conclusion that the welfare of petitioners could only by indirectly and consequentially affected by the proposed extension; that their interest in the transportation situation 'is in the effect which changes in it may have upon the market where they do business and upon rival markets now or hereafter established in the territory which the plaintiffs serve.' It held this was not enough. We agree. A mere extension to the plant of a competitor which in no other way affects the complaining parties in no proper sense brings about a material change in the transportation system directly affecting their peculiar interest which they have the right to prevent by suit.\n The challenged judgment must be affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n Kansas City, Mo. v. L. Singer & Sons et al. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 295, 305]\n\u00a0\n\n No. 35.\n\n The City of Kansas City, Missouri, sought to intervene in No. 34. The District Court denied its motion. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. In view of what we have decided in No. 34 this denial necessarily must be affirmed.\n Affirmed.\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER.\n I quite agree with my Brother STONE that unfair loss may be cast upon a community by the unjustified extension of a railroad line, and that such loss is one consequence of the evils of unregulated railroad building which the Transportation Act was intended to check. But our immediate problem is to determine how a community can challenge such a proposed improper extension. Can a city, in other words, come into a Federal Court and urge its special relation to an alleged violation of  1(18-22), of the Transportation Act, 1920, 41 Stat. 456, 477, 49 U.S.C.  1(18-22), 49 U.S.C.A.  1(18-22)? The answer, of course, depends on the scheme of enforcement that Congress has devised for the Act. After making administrative provisions for securing a certificate from the Interstate Commerce Commission as a prerequisite to the construction of an 'extension', the Act subjects any construction in violation of its licensing system to an injunction 'at the suit of the United States, the commission, any commission or regulating body of the State or States affected, or any party in interest'.  1(20).\n A city deeming itself adversely affected by a proposed illegal extension would naturally turn to its state commission to assert its interests. If, for any reason, the state agency does not employ its power under  1(20) on behalf of the city's claims, the latter can invoke the law-enforcing authority of the Interstate Commerce Commission and also enlist the power of the Attorney General to initiate litigation. It is reading  1(20) \n\n[311 \nU.S. 295, 306]\n\u00a0\n without illumination of the scheme and purposes of the Transportation Act to expand the categories of public agencies explicitly named by Congress for enforcing  1(18) by including a city as a 'party in interest'. To do so would disregard recognition of a state utility commission as the special repository of all the interests of a state in this particular field, and of the Interstate Commerce Commission as the national organ for enforcing the body of interstate commerce acts. Clearly, therefore, Kansas City can not be deemed a 'party in interest' for the litigious purposes of that phrase in  1(20).\n But it would indeed be strange to find that while the city was not given power to resort to a court, a private and more limited sufferer from the same economic threat may have such legal standing. Such a paradox exposes the appropriate scope of 'party in interest' in  1(20). The guiding considerations in the application of that section are to be found in the reach of the functions of the Interstate Commerce Commission and of its state analogues. They are relied on for the enforcement of railroad legislation neither grudgingly nor with scepticism. In these agencies are lodged the resources for compounding the manifold ingredients of 'the public interest'. To entrust the vindication of this public interest to a private litigant professing a special stake in the public interest is to impinge on the responsibility of the public authorities designated by Congress. If there be insufficient assurance that unlawful railroad construction will be resisted by a state commission representing all the interests of a state that are affected, the Interstate Commerce Commission may be moved to enjoin illegality.\n Who then is a 'party in interest'? As a part of the very system through which the national policy is to be achieved, a railroad has been deemed by this Court a 'party in interest' to effectuate the railroad policy intro- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 295, 307]\n\u00a0\n duced by the licensing system of the Transportation Act. Texas & Pac. Ry. v. Gulf, etc., Ry., \n270 \nU.S. 266, 277\n, 46 S.Ct. 263, 266; Western Pacific California R. Co. v. Southern Pac. Co., \n284 \nU.S. 47\n, 52 S. Ct. 56. And one who in a proceeding initiated before the Interstate Commerce Commission has been treated by it as a party to the litigation, cf. Los Angeles Passenger Terminal Cases, 100 I.C.C. 421; Id., 142 I.C.C. 489; Atchison Ry. v. Railroad Comm., \n283 \nU.S. 380, 393\n, 394 S., 51 S.Ct. 553, 556, 557, may perhaps be deemed a 'party in interest' in the further pursuit of claims before a court after adverse action by the Commission. Compare Interstate Commerce Comm. v. Oregon- Washington R.R., \n288 \nU.S. 14\n, 53 S.Ct. 266 and Federal Communications Commission v. Sanders Radio Station, \n309 \nU.S. 470\n, 60 S.Ct. 693. But to allow any private interest to thresh out the complicated questions that arise out of  1(18-22)1-as, for instance, whether a proposed construction is an 'extension' or a 'spur', compare Texas & Pac. Ry. v. Gulf, etc., Ry., \n270 \nU.S. 266\n, 46 S.Ct. 263-is to invite dislocation of the scheme which Congress has devised for the expert conduct of the litigation of such issues. \n2\n It also would put upon the district courts the task of drawing fine lines in determining when a private claim is so special that it may be set apart from the general public interest and give the claimant power to litigate a public controversy. These inquiries are so harassing and unprofitable as to be avoided, unless Congress has explicitly cast the duty upon the courts. Against any such implication, in the absence of rather plain language, the whole course of \n\n[311 \nU.S. 295, 308]\n\u00a0\n federal railroad legislation and the relation of the Interstate Commerce Commission to it admonishes. The interests of merely private concerns are amply protected even though they must be channelled through the Attorney General or the Interstate Commerce Commission or a state commission.\n Therefore, the court below made proper dispositions of these cases.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS, Mr. Justice BLACK, Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, and Mr. Justice MURPHY having concurred in the Court's opinion, also join in these views.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE (dissenting).\n I think that the complainants, petitioners in No. 34, are proper parties to maintain this suit, that the decree should be reversed and, on the remand, the petition of Kansas City for intervention should be considered in light of that conclusion and of  212 and 213 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  45a, 28 U.S.C.A.  45a, and of Rule 24 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c.\n On the pleadings it stands conceded that the proposed extension of respondent's line is unauthorized and unlawful, and the sole question we have to decide is whether the interests of petitioners in maintaining this suit, as disclosed by their pleadings, satisfies the requirement of the statute which authorizes it to be brought by 'any party in interest'.\n Section 1(18) of the Transportation Act of 1920, 41 Stat. 474, 477, 49 U.S.C.  1(18), 49 U.S.C.A.  1(18), forbids the extension of its line by a railroad without a certificate of the Interstate Commerce Commission that 'the present or future public convenience and necessity require or will require' the construction of the extension. Similarly it prohibits the abandonment of any portion of a line of railroad without a like certificate permitting the abandon- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 295, 309]\n\u00a0\n ment. Section 1(19) requires the Commission to give notice of application for a certificate to the governor of the state in which the proposed extension is to be constructed and to public the notice in each county through which the line of railroad is constructed or operated. By  1(20) the Commission is authorized to attach to its certificate such 'conditions as in its judgment the public convenience and necessity may require', and authorizes any court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin the prohibited construction or abandonment 'at the suit of the United States, the Commission, any commission or regulation body of the State or States affected, or any party in interest; ....' By  1(22) spur, industrial, side tracks and the like are excluded from the authority of the Commission and the railroad may build them without applying for a certificate.\n The interest of petitioners in maintaining the suit as shown by the pleadings is derived from the injury to the public which, it is specifically alleged, will result from the proposed extension through the injury to the community in Kansas City, Missouri, and vicinity, of which community petitioners are a part and in which they are property owners, and the consequent injury alleged to affect them individually. The public injury, it is alleged, will be caused by (a) the loss or serious impairment in utility of the Kansas City public produce market and the destruction or serious diminution of values of property and business and of financial investments in and about the market, which will be brought about by the extension, through the creation of a rival market and the diversion of traffic to it at a point in Kansas City, Kansas, far removed from the center of population of Kansas City, Missouri, and to the inconvenience of the great majority of the citizens of both cities who are served by the existing market, which is adequate to the needs of the community; (b) by the \n\n[311 \nU.S. 295, 310]\n\u00a0\n unnecessary duplication of railroad facilities in the Kansas City district at large cost, with wasteful and needless expenditures by respondent and no increase in freight to be handled; and (c) by the diversion of traffic to respondent railroad from other railroads and destructive competition between the railroads operating in the vicinity.\n Special injury is shown to complainants (petitioners in No. 34) by the allegations that they are owners of business property and investments in the existing market area and vicinity, and that their property will be reduced in value in consequence of the diversion of traffic to the rival market. The petitioner, Kansas City, Missouri, in intervention, in No. 35, alleges the like injury to the public which it represents and sets up specifically the threatened loss in value and utility of a large public market structure which it is now building at great cost, and the threatened loss to it of taxes through diminution in property values in the city.\n The statute does not define the 'parties in interest' whom it permits to sue to restrain an unauthorized extension. It cannot be assumed that the phrase is meaningless or that the statute should be read as though the words were omitted. Obviously the parties intended must have, as do petitioners, an interest in the outcome of the litigation other than the 'common concern for obedience to law'. See Massachusetts v. Mellon, \n262 \nU.S. 447, 488\n, 43 S.Ct. 597, 601. And as the language of the statute plainly indicates, and as we have held, they may be, as are petitioners, others than the public bodies named in the statute as appropriate plaintiffs. Atchison Ry. v. Railroad Commission, \n283 \nU.S. 380, 393\n, 394 S., 51 S.Ct. 553, 556, 557. And they may maintain the suit although the injury which they allege is not strictly an actionable wrong independently of the paragraphs in question. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 295, 311]\n\u00a0\n Western Pacific R. Co. v. Southern Pacific Co., \n284 \nU.S. 47\n, 52 S.Ct. 56.\n The statute draws no distinction between direct and indirect injury as the test of plaintiff's interest. Nor is any reason advanced for saying that his interest is more significant because the injury which he suffers is labeled 'direct' rather than 'indirect.' In any case that suffered by petitioners does not seem to be any the less direct than that which an extension may inflict upon a competing railroad which admittedly may sue to enjoin it. Western Pacific California R. Co. v. Southern Pacific Co., supra; cf. Claiborne-Annapolis Ferry Co. v. United States, \n285 \nU.S. 382\n, 52 S.Ct. 440. If the statute imposes any requirements other than those indicated by the phrase 'party in interest', they must be implied from the purposes of the statute, its context, and from the reasons for permitting others than the public bodies named in it to bring the suit. Cf. New York Central Securities Corp. v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 12, 24\n, 53 S.Ct. 45, 48. On the other hand if maintenance of the present suit by petitioners is consistent with those purposes and aids them and is in harmony with the reasons for allowing any party in interest to sue, the conclusion would seem inescapable that petitioners are proper plaintiffs.\n It is not denied that the statutory language and the legislative history of the paragraphs in question require consideration by the Commission of the interests of cities, towns and communities which are adversely affected by a proposed extension of a line of railroad, in order to determine whether 'public convenience and necessity' require the extension. The phrase 'public convenience and necessity' has long been used to signify the final result of the balancing of the consequences which flow from the proposed action to all those matters of public concern which are affected by it. Cf. Chesa- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 295, 312]\n\u00a0\n peake & O. Ry. Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 35, 42\n, 51 S.Ct. 337, 339; United States v. Lowden, \n308 \nU.S. 225\n, 60 S.Ct. 248. And we have held that in the administration of the cognate provision relating to abandonment of railroad lines the Commission must consider as a part of the public convenience and necessity the interests of local communities affected by the proposed abandonment. Colorado v. United States, \n271 \nU.S. 153, 168\n, 46 S.Ct. 452, 455. A community may suffer injury through the loss of railroad service and diversion of traffic resulting from the construction and operation of a railroad extension without any compensating public advantage which is comparable in kind and amount with injury sustained by the abandonment of a line of railroad. One as well as the other should receive the consideration of the Commission in determining whether it should grant or withhold a certificate. Such appears to be its settled practice on applications for a certificate authorizing extension. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[311 \nU.S. 295, 313]\n\u00a0\n It is plain that the purpose of the statute is the protection of the public interest and that in the administration of its provisions by the Commission public interest is of paramount concern. That interest is primarily that railroad extensions, as the statute provides, shall not be built or operated without receiving the approval of the Commission, and that the Commission shall grant its permission only if the public convenience and necessity so require.\n In determining who may bring the suit to restrain the proposed construction as provided by  1(20), it is significant that the suit is brought to restrain an act which the statute declares unlawful, the construction of an extension without the certificate of the Commission,  1(18), and that the function of the court is not that of the Commission in granting or withholding a certificate. The only issue which can be litigated in such a suit, brought by a proper plaintiff, is whether in fact the proposed construction is of a spur or sidetrack, the only new trackage which a railroad may lawfully build without recourse to the Commission. It is an issue which is by paragraphs (18) and (22) of  1 made a judicial, not an administrative question and involves no more complexities of litigation than many other cases which courts are called on daily to decide. In any case the issue is one which Congress directed to be litigated in a suit brought under  1(20), and its complexity is unaffected by the particular plaintiff who brings the suit.\n If the proposed construction is an extension the injunction must issue as of right, but its only affect is to compel the railroad before proceeding further to apply to the Commission for a certificate of public convenience and necessity which is the public purpose of the Act. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 295, 314]\n\u00a0\n Texas & Pacific Ry. v. Gulf, etc., Ry., \n270 \nU.S. 266, 273\n, 46 S.Ct. 263, 264. The court is thus called on to decide no administrative issue which must be submitted to the Commission in advance of suit, and any decree which it may render involves no embarrassment to the Commission or otherwise in the administration of the Act. While the Commission itself may bring the suit, it is under no statutory duty to do so and its only other authority in the premises is to grant or withhold the certificate when applied for. One injured by an unauthorized extension and opposed to its construction, whether a state commission, a competing railroad or any other injured party, is not authorized to initiate any proceeding before the Commission and its only protection as of right from the consequences of the threatened public wrong is that afforded by suit authorized by  1( 20). See Texas & Pacific Ry. v. Gulf, etc., Ry., supra, \n270 \nU.S. 272\n-274, 46 S.Ct. 264, 265.\n In considering the scope of the application of the statute this Court has recognized that the public interest which the Commission is to protect includes the public interest in the maintenance of an adequate transportation system and that a railroad whose welfare, although not its legal right, is adversely affected by an unauthorized and therefore unlawful extension of the line of another is a 'party in interest' entitled to maintain suit to enjoin the extension. Western Pacific California R. Co. v. Southern Pacific Co., supra; cf. Claiborne-Annapolis Ferry Co. v. United States, supra. And it has held that one other than a carrier (a municipality), who has 'a proper interest in the subject- matter', may institute a proceeding before the Interstate Commerce Commission under  1, paragraphs 18 to 22, to obtain a certificate of public convenience, so as to enable a railroad to build an extension to a new station which a state commission has ordered it to build. Atchison Ry. v. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 295, 315]\n\u00a0\n Railroad Commission, supra, \n283 \nU.S. 393, 394\n, 51 S.Ct. 556, 557. Compare Detroit & M. Ry. v. Boyne City, etc., Co., D.C., 286 F. 540.\n But it has never held, unless it has done so now, that the public concern in protecting large communities from destruction of their business and financial interests by diversion of traffic to rival communities by railroad extensions, is not included in that public convenience and necessity which the Commission must consider in granting or withholding a certificate; or that one not a railroad who is a member of a community adversely affected and whose own business or property interests are so adversely affected is not a 'party in interest' within the meaning of the statute.\n If the statute permits some protection through commission action of the public interest in the preservation of communities adversely affected by the construction of railroad extensions, no plausible reason has been advanced for saying that an individual member of such a community whose property or financial interests are adversely affected by the proposed unauthorized extension, and who would be a proper party to the proceeding before the Commission on application for a certificate,2 \n\n[311 \nU.S. 295, 316]\n\u00a0\n is not a party in interest, entitled to bring suit quite as much as a competing railroad whose property interests are likewise affected. On the contrary, petitioners have a special and peculiar interest in preventing the unlawful extension and in securing, before the extension is built, such consideration of the community interest as the Commission gives, and which can be insured only by resort to the suit authorized by  1(20).\n True, the statute is concerned with the protection of the public interest but in order that the public interest might not suffer, and that private injury might not be inflicted through a public wrong, the construction of an unlawful extension, Congress did not restrict the authority to bring suit to public agencies-the United States, the Commission or state commissions. Congress by providing that applications for certificates of convenience need not be made for local spur or side tracks, recognized that such constructions are too trivial to require a proceeding before the Commission. Instead it gave authority to bring the suit to private parties in interest, who because of the injury especially inflicted upon them through the adverse effect of the unlawful extension on the public, have a peculiar incentive to protect the public interest with which the statute is concerned, see Federal Communications Comm. v. Sanders Bros. Radio Station, \n309 \nU.S. 470, 477\n, 60 S.Ct. 693, 698, and who by restraining an unauthorized 'extension' insure the expert consideration by the Commission in the situation in which Congress required it.\n Just as Congress gave authority to a railroad to sue to enjoin an unauthorized extension by its competitor in order to effect the railroad policy of the Act, it gave like authority to complainants to effect its public policy with respect to a community injuriously affected by an \n\n[311 \nU.S. 295, 317]\n\u00a0\n unlawful railroad extension. The statute gives no warrant for saying that the one may bring suit but that the other can only ask some public body to bring it and neither interferes with the functions which the Commission is authorized to perform and which, as we have seen, are distinct from those assigned to the court by  1(20).\n Maintenance of the suit by complainants is thus within the fair meaning of the words of the statute. It aids rather than obstructs the administration of the Act; it effectuates the public policy of the Act and is within the reason for permitting others than public agencies to bring the suit. They are 'parties in interest' to which the statute refers.\n Since the suit was properly brought the district court should entertain and decide the petition of Kansas City for intervention in the light of 28 U.S.C.  45a, 28 U.S.C.A.  45a, and Rule 24 of the Rules of Civil Procedure.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice REED concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Transportation Act, 1920, Sec. 402: 'Paragraph '(18) ...

Bruce, of Houston, Tex., for petitioners.\n Mr. J. Louis Monarch, of Washington, D.C., for respondent. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 415, 416]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We took this case because the petition for certiorari alleged that the Circuit Court of Appeals had based its decision on a point not presented or argued by the litigants, which the petitioner had never had an opportunity to meet by the production of evidence.\n The Gulf Coast Irrigation Company was the owner of irrigation properties. Petitioner was its sole stockholder. He personally owned certain lands and other irrigation properties. November 4, 1931, the Irrigation Company, the Gulf Coast Water Company, and the petitioner, entered into an agreement which recited that the petitioner owned all of the stock of the Irrigation Company; described the company's properties, and stated that, prior to conveyance to be made pursuant to the contract, the Irrigation Company would be the owner of certain other lands and irrigation properties. These other lands and properties were those which the petitioner individually owned. The contract called for a conveyance of all the properties owned, and to be owned, by the Irrigation Company for $ 50,000 in cash and $750,000 in bonds of the Water Company, payable serially over the period January 1, 1933, to January 1, 1944. The petitioner joined in this agreement as a guarantor of the title of the Irrigation Company and for the purpose of covenanting that he would not personally enter into the irrigation business within a fixed area during a specified period after the execution of the contract. Three days later, at a special meeting of stockholders of the Irrigation Company, the proposed reorganization was approved, the minutes stating that the taxpayer, 'desiring also to reorganize his interest in the properties,' had consented to be a party to the reorganization. The capital stock of the Irrigation Company was \n\n[308 \nU.S. 415, 417]\n\u00a0\n increased and thereupon the taxpayer subscribed for the new stock and paid for it by conveyance of his individual properties.\n The contract between the two corporations was carried out November 18, with the result that the Water Company became owner of all the properties then owned by the Irrigation Company including the property theretofore owned by the petitioner individually. Subsequently all of its assets, including the bonds received from the Water Company, were distributed to the petitioner. The company was then dissolved. The petitioner and his wife filed a tax return as members of a community in which they reported no gain as a result of the receipt of the liquidating dividend from the Irrigation Company. The latter reported no gain for the taxable year in virtue of its receipt of bonds and cash from the Water Company. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed additional taxes against the community, as individual taxpayers, by reason of the receipt of the liquidating dividend, and against the petitioner as transferee of the Irrigation Company's assets in virtue of the gain realized by the company on the sale of its property. The tax was paid and claims for refund were filed. Petitioner's wife having died he brought suit individually and as her executor and representative in the community property against the respondent to recover the amount of the additional taxes so assessed. He alleged that the transaction constituted a tax-exempt reorganization as defined by the Revenue Act. \n1\n The respondent traversed the allegations of the complaints and the causes were consolidated and tried by the District Court without a jury. The respondent's contention that the transaction amounted merely to a sale of assets by the petitioner and the Irrigation Company and did not fall within the statu- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 415, 418]\n\u00a0\n tory definition of a tax-free reorganization was overruled by the District Court and judgment was entered for the petitioner.\n The respondent appealed, asserting error on the part of the District Court in matters not now material and also assigning as error the court's holding that the transaction constituted a nontaxable reorganization.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that, as the Water Company acquired substantially all the properties of the Irrigation Company, there was a merger of the latter within the literal language of the statute, but held that, in the light of the construction this Court has put upon the statute, the transaction would not be a reorganization unless the transferor retained a definite and substantial interest in the affairs of the transferee. It thought this requirement was satisfied by the taking of the bonds of the Water Company, and, therefore, agreed with the District Court that a reorganization had been consummated. It added, however, 'We find a reason for reversing the judgment which has not been argued.' Adverting to the fact that the transfer of the petitioner's individual properties to the Irrigation Company was for the purpose of including them in the latter's assets to be transferred in the proposed reorganization, the court said the statute did not extend to the reorganization of an individual's business or affairs, and the transaction was a reorganization within the meaning of the Revenue Act as respects the corporation's assets owned on November 4, 1931, but not as respects the petitioner's individual properties included in the sale. It concluded: 'Only so much of the consideration as represents the price of the properties and business of the Irrigation Company is entitled to be protected from taxation as arising from a reorganization. It does not appear what the proper apportionment is. The Burden was upon LeTulle to show not only that he had been illegally taxed, but how much \n\n[308 \nU.S. 415, 419]\n\u00a0\n of what was collected from him was illegal. The latter he did not do. The evidence does not support the judgment for the full amount paid by him. It is accordingly reversed, that further proceedings may be had consistent herewith.' \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The petitioner sought certiorari asserting that the Circuit Court of Appeals had departed from the usual and accepted course of judicial proceedings by deciding the cause upon a ground not presented or argued and hence had deprived the petitioner of his day in court. The respondent, though he had contended below that the transaction in question did not amount to a taxfree statutory reorganization, did not file a cross petition asking for a review of that part of the judgment exempting from taxation gain to the Irrigation Company arising from the transfer of its assets owned by it on and prior to November 4, 1931, and the part of the liquidating dividend attributable thereto.\n We find it unnecessary to consider petitioner's contention that the Circuit Court of Appeals erred in deciding the case on a ground not raised by the pleadings, not before the trial court, not suggested or argued in the Circuit Court of Appeals, and one as to which the petitioner had never had the opportunity to present his evidence, since we are of opinion that the transaction did not amount to a reorganization and that, therefore, the petitioner cannot complain, as the judgment must be affirmed on the ground that no tax-free reorganization was effected within the meaning of the statute.\n Section 112[i] provides, so far as material: '(1) The term 'reorganization' means (A) a merger or consolidation (including the acquisition by one corporation of at least a majority of the voting stock and at least a majority of the total number of shares of all other \n\n[308 \nU.S. 415, 420]\n\u00a0\n classes of stock of another corporation, or substantially all the properties of another corporation) ....'\n As the court below properly stated, the section is not to be read literally, as denominating the transfer of all the assets of one company for what amounts to a cash consideration given by the other a reorganization. We have held that where the consideration consists of cash and short term notes the transfer does not amount to a reorganization within the true meaning of the statute, but is a sale upon which gain or loss must be reckoned. \n3\n We have said that the statute was not satisfied unless the transferor retained a substantial stake in the enterprise and such a stake was thought to be retained where a large proportion of the consideration was in common stock of the transferee,4 or where the transferor took cash and the entire issue of preferred stock of the transferee corporation. \n5\n And, where the consideration is represented by a substantial proportion of stock, and the balance in bonds, the total consideration received is exempt from tax under Sec. 112(b)(4) and 112(g). 6\n In applying our decision in the Pinellas case, supra, the courts have generally held that receipt of long term bonds as distinguished from short term notes constitutes the retention of an interest in the purchasing corporation. There has naturally been some difficulty in classifying the securities involved in various cases. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n We are of opinion that the term of the obligations is not material. Where the consideration is wholly in the \n\n[308 \nU.S. 415, 421]\n\u00a0\n transferee's bonds, or part cash and part such bonds, we think it cannot be said that the transferor retains any proprietary interest in the enterprise. On the contrary, he becomes a creditor of the transferee; and we do not think that the fact referred to by the Circuit Court of Appeals, that the bonds were secured solely by the assets transferred and that, upon default, the bondholder would retake only the property sold, changes his status from that of a creditor to one having a proprietary stake, within the purview of the statute.\n We conclude that the Circuit Court of Appeals was in error in holding that, as respects any of the property transferred to the Water Company, the transaction was other than a sale or exchange upon which gain or loss must be reckoned in accordance with the provisions of the revenue act dealing with the recognition of gain or loss upon a sale or exchange.\n Had the respondent sought and been granted certiorari the petitioner's tax liability would, in the view we have expressed, be substantially increased over the amount found due by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Since the respondent has not drawn into question so much of the judgment as exempts from taxation gain to the Irrigation Company arising from transfer of its assets owned by it on and prior to November 4, 1931, and the part of the liquidating dividend attributable thereto, we cannot afford him relief from that portion of the judgment which was adverse to him.\n A respondent or an appellee may urge any matter appearing in the record in support of a judgment,8 but he may not attack it even on grounds asserted in the court below, in an effort to have this Court reverse it, when \n\n[308 \nU.S. 415, 422]\n\u00a0\n he himself has not sought review of the whole judgment, or of that portion which is adverse to him. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed and the cause is remanded to the District Court with directions to proceed in accordance with the opinion and mandate of the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n So ordered.\n Affirmed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 112(i) of the Revenue Act of 1928, c. 852, 45 Stat. 791, 818, 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Acts, page 379. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 5 Cir., 103 F.2d 20, 22. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Pinellas Ice & Cold Storage Co. v.

COMMONWEALTH OF KENTUCKY(1940)\nNo. 92\nArgued: December 14, 1939Decided: January 29, 1940\n\n\n\n\n[309 \nU.S. 83, 84]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Leo T. Wolford and Wm. Marshall Bullitt, both of Louisville, Ky., for appellant.\n\n\n\n[309 \nU.S. 83, 85]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Samuel M. Rosenstein, of Frankfort, Ky., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal1 brought here under Section 237(a) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A.  344(a), from a judgment of the Court of Appeals of Kentucky sustaining the validity of a statute of that state against an attack by the appellant on the ground of its being repugnant to the due process, equal protec- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 83, 86]\n\u00a0\n tion, and privileges and immunities clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, U.S.C.A.\n The issue is whether a state statute which imposes on its citizens an annual ad valorem tax on their deposits in banks outside of the state at the rate of fifty cents per hundred dollars and at the same time imposes on their deposits in banks located within the state a similar ad valorem tax at the rate of ten cents per hundred dollars is obnoxious to the stated clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The relevant provisions of the Kentucky statutes for the period in question appear in the note below. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The opinion of the Court of Appeals of Kentucky in this case construes the exception in Section 4019, limiting the tax on bank deposits to one-tenth of one per cent, as applicable only to depositors in local financial institutions organized under the laws of Kentucky or under the na- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 83, 87]\n\u00a0\n tional banking laws. This interpretation of the state laws is of course accepted by us. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n John E. Madden died in November, 1929, a citizen and resident of Fayette County, Kentucky. On several prior assessment dates, July 1 in Kentucky, Mr. Madden had on deposit in New York banks a considerable amount of funds. These deposits had not been reported for the purposes of taxation in Kentucky. That state brought suit against Mr. Madden's executor to have these deposits assessed as omitted property and to recover an ad valorem tax of 50 cents per hundred dollars as of July 1 of each year, together with interest and penalties. The executor used as one defense against this claim the contention that a tax on deposits in banks outside of Kentucky at a higher rate than the tax upon bank deposits within Kentucky would abridge decedent's privileges and immunities as a citizen of the United States, deprive him of his property right and the liberty to keep money on deposit outside of Kentucky without due process of law, and deny to him equal protection of the law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court of Appeals passed upon the constitutional questions submitted because of the difference in taxing rate between Kentucky deposits and out-of-state deposits. It approved the classification as permissible under the due process and equal protection clauses and refused to accept the argument that its interpretation of the statutes violated the privileges and immunities clause.\n I. Classification.-The broad discretion as to classification possessed by a legislature in the field of taxation \n\n[309 \nU.S. 83, 88]\n\u00a0\n has long been recognized. \n4\n This Court fifty years ago concluded that 'the fourteenth amendment was not intended to compel the states to adopt an iron rule of equal taxation,'5 and the passage of time has only served to underscore the wisdom of that recognition of the large area of discretion which is needed by a legislature in formulating sound tax policies. Traditionally classification has been a device for fitting tax programs to local needs and usages in order to achieve an equitable distribution of the tax burden. It has, because of this, been pointed out that in taxation, even more than in other fields, legislatures possess the greatest freedom in classification. \n6\n Since the members of a legislature necessarily enjoy a familiarity with local conditions which this Court cannot have, the presumption of constitutionality can be overcome only by the most explicit demonstration that a classification is a hostile and oppressive discrimination against particular persons and classes. \n7\n The burden is on the one attacking the legislative arrangement to negative every conceivable basis which might support it. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n Paying proper regard to the scope of a legislature's powers in these matters, the insubstantiality of appellant's claim that he has been denied equal protection or due process of law by the classification is at once apparent. When these statutes were adopted in 1917 during a general revision of Kentucky's tax laws, the chief problem facing the legislature was the formulation of an \n\n[309 \nU.S. 83, 89]\n\u00a0\n enforceable system of intangible taxation. \n9\n By placing the duty of collection on local banks, the tax on local deposits was made almost self- enforcing. The tax on deposits outside the state, however, still resembled that on investments in Watson v. State Comptroller, the collection of which was said to depend 'either upon (the taxpayer's) will or upon the vigilance and discretion of the local assessors.' \n10\n Here as in the Watson case the classification may have been 'founded in 'the purposes \n\n[309 \nU.S. 83, 90]\n\u00a0\n and policy of taxation.\" The treatment accorded the two kinds of deposits may have resulted from the differences in the difficulties and expenses of tax collection. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n II. Privileges and Immunities.-The appellant presses urgently upon us the argument that the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States12 forbids the enforcement by the Commonwealth of Kentucky of this enactment which imposes upon the testator taxes five times as great on money deposited in banks outside the State as it does on money of others deposited in banks within the State. The privilege or immunity which appellant contends is abridged is the right to carry on business beyond the lines of the State of his residence, a right claimed as appertaining to national citizenship.\n There is no occasion to attempt again an exposition of the views of this Court as to the proper limitations of the privileges and immunities clause. There is a very recent discussion in Hague v. Committee Industrial Organization. \n13\n The appellant purports to accept as sound the position stated as the view of all the justices concurring in the Hague decision. This position is that the privileges and immunities clause protects all citizens against abridgement by states of rights of national citizenship as distinct from the fundamental or \n\n[309 \nU.S. 83, 91]\n\u00a0\n natural rights inherent in state citizenship. \n14\n This Court declared in the Slaughter-House Cases15 that the Fourteenth Amendment as well as the Thirteenth and Fifteenth were adopted to protect the negroes in their freedom. This almost contemporaneous interpretation extended the benefits of the privileges and immunities clause to other rights which are inherent in national citizenship but denied it to those which spring from \n\n[309 \nU.S. 83, 92]\n\u00a0\n state citizenship. \n16\n In applying this constitutional principle this Court has determined that the right to operate an independent slaughter-house,17 to sell wine on terms of equality with grape growers18 and to operate businesses free of state regulation19 were not privileges and immunities protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. And a state inheritance tax statute which limited exemptions to charitable corporations within the state was held not to infringe any right protected by the privileges and immunities clause. \n20\n The Court has consistently refused to list completely the rights which are covered by the clause, though it has pointed out the type of rights protected. \n21\n We think it quite clear that the right to carry out an incident to a trade, business or calling22 such as the deposit \n\n[309 \nU.S. 83, 93]\n\u00a0\n of money in banks is not a privilege of national citizenship.\n In the states, there reposes the sovereignty to manage their own affairs except only as the requirements of the Constitution otherwise provide. Within these constitutional limits the power of the state over taxation is plenary. An interpretation of the privileges and immunities clause which restricts the power of the states to manage their own fiscal affairs is a matter of gravest concern to them. \n23\n It is only the emphatic requirements of the Constitution which properly may lead the federal courts to such a conclusion.\n Appellant relies upon Colgate v. Harvey, supra,24 as a precedent to support his argument that the present statute is not within the limits of permissible classification and violates the privileges and immunities clause. In view of our conclusions, we look upon the decision in that case as repugnant to the line of reasoning adopted here. As a consequence, Colgate v. Harvey, supra, must be and is overruled.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES concurs in the result upon the ground, as stated by the Court of Appeals of Kentucky, that the classification adopted by the legislature rested upon a reasonable basis.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS.\n I think that the judgment should be reversed. Four years ago in Colgate v. Harvey, \n296 \nU.S. 404\n, 56 S.Ct. 252, 102 A.L.R. 54, this court held that the equal protection clause and the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibit such a discrimination as results from the statute now under review.

This resulted in a total tax of about $2.65 per hundred dollars on intangibles, a tax which in the case of bank deposits almost equaled the interest on deposits. The high rate led to wide-spread evasion of the tax by concealment of intangibles; with bank deposits this took the form of withdrawals for deposits outside the state. The unequal burden which this evasion placed on other forms of property led to agitation for reform as early as 1908. Two special tax commissions reported on the need for a constitutional amendment and a general tax reform. After an amendment permitting classification was adopted in 1916, a third committee made specific proposals for revision, and most of the recommendations were adopted at a special legislative session in 1917. See the message of Governor Stanley to the General Assembly of 1917, Kentucky Senate Journal of 1917, p. 13. In general the revision took the form of a drastic lowering of the rates on intangibles. An even lower rate was placed on bank deposits and almost complete collection assured by placing the duty of collection on the banks.\n The studies which led to the general revision of 1917 may be found in Report of the Kentucky Tax Commission for 1909; Report of the Special Tax Commission of Kentucky for 1912-14; Report of the Kentucky Tax Commission for 1916.

HAMILTON(1940)\nNo. 380\nArgued: Decided: April 22, 1940\n\n\n\n - \n\n[309 \nU.S. 598, 599]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Sterling G. McNees, Edmund M. Brady, and Gilbert Nurick, all of Harrisburg, Pa., for appellants.\n Mr. George W. Keitel, of Harrisburg, Pa., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question for decision is whether a statute of Pennsylvania prohibiting the operation over its highways of any motor vehicle carrying any other vehicle over the head of the operator of such carrier vehicle, is superseded by the rules and regulations promulgated by the Interstate Commerce Commission under the Motor Carrier Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 543, 49 U.S.C.  301-327, 49 U.S.C.A.  301-327, applicable to common and contract carriers in interstate commerce.\n Appellants, co-partners engaged as common carriers in the business of transporting in interstate commerce new \n\n[309 \nU.S. 598, 600]\n\u00a0\n automobiles upon motor trucks specially constructed for that purpose, brought this suit in the Pennsylvania state courts to enjoin appellees, state officers, from enforcing against appellants  1033(c) of the Pennsylvania Vehicle Code, P.L. 2401, effective June 29, 1937, 75 P.S.  642(c), which prohibits the operation on the highways of the state of any vehicle carrying any other vehicle 'above the cab of the carrier vehicle or over the head of the operator of such carrier vehicle.' \n1\n Two other like suits brought by motor carriers engaged in like transportation interstate were consolidated with the present suit.\n After a hearing in which there was extensive evidence tending to show that the transportation by appellants over the state highways of cars placed above the cab of the transporting vehicle is unsafe to the driver and to the public, the trial court found that the location of motor vehicles over the cab of the carrier rendered its operation dangerous on the curves and grades of the Pennsylvania \n\n[309 \nU.S. 598, 601]\n\u00a0\n highways. It found that such location of the carried car above the driver raises the center of gravity of the loaded car above that which is normal in trucking operations, places excessive weight on the front axles and tires, obscures the vision of the driver of the carrier car, with the results that it increases the difficulty of steering the loaded car, adversely affects braking, particularly on curves, and affects the balance of the loaded car so as to make its use on the highways dangerous.\n It also found that in case of collision or loss of control the overhead car has a tendency to fly off the cab, in consequence of which, in numerous cases, serious injury had resulted to the operator of the truck or to the colliding car and its occupants, or both, and that the height of the overhead car and its interference with the driver's vision causes him to drive on the wrong side of the road in order to avoid overhead obstructions. The court concluded that the state statute was a safety regulation of motorcars using the highways of the state and that, as applied to appellants, it infringed neither the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution, art. 1,  8, cl. 3 nor the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and gave judgment dismissing the complaint. On appeal the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania confirmed the findings of the trial court and affirmed the decree. Maurer v. Boardman, 336 Pa. 17, 7 A. 2d 466. The case comes here on appeal under Section 237 of the Judicial Code, as amended, 28 U.S.C.  344, 28 U.S.C.A.  344.\n Before the present suit was brought, the Interstate Commerce Commission, purporting to act under the Motor Carrier Act, had promulgated regulations effective July 1, 1936, with respect to 'safety of operation and equipment' of common and contract motor carriers in interstate commerce, subject to the Act. These regulations contained no provisions specifically applicable to cars carried over the cab of the carrier vehicle. On March 11, 1939, while the present cause was pending be- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 598, 602]\n\u00a0\n fore the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, the Interstate Commerce Commission, in 'Car Over Cab Operations', 12 M.C.C. 127, issued its report of an investigation of the practice of the car over cab method of transportation of motor vehicles, in which it announced its conclusion that 'The record discloses no testimony whatsoever to show that the operation of motor vehicles, used in transporting new automobiles, and which are so constructed that one of the automobiles being transported extends in whole or in part over the cab, is unsafe. On the contrary, the evidence is clear that the average number of accidents in which vehicles of this type are involved is less than the country's average for all trucks. We find no reasons of record why the operations of such vehicles should be forbidden. The safety regulations heretofore prescribed by us, of course, apply to these as well as other vehicles operated by common and contract carriers in interstate or foreign commerce. The operations of vehicles so equipped are therefore permitted by the existing regulations, and there is no need for change.' (p. 132.)2 \n\n[309 \nU.S. 598, 603]\n\u00a0\n The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania took judicial notice of this action of the Commission, but concluded that the authority of the state to enact  1033(c) of the Vehicle Code was unimpaired by federal action under the commerce clause for the reason that the applicable provisions of the Motor Carrier Act, enacted by Congress, did not purport to withdraw from the state its constitutional power to make the regulation embodied in that section, and for a second reason, which we find it unnecessary to consider, that in any case the action of the Commission in declining to adopt any rule or regulation with respect to the car over cab practice of interstate common and contract motor carriers could not be taken as a mandate to such carriers to continue the practice despite state regulation prohibiting it.\n Appellants assail the state statute on the grounds that even though it is unaffected by the provisions of the Motor Carrier Act it nevertheless infringes the commerce clause and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and that in any case the statute is superseded by the action taken by the Commission in conformity to the Motor Carrier Act.\n Only a word need be said of the constitutional objections. The present record lays a firm foundation for the exercise of state regulatory power, unless the state has been deprived of that power by Congressional action authorizing the commission to substitute its judgment for that of the state legislature as to the need and propriety of the state regulation. The nature and extent of the state power, in the absence of Congressional action, to regulate the use of its highways by vehicles engaged in interstate commerce has so recently been considered by this Court that it is unnecessary to review the authorities now, or to restate the standards which define the state power to prescribe regulations adapted to promote safety upon its highways and to insure their conservation \n\n[309 \nU.S. 598, 604]\n\u00a0\n and convenient use by the public. See South Carolina Highway Dept. v. Barnwell Bros., \n303 \nU.S. 177\n, 58 S.Ct. 510. Judged by these standards we can find no basis for saying that the Pennsylvania statute is not such a regulation or that it is a denial of due process or that it infringes the commerce clause if Congress has not authorized the Interstate Commerce Commission to promulgate a conflicting rule.\n This brings us to the more serious question whether Congress, by the enactment of the Motor Carrier Act of 1935, as a regulation of interstate commerce, has undertaken to deprive the state of the power to impose the present regulation upon vehicles moving in interstate commerce. With the adoption of the Motor Carrier Act, the national government embarked on the regulation of a type of interstate traffic, many of whose regulatory problems bear little resemblance to those of other systems of transportation which had previously been subjected to Congressional control. They presented difficulties and complexities differing from and far exceeding those of any earlier regulations of interstate commerce. Our most extensive experience had been in the national regulation of rail carriers, operating over roads and with rolling stock privately owned and controlled, with standards of roadbed, operation and equipment, substantially uniform throughout the country, and with the movement of traffic on each road subject to a single unified control.\n Regulation of vehicular traffic over the highways of the United States involves a far more varied and complex undertaking. The highways of the country have been built by the states with substantial financial aid from the federal government in the construction of some of them. \n3\n They are state owned, and, in general, are open \n\n[309 \nU.S. 598, 605]\n\u00a0\n in each state to use by privately owned and controlled motor vehicles of widely different character as respects weight, size, and equipment. \n4\n The width, grades, curves, weight-bearing capacity, surfacing and overhead obstructions of the highways differ widely in the forty-eight different states and in different sections of each state. There are like variations with respect to congestion of traffic. State regulation, developed over a period of years, has been directed to the safe and convenient use of the highways and their conservation with reference to varying local needs and conditions.\n Assumption of national control involved problems of peculiar difficulty and delicacy. Apart from regulations of interstate motor traffic having commercial aims and involving routes, schedules, rates and the like, any regulation on a national scale, whatever its extent, has an intimate and vital relation to the conservation of highways which belong to the states, and to their safe and convenient use by the general public in both interstate and intrastate traffic. Our entire experience with the growth of automobile traffic and its regulation by the states teaches that in any form of non-commercial regulation, safety is a dominant consideration. Motor vehicles are dangerous machines whose operation is attended by serious hazard to persons and property. Hess v. Pawloski, \n274 \nU.S. 352, 356\n, 47 S.Ct. 632, 633. In 1934, the year before the enactment of the Motor Carrier Act, there were 36,000 reported deaths from motorcar accidents in the United States. \n5\n Excessive speed, defective appliances, \n\n[309 \nU.S. 598, 606]\n\u00a0\n negligent driving, size, weight and loading of cars in conjunction with local conditions of traffic and of the highways, contributed in varying degrees to this record of disaster.\n It is in the light of this history and background that we must appraise and apply the provisions of the Motor Carrier Act of 1935. The declared policy of the Act,  202(a), is to preserve and foster the economic and commercial advantages of an efficient transportation system. The power to regulate, which it confers on the Interstate Commerce Commission, extends in some measure to safety regulations. Section 204(a) provides: 'It shall be the duty of the Commission-(1) to regulate common carriers by motor vehicle as provided in this part (chapter), and to that end the Commission may establish reasonable requirements with respect to continuous and adequate service, transportation of baggage and express, uniform systems of accounts, records, and reports, preservation of records, qualifications and maximum hours of service of employees, and safety of operation and equipment.'\n Subdivision (2) imposes a like duty upon the Commission to regulate 'contract carriers.' Subdivision (3) imposes the duty 'To establish for private carriers of property by motor vehicle, if need therefor is found, reasonable requirements to promote safety of operation, and to that end prescribe qualifications and maximum hours of service of employees, and standards of equipment.'\n Section 225 provides: 'The Commission is hereby authorized to investigate and report on the need for Federal regulation of the sizes and weight of motor vehicles and combinations of motor vehicles and of the qualifications and maximum hours of \n\n[309 \nU.S. 598, 607]\n\u00a0\n service of employees of all motor carriers and private carriers of property by motor vehicle ....'\n The words of this section indicate, as its history demonstrates, that it was intended to reserve from the regulatory power of the Commission the regulation of 'sizes and weight of motor vehicles.' Unlike  204(a)(3), which makes it the duty of the Commission 'if need therefor is found' to establish reasonable requirements to promote safety of operation and to prescribe standards of equipment for 'private carriers of property',  225 imposes no duty and confers no authority on the Commission to regulate the sizes and weights of motor vehicles. \n6\n Its authority is limited to investigation and report of the need of such regulation. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n The bill containing the provisions of  204 and 225 which we have quoted, was prepared by the Federal Coordinator of Transportation and its adoption was recommended in his 1934 report to the Interstate Com- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 598, 608]\n\u00a0\n merce Commission, which transmitted the report and proposed bill to the Senate with its favorable recommendation. Sen.Doc. No. 152, 73rd Cong., 2d Sess. The report made no mention of the scope, purpose or meaning of  225, other than the statement, p. 49, that it provides for 'investigation and report to Congress of the need, if any, for federal regulation of the sizes and weights of motor vehicles.' The report referred, page 32, to the facts that the states regulate extensively the length, width, height and speed of motor vehicles, and their maximum gross weights and require that they 'be equipped with a variety of safety appliances'; that these regulations 'are designed in part to protect the safety and convenience of the public in its use of the highways and in part to protect the highways from excessive wear and tear', and that the 'requirements as to gross weights, lengths, and widths of vehicles are often grounded in State policies with respect to the design of highways', with respect to their weight sustaining capacity and their curves. In testifying at the hearings upon the bill before the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce, the Coordinator explained the provisions of  225 by stating: 'with respect to size and weight of vehicles ... we do not undertake in this bill to cover that situation except to provide for a thorough investigation of it by the Commission with recommendations to Congress because there is involved not only a question of fact as to what the regulation should be, but also as to how far the federal government has power to interfere with the exercise of the police power of the states with respect to the use of their highways. They have the right to protect their highways against unsafe or unreasonable use, but whether or not the federal government can come in and interfere with it I cannot say at this time.' Hearings before \n\n[309 \nU.S. 598, 609]\n\u00a0\n Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce on S. 1629, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., ( 1935) p. 92.8\n Again, page 61, he referred to 'sizes and weights' as 'an extremely important matter from the standpoint of public safety and convenience'. This Court has also had occasion to point out that the sizes and weights of automobiles have an important relation to the safe and convenient use of the highways, which are matters of state control. Sproles v. Binford, \n286 \nU.S. 374\n, 52 S.Ct. 581; South Carolina Highway Dept. v. Barnwell Bros., supra. It is evident that the purport of  225 is to reserve 'sizes and weight' from the regulatory powers of the Commission, quite as much when related to safety as when related to highway construction, pending investigation and report by the Commission of the need for such regulation, and further consideration of the matter by Congress. Such has been the uniform construction of  225 by courts having occasion to consider the subject. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n[309 \nU.S. 598, 610]\n\u00a0\n On the argument before us it was conceded that the 'size and weight of motor vehicles', of which  225 speaks, must be taken to include the sizes and weights of motor vehicles and their loads. This is evident both because an investigation of sizes and weights of motor vehicles, apart from their load, would be useless so far as the major problems of safety and use of the highways are concerned and because, as presently will appear, the state regulation of sizes and weights to be investigated has from the beginning included sizes and weights of the loaded vehicle. The power of the states to regulate the sizes and weights of loaded motor vehicles was thus left undisturbed. Such other courts as have had occasion to consider the matter in the cases already noted have arrived at the same conclusion. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n But the question remains whether the Pennsylvania statute is a regulation of 'sizes and weight' within the meaning of  225, or whether it is a regulation of 'safety of operation and equipment', which the Commission was authorized to make by  204(a)(1)(2). Perusal of the present record can leave no doubt that in both a technical and a practical sense  1033(c) is a regulation of weight and size of the loaded motor vehicle, and that the Pennsylvania Legislature intended it to be such. \n11\n By provid- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 598, 611]\n\u00a0\n ing that the carried car shall not be loaded above the cab, the statute sets practical limits to the height of the loaded car and precludes its projection beyond the cab of the carrier car and into the line of vision of its driver. It is also a restriction on weight distribution of the loaded car and in its amended form specifically prohibits placing the 'weight' of the carried car above the driver. \n12\n The highest court of the state has declared that such are the purposes of subsection (c), in order to avoid the safety hazards resulting from improper weight distribution and the height of the carried car at a point where it cannot be observed by the driver. As interpreted and applied by the state court, we can not regard the regulation as other than an exercise of the state's power to protect the safe and convenient use of its highways through the control of size and weight of motor vehicles passing over them, which it was the purpose of  225 to reserve to the state from the grant of regulatory power to the Commission. Being thus reserved we think it is unaffected by the authority conferred on the Commission by  204 to regulate 'safety of operation and equipment'.\n The Commission in its report in 'Car Over Cab Operations', supra, gave no consideration to the extent of its authority under  204, to make safety regulations affecting the car over cab practice or to the question whether the Pennsylvania restriction is in fact and in practical operation a weight and size regulation, or whether the \n\n[309 \nU.S. 598, 612]\n\u00a0\n authority to make such regulations is reserved to the states by  225. The power of the Commission to regulate with respect to safety in the case of common and contract carriers is defined by  204(a)(1) and (2), which makes it the duty of the Commission to regulate 'safety of operation and equipment.' In the exercise of this authority the Commission has made no regulation concerning sizes and weight of motor vehicles or their loads. But in a brief filed in this cause it contends that the Pennsylvania statute is an infringement of the Commission's authority to regulate safety of equipment. In ordinary speech the load of a vehicle is not spoken of as a part of its equipment. In the Motor Carrier Safety Regulations, promulgated by the Commission, safety of equipment is treated as synonymous with or the equivalent of parts and accessories of motor cars affecting safety. The Uniform Act regulating motor car traffic on highways, which was recommended by the National Conference of State and Highway Safety in 1930 and 1934, which was referred to in the report of the Coordinator, placed all size and weight regulations in a single 'Article XVI, Size, Weight and Load', separate from the articles containing provisions relating to the speed, driving and movement of motor cars and from 'Article XV, Equipment', which was confined to automobile parts and accessories and their inspection. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n But even though the phrase 'operation and equipment' of motor cars could be taken, when standing alone, as including the weight and size of their loads, we think it plain that it cannot be so taken when read in conjunction with the reservation in  225 of 'sizes and weights' from the regulatory power of the Commission. As the report \n\n[309 \nU.S. 598, 613]\n\u00a0\n of the Coordinator and the legislation in the several states shows, and as this Court has recognized, see Sproles v. Binford, supra; South Carolina State Highway Dept. v. Barnwell Bros., supra, the sizes and weights of motor vehicles and their loads present safety problems which are special and distinct from those involved in the driving and movement of cars ordinarily known as their operation, and from their parts and accessories ordinarily referred to as motor car equipment. As we have seen, one of the purposes of the reservation made in  225 was to give opportunity for further study and consideration by the Commission of the relation of sizes and weights of motor cars to the public safety and convenience, as well as to road construction and use so that the Commission and Congress might be advised what the regulation of these safety factors should be and how far Congress should interfere with their regulation by the states.\n The Couzens bill, S. 2793,  2(a)(1)(2), 72d Cong., 1st Sess., discussed in the 1934 report of the Coordinator, authorized the Commission to prescribe reasonable requirements with respect to 'safety of operation and equipment (including the weight, length, width and height of motor vehicles used by such carriers)'. This proposal was not adopted and in the bill recommended by the Coordinator and the Commission in 1934 and enacted as the Motor Carrier Act of 1935, the parenthetical clause in the provision authorizing regulation of safety of operation and equipment as it appeared in the Couzens bill, was transferred to  225, where it appeared as 'sizes and weight of motor vehicles', federal regulation of which was reserved to await the future action of Congress. The clause which was thus resorted to in the earlier bill to include regulations of sizes and weight in the authority to regulate 'safety of operation and equipment' was by its transfer to  225 of the Act of 1935 similarly made the means of withholding from the regulatory power of the Commission regulations of sizes and weight affecting safety. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 598, 614]\n\u00a0\n As a matter of statutory construction Congressional intention to displace local laws in the exercise of its commerce power is not, in general, to be inferred unless clearly indicated by those considerations which are persuasive of the statutory purpose. This is especially the case when public safety and health are concerned. Kelly v. Washington, \n302 \nU.S. 1\n, 10-14, 58 S.Ct. 87, 92, 94; H. P. Welch Co. v. New Hampshire, \n306 \nU.S. 79, 85\n, 59 S.Ct. 438, 441, and cases cited. There are other cogent reasons why the reservation made by  225 cannot be given a narrow construction. The hesitancy manifested by Congress, until the adoption of the 1935 Act, to interfere with the state highway regulations and its failure then to follow earlier and more far reaching proposals are persuasive against such a construction. \n14\n A thorough investigation by the Commission which the statute authorized was necessary not only to determine the importance of sizes and weight 'from the standpoint of public safety and convenience', but also to resolve the uncertainty of the draftsmen of the bill and presumably of Congress 'as to the facts with reference to the matter' and 'as to what the regulation should be'. S.Doc.No.152, 73rd Cong., 2d Sess., p. 61. The extent to which Congress should, if at \n\n[309 \nU.S. 598, 615]\n\u00a0\n all, curtail state regulation, could be determined only when those doubts were resolved.\n A considerable period of time was required for preparation for the investigation and for bringing it to a conclusion. The investigation which was authorized in November 1937, Ex parte No.M.C. 15, has not yet proceeded beyond the preliminary stage of gathering information. It could not be assumed that in the meantime a rapidly changing industry would not produce new types of vehicles involving new problems of the relation of sizes and weight to safety such as are involved in the present case. A construction of the reservation made in  225 is not to be favored which would deprive the states of authority to make safety regulations of sizes and weight before Congress was informed by a full investigation and report of the Commission of the nature of the regulations, both those in force and those which are needed, and whether in the light of the competing demands for national uniformity and for accommodation to local conditions, regulation of sizes and weight can be best prescribed by the Commission, by the state legislatures, or by a divided authority. For these reasons we think that the reservation of state power by  225 is not restricted to the particular problems of weight and size which the traffic had developed at the moment when the act was passed, or which were then known to the Commission, in advance of the investigation which was to ascertain the facts, what the regulation should be and how far regulations of sizes and weights should be withdrawn from the states.\n Sizes and weights which affect safety, not excluding consideration of local conditions, as well as those which affect wear and tear of the highways were to be the subject of investigation, and it is the subject of investigation which defines the reservation from the Commission's authority to regulate. Hence the phrase 'sizes and weight' in  225, when safety is concerned, is not to be \n\n[309 \nU.S. 598, 616]\n\u00a0\n narrowly limited to the overall length, width and height of the loaded cars and to their gross weight. For as we have seen distribution of weight and dimensions of load or particular parts of it in connection with local conditions of curves, grades and overhead obstruction of the highways, have an important relation to safety. In the light of the investigation Congress might conclude that the regulation of gross weights and dimensions concededly left to the states, could not be conveniently or wisely separated from regulation of weight distribution and particular dimensions.\n It is true that the report of the Coordinator presenting the bill for Congressional action particularized gross weight and overall dimensions as a common subject of regulation by the states and as a reason for making the investigation. But we find nothing in the report, or in his testimony before the Senate Committee, or elsewhere in the legislative history, to show that it was intended by  225 to confine state power to regulation of sizes and weights of automobiles and their loads to gross weights and overall dimensions. The bill as proposed and as enacted did not specify any such limitation of 'sizes and weight', and it was well known that state size and weight regulations then in force or proposed were not so restricted.\n Schedule B of the 1934 report of the Coordinator disclosed, page 213, that state regulation was then concerned with distribution of load weight by axle and wheel weight requirements. The weight provisions of the Uniform Act proposed by the National Conference on State and Highway Safety in 1930 and 1934, contained gross weight limitations and axle weight limitations which involved distribution of weight of the loaded car. The preliminary report (No. 1) of the Interstate Commerce Commission, Bureau of Motor Carriers of April, 1940, p. 71, notes various state regulations fixing axle weight or wheel weight limitations, sometimes with and sometimes with- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 598, 617]\n\u00a0\n out a gross weight limitation, and states that the combination of these factors 'is basically intended to control not only total gross weight of the vehicle and its load but also distribution of the load on the vehicle.'\n The proposed Uniform Act also contained provisions, in 'Article XVI, Size, Weight and Load' ( 78(e) of the 1930 Draft;  142(d) of the 1934 Draft), for the distribution or location of load and its particular dimensions, independently of gross weight and overall measurements. They directed that 'the load upon any vehicle ... shall not extend more than three feet beyond the front wheels of such vehicle or the front bumper of such vehicle if it is equipped with such a bumper.' Report No. 1 of the Commission indicates that this provision has been adopted in twenty-three states and that three states prohibit any such projection of load. As already noted, the present Pennsylvania statute regulating car over cab operation has been enacted in substance in West Virginia. \n15\n\u00a0\n\n Reading the words of  225 in the light of its legislative history, and mindful of the peculiar conditions of the traffic and the problems of state regulation to which the section must be applied, and of its obvious purpose to postpone until the report of the Commission's determination of the extent to which Congress should withdraw from the states their power to regulate sizes and weight of motor vehicles, we cannot say that the phrase as used in the statute is restricted to overall measurements or gross weight, or that it does not include particular dimensions of motor vehicles and their loads and the distribution of load, which affect safety as well as the wear and tear of the highways. We conclude that the Pennsylvania statute now before us is a weight and size regulation within the meaning of  225, and is within the regulatory authority of the state reserved by that section from the authority granted to the Commission by  204.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] '(c) No person shall operate a vehicle on the highways of this Commonwealth carrying any other vehicle, any part of which is above the cab of the carrier vehicle or over the head of the operator of such carrier vehicle.'\n After the argument of the appeal in this case, but before the decree in the State Supreme Court, this section was amended to read:\n'(c) No person shall operate a vehicle on the highways of this Commonwealth carrying any other vehicle the weight of which is directly above the cab of the carrier vehicle or directly over the head of the operator of such carrier vehicle.' Act No. 400 of June 27, 1939, 75 P.S.Pa .  642(c).\n\n The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, in its opinion, considered this amendment and concluded that the statute both before and after the amendment applied to the vehicles used by appellants and was directed at the same evils, and that no essential change was made by the amendment, a construction which we adopt. The Supreme Court also concluded that as the amendment named no date when it was to take effect it would become effective some two months later, on September 1, 1939, as provided by  4 of the Statutory Construction Act of May 28, 1937, P.L. 1019, 1020, 46 P.S. Pa.  504. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The report of the Interstate Commerce Commission states, page 133, that im this proceeding 'the only evidence was introduced by or on behalf of carriers engaged in the type of operation under investigation', that the State of Pennsylvania declined to participate in the proceeding and that a representative of the state invited the attention of the Commission to the evidence which had been taken in the present suit, but that such evidence was not made a part of the record in the proceeding before the Commission and was not considered by it. The Commission, so far as the report discloses, gave no consideration to the consequences of placing the carried car above the cab of the motor carrier when accidents do in fact occur, to the effect of the weight distribution of the combination when used on highways of grades and curves over which petitioners operate in Pennsylvania, and its tendency to cause the driver of the combination to hold to the middle of the road to avoid injury to the carrier car on the tree-lined highways of the state, all of which were deemed by the state courts in the present case to have an important bearing on safety. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] For the significance of federal aid, see hearings before Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce on S. 2793, 72d Cong., 1st Sess.

To enable the Commission to make a report under the provisions of section 225 on the need for Federal regulation of the sizes and weight of motor vehicles and combinations thereof.\n\n'2. To enable the Commission to prescribe reasonable requirements under the provisions of section 204 of the act as to the sizes and weight of motor vehicles and combinations therefor insofar as they affect the safety of operation.'\n\n The Commission is now engaged in making its investigation and has made no report of its findings or conclusions. Report No. 1, a preliminary study as yet unpublished (April, 1940), made by the Bureau of Motor Carriers, Interstate Commerce Commission, is devoted to an analysis of state limitations of sizes and weights of motor vehicles. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] On Page 61 of the Report the Coordinator stated: 'But on this question of sizes and weight of motor vehicles which is an extremely important matter from the standpoint of public safety and convenience, there is not only the question here as to what those sizes and weights ought to be from the standpoint of road construction and road use, but there is also the legal question as to whether the federal government can exercise power over the matter or whether it is a matter exclusively within the jurisdiction of the states. It was because of doubts not only as to the facts with reference to that matter, but also to the law that provisions were made for this investigation.'\n The Committee Reports make no comment on Section 225.

Subdivision (b) prohibits operation of vehicles carrying other vehicles any part of which is more than 115 inches from the ground; and subdivision (d) prohibits the operation of vehicles carrying any oher vehicle 'any axle of which is more than 3 feet higher than any other axle on such carrying vehicle'. Subsections (a), (b) and (d) do not become effective until January 1, 1942. West Virginia has a statute containing similar provisions.

Beginning with the 70th Congress the bills almost uniformly provided that interstate carriers should remain subject to state regulations relating 'to the maintenance, protection, safety, or use of the highways therein, which do not discriminate against motor vehicles used in interstate commerce'. The Rayburn bill which the Interstate Commerce Commission approved, contained such a clause (S.Dec. 152, 73d Cong., 2nd Sess., 25). Only the Couzens bill (S. 2793, 72d Cong., 1st Sess.) affirmatively prescribed federal regulation. The Dill bill (S. 3171, 73d Cong., 2d Sess.) and S. 1629, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., which was finally enacted as the Motor Carrier Act, envisaged the possibility of such regulation of size and weights but only after a report to Congress.

LAKELAND HIGHLANDS CANNING CO.(1940)\nNo. 270\nArgued: January 12, 1940Decided: February 26, 1940\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of Florida. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 310, 311]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William C. Pierce and O. K. Reaves, both of Tampa, Fla., and H. E. Carter, of Tallahassee, Fla., for appellants.\n Mr. G. L. Reeves, of Tampa, Fla., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellees, corporations of Florida and other states, and individuals, engaged in the canning of citrus fruits in that state, filed their bill in the District Court for Southern Florida against Nathan Mayo, as Commissioner of Agriculture of Florida, praying injunctions, temporary and final, to restrain him from cancelling their licenses \n\n[309 \nU.S. 310, 312]\n\u00a0\n as citrus fruit dealers, from enforcing against them a regulation made pursuant to a state statute, and from interfering with the conduct of their business by reason of their failure to comply with the statute.\n On presentation of the bill and motion for temporary relief, the court issued a restraining order and convened a court of three judges. The Florida Citrus Commission was permitted to intervene as a defendant. After hearing on affidavits, filed by appellees and appellant Mayo, and, on evidence offered by the appellees, the court granted a temporary injunction pending final hearing. 1 The Commissioner and the intervener have appealed.\n The bill alleges the importance of the grapefruit canning industry in the State, and asserts that the appellees, in the conduct of their business, packed over sixty per cent. of the total grapefruit and grapefruit juice canned in the State in seasons prior to that of 1938-1939. It recites the adoption by the legislature of the Growers' Cost Guarantee Act, Chap. 16862 of the Acts of 1935, which, after declaring that the production and distribution of citrus fruit is a paramount industry of the State, upon which the prosperity of the State largely depends, and assigning reasons for the protection of the industry and the maintenance of prices commensurate with the cost of production of citrus fruit, authorizes the Commissioner of Agriculture, in his discretion, with the consent and advice of the Governor, to declare the existence of an emergency in the industry; and provides that, if he does so, then-upon petition of owners or controllers of fifty per cent. or more of the producing acreage of citrus fruit, and, upon procurement by the Florida Citrus Commission from producers, shippers, or handlers, not subject to the provisions of the act, of binding agreements to conform thereto and abide by its terms-the Commission shall \n\n[309 \nU.S. 310, 313]\n\u00a0\n determine and record annually the average reasonable cost, per standard backed box, of producing citrus fruit. The statute provides that, thereupon, every contract with a grower for the purchase of fruit is to be held to require the purchaser to pay the grower a price per box equal to such ascertained and recorded cost; and continues: 'Any contract, plan, scheme or device whereby it shall be attempted to preclude the grower from recovering such cost of production shall to that extent be held to be unlawful and against the public policy of this State, but in all other respects and particulars contracts of sale ... shall be valid and binding and the terms thereof shall measure the rights of the respective parties.' Section 3. By its terms the act is to apply to any one or more of the varieties of citrus fruit.\n The complaint further refers to the Bond and License Act, Chap. 16860, Laws of Florida, 1935, as amended by Chap. 17777, Acts of 1937, which requires every dealer (which term includes processors of citrus fruit) to take a license and provides that if the Commissioner determines that any dealer has violated the provisions of any applicable act he may suspend or revoke the license of the offender. Operation as a dealer without license is made a misdemeanor.\n The bill alleges that the packing season for canning citrus products in Florida begins about November 1st of each year and continues until June or July of the following year; that preparations for canning include the ordering of cans, labels, contracting for purchase of fruit, securing labor, planning of factory operations, and obtaining orders for the product.\n It is alleged that, under the Growers' Cost Guarantee Act, the appellant Mayo, as Commissioner of Agriculture, with the consent and advice of the Governor, declared an emergency in the citrus industry on January 13, 1939, and that the Citrus Commission passed a resolution Jan- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 310, 314]\n\u00a0\n uary 16, 1939, reciting that more than fifty per cent. of the owners or controllers of producing acreage of grapefruit in the State have requested the Commission to determine the cost of production of grapefruit, fixing the cost per standard packed box at thirty-two cents for the season 1938- 1939, and decreeing that every contract with a grower shall be held to require that the purchaser shall, in any event, pay the grower the amount so fixed as the cost of production.\n The bill states that the expected pack of grapefruit for the season 1938-39 was large, but that, due to the regulation, the output of the cannel product has been less, by two million cases, than that of the previous season; that, since January 19, 1939, each of appellees has been offered quantities of grapefruit by Florida growers, at prices ranging from twelve cents per box for fruit to be processed into juice, to twenty- five cents per box for fruit to be canned into sections or hearts, and that, but for the regulation in question, each could, and would, have purchased such fruit, canned the same, and sold the canned product at a large profit; that, as a result of the regulation, much of the fruit remains unsold and is spoiling.\n The bill further asserts that many growers own their own canning plants and may, therefore, process their fruit without being subject to the burden of the Cost Guarantee Law; and that many growers, with like immunity, process their fruit through cooperative organizations to which the Commissioner does not apply the cost price provisions of the law and regulations.\n According to the bill a large proportion of the Florida canned fruit is sold in interstate and foreign commerce and much of it competes with that produced in other states which brings lower prices, and, consequently, the appellees cannot pay thirty-two cents per box and sell in competition with fruit elsewhere processed. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 310, 315]\n\u00a0\n It is further averred that one of the appellees had made binding contracts of purchase prior to issue of the regulation, the obligation of which has been impaired thereby.\n After alleging that each appellee has a large investment; that the payment of thirty-two cents per box would render it impossible for them to sell their processed grapefruit except at a loss; that the enforcement of the regulation will cause them large losses and irreparable damage; that if they do not comply with the regulation the Commissioner will revoke their licenses, and that, if he should do so, they will be compelled to suspend business or subject themselves to risk of fine and imprisonment under the Bond and License Act, the bill charges that the Growers' Cost Guarantee Law, as administered and as applied to them, is unconstitutional and void as illegally attempting to regulate interstate commerce, as violating the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, because discriminating between cooperatives and the complainants, as taking their property without due process of law, and as impairing the obligation of contracts. The bill also challenges the regulation on the ground that the Commission failed to ascertain, in accordance with the law, that fifty per cent. of the owners or controllers of acreage had requested regulation and also failed to observe the condition precedent to making any order, namely, that all persons not subject to the provisions of the act should execute binding agreements to be governed thereby.\n At the time of hearing and decree for preliminary injunction no answer or motion to dismiss had been filed. The court in its opinion stated that the defendants had appeared and, though they had not filed answers, argued the case 'and requested the Court to pass on all questions presented, and especially on the constitutionality of the Act involved.' ( 28 F.Supp. 45.) \n\n[309 \nU.S. 310, 316]\n\u00a0\n The court in its opinion, after a running commentary, concluded: 'We find the Act unconstitutional.' The court then went on to say that there was no proof before it that the Commission had procured agreements, as required by the act, from shippers or handlers not subject to the provisions of the act, and that, while this fact might not render the act violative of the Constitution, it required an injunction to restrain the Commission from enforcing the prices fixed. An injunction was issued to remain in force until final hearing.\n We think the court committed serious error in this dealing with the case upon motion for temporary injunction. The question before it was not whether the act was constitutional or unconstitutional; was not whether the Commission had complied with the requirements of the act, if valid, but was whether the showing made raised serious questions, under the federal Constitution and the state law, and disclosed that enforcement of the act, pending final hearing, would inflict irreparable damages upon the complainants.\n The observations made in the course of the opinion are not, in any proper sense, findings of fact upon these vital issues. Statements of fact are mingled with arguments and inferences for which we find no sufficient basis either in the affidavits or the oral testimony.\n It is of the highest importance to a proper review of the action of a court in granting or refusing a preliminary injunction that there should be fair compliance with Rule 52(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S. C.A. following section 723c. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The appellants complain that the court's opinion decides a question which was not open on the hearing and \n\n[309 \nU.S. 310, 317]\n\u00a0\n prejudices their position on final hearing; that the decision goes beyond the question of a prima facie showing made for the purpose of obtaining a temporary injunction and proceeds upon assemptions of fact not sustained by the evidence which appellants could have negatived by proof adduced at final hearing. The appellees insist that in holding the act unconstitutional the court did so only for the purposes of temporary relief and that its conclusion in this respect can have no effect upon the ultimate decision of the cause upon the merits. Nevertheless, the parties have essayed, in view of the action of the court below, to argue in this court the question of the constitutionality of the statute, whereas, if the court below had confined itself to the issue presented, namely, whether the proofs warranted the entry of an injunction pending a decision of the constitutional and other questions presented, the parties could either have obtained a trial on the merits long before an appeal from the interlocutory order could be heard in this case or, if an appeal from the interlocutory order had been perfected here, would have been restricted in argument to the question whether, upon proper findings and conclusions, the court had abused its discretion in granting or refusing an injunction. \n 3\n\u00a0\n\n Moreover, if appellants conceived themselves aggrieved by the action of the court upon motion for preliminary injunction, they were entitled to have explicit findings of fact upon which the conclusion of the court was based. Such findings are obviously necessary to the intelligent and orderly presentation and proper disposition of an appeal.\n The appellants insist that the bill fails to state facts sufficient to raise a substantial question as to the constitutional validity of the statute. They could have made this point in the District Court by a motion to \n\n[309 \nU.S. 310, 318]\n\u00a0\n dismiss and obtained a prompt decision on it. They omitted so to do.\n The record does not warrant a judgment of dismissal. The complaint raises constitutional questions of due process, equal protection, and violation of the obligation of contract. It further raises questions as to whether the act has ever been put into operation in accordance with its terms.\n The appellees' principal attack upon the statute, based upon the Constitution, centers on its regulation of prices. The mere fact that the act fixes prices is, in itself insufficient to invalidate it;4 and allegation of that fact does not raise substantial federal questions. The presumption that an act fixing prices is constitutional would require the denial of a temporary injunction, except in extraordinary situations. Findings to support a conclusion against constitutionality would need to be unequivocal.\n Some of the complainants are corporations of states other than Florida and allegations of the bill, which were not denied, sufficiently allege an amount in controversy in excess of $3,000 with respect to each complaint. In respect of the Commission's alleged failure to comply with the statute, it may be that these complainants are entitled to maintain the suit although not entitled to a hearing before a three judge court, even though it be found that there is no substance in the constitutional questions presented.\n The legislation requiring the convening of a court of three judges in cases such as this was intended to insure that the enforcement of a challenged statute should not be suspended by injunction except upon a clear and persuasive showing of unconstitutionality and irreparable \n\n[309 \nU.S. 310, 319]\n\u00a0\n injury. Congress intended that, in this class of suits, prompt hearing and decision shall be afforded the parties so that the states shall be put to the least possible inconvenience in the administration of their laws.\n Both the court below and the appellants are in part responsible for the inexcusable delay in the disposition of this case. We are advised that since the entry of the injunction the defendants have answered the bill, and there appears to be no reason why the case cannot promptly be finally heard and decided upon the merits. We reverse the decree and remand the cause to the court below with instructions that, if the motion for interlocutory injunction is pressed, the parties, if they desire it, may be afforded a further hearing, and any action taken by the court shall be upon findings of fact and conclusions founded upon the evidence, in accordance with Rule 52(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure.\n So ordered.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice MURPHY took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Opinion of Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER.\n A different disposition of the case seems to me to be required.\n Citrus fruit occupies a central and indeed pervasive role in the economy of Florida. That state's well-being is dependent on the cultivation of the citrus crop, its packing, transportation, financing and exporation. The appropriateness of regulations to be adopted for the citrus fruit industry is thus peculiarly a matter for the legislature of Florida in whose keeping is the shaping of that state's social and economic policy. In Nebbia v. People of State of New York, \n291 \nU.S. 502\n, 54 S.Ct. 505, 89 A.L.R. 1469, this Court recognized price control as one of the means open to a state for the protection of its welfare. United States v. Rock Royal Co-Op., 307 \n\n[309 \nU.S. 310, 320]\n\u00a0\n U.S. 533, 59 S.Ct. 993. Cf. West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, \n300 \nU.S. 379\n, 57 S.Ct. 578, 108 A.L.R. 1330. The allowable exercise of legislative discretion to attain price stability finds obvious occasion in the case of a commodity as basic to a state's economy as citrus fruit is to that of Florida. Certainly neither in the bill nor in the Court's opinion is a reason vouchsafed to take the present suit out of the scope of the Nebbia doctrine. The wisdom of such a policy-its efficacy to achieve the desired ends-is of course not our concern.\n The price level here challenged was not hastily or crudely fixed. It was the result of an approved modern method for dealing with the complexities of such a problem. The price was not fixed directly by statute. It was ascertained under appropriate safeguards by a body established to carry into apt result the legislative policy for assuring 'the grower returns at least equal to the cost of production ....' Laws of Florida, 1935, c. 16862. The Florida Citrus Commission on January 16, 1939, fixed minimum prices for grapefruit, thereby establishing what is colloquially known as a 'floor' for the market, so as to prevent the destructive play of blind economic forces.\n This action was thereupon commenced in the District Court for the Southern District of Florida, not by any of the growers but by some canners, appellees here. 28 F.Supp. 44. On March 23, 1939, they sought to enjoin the Commissioner of Agriculture and other state officials from enforcing the fixed minimum prices. They claimed that these deprived them of the opportunity to buy in a cheaper market-the cheapness of competition indifferent to any but immediate consequences. They claimed irreparable damage and asked for both a temporary and a permanent injunction. On April 28, 1939, in the circumstances set forth in this Court's opinion, the District Court declared the statute unconstitutional and granted an interlocutory injunction. There were no findings-and there \n\n[309 \nU.S. 310, 321]\n\u00a0\n could have been none on this record-taking the statute out of the doctrine announced in the Nebbia case. \n1\n Certainly a consumer has no constitutional right to buy as cheaply as an unregulated industry would, under adverse circumstances, be compelled to sell.\n Pursuant to the delays inevitable in a litigation like the present, an order allowing appeal was not granted until July 3, and the case was filed here on August 7, where in due course it was reached for argument on January 12, 1940. As a result, the injunction effectively suspended the operation of the Florida law during the whole marketing season, although this Court now finds that the injunction should never have been granted.\n I do not believe we should now let this bill hang over next year's corp. We ought not to encourage the use of the judicial process for such unjustifiable attempts to set aside a state law by allowing them to be successful in result even though legally erroneous. We ought to apply what was characterized in Massachusetts State Grange v. Benton, \n272 \nU.S. 525, 527\n, 47 S.Ct. 189, 190, as 'the important rule, which we desire to emphasize, that no injunction ought to issue against officers of a State clothed with authority to enforce the law in question, unless in a case reasonably free from doubt and when necessary to prevent great and irreparable injury.' Even if the present \n\n[309 \nU.S. 310, 322]\n\u00a0\n bill is taken at face value, it does not make out 'a case reasonably free from doubt.' The withdrawal of the injunction from industrial controversies made by the Norris-La Guardia Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  101 et seq., was in no small part due to the belief by Congress that experience had shown that the use of a legal remedy devised for a simple situation might in a totally different environment become a perversion of that remedy. Congress has also given indication in  266 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C .  380, 28 U.S.C.A.  380, of its concern over the misuse of the injunction, fashioned for settling an ordinary clash of private interests, to restrain the machinery of a state in carrying out some vital state policy.\n The supervisory power of this Court over the district courts becomes especially appropriate in equity suits. We ought to feel free to apply the traditional powers of the chancellor on appeal to act as though the suit were before him de novo. Compare United States v. Rio Grande Dam & Irrigation Co., \n184 \nU.S. 416, 423\n, 22 S.Ct. 428, 430. The present case demands that we enforce the 'important rule' of Massachusetts State Grange v. Benton, supra.\n Inasmuch as the Florida statute is obviously constitutional, the bill does not raise a substantial federal question and the District Court was without jurisdiction to entertain it on behalf of the appellees who are citizens of Florida. As to them, the case should be remanded to the District Court with directions to dismiss the bill.\n Some of the appellees, however, are citizens of other states, and among the allegations of the bill, in addition to the amount of damage requisite to give diversity jurisdiction, are those of failure by the state officials to comply with some of the conditions which appellees assert to be indispensable for the issuance of a valid pricefixing order under the statute. Whatever may be the merits of these contentions, in any event they do not touch the constitutionality of the statute or the order, \n\n[309 \nU.S. 310, 323]\n\u00a0\n and so  266 of the Judicial Code cannot be invoked for their adjudication. As to these appellees, the judgment below should be vacated and the case remanded to the District Court for any proceedings that may be appropriate before a single judge. But compare Gilchrist v. Interborough Rapid Transit Co., \n279 \nU.S. 159\n, 49 S.Ct. 282.\n Mr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice DOUGLAS join in these views. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 28 F.Supp. 44. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Compare Home Tel. & Tel.

DIXIE GREYHOUND LINES(1940)\nNo. 138\nArgued: December 14, 1939Decided: February 12, 1940\n\n\n\n Rehearing Denied March 11, 1940\n\n\n See \n309 \nU.S. 696\n, 60 S.Ct. 610, 84 L.Ed. --.\n Messrs. Frank Pace, Jr., of Little Rock, Ark., and Amos M. Mathews, of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Walter Chandler and A. L. Heiskell, both of Memphis, Tenn., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n An Arkansas statute1 prohibits entry into the State of any automobile or truck 'carrying over twenty (20) gal- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 176, 177]\n\u00a0\n lons of gasoline in the gasoline tank of such automobile or truck or in auxiliary tanks of said trucks to be used as motor fuel in said truck or motor vehicles until the state tax thereon (six and one-half cents per gallon2) has been paid.'\n Appellee, a Delaware corporation, operates passenger busses propelled by gasoline motors, from Memphis, Tennessee across Arkansas to St. Louis, Missouri, and in reverse. The route between these points approximates 342 miles-3 in Tennessee, 78 in Arkansas, 261 in Missouri. Like busses ply between Memphis and points within and beyond Arkansas, and in reverse. It is only necessary now to consider the facts connected with operation of the Memphis-St. Louis line. They are typical. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 176, 178]\n\u00a0\n Each bus consumes about one gallon of gasoline for every five miles traversed. Sixty-eight gallons are required for the journey from Memphis to St. Louis-under one in Tennessee, sixteen in Arkansas, fifty-one in Missouri. The practice is to place in the bus tank at Memphis the sixty- eight gallons of gasoline commonly required for the trip; also ten more to meet any emergency. Thus upon arrival at the Arkansas line the tank contains some seventy-seven gallons of which sixteen probably will be consumed within that State. As a condition precedent to entry there, appellant-revenue officer of the State-demands that each bus pay six and one-half cents upon every gallon of this gasoline above twenty, and threatens enforcement.\n By a bill in the District Court, appellee unsuccessfully sought an injunction against this threatened action. The Circuit Court of Appeals Eighth Circuit took a different view.\n After accepting as correct the ruling in Sparling v. Refunding Board, 189 Ark. 189, 199, 71 S.W.2d 182, 186, that the tax imposed was not upon property but on the privilege of using the highways, and had been definitely allocated to highway purposes, the latter court said (101 F.2d 572, 574):\n'The appellant does not now contend that the tax of which it complains may not be imposed by the State of Arkansas with respect to gasoline consumed or to be consumed upon the highways of Arkansas, as compensation for the use of the highways, but it does contend that that State may not impose a tax upon gasoline which is carried in interstate commerce for use in Missouri or Tennessee, because that would constitute a direct and unreasonable burden upon interstate commerce. ...\n\n'Reduced to its lowest possible terms, the question for decision, we think, is whether the imposition of the tax upon gasoline carried, for use in other states, in the fuel \n\n[309 \nU.S. 176, 179]\n\u00a0\n tank of a motor vehicle traveling in interstate commerce can be sustained. That the tax is a direct burden on interstate commerce, cannot be controverted.\n\n'If it is to be sustained at all with respect to gasoline to be used in other states, it must be sustained upon the theory that the method employed for determining the amount of the tax constitutes a fair measure for ascertaining the compensation which lawfully may be exacted by Arkansas from the appellant for the use which it makes of the highways of the State. ...\n\n'While we can understand how the use of state highways by a carrier can be roughly measured by the amount of gasoline which that carrier uses to move its vehicles over the highways, we are unable to comprehend how the use of the highways of one state can appropriately be measured by the amount of gasoline carried in the fuel tank of an interstate carrier for use upon the highways of another state.'\n\n Also, it declared the point in issue is ruled by Interstate Transit, Inc., v. Lindsey, \n283 \nU.S. 183, 186\n, 51 S.Ct. 380, 381, which held invalid a tax laid by Tennessee's Legislature on the privilege of operating a bus in interstate commerce because not imposed solely as compensation for the use of highways or to defray the expense of regulating motor traffic.\n Finally, it reversed the District Court and directed entry of a decree there enjoining appellant 'from enforcing the challenged tax against it (the appellee) with respect to all gasoline in the fuel tanks of its interstate busses which is being carried through Arkansas for use in other states.'\n This action we approve.\n The often announced rule is that while generally a state may not directly burden interstate commerce by taxation she may require all who use her roads to make reasonable compensation therefor. Hendrick v. Maryland, 235 U.S. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 176, 180]\n\u00a0\n 610, 622, 35 S.Ct. 140, 142; Interstate Transit, Inc., v. Lindsey, supra, \n283 \nU.S. 185, 186\n, 51 S.Ct. 380, 381; Bingaman v. Golden Eagle Western Lines, \n297 \nU.S. 626, 628\n, 56 S.Ct. 624.\n Here, the revenue officer demanded payment of appellee on account of gasoline to be immediately transported over the roads of Arkansas for consumption beyond. If, considering all the circumstances, this imposition reasonably can be regarded as proper compensation for using the roads it is permissible. But the facts disclosed are incompatible with that view. A fair charge could have no reasonable relation to such gasoline. That could not be even roughly computed by considering only the contents of the tank. Moreover, we find no purpose to exact fair compensation only from all who make use of the highways. Twenty gallons of gasoline ordinarily will propel a bus across the State and if only that much is in the tank at the border no charge whatever is made. Evidently large use without compensation is permissible and easy to obtain.\n The point here involved has been much discussed. Our opinions above referred to and others there cited define the applicable principles. The present controversy is within those approved by Interstate Transit, Inc., v. Lindsey, supra. Neither Hicklin v. Coney, \n290 \nU.S. 169\n, 54 S.Ct. 142, nor Bingaman v. Golden Eagle Western Lines, supra, relied upon by appellant's counsel, properly understood, sanctions a different view.\n The challenged judgment must be affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE, concurring.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice ROBERTS, Mr. Justice REED and I agree with Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, but we think a word should be said of appellant's contention \n\n[309 \nU.S. 176, 181]\n\u00a0\n that the tax in its practical operation may be taken as a fair measure of respondent's use of the highways.\n Since the subject taxed, gasoline introduced into the state in the tank of a vehicle, for use solely in propelling it in interstate commerce, is immune from state taxation except for a limited state purpose, the exaction of a reasonable charge for the use of its highways, it is not enough that the tax when collected is expended upon the state's highways. It must appear on the face of the statute or be demonstrable that the tax as laid is measured by or has some fair relationship to the use of the highways for which the charge is made. Sprout v. City of South Bend, \n277 \nU.S. 163, 170\n, 48 S.Ct. 502, 504, 62 A.L.R. 45; Interstate Transit, Inc., v. Lindsey, \n283 \nU.S. 183, 186\n, 51 S.Ct. 380, 381; Bingaman v. Golden Eagle Western Lines, \n297 \nU.S. 626, 628\n, 56 S.Ct. 624; Morf v. Bingaman, \n298 \nU.S. 407\n, 56 S.Ct. 756; Ingels v. Morf, \n300 \nU.S. 290, 294\n, 57 S.Ct. 439, 441.\n While the present tax, laid on gasoline in the tank in excess of twenty gallons, admittedly has no necessary or apparent relationship to any use of the highways intrastate, appellant argues that, as applied to the reserve gasoline in each of appellee's vehicles, the tax either is, or with a reduction of the reserves would be, substantially equivalent to a tax which the state could lay, but has not, on the gasoline consumed within the state. That could be true only in case the taxed gasoline, said to be reserved for the extrastate journey, were by chance or design of substantially the same amount as that consumed intrastate.\n That the relationship between tax and highway use does not in fact exist as the business is now conducted is demonstrated by appellant's showing that on all of appellee's routes, taken together, the taxed gasoline which is reserved for extrastate use is substantially more than that consumed on those routes within the state. In three the taxed reserve in excess of the twenty gallons exemption is substantially the same as the amount of the intra- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 176, 182]\n\u00a0\n state consumption. But on the fourth route the taxed reserve on busses moving in one direction is more than four times that consumed within the state. In the other it is approximately the same. With the three scheduled trips daily each way on the Memphis-St. Louis route, the excess of the gasoline taxed over that consumed in the state is more than 150 gallons per day. In no case does it appear that the amount of taxed gasoline has any relation to the size or weight of vehicles.\n It cannot be said that such a tax whose equivalence to a fair charge for the use of the highways, when not fortuitous, is attained only by appellee's abandonment of some of the commerce which is taxed, has any such fair relationship to the use of the highways by appellee as would serve to relieve the state from the constitutional prohibition against the taxation of property moving in interstate commerce. A tax so variable in its revenue production when compared with the taxpayer's intrastate movement cannot be thought to be 'levied only as compensation for use of the highways'. Interstate Transit, Inc., v. Lindsey, supra, \n283 \nU.S. 186\n, 51 S.Ct. 381. Justification of the tax, as a compensation measure, by treating it as the equivalent of one which could be laid on gasoline consumed within the state must fail because the state on its face and in its application discriminates against the commerce by measuring the tax by the consumption of gasoline moving and used in interstate commerce which occurs outside the state. See Fargo v. Michigan, \n121 \nU.S. 230, 241\n, 7 S.Ct. 857, 861. Gwin, White & Prince v. Henneford, \n305 \nU.S. 434, 438\n, 59 S.Ct. 325, 327.\n It is no answer to the challenge to the levy to say that by altering the amount of the gasoline brought into the state for extrastate consumption appellee could so moderate the tax that it would bear a fair relation to the use of the highways within the state. In the circumstances of this case the state is without power to regulate the amount \n\n[309 \nU.S. 176, 183]\n\u00a0\n of gasoline carried interstate in appellee's tanks. It cannot be said, if that were material, that the amount carried is not appropriate for the interstate commerce in which appellee is engaged and it can hardly be supposed that the state could compel appellee to purchase there all the gasoline which it uses intrastate upon an interstate journey, because that would be a convenient means of laying and collecting a tax for the use of the highways. There are ways enough in which the state can take its lawful toll without any suppression of the commerce which it taxes. In laying an exaction as a means of collecting compensation for the use of its highways the state must tax the commerce as it is done, and not as it might be done if the state could control it. Appellant cannot justify an unlawful exaction by insisting that it would be lawful if the taxpayer were to relinquish some of the commerce which the Constitution protects from state interference.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK, Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, and Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, dissenting.\n We take a different view. Measured by the oft-repeated judicial rule that every enactment of a legislature carries a presumption of constitutional validity, the Arkansas tax has not, in our opinion, been shown to be beyond all reasonable doubt in violation of the constitutional provision, U.S.C.A.Const. art. 1,  8, cl. 3, that 'Congress shall have Power To ... regulate Commerce ... among the several States.' 'In case of real doubt a law must be sustained.' Mr. Justice Holmes in Interstate Consol. St. Ry. Co. v. Massachusetts, \n207 \nU.S. 79, 88\n, 28 S.Ct. 26, 28, 12 Ann.Cas. 555. 1 Congress, sole constitutional legislative repository of power over that commerce, has \n\n[309 \nU.S. 176, 184]\n\u00a0\n enacted no regulation prohibiting Arkansas from levying a tax-on gasoline in excess of twenty gallons brought into the State-in return for the use of its highways. Gasoline taxes are widely utilized for building and maintaining public roads, and the proceeds of this Arkansas tax are pledged to that end. Arkansas can levy a gallonage tax on any gasoline withdrawn from storage within the State and placed in the tanks of this carrier's vehicles 'notwithstanding that its ultimate function is to generate motive power for carrying on interstate commerce.' Edelman v. Boeing Air Transp., \n289 \nU.S. 249, 252\n, 53 S.Ct. 591, 592. The present tax aims at carriers who would escape such taxation, unless we are to require Arkansas to shape its taxes to the circumstances of each carrier.\n The cost entailed by the construction and maintenance of modern highways creates for the forty-eight States one of their largest financial problems. A major phase of this problem is the proper apportionment of the financial burden between those who use a State's highways for transportation within its borders and those who do so in the course of interstate transportation. Striking a fair balance involves incalculable variants and therefore is beset with perplexities. The making of these exacting adjustments is the business of legislation-that of state legislatures and of Congress. This Court has but a limited responsibility in that state legislation may here be challenged if it discriminates against interstate commerce or is hostile to the congressional grant of authority. McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Coal Mining Company, \n309 \nU.S. 33\n, 60 S.Ct. 388, 84 L.Ed. --, decided January 29, 1940.\n Arkansas' tax hits the big, heavy busses and trucks which, it is well established, entail most serious wear and tear upon roads. Had Arkansas expressly declared the challenged statute to be a means of working out a fair charge upon these heavy vehicles for cost and maintenance of the roads they travel in the State, the relation- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 176, 185]\n\u00a0\n ship between the means employed and these allowable ends-however crude and awkward-would have been rendered more explicit, but not made more evidently a matter of policy and administration, and therefore not for judicial determination. Certainly, the State had power to impose flat fees or taxes graduated according to gasoline used, horsepower, weight and capacity or mileage, and yet those taxes would not measure with exact precision the taxpayers' use of Arkansas highways. \n2\n It is not for us to measure the refinements of fiscal duties which a State may exact from these heavy motor vehicles. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n This case again illustrates the wisdom of the Founders in placing interstate commerce under the protection of Congress. The present problem is not limited to Arkansas, but is of national moment. Maintenance of open channels of trade between the States was not only of paramount importance when our Constitution was framed; it remains today a complex problem calling for national vigilance and regulation.\n Our disagreement with the opinions just announced does not arise from a belief that Federal action is unnecessary to bring about appropriate uniformity in regulations of interstate commerce. Indeed, state legislation recently before this Court indicates quite the contrary. For instance, we sustained the right of South Carolina- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 176, 186]\n\u00a0\n in the absence of congressional prohibition-to regulate the width and weight of interstate trucks using her highways, even though the unassailed findings showed that a substantial amount of interstate commerce would thereby be barred from the State. South Carolina State Highway Dept. v. Barnwell Bros. \n4\n We did not thereby approve the desirability of such state regulations. It is not for us to approve or disapprove. We did decide that 'courts do not sit as Legislatures, either state or national. They cannot act as Congress does when, after weighing all the conflicting interests, state and national, it determines when and how much the state regulatory power shall yield to the larger interests of a national commerce.' \n5\n As both the Union and the State are more and more dependent upon the exercise of their taxing powers for carrying on government, it becomes more and more important that potential conflicts between state and national powers should not be found where Congress has not found them, unless conflict is established by demonstrable concreteness. See Hammond v. Schappi Bus Line, \n275 \nU.S. 164\n, 48 S.Ct. 66.\n Even under the principle enunciated by the majority-that Arkansas may not measure her tax by gasoline carried in appellee's tanks for use in other States-the challenged judgment should not stand.\n Arkansas admittedly has power to tax appellee upon gasoline used within her borders, and need not, of course, extend to appellee any exemption for a reserve. The record discloses that appellee's busses travel 1188.8 miles each day over Arkansas highways. The trial judge found, and there is evidence to support the finding, that these busses use about one gallon of gasoline for every five miles traveled. Thus, appellee uses about 237.76 gallons \n\n[309 \nU.S. 176, 187]\n\u00a0\n of gasoline a day in Arkansas, upon which the tax of 6.5 cents per gallon used would amount to $15.45 a day.\n Appellee's busses travel four different routes, two from Memphis through Arkansas to Missouri, and two from Memphis to cities in Arkansas. On the trips to Missouri the tax now exacted by Arkansas is greater than would be a tax on the gasoline actually used in Arkansas. But on the trips from Memphis into Arkansas and back, the tax exacted, because of the 20- gallon exemption, is less than would be a tax on the gasoline used in Arkansas.\n As appellant points out in his brief, when all the routes are taken together, the daily tax which Arkansas would collect if appellee carried only enough gasoline to complete each trip would only amount to $13.00- actually $2.45 less than a tax on gasoline consumed in Arkansas.\n This amount-$2.45-equals the present tax on 37 gallons of gasoline. Appellee's busses enter Arkansas 13 times each day. It follows that appellee may carry a reserve of almost three gallons on each trip and still pay no more than the tax which, as the majority assumes, Arkansas could constitutionally impose on the gasoline actually consumed on her own roads. There is nothing in the record to show that a greater reserve is necessary. An interstate carrier has no absolute right to fix the size and character of its equipment used in interstate commerce, in total disregard of the necessities of the enterprise and the requirements of States through which the carrier operates. \n6\n Exactions by such States may well be designed to operate upon the quantity of gasoline reserves for considerations analogous to those which have called into being state regulations of the size, weight and number of the vehicles themselves. And a state tax which may induce a reduction in the amount of reserve previously \n\n[309 \nU.S. 176, 188]\n\u00a0\n carried is no more to be condemned on that sole ground alone than is a state law actually prohibiting vehicles above a certain size or weight. That this reduction may be attributable to a tax rather than to a regulatory measure expressly passed in the interests of public safety should not be controlling. Particularly is this so when the proceeds of the tax are utilized exclusively for highway purposes and the tax itself is directed to gasoline used, just as other equipment is used, in the course of interstate business and involves no manifestation of hostility to-or levy upon-gasoline carried as a commodity in interstate commerce. It is presumably safe to rely on appellee's self-interest to work out any schedules of refueling at its various storage facilities necessitated by changes in reserves carried. We cannot believe that appellee is able to attack the constitutionality of this tax on the ground that as to others it might operate differently and serve to burden the use of gasoline in other States. \n7\n It is important to bear in mind that we are not passing upon a statute as such but upon the incidence of this statute in the single concrete situation presented by a specific objector on this specific record. The very fact that such niceties of calculation have to be indulged in as the concurring opinion finds necessary in order to establish the mischief of the statute, makes manifest the 'real doubt' of any showing of unconstitutionality and indicates that a burden of calculation and speculation is assumed in the exercise of the judicial function which should be left to the legislatures of the States and the Congress.\n Judicial control of national commerce-unlike legislative regulations- must from inherent limitations of the judi- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 176, 189]\n\u00a0\n cial process treat the subject by the hit and miss method of deciding single local controversies upon evidence and information limited by the narrow rules of litigation. Spasmodic and unrelated instances of litigation cannot afford an adequate basis for the creation of integrated national rules which alone can afford that full protection for interstate commerce intended by the Constitution. We would, therefore, leave the questions raised by the Arkansas tax for consideration of Congress in a nation-wide survey of the constantly increasing barriers to trade among the States. Unconfined by 'the narrow scope of judicial proceedings'8 Congress alone can, in the exercise of its plenary constitutional control over interstate commerce, not only consider whether such a tax as now under scrutiny is consistent with the best interests of our national economy, but can also on the basis of full exploration of the many aspects of a complicated problem devise a national policy fair alike to the States and our Union. Diverse and interacting state laws may well have created avoidable hardships. See, Comparative Charts of State Statutes illustrating Barriers to Trade between States, Works Progress Administration, May, 1939; Proceedings, The National Conference on Interstate Trade Barriers, The Council of State Governments, 1939. But the remedy, if any is called for, we think is within the ample reach of Congress. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act 67 General Assembly Arkansas, p. 194, approved March 2, 1933-\n'Section 1.

The New York Court of Appeals affirmed without opinion, 281 N.Y. 670, 22 N.E.2d 764, but its amended remittitur declared that the affirmance was upon the sole ground that the taxing statute as applied violated the commerce clause. We granted certiorari December 4, 1939, \n308 \nU.S. 546\n, 60 S.Ct. 261, 84 L.Ed. --, the question presented being of public importance, upon a petition which challenged the decision of the state court as not in accord with applicable decisions of this Court in Banker Brothers v. Pennsylvania, \n222 \nU.S. 210\n, 32 S.Ct. 38; Wiloil Corporation v. Pennsylvania, \n294 \nU.S. 169\n, 55 S.Ct. 358.\n Chapter 815 of the New York Laws of 1933, Ex.Sess., as amended by Chapter 873 of the New York Laws of 1934, Ex. Sess., authorized the City of New York, for a limited period within which the present tax was laid, 'to adopt and amend local laws imposing in (the) city any tax which the legislature has or would have power and authority to impose'. It directed that 'a tax imposed hereunder shall have application only within the territorial limits' of the city; and that 'this act shall not authorize the imposition of a tax on any transaction originating and\/or consummated outside of the territorial limits of (the) city, notwithstanding that some act be necessarily performed with respect to such transaction within such limits'. It required the revenues from the tax to be used exclusively for unemployment relief.\n Pursuant to this authority the municipal assembly of the City of New York Adopted Local Law No. 24 of 1934, p. 164 (published as Local Law No. 25), since, annually renewed, which laid a tax upon purchasers for consumption of tangible personal property generally (except foods and drugs furnished on prescription), of utility services in supplying gas, electricity, telephone service, etc., and of meals consumed in restaurants. By  2 the tax was fixed at 'two per centum upon the amount of the receipts from \n\n[309 \nU.S. 33, 43]\n\u00a0\n every sale in the city of New York', 'sale' being defined by  1(e) as 'any transfer of title or possession, or both ... in any manner or by any means whatsoever for a consideration, or any agreement therefor'. Another clause of  21 commands that the tax 'shall be paid by the purchaser to the vendor, for and on account of the city of New York'. By the same clause the vendor, who is authorized to collect the tax, is required to charge it to the purchaser, separately from the sales price; and is made liable, as an insurer, for its payment to the city. By  4 and 5 the vendor is required to keep records and file returns showing the amount of the receipts from sales and the amount of the tax. In event of its nonpayment to the seller the buyer is required, within fifteen days after his purchase, to file a tax return and to pay the tax to the Comptroller who is authorized by  2 to set up a procedure for the collection of the tax from the purchaser. Purchases for resale are exempt from the tax, and a purchaser who pays the tax and later resells is entitled to a refund.\n The ultimate burden of the tax, both in form and in substance, is thus laid upon the buyer, for consumption, of tangible personal property, and measured by the sales price. Only in event that the seller fails to pay over to the city the tax collected or to charge and collect it as the statute requires, is the burden cast on him. It is conditioned upon events occurring within the state, either \n\n[309 \nU.S. 33, 44]\n\u00a0\n transfer of title or possession of the purchased property, or an agreement within the state, 'consummated' there, for the transfer of title, or possession. The duty of collecting the tax and paying it over to the Comptroller is imposed on the seller in addition to the duty imposed upon the buyer to pay the tax to the Comptroller when not so collected. Such, in substance, has been the construction of the statute by the state courts. Matter of Atlas Television Co., Inc., 273 N.Y. 51, 6 N.E.2d 94; Matter of Merchants Refrigerating Co. v. Taylor, 275 N.Y. 113, 9 N.E.2d 799; Matter of Kesbec, Inc. v. McGoldrick, 278 N.Y. 293, 16 N.E.2d 288.\n Respondent, a Pennsylvania corporation, is engaged in the production of coal of specified grades, said to possess unique qualities, from its mines within that state and in selling it to consumers and dealers. It maintains a sales office in New York City and sells annually to its customers, 1,500,000 tons of its product, of which approximately 1,300,000 tons are delivered by respondent to some twenty public utility and steamship companies. The coal moves by rail from mine to dock in Jersey City, thence in most instances by barge to the point of delivery. All the sales contracts with the New York customers in question were entered into in New York City, and with two exceptions, presently to be considered separately, call for delivery of the coal by respondent by barge, alongside the purchasers' plants or steamships. In many instances the price of the coal was stated to be subject to any increase or decrease of mining costs including wages, and of railroad rates between the mines and the Jersey City terminal to which the coal was to be shipped. All the deliveries, with the exceptions already noted, were made within New York City, and all such are concededly subject to the tax except insofar as it infringes the commerce clause. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 33, 45]\n\u00a0\n Section 8, clause 3, article 1, of the Constitution declares that 'Congress shall have Power ... To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States ....' In imposing taxes for state purposes a state is not exercising any power which the Constitution has conferred upon Congress. It is only when the tax operates to regulate commerce between the states or with foreign nations to an extent which infringes the authority conferred upon Congress, that the tax can be said to exceed constitutional limitations. See Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 187; South Carolina State Highway Dept. v. Barnwell Bros., \n303 \nU.S. 177, 185\n, 58 S.Ct. 510, 513. Forms of state taxation whose tendency is to prohibit the commerce or place it at a disadvantage as compared or in competition with intrastate commerce and any state tax which discriminates against the commerce, are familiar examples of the exercise of state taxing power in an unconstitutional manner, because of its obvious regulatory effect upon commerce between the states. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[309 \nU.S. 33, 46]\n\u00a0\n But it was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce of their just share of state tax burdens, merely because an incidental or consequential effect of the tax is an increase in the cost of doing the business, Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, \n303 \nU.S. 250, 254\n, 58 S.Ct. 546, 548, 115 A.L.R. 944. Not all state taxation is to be condemned because, in some manner, it has an effect upon commerce between the states, and there are many forms of tax whose burdens, when distributed through the play of economic forces, affect interstate commerce, \n\n[309 \nU.S. 33, 47]\n\u00a0\n which nevertheless falls short of the regulation of the commerce which the Constitution leaves to Congress. A tax may be levied on net income wholly derived from interstate commerce. \n3\n Non-discriminatory taxation of the instrumentalities of interstate commerce is not prohibited. \n4\n The like taxation of property, shipped interstate, before its movement begins,5 or after it ends,6 is not a forbidden regulation. An excise for the warehousing of merchandise preparatory to its interstate shipment or upon its use,7 or withdrawal for use,8 by the consignee after the interstate journey has ended is not precluded. Nor is taxation of a local business or occupation which is separate and distinct from the transportation or intercourse which is interstate commerce, forbidden merely because in the ordinary course such transportation or intercourse is induced or occasioned by such business, or is prerequisite to it. Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, supra, 303 U.S. page 253, 58 S.Ct. page 547, 115 A.L.R. 944, and cases cited. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 33, 48]\n\u00a0\n In few of these cases could it be said with assurance that the local tax does not in some measure affect the commerce or increase the cost of doing it. But in them as in other instances of constitutional interpretation so as to insure the harmonious operation of powers reserved to the states with those conferred upon the national government, courts are called upon to reconcile competing constitutional demands, that commerce between the states shall not be unduly impeded by state action, and that the power to lay taxes for the support of state government shall not be unduly curtailed. See Woodruff v. Parham, 8 Wall. 123, 131; Brown v. Houston, \n114 \nU.S. 622\n, 5 S.Ct. 1091; Galveston, H. & S.A.R. Co. v. Texas, \n210 \nU.S. 217, 225\n, 227 S., 28 S.Ct. 638, 639, 640; South Carolina Highway Dept. v. Barnwell Bros., supra; Ford Motor Co. v. Beauchamp, \n308 \nU.S. 331\n, 60 S.Ct. 273, decided December 11, 1939; cf. Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, \n269 \nU.S. 514\n, 523, et seq., 46 S.Ct. 172, 174; Board of County Comm'rs Jackson County, Kansas v. United States, \n308 \nU.S. 343\n, 60 S.Ct. 285, decided December 18, 1939\n\n\n Certain types of tax may, if permitted at all, so readily be made the instrument of impeding or destroying interstate commerce as plainly to call for their condemnation as forbidden regulations. Such are the taxes already noted which are aimed at or discriminate against the commerce or impose a levy for the privilege of doing it, or tax interstate transportation or communication or their gross earnings, or levy an exaction on merchandise in the course of its interstate journey. Each imposes a burden which intrastate commerce does not bear, and merely because interstate commerce is being done places it at a disadvantage in comparison with intrastate business or property in circumstances such that if the asserted power to tax were sustained, the states would be left free to exert it to the detriment of the national commerce.\n The present tax as applied to respondent is without the possibility of such consequences. Equality is its theme, \n\n[309 \nU.S. 33, 49]\n\u00a0\n cf. Henneford v. Silas Mason Co., \n300 \nU.S. 577, 583\n, 57 S.Ct. 524, 527. It does not aim at or discriminate against interstate commerce. It is laid upon every purchaser, within the state, of goods for consumption, regardless of whether they have been transported in interstate commerce. Its only relation to the commerce arises from the fact that immediately preceding transfer of possession to the purchaser within the state, which is the taxable event regardless of the time and place of passing title, the merchandise has been transported in interstate commerce and brought to its journey's end. Such a tax has no different effect upon interstate commerce than a tax on the 'use' of property which has just been moved in interstate commerce sustained in Monamotor Oil Co. v. Johnson, \n292 \nU.S. 86\n, 54 S.Ct. 575; Henneford v. Silas Mason Co., supra; Felt & Tarrant Mfg. Co. v. Gallagher, \n306 \nU.S. 62\n, 59 S. Ct. 376; Southern Pacific Co. v. Gallagher, \n306 \nU.S. 167\n, 59 S.Ct. 389, or the tax on storage or withdrawal for use by the consignee of gasoline, similarly sustained in Gregg Dyeing Co. v. Query, \n286 \nU.S. 472\n, 52 S.Ct. 631, 84 A.L.R. 831; Nashville, C. & St. L. Ry. Co. v. Wallace, \n288 \nU.S. 249\n, 53 S.Ct. 345, 87 A.L.R. 1191; Edelman v. Boeing Air Transport Co., \n289 \nU.S. 249\n, 53 S.Ct. 591, or the familiar property tax on goods by the state of destination at the conclusion of their interstate journey. Brown v. Houston, supra; American Steel & Wire Co. v. Speed, \n192 \nU.S. 500\n, 24 S.Ct. 365.\n If, as guides to decision we look to the purpose of the commerce clause to protect interstate commerce from discriminatory or destructive state action, and at the same time to the purpose of the state taxing power under which interstate commerce admittedly must bear its fair share of state tax burdens, and to the necessity of judicial reconciliation of these competing demands, we can find no adequate ground for saying that the present tax is a regulation which, in the absence of Congressional action \n\n[309 \nU.S. 33, 50]\n\u00a0\n the commerce clause forbids. \n9\n This Court has uniformly sustained a tax imposed by the state of the buyer upon a sale of goods, in several instances in the 'original package', effected by delivery to the purchaser upon arrival at destination after an interstate journey, both when the local seller has purchased the goods extra-state for the purpose of resale, Woodruff v. Parham, supra; Hinson v. Lott, 8 Wall. 148; Banker Bros. v. Pennsylvania, supra; Wiloil Corp. v. Pennsylvania, supra; Graybar Electric Co. v. Curry, \n308 \nU.S. 513\n, 60 S.Ct. 139, 84 L.Ed. --; Id ., Ala.Sup., 189 So. 186, and when the extrastate seller has shipped them into the taxing state for sale there. Hinson v. Lott, supra; Sonneborn Bros. v. Cureton, \n262 \nU.S. 506\n, 43 S.Ct. 643. It has likewise sustained a fixed-sum license tax imposed on the agent of the interstate seller for the privilege of selling merchandise brought into the taxing state for the purpose of sale. Howe Machine Co. v. Gage, \n100 \nU.S. 676\n; Emert v. Missouri, \n156 \nU.S. 296\n, 15 S.Ct. 367; Kehrer v. Stewart, \n197 \nU.S. 60\n, 25 S.Ct. 403; Baccus v. Louisiana, \n232 \nU.S. 334\n, 34 S.Ct. 439; Wagner v. Covington, \n251 \nU.S. 95, 104\n, 40 S.Ct. 93, 168.\n The only challenge made to these controlling authorities is by reference to unconstitutional 'burdens' on interstate commerce made in general statements which are inapplicable here because they are torn from their setting in judicial opinions and speak of state regulations or taxes of a different kind laid in different circumstances from those with which we are now concerned. See for example, Galveston, H. & S.A.R. Co. v. Texas, supra; Cooney v. Mountain States Telephone Co., \n294 \nU.S. 384\n, 55 S.Ct. 477; Fisher's Blend Station v. Tax Commission, \n297 \nU.S. 650\n, 56 S. Ct. 608. Others will presently be discussed. But unless we are now to reject the plain teaching of this line of sales tax \n\n[309 \nU.S. 33, 51]\n\u00a0\n decisions, extending back for more than seventy years from Graybar Electric Co. v. Curry, supra, decided this term, to Woodruff v. Parham, supra, the present tax must be upheld. As we have seen, the ruling of these decisions does not rest on precedent alone. It has the support of reason and of a due regard for the just balance between national and state power. In sustaining these taxes on sales emphasis was placed on the circumstances that they were not so laid, measured or conditioned as to afford a means of obstruction to the commerce or of discrimination against it, and that the extension of the immunity of the commerce clause contended for would be at the expense of state taxing power by withholding from taxation property and transactions within the state without the gain of any needed protection to interstate commerce. Woodruff v. Parham, supra, 8 Wall. page 137, 140; Hinson v. Lott, supra, 8 Wall. page 152; Sonneborn Bros. v. Cureton, supra, 262 U.S. pages 513, 514, 521, 43 S.Ct. pages 645, 648; Wiloil Corp. v. Pennsylvania, supra, 294 U.S. page 174, 55 S.Ct. page 359; cf. Brown v. Houston, supra; Henneford v. Silas Mason Co., supra, 300 U.S. page 583, 57 S.Ct. page 527.10 \n\n[309 \nU.S. 33, 52]\n\u00a0\n Apart from these more fundamental considerations which we think are of controlling force in the application of the commerce clause, we can find no adequate basis for distinguishing the present tax laid on the sale or purchase of goods upon their arrival at destination at the end of an interstate journey from the tax which may be laid in like fashion on the property itself. That the latter is a permissible tax has long been established by an unwavering line of authority. Brown v. Houston, supra; Coe v. Errol, \n116 \nU.S. 517\n, 6 S.Ct. 475; Pittsburgh & So. Coal Co. v. Bates, \n156 \nU.S. 577\n, 15 S.Ct. 415; American Steel & Wire Co. v. Speed, supra, 192 U.S. page 520, 24 S.Ct. page 370; General Oil Co. v. Crain, \n209 \nU.S. 211\n, 28 S.Ct. 475; Bacon v. Illinois, \n227 \nU.S. 504\n, 33 S.Ct. 299. As we have often pointed out, there is no distinction in this relationship between a tax on property, the sum of all the rights and powers incident to ownership, and the taxation of the exercise of some of its constitutent elements. Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Ry. Co. v. Wallace, supra, 288 U.S. page 267, 268, 53 S.Ct. page 350, 87 A.L.R. 1191; Henneford v. Silas Mason Co., supra, 300 U.S. page 582, 57 S.Ct. page 526; cf. Bromley v. McCaughn, \n\n[309 \nU.S. 33, 53]\n\u00a0\n \n280 \nU.S. 124\n, 136-138, 50 S.Ct. 46, 47, 48. If coal situated as that in the present case, was before its delivery, subject to a state property tax, see Brown v. Houston, supra; Pittsburgh & So. Coal Co. v. Bates, supra; transfer of possession of the coal upon a sale is equally taxable, see Wiloil Corporation v. Pennsylvania, supra, 294 U.S. page 175, 55 S.Ct. page 360, just as was the storage or use of the property in similar circumstances held taxable in Nashville, Chattanooga & St. L.R. Co. v. Wallace, supra; Henneford v. Silas Mason Co., supra.\n Respondent, pointing to the course of its business and to its contracts which contemplate the shipment of the coal interstate upon orders of the New York customers, insists that a distinction is to be taken between a tax laid on sales made, without previous contract, after the merchandise has crossed the state boundary, and sales, the contracts for which when made contemplate or require the transportation of merchandise interstate to the taxing \n\n[309 \nU.S. 33, 54]\n\u00a0\n state. Only the sales in the state of destination in the latter class of cases, it is said, are protected from taxation by the commerce clause, a qualification which respondent concedes is a salutary limitation upon the reach of the clause since its use is thus precluded as a means of avoiding state taxation of merchandise transported to the state in advance of the purchase order or contract of sale.\n But we think this distinction is without the support of reason or authority. A very large part, if not most of the merchandise sold in New York City, is shipped interstate to that market. In the case of products like cotton, citrus fruits and coal, not to mention many others which are consumed there in vast quantities, all have crossed the state line to seek a market, whether in fulfillment of a contract or not. That is equally the case with other goods sent from without the state to the New York market, whether they are brought into competition with like goods produced within the state or not. We are unable to say that the present tax, laid generally upon all sales to consumers within the state, subjects the commerce involved where the goods sold are brought from other states, to any greater burden or affects it more, in any economic or practical way, whether the purchase order or contract precedes or follows the interstate shipment. Since the tax applies only if a sale is made, and in either case the object of interstate shipment is a sale at destination, the deterrent effect of the tax would seem to be the same on both. Restriction of the scope of the commerce clause so as to prevent recourse to it as a means of curtailing state taxing power seems as salutary in the one case as in the other.\n True, the distinction has the support of a statement obiter in Sonneborn Bros. v. Cureton, supra, 262 U.S. page 515, 43 S.Ct. page 646 and seems to have been tacitly recognized in Ware & Leland v. Mobile County, \n209 \nU.S. 405, 412\n, 28 S.Ct. 526, 528, 14 Ann. Cas. 1031, and Banker Bros. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 33, 55]\n\u00a0\n Co. v. Pennsylvania, supra, although in each case a tax on the sale of goods brought into the state for sale was upheld. But we have sustained the tax where the course of business and the agreement for sale plainly contemplated the shipment interstate in fulfilment of the contract. Wiloil Corporation v. Pennsylvania, supra, 294 U.S. page 173, 55 S.Ct. page 359; Graybar Electric Co. v. Curry, supra. In the same circumstances the Court has upheld a property tax on the merchandise transported, American Steel & Wire Co. v. Speed, supra; General Oil Co. v. Crain, supra; see Bacon v. Illinois, supra, 227 U.S. page 515, 516, 33 S. Ct. page 303; upon its use, Monamotor Oil Co. v. Johnson, supra; Felt & Tarrant Co. v. Gallagher, supra, and upon its storage; cf. Gregg Dyeing Co. v. Query, supra; Nashville, c. & St. L. Ry. Co. v. Wallace, supra. Taxation of property or the exercise of a power over it immediately preceding its previously contemplated shipment interstate has been similarly sustained. Coe v. Errol; Bacon v. Illinois, supra; Federal Compress & Warehouse Co. v. McLean, \n291 \nU.S. 17\n, 54 S.Ct. 267. For reasons already indicated all such taxes upon property or the exercise of the powers of ownership stand in no different relation to interstate commerce and have no different effect upon it than has the present sales tax upon goods whose shipment interstate into the taxing state was contemplated when the contract was entered into.\n It is also urged that the conclusion which we reach is inconsistent with the long line of decisions of this Court following Robbins v. Shelby County Taxing District, \n120 \nU.S. 489\n, 7 S.Ct. 592, which have held invalid license taxes to the extent that they have sought to tax the occupation of soliciting orders for the purchase of goods to be shipped into the taxing state. In some instances the tax appeared to be aimed at suppression or placing at a disadvantage this type of business when brought into competition with competing intrastate sales. See Robbins v. Shelby County \n\n[309 \nU.S. 33, 56]\n\u00a0\n Taxing District, supra, 120 U.S. page 498, 7 S.Ct. page 596; Caldwell v. North Carolina, \n187 \nU.S. 622, 632\n, 23 S.Ct. 229, 233.11 In all, the statute, in its practical operation, was capable of use, through increase in the tax, and in fact operated to some extent to place the merchant thus doing business interstate at a disadvantage in competition with untaxed sales at retail stores within the state. While a state, in some circumstances may, by taxation suppress or curtail one type of intrastate business to the advantage of another type of competing business which is left untaxed, see Puget Sound Power & Light Co. v. Seattle, \n291 \nU.S. 619, 625\n, 54 S.Ct. 542, 545, and cases cited, it does not follow that interstate commerce may be similarly affected by the practical operation of a state taxing statute. Compare Hammond Packing Co. v. Montana, \n233 \nU.S. 331\n, 34 S.Ct. 596, Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, \n292 \nU.S. 40\n, 54 S.Ct. 599, with Schollenberger v. Pennsylvania, \n171 \nU.S. 1\n, 18 S.Ct. 757; Robbins v. Shelby County Taxing District supra; Sprout v. South Bend, \n277 \nU.S. 163\n, 48 S.Ct. 502, 62 A.L.R. 45. It is enough for present pur- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 33, 57]\n\u00a0\n poses that the rule of Robbins v. Shelby County Taxing District, supra, has been narrowly limited to fixed-sum license taxes imposed on the business of soliciting orders for the purchase of goods to be shipped interstate. Compare Robbins v. Shelby County Taxing District, supra, with Ficklen v. Shelby County Taxing District, \n145 \nU.S. 1\n, 12 S.Ct. 810, see Howe Machine Co. v. Gage, supra; Wagner v. Covington, supra; and that the actual and potential effect on the commerce of such a tax is wholly wanting in the present case.\n Finally it is said that the vice of the present tax is that it is measured by the gross receipts from interstate commerce and thus in effect reaches for taxation the commerce carried on both within and without the taxing state. Adams Manufacturing Co. v. Storen, \n304 \nU.S. 307\n, 58 S.Ct. 913, 117 A.L.R. 429; Gwin, White & Prince v. Henneford, supra; cf. Western Live Stock v. Bureau, supra, 303 U.S. page 260, 58 S.Ct. page 550, 115 A.L.R. 944. It is true that a state tax upon the operations of interstate commerce measured either by its volume or the gross receipts derived from it has been held to infringe the commerce clause, because the tax if sustained would exact tribute for the commerce carried on beyond the boundaries of the taxing state, and would leave each state through which the commerce passes free to subject it to like burden not borne by intrastate commerce. See Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, supra, 303 U.S. page 255, 58 S.Ct. page 548, 115 A. L.R. 944; Gwin, White & Prince v. Henneford, supra, 305 U.S. page 439, 59 S.Ct. page 327.\n In Adams Manufacturing Co. v. Storen, supra, 304 U.S. pages 311, 312, 58 S.Ct. pages 915, 916, 117 A.L.R. 429, a tax on gross receipts, so far as laid by the state of the seller upon the receipts from sales of goods manufactured in the taxing state and sold in other states, was held invalid because there the court found the receipts derived from activities in interstate commerce, as distinguished from the receipts from activities wholly intrastate, were included in the measure of the tax, the sales price, without segregation or apportionment. It was pointed out, \n\n[309 \nU.S. 33, 58]\n\u00a0\n pages 310, 311 and 312, of 304 U.S., at pages 915, 916, of 58 S.Ct., 117 A.L.R. 429, that had the tax been conditioned upon the exercise of the taxpayer's franchise or its privilege of manufacturing in the taxing state, it would have been sustained, despite its incidental effect on interstate commerce since the taxpayer's local activities or privileges were sufficient to support such a tax, and that it could fairly be measured by the sales price of the goods. Compare American Manufacturing Co. v. St. Louis, \n250 \nU.S. 459\n, 39 S.Ct. 522 with Crew Levick Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n245 \nU.S. 292\n, 38 S.Ct. 126. See Western Live Stock v. Bureau, supra, 303 U.S. pages 257-259, 58 S. Ct. pages 549, 550, 115 A.L.R. 944; cf. Bass, Ratcliff & Gretton v. State Tax Commission, \n266 \nU.S. 271, 280\n, 45 S.Ct. 82, 83; Educational Films Corp. v. Ward, \n282 \nU.S. 379, 387\n, 388 S., 51 S.Ct. 170, 171, 71 A.L.R. 1226; Pacific Co., Ltd. v. Johnson, \n285 \nU.S. 480\n, 52 S.Ct. 424.\n The rationale of the Adams Manufacturing Co. case does not call for condemnation of the present tax. Here the tax is conditioned upon a local activity delivery of goods within the state upon their purchase for consumption. It is an activity which apart from its effect on the commerce, is subject to the state taxing power. The effect of the tax, even though measured by the sales price, as has been shown, neither discriminates against nor obstructs interstate commerce more than numerous other state taxes which have repeatedly been sustained as involving no prohibited regulation of interstate commerce.\n In two instances already noted, respondent's contracts with Austin, Nichols & Co., and with the New England Steamship Company call for delivery of the coal at points outside of New York, in the one case f.o.b. at the mines in Pennsylvania, and in the other at the pier in Jersey City, New Jersey, and deliveries were made accordingly.\n Respondent asked the state courts to rule that the taxing act did not apply to these transactions, particularly because the enabling statute expressly prohibits the city from imposing a tax upon 'any transaction originating and\/or consummated outside of the territorial limits of (the) city'. See Matter of Gunther's Sons v. McGoldrick, \n\n[309 \nU.S. 33, 59]\n\u00a0\n 279 N.Y. 148, 18 N.E.2d 12. This question the state courts left unanswered, the Court of Appeals resting its decision wholly on the constitutional ground.\n Upon the remand of this cause for further proceedings not inconsistent with this decision, the state court will be free to decide the state question, and the remand will be without prejudice to the further presentation to this Court of any federal question remaining undecided here, if the state court shall determine that the taxing statute is applicable.\n Reversed and remanded.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES, dissenting.\n The pressure of mounting outlays has led the States to seek new sources of revenue, and we have gone far in sustaining state power to tax property and transactions subject to their jurisdiction despite incidental or indirect effects upon interstate commerce. But hitherto we have also maintained the principle that the States cannot lay a direct tax upon that commerce. In the instant case, the Court of Appeals of New York has decided unanimously that the tax as here applied is such a tax and goes beyond the limit of state power. 281 N.Y. 670, 22 N.E.2d 764. See, also, Matter of National Cash Register Co. v. Taylor, 276 N.Y. 208, 11 N.E.2d 881. I think that the judgment should be affirmed.\n The case is one of interstate commerce in its most obvious form. The Berwind-White Company is a Pennsylvania corporation engaged in mining coal in that State. It has a sales' office in New York. Its coal is mined from two veins known as 'B Seam' and 'C Prime Seam'. The coal is sold to New York consumers for plants and steamships. The contracts of sale call for coal from the seller's mines in Pennsylvania, most of it being of the 'B Seam' sort. The contracts are generally for a specified period, orders being given as coal is needed. The pur- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 33, 60]\n\u00a0\n chasers notify the mining company of their requests, whereupon the coal is mined to meet the orders, two days being allowed for mining and five for transportation. The coal is transported from the mines by railroad to a pier in Jersey City where the seller's barges take the coal and bring it alongside the purchasers' plant or steamship where delivery is made, the purchasers doing the unloading. There were two purchasers who took delivery outside New York.\n The tax is two per cent of the entire purchase price. The Court of Appeals has described the tax as 'two per cent upon receipts from every sale of tangible personal property sold within the city'. Matter of Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. McGoldrick, 279 N.Y. 184, 197, 18 N.E.2d 25, 26. There can be no doubt as to the incidence of the tax in this instance. The Comptroller of the City has assessed the tax against the seller, the Berwind-White Company. The statute requires the seller, under penalty, to file a return of its sales and to pay the tax. To enforce the payment, the property of the seller may be levied upon under a Comptroller's warrant. It is the tax so laid that the City now demands. In the Matter of Atlas Television Co., 273 N.Y. 51, 57, 58, 6 N.E.2d 94, 96, the Court of Appeals held that the contention that the seller was required only to collect the tax as the agent of the City could not be sustained and hence it was decided that in case of the seller's insolvency the City was entitled to priority of payment. The court said: 'The duty of payment to the city is laid upon the vendor, not the purchaser. His liability is not measured by the amount actually collected from the purchaser but by the receipts required to be included in such return. Section 6. He must pay the tax even if failure to collect is due to no fault of his own'. This statement was repeated in Matter of Merchants Refrigerating Co. v. Taylor, 275 N.Y. 113, 118, 9 N.E.2d 799, and while it was there said that the \n\n[309 \nU.S. 33, 61]\n\u00a0\n Atlas case did not hold that the sales tax was 'imposed' on the vendor, still the court again ruled that the vendor 'is under a duty to pay the tax to the city regardless of whether or not the vendor collects it from the purchaser'. Id., 275 N.Y. page 124, 9 N.E.2d page 803. If the vendor must pay the tax whether or not he can recoup the amount from the purchaser, and the tax, as here, is assessed against the vendor, it would seem inadmissible to defend the tax upon the ground that it is a tax upon the purchaser. From any point of view, the tax now contested is laid upon interstate sales.\n In confiding to Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce, the aim was to provide a free national market,-to pull down and prevent the re-erection of state barriers to the free intercourse between the people of the States. That free intercourse was deemed, and has proved, to be essential to our national economy. It should not be impaired. As we recently said in Baldwin v. Seelig, \n294 \nU.S. 511, 522\n, 55 S.Ct. 497, 500, 101 A.L.R. 55: 'Imposts and duties upon interstate commerce are placed beyond the power of a state, without the mention of an exception, by the provision committing commerce of that order to the power of the Congress. ... 'It is the established doctrine of this court that a state may not, in any form or under any guise, directly burden the prosecution of interstate business.\"\n Undoubtedly the problem of maintaining the proper balance between state and national power has been a most difficult one. We have recognized the power of the State to meet local exigencies in protecting health and safety and preventing fraud, as, for example, in the case of quarantine, pilotage and inspection laws, although interstate or foreign commerce is involved; that is, until Congress in the exercise of its paramount authority displaces such local requirements. \n1\n We have also recognized the \n\n[309 \nU.S. 33, 62]\n\u00a0\n power of the State to tax property subject to its jurisdiction although the property has come from another State, when it is found that interstate commerce has ended and that the property has become a part of the common mass within the State. We have sustained the authority of the State to impose occupation taxes when they were deemed to be so measured or apportioned as to relate appropriately to the privilege of transacting an intrastate business. The application of these principles has led to close distinctions. \n2\n But that fact would seem to present no good reason for sweeping away the protection of interstate commerce where the State lays a direct tax upon that commerce as in this case.\n We have said in a long line of decisions, that the States cannot tax interstate commerce either by laying the tax upon the business which constitutes such commerce or the privilege of engaging in it, or upon the receipts, as such, derived from it. \n3\n The same principle has been declared in recent cases. In Fisher's Blend Station v. Tax Commission, \n297 \nU.S. 650, 655\n, 56 S.Ct. 608, 610, we said: 'As appellant's income is derived from interstate commerce, the tax, measured by appellant's gross income, is of a type which \n\n[309 \nU.S. 33, 63]\n\u00a0\n has long been held to be an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce'. There, a state occupation tax upon the gross receipts of the owner of a radio station from broadcasting programs to listeners within and beyond the State was held invalid. It was said to be enough that the tax was levied on gross receipts from the proprietor's 'entire operations, which include interstate commerce'. Id., 297 U.S. page 656, 56 S.Ct. page 610. In Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, \n303 \nU.S. 250\n, 58 S.Ct. 546, 115 A.L.R. 944, a tax on the gross receipts from the sale of advertising by a trade journal was sustained because in the last analysis the tax, like that upon the privilege of manufacturing within the State, was upon the carrying on of a local business in the preparing, printing and publishing a magazine. Id., 303 U. S. page 258, 58 S.Ct. page 549, 115 A.L.R. 944. Soon after, we held in Adams Manufacturing Company v. Storen, \n304 \nU.S. 307, 311\n, 58 S. Ct. 913, 915, 117 A.L.R. 429, that a state tax could not be constitutionally applied to the gross receipts derived by an Indiana corporation in interstate commerce through the sale of its products manufactured in Indiana to customers in other States. And, but a year ago, in Gwin, White & Prince v. Henneford, \n305 \nU.S. 435, 436\n, 438 S., 59 S.Ct. 325, 326, 327, we held invalid a state tax measured by the gross receipts from the business of marketing fruit shipped in interstate commerce from the State of production to places in other States where the sales and deliveries were made and the proceeds collected. If the question now before us is controlled by precedent, the result would seem to be clear.\n In relation to the present transaction, it would hardly be contended that New York could tax the transportation of the coal from Pennsylvania to New York or a contract for that transportation. But the movement of the coal from the one State to the other was definitely required by the contracts of sale and these sales must be regarded as an essential part of the commercial inter- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 33, 64]\n\u00a0\n course contemplated by the commerce clause. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat, 1, 188. The tax on the gross receipts of the seller from these sales was manifestly an imposition upon the sales themselves. Whether the tax be small or large, it is plainly to the extent of it a burden upon interstate commerce; and as it is imposed immediately upon the gross receipts from that commerce, it is a direct burden. And, as we have often said, where what is taxed is subject to the jurisdiction of the State, the size of the tax lies within the discretion of the State, and not of this Court. A. Magnano Company v. Hamilton, \n292 \nU.S. 40, 45\n, 54 S.Ct. 599, 601. See, also, Alaska Fish Salting & By-Products Company v. Smith, \n255 \nU.S. 44, 48\n, 41 S.Ct. 219, 220.\n How then can the laying of such a burden upon interstate commerce be justified? It is urged that there is a taxable event within the State. That event is said to be the delivery of the coal. But how can that event be deemed to be taxable by the State? The delivery is but the necessary performance of the contract of sale. Like the shipment from the mines, it is an integral part of the interstate transaction. It is said that title to the coal passes to the purchaser on delivery. But the place where the title passes has not been regarded as the test of the interstate character of a sale. We have frequently decided that where a commodity is mined or manufactured in one State and in pursuance of contracts of sale is delivered for transportation to purchasers in another State, the mere fact that the sale is f.o.b. cars in the seller's State and the purchaser pays the freight does not make the sale other than interstate. \n4\n And when, as here, the buyer in an interstate sale takes delivery in his own \n\n[309 \nU.S. 33, 65]\n\u00a0\n State, that delivery in completion of the sale is as properly immune from state taxation as is the transportation to the purchaser's dock or vessel. Moreover, even if it were possible to sustain a state tax by reason of such delivery within the State, there would still be no ground for sustaining a tax upon the whole of the interstate transaction of which the delivery is only a part, as in the case of a tax upon the entire gross receipts.\n Petitioner strongly insists that in substance the tax here should be regarded as the same as a use tax the validity of which this Court has sustained. Henneford v. Silas Mason Co., \n300 \nU.S. 577\n, 57 S.Ct. 524; Southern Pacific Company v. Gallagher, \n306 \nU.S. 167\n, 59 S.Ct. 389. But in the Henneford case, Mr. Justice Cardozo, in speaking for the Court, was most careful to show that the use tax was upheld because it was imposed after interstate commerce had come to an end. In making this distinction, the Court clearly recognized that a tax imposed directly upon interstate commerce would be beyond the State's power, and the tax was sustained as one upon property which had come to rest within the State and like other property was subject to its jurisdiction. The Court said: 'The tax is not upon the operations of interstate commerce, but upon the privilege of use after commerce is at an end. ... The privilege of use is only one attribute, among many, of the bundle of privileges that make up property or ownership'. Id., 300 U.S. page 582, 57 S.Ct. page 526. And later, in Puget Sound Company v. State Tax Commission, \n302 \nU.S. 90, 92\n, 94 S., 58 S.Ct. 72, 73, 74, Mr. Justice Cardozo in delivering the opinion of the Court, after showing that the business of the company, so far as it consisted of the loading and discharge of cargoes by longshoremen subject to its own control, was interstate or foreign commerce, concluded that the State was 'not at liberty to tax the privilege of doing it by exacting in return therefor a percentage of the gross receipts'. He observed that 'De- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 33, 66]\n\u00a0\n cisions to that effect are many and controlling'. The fact that a use tax, sustained as a tax upon an attribute of property which is subject to the jurisdiction of the State, may have an incidental or indirect effect upon interstate commerce, and thus in the opinion of commentators may tend to discourage interstate transactions, is certainly no excuse for going further and upholding the action of States which, looking with a jealous eye upon the freedom of interstate commerce, attempt to lay a direct tax upon that commerce.\n The point was clearly brought out by Mr. Justice Holmes, speaking for the Court in Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Railway Co. v. Texas, \n210 \nU.S. 217, 227\n, 28 S.Ct. 638, 640, when he referred to the necessity of maintaining the distinction between taxation of property within the State, which had long been upheld, and taxation of interstate business which had been condemned. He observed that 'When a legislature is trying simply to value property, it is less likely to attempt or to effect injurious regulation than when it is aiming directly at the receipts from interstate commerce'. Accordingly a state tax upon gross receipts which included receipts from interstate business was held invalid.\n The ground most strongly asserted for sustaining the tax in the present case is that it is non-discriminatory. Undoubtedly a state tax may be bad because it is so laid as to involve a hostile discrimination against interstate commerce. But does it follow that a State may lay a direct tax upon interstate commerce because it is free to tax its own commerce in a similar way? Thus, a State may tax intrastate transportation, but it may not tax interstate transportation. The State may tax intrastate sales,5 but can the State tax interstate sales in order to promote its local business? It would seem to be extra- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 33, 67]\n\u00a0\n ordinary if a State could escape the restriction against direct impositions upon interstate commerce by first laying exactions upon its own trade and then insistent that in order to make its local policy completely effective it must be allowed to lay similar exactions upon interstate trade. That would apparently afford a simple method for extending state power into what has hitherto been regarded as a forbidden field. Moreover, it may or may not be in the interest of the State to promote domestic trade in a given commodity. The State may seek by its taxing scheme to restrict such trade and the mere equivalency of a tax upon domestic business would not prevent the injurious effect upon interstate transactions. See A. Magnano Company v. Hamilton, supra.\n So, while recognizing that a tax discriminating against interstate commerce is necessarily invalid, it has long been held by this Court in the interest of the constitutional freedom of that commerce that a direct tax upon it is not saved because the same or a similar tax is laid also upon intrastate commerce. The Court dealt specifically with that question in Robbins v. Shelby County Taxing District, \n120 \nU.S. 489, 497\n, 7 S.Ct. 592, 596, saying: 'Interstate commerce cannot be taxed at all, even though the same amount of tax should be laid on domestic commerce, or that which is carried on solely within the state'. See, also, Cooney v. Mountain States Telephone Co., \n294 \nU.S. 384, 393\n, 394 S., 55 S.Ct. 477, 482. And very recently, in Adams Manufacturing Company v. Storen, supra, 304 U.S. page 312, 58 S.Ct. page 916, 117 A.L.R. 429, where a tax on the gross receipts derived from interstate sales was held invalid, we said explicitly: 'The opinion of the State Supreme Court stresses the generality and nondiscriminatory character of the exaction but it is settled that this will not save the tax if it directly burdens interstate commerce'.\n We have directed attention to a vice in imposing direct taxes upon interstate commerce in that such taxes might \n\n[309 \nU.S. 33, 68]\n\u00a0\n be imposed with equal right by every State which the commerce touches. This has been observed with respect to taxes upon gross receipts from interstate transactions. In Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, supra, 303 U.S. page 256, 58 S.Ct. page 549, 115 A.L.R. 944, we said: 'The multiplication of state taxes measured by the gross receipts from interstate transactons would spell the destruction of interstate commerce and renew the barriers to interstate trade which it was the object of the commerce clause to remove'. See, also, Gwin, White & Prince v. Henneford, supra. But petitioner has insisted that in the present case there is no danger or multiple taxation in that New York puts its tax upon an event which cannot occur in any other State. Of course the delivery of the coal in New York is an event which cannot occur in another State. Just as New York cannot tax the shipment of coal from the mines in Pennsylvania or the transshipment of the coal in New Jersey, so neither Pennsylvania nor New Jersey can tax the delivery in New York. Petitioner's argument misses the point as to the danger of multiple taxation in relation to interstate commerce. The shipment, the transshipment and the delivery of the coal are but parts of a unitary interstate transaction. They are integral parts of an interstate sale. If, because of the delivery in New York, that State can tax the gross receipts from the sale, why cannot Pennsylvania by reason of the shipment of the coal in that State tax the gross receipts there? That would not be difficult, as the seller is a Pennsylvania corporation and in fact in many, if not in most, instances, the purchase price of the goods shipped to New York is there received. The point is not that the delivery in New York is an event which cannot be taxed by other States, but that the authority of New York to impose a tax on that delivery cannot properly be recognized without also recognizing the authority of other States to tax \n\n[309 \nU.S. 33, 69]\n\u00a0\n the parts of the interstate transaction which take place within their borders. If New York can tax the delivery, Pennsylvania can tax the shipment and New Jersey the transshipment. And the latter States, respectively, would be as much entitled to tax the gross receipts from the sales as would New York. Even if it were assumed that the gross receipts from the interstate sales could be apportioned so that each State could tax such portion of the receipts as could be deemed to relate to the part of the transaction within its territory, still this would not help New York here, as there has been no attempt at apportionment. The taxation of the gross receipts in New York, on any appropriate view of what pertains to the interstate sales, would seem clearly to involve the danger of multiple taxation to which we have adverted in recent decisions.\n Doubtless much can be said as to the desirability of a comprehensive system of taxation through the cooperation of the Union and the States so as to avoid the differentiations which beset the application of the commerce clause and thus to protect both state and national governments by a just and general scheme for raising revenues. However important such a policy may be, it is not a matter for this Court. We have the duty of maintaining the immunity of interstate commerce as contemplated by the Constitution. That immunity still remains an essential buttress of the Union, and a free national market, so far as it can be preserved without violence to state power over the subjects within state jurisdiction, is not less now than heretofore a vital concern of the national economy.\n The tax as here applied is open to the same objection as a tariff upon the entrance of the coal into the State of New York, or a state tax upon the privilege of doing an interstate business, and in my view it cannot be sus- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 33, 70]\n\u00a0\n tained without abandoning principles long established and a host of precedents soundly based.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice ROBERTS join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Upon each taxable sale or service the tax to be collected shall be stated and charged separately from the sale price or charge for service and shown separately on any record thereof, at the time when the sale is made or evidence of sale issued or employed by the vendor and shall be paid by the purchaser to the vendor, for and on account of the city of New York, and the vendor shall be liable for the collection or the service rendered; and the vendor shall have the same right in respect to collecting the tax from the purchaser, or in respect to non-payment of the tax by the purchaser, as if the tax were a part of the purchase price of the property or service and payable at the time of the sale.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Despite mechanical or artificial distinctions sometimes taken between the taxes deemed permissible and those condemned, the decisions appear to be predicated on a practical judgment as to the likelihood of the tax being used to place interstate commerce at a competitive disadvantage. See Galveston, H. & S.A.R. Co. v. Texas, \n210 \nU.S. 217, 227\n, 28 S.Ct. 638. License taxes requiring a corporation engaged in interstate commerce to pay a fee of a certain percentage of its capital stock have been rejected because of the danger that each state in which the corporation does business may impose a similar tax, measured by its interstate business in all, Western Union Tel. Co. v. Kansas, \n216 \nU.S. 1\n, 30 S.Ct. 190; Atchison, T. & S.F. Ry. Co. v. O'Connor, \n223 \nU.S. 280\n, 32 S.Ct. 216, Ann.Cas. 1913C, 1050; Looney v.

Massachusetts, \n246 \nU.S. 135\n, 38 S.Ct. 292, Ann.Cas.1918C, 617, and have only been sustained when apportioned to that part of the capital thought to be attributable to an intrastate activity. National Leather Co. v. Massachusetts, \n277 \nU.S. 413\n, 48 S.Ct. 534; International Shoe Co. v. Shartel, \n279 \nU.S. 429\n, 49 S.Ct. 380; Ford Motor Co. v. Beauchamp, \n308 \nU.S. 331\n, 60 S.Ct. 273, No. 17, October Term, 1939, decided December 11, 1939. Privilege taxes requiring a percentage of the gross receipts from interstate transportation or from other activities in carrying on the movement of that commerce, which if sustained, could be imposed wherever the interstate activity occurs, have been struck down for similar reasons. Fargo v. Michigan, \n121 \nU.S. 230\n, 7 S.Ct. 857; Philadelphia & S.M. Steamship Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n122 \nU.S. 326\n, 7 S.Ct. 1118; Leloup v.

Fixed-sum license fees, regardless of the amount, for the privilege of carrying on the commerce, have been thought likely to be used to overburden the interstate commerce, McCall v. People of California, \n136 \nU.S. 104\n, 10 S.Ct. 881; Crutcher v. Kentucky, \n141 \nU.S. 47\n, 11 S.Ct. 851; Barrett v.

New Orleans, \n264 \nU.S. 150\n, 44 S.Ct. 242, 34 A.L.R. 907. \n Taxation of articles in course of their movement in interstate commerce is similarly foreclosed. Case of State Freight Tax, 15 Wall. 232; Champlain Realty Co. v. Brattleboro, \n260 \nU.S. 366\n, 43 S.Ct. 146, 25 A.L.R. 1195; Hughes Bros. Co. v. Minnesota, \n272 \nU.S. 469\n, 47 S.

Lying back of these decisions is the recognized danger that, to the extent that the burden falls on economic interests without the state, it is not likely to be alleviated by those political restraints which are normally exerted on legislation where it affects adversely interests within the state.

See Monamotor Oil Co. v. Johnson, supra; Felt & Tarrant Mfg. Co. v. Gallagher, supra. \n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] In all of these cases, except Henneford v. Silas Mason Co., supra, the taxed sale was of merchandise in the 'original package', although the original package doctrine had been thought to be a 'positive and absolute' limitation on the exercise of state power. American Steel & Wire Co. v. Speed, \n192 \nU.S. 500, 521\n, 24 S.Ct. 365, 370. The doctrine originated in Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, where a discriminatory tax on imports was involved. It was overthrown as to interstate commerce when the court found that it would be unjust to permit the merchant who engaged in interstate commerce to escape a tax which the state had levied on the sale of goods after their interstate shipment, but with equal justice on all merchants. Woodruff v. Parham, 8 Wall. 123; Hinson v. Lott, 8 Wall. 148. After its supposed recrudescence in Leisy v. Hardin, \n135 \nU.S. 100\n, 10 S.Ct. 681, the opinions of Justice Miller in Woodruff v. Parham, supra, and of Justice Bradley in Brown v. Houston, \n114 \nU.S. 622\n, 5 S.Ct. 1091, were explained by Chief Justice (then Justice) White in American Steel & Wire Co. v. Speed, supra, 192 U.S. at page 521, 24 S.Ct. at page 371, as the recognition by the court that the question was not whether 'interstate commerce was to be considered as having completely terminated', but whether a particular exertion of taxing power by a state 'so operated upon interstate commerce as to amount to a regulation thereof, in conflict with the paramount authority conferred upon Congress.' \n He pointed out that the Court in these cases 'conceded that the goods which were taxed had not completely lost their character as interstate commerce, since they had not been sold in the original packages. As, however, they had arrived at their destination, were at rest in the state, were enjoying the protection which the laws of the state afforded, and were taxed without discrimination, like all other property, it was held that the tax did not amount to a regulation in the sense of the Constitution, although its levy might remotely and indirectly affect interstate commerce.' Cf. Cardozo, J., in Baldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig, Inc., \n294 \nU.S. 511, 526\n, 55 S.Ct. 497, 501, 502, 101 A.L.R. 55:\n'The test of the 'original package,' which came into our law with Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, is not inflexible and final for the transactions of interstate commerce, whatever may be its validity for commerce with other countries. Cf. Woodruff v. Parham, supra; Anglo- Chilean Nitrate Sales Corp. v. Alabama, \n288 \nU.S. 218, 226\n, 53 S.Ct. 373, 375. There are purposes for which merchandise, transported from another state, will be treated as a part of the general mass of property at the state of destination though still in the original containers. This is so, for illustration, where merchandise so contained is subjected to a nondiscriminatory property tax which it bears equally with other merchandise produced within the state. Sonneborn Bros. v. Cureton, \n262 \nU.S. 506\n, 43 S.Ct. 643; Texas Co. v. Brown, \n258 \nU.S. 466, 475\n, 42 S.Ct. 375 (378); \n\n American Steel & Wire Co. v. Speed, \n192 \nU.S. 500\n, 24 S.Ct. 365. ... 'A state tax upon merchandise brought in from another state or upon its sales, whether in original packages or not, after it has reached its destination and is in a state of rest, is lawful only when the tax is not discriminating in its incidence against the merchandise because of its origin in another state.' Sonneborn Bros. v. Cureton, supra, at page 516 of 262 U.S., 43 S.Ct. 643, 646 (67 L.Ed. 1095). Cf. ... Bowman v. Chicago & N.W. Ry. Co., \n125 \nU.S. 465, 491\n, 8 S.Ct. 689 (701), 1062 .... In brief, the test of the original package is not an ultimate principle. It is an illustration of a principle. Pennsylvania Gas Co. v. Public Service Comm'n, 225 N.Y. 397, 403, 122 N.E. 260. It marks a convenient boundary, and one sufficiently precise save in exceptional conditions. What is ultimate is the principle that one state in its dealings with another may not place itself in a position of economic isolation. Formulas and catchwords are subordinate to this overmastering requirement.' \n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] When the Robbins case was decided, sixteen states required the payment of license taxes by some kinds of drummers. For citations of the statuttes, see, Lockhart, Sales Tax in Interstate Commerce, 52 Harv.L.Rev. 617, 621. More recently it has been estimated that almost 800 municipal ordinances directed at drummers were adopted for the purpose of embarrassing this competition with local merchants. Hemphill, the House to House Canvasser in Interstate Commerce, 60 Am.L.Rev. 641. The court was cognizant of this trend, see Robbins v.

Sol Charles Levine and Jerome R. Hellerstein, both of New York City, on the brief), for petitioner.\n Mr. Harold S. Deming, of New York City (Messrs. Donald Havens and Bernard D. Atwood, both of New York City, on the brief), for respondent. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 430, 431]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a companion case to McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Coal Mining Company, decided January 29, 1940, \n309 \nU.S. 33\n, 60 S.Ct. 388, 84 L.Ed. -- brought here to review a judgment of the New York State Supreme Court that the New York City tax laid upon sales of goods for consumption, is an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce.\n Upon certiorari to review a determination by the Comptroller of the City of New York that respondent was subject to a New York City tax upon sales to it of fuel oil in 1934 and 1935, the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court held that the taxing statute as applied did so infringe. 254 App.Div. 237, 4 N.Y.S.2d 661. The Court of Appeals affirmed, 279 N.Y. 192, 18 N.E.2d 28, with opinion, on the single ground that the tax was unconstitutional by reason of its effect on interstate commerce, and by its amended remittitur the court stated that the affirmance was on the sole ground that the tax violated the commerce clause. 280 N.Y. 691, 21 N.E.2d 199. We granted certiorari, \n307 \nU.S. 620\n, 59 S.Ct. 1043, upon a petition which assailed the determination of the state court that the tax was a prohibited burden on interstate commerce, the question being of public importance.\n The relevant provisions of the taxing act are set out in our opinion in the Berwind-White Coal Mining Company case, and need not be repeated here. The Appellate Division found facts not challenged here as follows: Appellant, a corporation of the Republic of France, owns vessels and operates them in the transportation of pas- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 430, 432]\n\u00a0\n sengers and freight between the Port of New York and France, and other foreign countries. It is authorized to do business, and maintains an office in New York City, where in the course of its business it makes purchases of fuel oil for consumption in the operation of its vessels, from the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, which also maintains an office and carries on business in the City. That company enters into long- term contracts with the respondent, negotiated and signed in the City, for the sale to respondent of its requirements of fuel oil as ordered, to be delivered alongside respondent's vessels in New York Harbor. All the sales presently involved were of oil stored by the Standard Oil Company in its tanks in New Jersey, which as ordered were transported by barge to respondent's vessels in New York City where it was delivered.\n The oil thus transported and delivered to respondent was of two types. One, 'bonded fuel oil', is refined oil imported by the Standard Oil Company from foreign countries and stored in bond in New Jersey without payment of import duties, pursuant to the revenue laws of the United States which authorize release from the bond upon delivery of the oil to a foreign steamship for export or use as fuel by the vessel. The other type, known as 'drawback oil', is the product of crude oil imported from foreign countries by the Standard Oil Company and refined at its New Jersey plant. An import duty is paid upon the oil, but upon delivery of the refined oil to a foreign steamship for export, or for use as fuel on the vessel, the importer is entitled under the revenue laws to a refund or drawback on the duty paid. 19 U.S.C.  1309, 1313, 19 U.S.C.A.  1309, 1313, 46 Stat. 690, 693.\n So far as the validity of the tax with respect to the interstate commerce is concerned, our decision sustaining it in the Berwind-White Coal Mining Company case is controlling, and the judgment must be reversed, unless \n\n[309 \nU.S. 430, 433]\n\u00a0\n the state of the record is such as to entitle respondent to assail the tax upon constitutional grounds not urged or decided in the state courts.\n Respondent's petition to the New York Supreme Court to review the determination of the Comptroller set out that the tax 'was assessed upon the purchase price paid on transactions in interstate and foreign commerce' and that the City was 'without power to impose said tax on said transactions by virtue of the provisions of the Constitution and the laws of the United States,' specifying the commerce clause, art. 1,  8, cl. 3, and Article I,  10, Clause 2, prohibiting 'Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports'. No mention was made of any applicable statute of the United States.\n Respondent's brief and argument here advance as reasons in support of the judgment of the state court in its favor that the bonded oil and drawback oil, at the time of delivery to respondent, retained their character as imports, and that they were then in process of being exported, so that the tax imposed upon the delivery to the purchaser is a prohibited impost or duty on imports and exports.\n Respondent concedes by its brief that the contentions it now makes were not argued in the New York Court of Appeals, and does not deny petitioner's assertion here that respondent stated in its brief in the Appellate Division, 'The court need give no attention to them', and that by its brief in the Court of Appeals respondent explicitly limited its presentation of the case to the interstate commerce point. Whether, under the practice of the Court of Appeals, respondent was in the circumstances free to ask decision of these questions there, we are not advised. But in any event the record does not disclose that they were presented to the Court of Appeals, the highest court of the state in which decision could have been had whose decision we review, and it shows \n\n[309 \nU.S. 430, 434]\n\u00a0\n that that court considered and passed upon only the interstate commerce question.\n By virtue of the petition for certiorari addressed to the constitutional question which the state court decided, this Court has jurisdiction of the cause. And respondent, in urging decision here of the constitutional questions not pressed in the state court, relies on the familiar rule of appellate court procedure in federal courts that, without a cross-petition or appeal, a respondent or appellee may support the judgment in his favor upon grounds different from those upon which the court below rested its decision.

Railroad Commission, \n290 \nU.S. 264, 269\n, 54 S.Ct. 154, 156.\n But it is also the settled practice of this Court, in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, that it is only in exceptional cases, and then only in cases coming from the federal courts, that it considers questions urged by a petitioner or appellant not pressed or passed upon in the courts below. Blair v. Oesterlein Co., \n275 \nU.S. 220, 225\n, 48 S.Ct. 87, 88; Duignan v. United States, \n274 \nU.S. 195, 200\n, 47 S.Ct. 566, 568. In cases coming here from state courts in which a state statute is assailed as unconstitutional, there are reasons of peculiar force which should lead us to refrain from deciding questions not presented or decided in the highest court of the state whose judicial action we are called upon to review. Apart from the reluctance with which every court should proceed to set aside legislation as unconstitutional on grounds not properly presented, due regard for the appropriate relationship of this Court to state courts requires us to decline to consider and decide questions affecting the validity of state statutes not urged or considered there. It is for these reasons that this Court, where the constitutionality of a statute has been upheld in the state court, consistently refuses to consider any grounds of attack not raised or decided in that court. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 430, 435]\n\u00a0\n Dewey v. Des Moines, \n173 \nU.S. 193\n, 19 S.Ct. 379; Keokuk & Hamilton Bridge Co. v. Illinois, \n175 \nU.S. 626, 633\n, 20 S.Ct. 205, 208; Whitney v.

Graves, \n300 \nU.S. 308, 317\n, 57 S.Ct. 466, 469, 108 A.L.R. 721.\n Like considerations, we think, require us to refuse to entertain such new grounds of attack as a support for a state judgment of invalidity based on an erroneous construction of the Constitution. In the exercise of our appellate jurisdiction to review the action of state courts we should hold ourselves free to set aside or revise their determinations only so far as they are erroneous and error is not to be predicated upon their failure to decide questions not presented. Similarly their erroneous judgments of unconstitutionality should not be affirmed here on constitutional grounds which suitors have failed to urge before them, or which, in the course of proceedings there, have been abandoned.\n Upon the remand of this cause for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion, the state courts will be free to decide any federal question remaining undecided here which, in conformity with their own procedure, may be raised for decision there, and the remand will be without prejudice to the further presentation of any such question to this Court.\nREVERSED.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice ROBERTS concur in the view that the questions relating to foreign commerce are not properly before us in this case, but think that the judgment of the state court, holding that the tax as here laid places an unconstitutional burden upon interstate commerce, should be affirmed upon the grounds stated in the dissenting opinion in McGoldrick v.

U.S.C.A.Const. art. 1,  8, cl. 3.\n Upon certiorari to review determinations by the Comptroller of the City of New York, that each of the respondents was subject to the tax, the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court set the levy aside. Matter of Felt & Tarrant Mfg. Co., v. Taylor, 254 App.Div. 246, 4 N.Y.S.2d 615; Matter of A. H. DuGrenier, Inc. v. McGoldrick, 255 App.Div. 961, 8 N. Y.S.2d 667. The New York Court of Appeals, without opinion, affirmed the judgment in each case, 279 N.Y. 678, 18 N.E.2d 311; 281 N.Y. 608, 22 N.E. 2d 172, but by its amended remittitur declared that the affirmance was upon the sole ground that the tax infringed the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution. The relevant provisions of the taxing act are set out in our opinion in the Berwind-White Company case and need not be repeated here.\n Respondent, Felt & Tarrant Mfg. Co., an Illinois corporation, with its factory and principal place of business in that state, manufactures and sells adding and calculating machines known as comptometers. It maintains an office in New York City, from which its agents solicit in the city orders for comptometers, which are forwarded to the Illinois office for approval. If accepted each order is filled by allocating to it the purchased comptometer designated by its serial number. It is invoiced to the purchaser and shipped to the New York City office of respondent's sales agent, where it is inspected, tested and adjusted, and then delivered to the purchaser. Remit- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 70, 77]\n\u00a0\n tances are made by the purchaser direct to the Illinois office. The course of business in soliciting and filling orders so far as now material is that of the same company, described in Felt & Tarrant Mfg. Co. v. Gallagher, \n306 \nU.S. 62\n, 59 S.Ct. 376.\n Respondent, DuGrenier, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation with its factory and principal office in that state, is engaged in the manufacture and sale of automatic vending machines. They are sold throughout the United States by an exclusive sales agent, the respondent Stewart & McGuire, Inc., having an office in New York City. The sales in the city, when not of machines located at the New York office, are effected through solicitations of orders by the agent, which takes from the prospective purchaser a signed order or a contract for a conditional sale on partial payment, which is forwarded by the agent to the Massachusetts office. If accepted there the order is filled by shipping the purchased machine by rail or truck direct to the purchaser in New York City, who pays the freight.\n In both cases the tax was imposed on all the sales of merchandise for which orders were taken within the city and possession of which was transferred to the purchasel there. Decision in both is controlled by our decision in the Berwind-White Company case. For reasons stated at length in the opinion in that case the tax so laid does not infringe the commerce clause. The judgments will be reversed and the causes remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice ROBERTS dissent from the judgments in these cases upon the grounds stated in the dissenting opinion in No. 475, McGoldrick v.

Counsel, Sol Charles Levine and Milton Sandberg, all of New York City, on the brief), for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[309 \nU.S. 414, 420]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Matthew S. Gibson, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Comptroller of the City of New York determined that respondent was subject to a New York City tax laid upon sales in 1934 and 1935 of fuel oil manufactured in New York City from crude petroleum which had been imported from a foreign country to New York and there sold and delivered as ships' stores to vessels engaged in foreign commerce. Upon certiorari to review the Comptroller's determination, the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court held that the taxing statute as applied infringed the power of Congress to regulate foreign commerce which it had exercised by statutes regulating the control and disposition of the imported oil. 256 App.Div. 207, 9 N.Y.S.2d 544.\n The New York Court of Appeals affirmed without opinion, 281 N.Y. 647, 22 N.E.2d 480, but by its amended remittitur declared that the affirmance was upon the ground, and none other, that the tax as applied \n\n[309 \nU.S. 414, 421]\n\u00a0\n violated the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution, Article I,  8, Clause 3, Article I,  10, Clause 2, which commands that no state shall lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports, and Article VI, Clause 2, making the 'Constitution, and the Laws in Pursuance thereof ... the supreme Law of the Land'.1 We granted certiorari upon a petition which challenged the several grounds of decision as defined by the amended remittitur of the Court of Appeals, the questions presented being of public importance.\n The taxing enactment, Local Law No. 24 of 1934, p. 164, published as Local Law No. 25, is that of the municipal assembly of the City of New York, adopted pursuant to authority of Chapter 815 of the New York Laws of 1933, Ex.Sess., as amended by Chapter 873 of New York Laws of 1934, Ex. Sess. Its details were recently discussed in our opinion in McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Coal Mining Company, decided January 29, 1940, \n309 \nU.S. 33\n, 60 S.Ct. 388, 84 L.Ed. -- and it is unnecessary to repeat them here. It suffices to say that it lays a tax on purchasers for consumption of tangible personal property at the rate of 2 per cent. of the sales price. The tax is conditioned upon events occurring within the state, either transfer of title or possession of the purchased property, or an agreement within the state, 'consummated there' for the transfer of title or possession. The duty of collecting the tax and paying it over to the Comptroller is imposed on the seller, \n\n[309 \nU.S. 414, 422]\n\u00a0\n who must pay it whether he collects it or not, in addition to the duty imposed upon the buyer to pay the tax to the Comptroller when not so collected.\n The material facts are not in dispute. In 1934 and 1935 respondent's predecessor imported crude petroleum from Venezuela and made customs entry of it for its own manufacturing warehouse in New York City, pursuant to its bonds known as 'Proprietor's Manufacturing Warehouse Bond, Class 6', given to the United States under the warehouse laws of the United States and treasury regulations. The bonds were given for the purpose of enabling the importer, under statutes of the United States and treasury regulations, to bring the petroleum into the United States, to manufacture it while in bond into fuel oil and then to withdraw it for export or other lawful purpose free of the import duty which would otherwise be payable. The bonds were conditioned, among other things, upon compliance with laws and regulations relating to the custody and safekeeping of the imported merchandise and its products held in bond, and to its lawful withdrawal from the warehouse under permit of the collector of the customs within the time permitted by law.\n The tax in question was laid on the sale of bunker 'C' fuel oil, manufactured in respondent's bonded warehouse from the imported oil and delivered alongside foreign bound vessels in New York City which purchased the oil as ships' stores for consumption as fuel in propelling them in foreign commerce.\n Petitioner argues that the tax imposed on the purchaser for consumption of the fuel oil after it had been changed radically by manufacture from the imported oil, and after it had been withdrawn from the bonded warehouse, is not a prohibited tax on imports and does not contravene any policy which the laws of the United States have sanctioned. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 414, 423]\n\u00a0\n For present purposes we may assume, without deciding, that had the crude oil not been imported in bond it would, upon its manufacture, have become a part of the common mass of property in the state and so would have lost its distinctive character as an import and its constitutional immunity as such from state taxation. See Gulf Fisheries Co. v. MacInerney, \n276 \nU.S. 124, 126\n, 48 S.Ct. 227, 228; Waring v. Mayor of Mobile, 8 Wall. 110; F. May & Co. v. New Orleans, \n178 \nU.S. 496\n, 20 S.Ct. 976; People of State of New York ex rel. Edward & John Burke v. Wells, \n208 \nU.S. 14\n, 28 S.Ct. 193. Respondent rests its argument on different considerations growing out of the control over the foreign commerce involved in the importation of the oil and its ultimate disposition as ships' stores of vessels engaged in foreign commerce, which Congress has exercised in pursuance of a national policy with which, it is insisted, the tax conflicts. Expression of this policy, it is urged is to be found in the statutes of the United States, read in light of their legislative history, exempting the imported oil from federal taxation, otherwise imposed, if it is sold for use as fuel on vessels engaged in the foreign trade, and in the measures taken in statutes and regulations to make that policy effective by segregating the oil under the direction of customs officers of the United States from the time of its importation until it is delivered to the purchasing vessel.\n The provisions of the Revenue Act of 1932 laying a tax on the importation of crude petroleum and granting exemptions, and the related provisions of the Tariff Act of 1930 and the applicable treasury regulations support this contention.\n Section 601(a), (c)(4) of the Revenue Act of 1932, 47 Stat. 169, 260, 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Acts, pages 603, 605, lays a tax 'with respect to the importation' of crude petroleum of one-half cent per gallon unless otherwise provided by treaties of the United States, and declares,  601(b ), that the tax imposed 'shall be levied, assessed, collected, and paid in the same \n\n[309 \nU.S. 414, 424]\n\u00a0\n manner as a duty imposed by the Tariff Act of 1930, and shall be treated for the purposes of all provisions of law relating to the customs revenue as a duty imposed by such Act ....' Section 630 of the Revenue Act of 1932, added by amendment of June 16, 1933, 48 Stat. 256, 26 U.S.C.A. Int. Rev.Code,  3451, declares that no tax under  601 shall be laid 'upon any article sold for use as fuel supplies, ships' stores ... or ... equipment on vessels ... actually engaged in foreign trade ....' and provides that 'articles manufactured or produced with the use of articles upon the importation of which tax has been paid under this title, if laden for use as supplies on such vessels, shall be held to be exported for the purposes' of the drawback provision of  601(b).\n Section 309(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, 46 Stat. 590, 690, 19 U.S.C. A.  1309(a), authorizes the withdrawal, duty free, under regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury of articles from bonded manufacturing warehouses, for supplies to vessels of the United States engaged in foreign trade and directs that no such article shall be landed at any port or place in the United States or its possessions. By virtue of the terms already noted of  601 and 630 of the Revenue Act of 1932, these provisions were extended to articles sold for fuel to vessels engaged in foreign trade, and the provisions of statutes and regulations relating to withdrawal from manufacturing bonded warehouses2 for export were thus extended to similar withdrawals of fuel oil for disposition as ships' stores. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[309 \nU.S. 414, 425]\n\u00a0\n It will be noted that the tax imposed on importation of crude petroleum by  601 of the Revenue Act of 1932 is, by force of its own provisions, to be treated as a duty imposed by the Tariff Act of 1930, which, in turn, has incorporated, by reference, customs regulations relating to the entry of merchandise in bonded manufacturing warehouses, its manufacture there and its withdrawal from bonded warehouses for exportation or disposition as ships' stores;4 that  630, read in conjunction with  601(b) and the related provisions of the Tariff Act of 1930 ( 309(b)) provides that articles manufactured from imported articles and laden for use on vessels engaged in foreign commerce under customs regulations are to be duty free and considered or held as exported for the purpose of the drawback provisions of both  601 of the Revenue Act of 1932 and  309(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930\n\n\n From the time of importation until the moment when the bunker 'C' oil is laden on vessels engaged in foreign trade, the imported petroleum and its product, the fuel oil, is segregated from the common mass of goods and \n\n[309 \nU.S. 414, 426]\n\u00a0\n property within the state, and is subject to the supervision and control of federal customs officers. \n5\n It cannot lawfully be removed from the manufacturing warehouse except for delivery for use as fuel to a vessel engaged in foreign commerce and it cannot lawfully be diverted from such destination and use and cannot, after delivery to the vessel, be landed in the United States. Throughout, the oil is subject to the obligation of respondent's bonds that it shall remain under such supervision and control and shall not be diverted from its ultimate destination as ships' stores.\n Article 942 of the Customs Regulations of 1931 provides that 'merchandise in bonded warehouse is not subject to levy, attachment, or other process of a State court ...' and that 'imported goods in bonded warehouse are exempt from taxation under the general laws of the several States'. These regulations, continued in Customs Regulations of 1937, Art. 940, appeared as Art. 731, Regulations of 1915, and Art. 850 of Regulations of 1923. They were thus in force when the Tariff Act of 1930 was adopted and were incorporated by reference cf. McCaughn v. Hershey Chocolate Co., \n283 \nU.S. 488, 492\n, 51 S.Ct. 510, 512, by the provisions of  309, 311, already noted, which also adopted the earlier provisions of  1351, Title 26 U.S.C., 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  3177, R. S.  3433, and declared that articles manufactured from imported materials in bonded warehouse should be placed there under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.\n The provisions of the Revenue Act of 1932, read with those of the Tariff Act of 1930 and with the statutes and regulations which we have mentioned, thus afford a comprehensive scheme for the regulation of the importation of the crude petroleum and of its control while in the \n\n[309 \nU.S. 414, 427]\n\u00a0\n course of manufacture in bond into fuel oil and its delivery as ships' stores to vessels in foreign commerce, all calculated to insure the devotion of the manufactured oil exclusively to that purpose.\n The statutes and regulations taken together operate as regulations of foreign commerce, as the legislative history shows they were intended to do. The Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C.A.  1001 et seq., of which  601 of the Revenue Act of 1932 is in effect a part, is entitled, 'An Act to provide revenue, to regulate commerce with foreign countries, to encourage the industries of the United States, to protect American labor, and for other purposes'. The obvious tendency of the exemption, from the tax laid upon importation of crude petroleum, when it or its product is used as ships' stores by vessels engaged in foreign commerce is to encourage importation of the crude oil for such use and thus to enable American refiners to meet foreign competition and to recover trade which had been lost by the imposition of the tax. That tendency, and the tendency of the sale of tax-free fuel to vessels engaged in foreign commerce to promote the commerce, were considerations to be taken into account by Congress in fixing the terms of the statute, and its adoption as a means of regulating and promoting foreign commerce was within the Congressional power. Board of Trustees of University of Illinois v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 48\n, 53 S. Ct. 509.\n That such was the purpose of the present legislation is confirmed by its history. Senate Report No. 58, 73d Cong., 1st Sess., on the bill which was enacted as  630 of the Revenue Act of 1932, exempting fuel placed on vessels engaged in foreign commerce from the tax, declared, page 3: 'It is believed that the amendment will enable the American manufacturers to compete more favorably with their foreign competitors for this business without any substantial loss of revenue, since the effect of the present act is to force purchases abroad'. It \n\n[309 \nU.S. 414, 428]\n\u00a0\n added that the provisions for drawback of the tax on importation 'also relieves American manufacturers from a competitive disadvantage'. From statements made on the floor of the Senate by the sponsor of the bill it appears that one purpose of the exemption was to increase the trade in fuel oil in American ports which had been lost through purchase of fuel in foreign ports by vessels engaged in foreign commerce following the imposition of the tax by  601(c)(4). 77 Cong.Rec., Part III, 3212-3214.\n The laying of a duty on imports, although an exercise of the taxing power, is also an exercise of the power to regulate foreign commerce, Hampton, Jr., Co. v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 394, 411\n, 48 S.Ct. 348, 352; Board of Trustees of University of Illinois v. United States, supra, 289 U.S. page 58, 53 S.Ct. page 510. The exemption of imports from the duty or the allowance of a drawback when they are devoted to particular purposes or uses, or when they are exported or otherwise sent out of the country, is likewise a regulation of foreign commerce, see Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 201, 202; Groves v. Slaughter, 15 Pet. 449, 505. Customs regulations to insure the devotion of the imports to the intended use are likewise within the Congressional power since such regulations are not only necessary or appropriate to protect the revenue, but are means to the desired end, the regulation of foreign commerce by insuring that the particular class of exempted imports are used for the purposes for which the exemption is allowed.\n The question remains, whether the present tax conflicts with the Congressional policy adopted by the Acts of Congress which we have discussed. As we have seen, the exemption and drawback provisions were designed, among other purposes, to relieve the importer of the import tax so that he might meet foreign competition in the sale of fuel as ships' stores. In furtherance of that end Congress provided for the segregation of the imported mer- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 414, 429]\n\u00a0\n chandise from the mass of goods within the state, prescribed the procedure to insure its use for the intended purpose, and by reference confirmed and adopted customs, regulations prescribing that the merchandise, while in bonded warehouse, should be free from state taxation. It is evident that the purpose of the Congressional regulation of the commerce would fail if the state were free at any stage of the transaction to impose a tax which would lessen the competitive advantage conferred on the importer by Congress, and which might equal or exceed the remitted import duty. See People of State of New York v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, \n107 \nU.S. 59, 63\n, 2 S.Ct. 87, 90. The Congressional regulation, read in the light of its purpose, is tantamount to a declaration that in order to accomplish constitutionally permissible ends, the imported merchandise shall not become a part of the common mass of taxable property within the state, pending its disposition as ships' stores and shall not become subject to the state taxing power. The customs regulation prescribing the exemption from state taxation, when applied to the facts of the present case, states only what is implicit in the Congressional regulation of commerce presently involved. The state tax in the circumstances must fail as an infringement of the Congressional regulation of the commerce. Sinnot v. Davenport, 22 How. 227; People of State of New York v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, supra, 107 U.S. page 63, 2 S.Ct. page 90; cf. Kelly v. State of Washington, \n302 \nU.S. 1, 9\n, 10 S., 58 S.Ct. 87, 91, 92.\n It is unnecessary to consider whether the tax upon the sale of the oil as ships' stores to vessels engaged in foreign commerce is in the circumstances of this case an impost on imports or exports, or a duty of tonnage prohibited by Article I,  10, Clauses 2 and 3 of the Constitution.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS took no part in the decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Certiorari which had been allowed by the Supreme Court of the United States December 4, 1939, \n308 \nU.S. 545\n, 60 S.Ct. 260, 84 L.Ed. --, before the amendment of the remittitur by the New York Court of Appeals, was dismissed January 15, 1940, \n309 \nU.S. 2\n, 60 S.Ct. 375, 84 L.Ed. --, on the ground that in the absence of an explicit statement by the Court of Appeals that it had annulled the assessment of the tax solely because of the violation of the Federal Constitution, the Court was unable to find that the decision of the highest court of the state did not rest upon an adequate nonfederal ground.

Gibson, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n The City of New York, through its Comptroller, assessed a tax against respondent with respect to sales of oil manufactured in that city in a bonded manufacturing warehouse, Class 6, established pursuant to the customs laws of the United States, the crude oil having been imported from Venezuela and the sales of the manufactured oil having been made to supply fuel to vessels engaged exclusively in foreign commerce. The Appellate Division, First Department, annulled the determination of the Comptroller considering the tax to be a burden upon foreign commerce. 256 App.Div. 207, 9 N.Y.S.2d 544. The Court of Appeals affirmed the order of the Appellate Division, without opinion. 281 N.Y. 647, 22 N.E.2d 480. Certiorari was granted, December 4, 1939, \n308 \nU.S. 545\n, 60 S.Ct. 260, 84 L.Ed. --.\n In the absence of an explicit statement by the Court of Appeals that it annulled the assessment of the tax solely because of violation of the federal Constitution, we are unable to find that the decision of the highest court of the State did not rest upon an adequate non-federal ground.

Petitioner sought a rehearing upon the ground that the purchaser had actual notice of the appeal and had appeared in the Court of Appeals joining in an objection to an enlargement of time for filing the record and also seeking appointment of a receiver or an additional supersedeas bond. Petitioner also asked that if it be considered that the purchaser was not already before the court, a citation should be issued to bring him in. The Court of Appeals denied both applications.

Jean S. Breitenstein, of Denver, Colo., and Edward M. Freeman, of New York City, for petitioners.\n Mr. Fred S. Caldwell, of Denver, Colo., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Colorado Supreme Court held null and void a judgment of the Wyoming court against the claim of Milliken that that judgment was entitled to full faith and credit under the Federal Constitution. 101 Colo. 564, 76 P.2d 420; 105 Colo. 532, 100 P.2d 151. The case is here on a petition for certiorari which we granted, \n310 \nU.S. 622\n, 60 S.Ct. 1099, because of the substantial character of the federal question which is raised.\n The controversy is over a 1\/64th interest in profits from operation of certain Colorado oil properties. Transcontinental1 on August 31, 1922, contracted to pay Meyer \n\n[311 \nU.S. 457, 459]\n\u00a0\n 4\/64ths of those profits. Milliken asserted a claim to a two-thirds interest in that 4\/64ths share. As a settlement of that dispute Transcontinental on May 3, 1924, contracted to pay Milliken a 2\/64ths interest and Milliken assigned2 to Transcontinental all his claims against Meyer pertaining to the lands in question and to Meyer's 4\/64ths interest in the profits.\n Later Milliken instituted suit in the Wyoming court alleging a joint adventure with Transcontinental and Meyer and charging a conspiracy on their part to defraud him of his rights. He sought a cancellation of the contracts of May 3, 1924, and an accounting from Transcontinental and Meyer. Meyer, who was asserted to be a resident of Wyoming, was personally served with process in Colorado pursuant to the Wyoming statutes;3 but he made no appearance in the Wyoming cause. \n4\n Transcontinental appeared and answered. The court found that there was no joint venture between Milliken and \n\n[311 \nU.S. 457, 460]\n\u00a0\n Transcontinental; that the contracts of May 3, 1924, were valid; and that the action against Transcontinental should be dismissed with prejudice. It found, however, that there was a joint venture between Milliken and Meyer; that they were entitled to share equally in 6\/64ths of the net profits; and that, while Meyer had regularly received 4\/64ths, he had refused to account to Milliken for his 1\/64th part. The court did not purport to decree the 1\/64th interest to Milliken or anyone else but entered an in personam judgment against Meyer for the profits which Meyer had withheld from Milliken, together with interest thereon; and enjoined Transcontinental from paying, and Meyer from receiving, more than 3\/64ths of the net profits. This was on July 11, 1931. Thereafter the 1\/64th share was withheld from Meyer and paid over to Milliken. \n5\n In 1935 respondent instituted this suit6 in the Colorado court praying, inter alia, for a judgment against Milliken for the sums withheld under the Wyoming judgment and paid to Milliken, for an injunction against Milliken attempting to enforce the Wyoming judgment, and for a decree that the Wyoming judgment was a nullity for want of jurisdiction over Meyer or his property. The bill alleged, inter alia, that Meyer at the time of service in the Wyoming court had long ceased to be a resident of Wyoming and was a resident of Colorado; that the service obtained on him did \n\n[311 \nU.S. 457, 461]\n\u00a0\n not give the Wyoming court jurisdiction of his person or property; and that such judgment was violative of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Milliken's answer alleged, inter alia, that Meyer was a resident of Wyoming at the time of the Wyoming action and that the Wyoming judgment was entitled to full faith and credit in Colorado under the Federal Constitution. Article 4,  1. The Colorado court, on issues joined, found that Meyer was domiciled in Wyoming when the Wyoming suit was commenced, that the Wyoming statutes for substituted service were constitutional, that the affidavit for constructive service7 on Meyer was filed in good faith, substantially conformed to the Wyoming statute and stated the truth, that Wyoming had jurisdiction over the person of Meyer, that the Wyoming decree8 was not void, and that the bill should be dismissed.\n That judgment was reversed by the Supreme Court of Colorado. It did not pass on the question of whether or not the Wyoming court had jurisdiction of the parties and subject matter. It held that the Wyoming decree was void on its face because of an irreconcilable contradiction between the findings and the decree. In its view the finding of the Wyoming court that Milliken's assignment of May 3, 1924, to Transcontinental of his claims against Meyer was valid, deprived the court of any ground upon which it could predicate a judgment against Meyer, since \n\n[311 \nU.S. 457, 462]\n\u00a0\n the only basis for an action by Milliken against Meyer rested upon the claim before its assignment.\n Where a judgment rendered in one state is challenged in another, a want of jurisdiction over either the person or the subject matter is of course open to inquiry. Grover & Baker Sewing Machine Co. v. Radcliffe, \n137 \nU.S. 287\n, 11 S.Ct. 92; Adam v. Saenger, \n303 \nU.S. 59\n, 58 S.Ct. 454. But if the judgment on its face appears to be a 'record of a court of general jurisdiction, such jurisdiction over the cause and the parties is to be presumed unless disproved by extrinsic evidence, or by the record itself.' Adam v. Saenger, supra, 303 U.S. at page 62, 58 S.Ct. at page 456. In such case the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution precludes any inquiry into the merits of the cause of action, the logic or consistency of the decision, or the validity of the legal principles on which the judgment is based. Fauntleroy v. Lum, \n210 \nU.S. 230\n, 28 S.Ct. 641; Roche v. McDonald, \n275 \nU.S. 449\n, 48 S.Ct. 142, 53 A.L.R. 1141; Titus v. Wallick, \n306 \nU.S. 282\n, 59 S.Ct. 557. Whatever mistakes of law may underlie the judgment (Cooper v. Reynolds, 10 Wall. 308) it is 'conclusive as to all the media concludendi'. Fauntleroy v. Lum, supra, 210 U.S. at page 237, 28 S.Ct. at page 643.\n Accordingly, if the Wyoming court had jurisdiction over Meyer, the holding by the Colorado Supreme Court that the Wyoming judgment was void because of an inconsistency between the findings and the decree was not warranted.\n On the findings of the Colorado trial court, not impaired by the Colorado Supreme Court, it is clear that Wyoming had jurisdiction over Meyer in the 1931 suit. Domicile in the state is alone sufficient to bring an absent defendant within the reach of the state's jurisdiction for purposes of a personal judgment by means of appropriate substituted service. Substituted service in such cases has been quite uniformly upheld where the absent defendant was served at his usual place of abode in the state (Huntley v. Baker, 33 Hun, N.Y., 578; Hurlbut v. Thomas, 55 Conn. 181, \n\n[311 \nU.S. 457, 463]\n\u00a0\n 10 A. 556, 3 Am.St.Rep. 43; Harryman v. Roberts, 52 Md. 64) as well as where he was personally served without the state. In re Hendrickson, 40 S. D. 211, 167 N.W. 172. That such substituted service may be wholly adequate to meet the requirements of due process was recognized by this Court in McDonald v. Mabee, \n243 \nU.S. 90\n, 37 S.Ct. 343, L.R.A.1917F, 458, despite earlier intimations to the contrary. See Pennoyer v. Neff, \n95 \nU.S. 714\n, 733; Burdick, Service as a Requirement of Due Process in Actions In Personam, 20 Mich.L.Rev. 422. Its adequacy so far as due process is concerned is dependent on whether or not the form of substituted service provided for such cases and employed is reasonably calculated to give him actual notice of the proceedings and an opportunity to be heard. If it is, the traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice (McDonald v. Mabee, supra) implicit in due process are satisfied. Here there can be no question on that score. Meyer did not merely receive actual notice of the Wyoming proceedings. While outside the state, he was personally served in accordance with a statutory scheme which Wyoming had provided for such occasions. And in our view the machinery employed met all the requirements of due process. Certainly then Meyer's domicile in Wyoming was a sufficient basis for that extraterritorial service. As in case of the authority of the United States over its absent citizens (Blackmer v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 421\n, 52 S.Ct. 252), the authority of a state over one of its citizens is not terminated by the mere fact of his absence from the state. The state which accords him privileges and affords protection to him and his property by virtue of his domicile may also exact reciprocal duties. 'Enjoyment of the privileges of residence within the state, and the attendant right to invoke the protection of its laws, are inseparable' from the various incidences of state citizenship. See Lawrence v. State Tax Commission, \n286 \nU.S. 276, 279\n, 52 S.Ct. 556, 557, 87 A. L.R. 374; New York ex rel. Cohn v. Graves, \n300 \nU.S. 308\n, 57 S.Ct. 466, 108 A.L.R. 721. The responsibilities \n\n[311 \nU.S. 457, 464]\n\u00a0\n of that citizenship arise out of the relationship to the state which domicile creates. That relationship is not dissolved by mere absence from the state. The attendant duties, like the rights and privileges incident to domicile, are not dependent on continuous presence in the state. One such incidence of domicile is amenability to suit within the state even during sojourns without the state, where the state has provided and employed a reasonable method for apprising such an absent party of the proceedings against him. See Restatement, Conflict of Laws,  47, 79; Dodd, Jurisdiction in Personal Actions, 23 Ill.L.Rev. 427. Here such a reasonable method was so provided and so employed.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Transcontinental Oil Co. In June, 1923, Transcontinental had disposed of a one-half interest in the properties in question to Texas Production Co. In April, 1931, Ohio Oil Co. acquired the remaining interest of Transcontinental in the properties. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Milliken's son, Carl S.

In all cases where service may be made by publication under the provisions of this chapter, personal service of a copy of the summons and the petition in said action may be made out of the state, and such summons when issued for service out of the state, shall be returnable at the option of the party having it issued, on the second, third or fourth Monday after its date, and shall require the defendant or defendants named therein to answer the petition in said action on or before the third Saturday after the return day named in said summons.' \n[\nFootnote 4\n] His deposition, however, was taken on oral interrogatories concerning his legal residence in Wyoming. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] By the Ohio Oil Co. one of the vendees of Transcontinental. These payments were to Margaret M. Milliken to whom Milliken's interests had been assigned. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] Texas Production Co. and Ohio Oil Co. were joined as defendants. They filed separate answers and cross-complaints which are not material here. It should be noted, however, that the Ohio Oil Co. in its answer set up the contract between Milliken and Transcontinental whereby Milliken assigned all of his rights against Meyer in the lands and the 4\/64ths interest in question to Transcontinental and alleged that Milliken was estopped thereby to make any claims against it for the disputed 1\/64th interest. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] While the affidavit for constructive service stated in accordance with  5636 of the Wyoming Comp.Stat., supra, note 3, that Meyer concealed himself in order to avoid service of summons, the present record does not show whether or not the Wyoming court so found. \n[\nFootnote 8\n] The Wyoming judgment does not seem to have been proved by respondents in accordance with the provisions of R.S.  905, 28 U.S.C.  687, 28 U.S.C.A.  687, in their suit in Colorado to set it aside. Nor was that judgment so proved by the answers. But since the Colorado trial court gave the Wyoming judgment full faith and credit despite lack of such proof, respondents cannot here claim that that was error. \n\n\n\n\n","81":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMINERSVILLE SCHOOL DIST. v. GOBITIS(1940)\nNo. 690\nArgued: April 25, 1940Decided: June 3, 1940\n\n\n\n\n[310 \nU.S. 586, 587]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Joseph W. Henderson, of Philadelphia, Pa., for petitioners.\n\n\n\n[310 \nU.S. 586, 588]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George K. Gardner, of Boston, Mass., and Joseph F. Rutherford, of Brooklyn, N.Y., for respondents.\n\n\n\n[310 \nU.S. 586, 591]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A grave responsibility confronts this Court whenever in course of litigation it must reconcile the conflicting claims of liberty and authority. But when the liberty invoked is liberty of conscience, and the authority is authority to safeguard the nation's fellowship, judicial conscience is put to its severest test. Of such a nature is the present controversy.\n Lillian Gobitis, aged twelve, and her brother William, aged ten, were expelled from the public schools of Minersville, Pennsylvania, for refusing to salute the national flag as part of a daily school exercise. The local Board of Education required both teachers and pupils to participate in this ceremony. The ceremony is a familiar one. The right hand is placed on the breast and the following pledge recited in unison: 'I pledge allegiance to my flag, and to the Republic for which it stands; one nation indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.' While the words are spoken, teachers and pupils extend their right hands in salute to the flag. The Gobitis family are affiliated with 'Jehovah's Witnesses', for whom the Bible as the Word of God is the supreme authority. The chil- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 586, 592]\n\u00a0\n dren had been brought up conscientiously to believe that such a gesture of respect for the flag was forbidden by command of scripture. \n 1\n\u00a0\n\n The Gobitis children were of an age for which Pennsylvania makes school attendance compulsory. Thus they were denied a free education and their parents had to put them into private schools. To be relieved of the financial burden thereby entailed, their father, on behalf of the children and in his own behalf, brought this suit. He sought to enjoin the authorities from continuing to exact participation in the flag-salute ceremony as a condition of his children's attendance at the Minersville school. After trial of the issues, Judge Maris gave at a preliminary stage of the litigation relief in the District Court, 24 F.Supp. 271, on the basis of a thoughtful opinion, 21 F.Supp. 581; his decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 3 Cir., 108 F.2d 683. Since this decision ran counter to several per curiam dispositions of this Court,2 we granted certiorari to give the matter full reconsideration. \n309 \nU.S. 645\n, 60 S.Ct. 609, 84 L.Ed. --. By their able submissions, the Committee on the Bill of Rights of the American Bar Association and the American Civil Liberties Union, as friends of the Court, have helped us to our conclusion.\n We must decide whether the requirement of participation in such a ceremony, exacted from a child who refuses \n\n[310 \nU.S. 586, 593]\n\u00a0\n upon sincere religious grounds, infringes without due process of law the liberty guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Centuries of strife over the erection of particular dogmas as exclusive or all-comprehending faiths led to the inclusion of a guarantee for religious freedom in the Bill of Rights. The First Amendment, and the Fourteenth through its absorption of the First, sought to guard against repetition of those bitter religious struggles by prohibiting the establishment of a state religion and by securing to every sect the free exercise of its faith. So pervasive is the acceptance of this precious right that its scope is brought into question, as here, only when the conscience of individuals collides with the felt necessities of society.\n Certainly the affirmative pursuit of one's convictions about the ultimate mystery of the universe and man's relation to it is placed beyond the reach of law. Government may not interfere with organized or individual expression of belief or disbelief. Propagation of belief-or even of disbelief in the supernatural-is protected, whether in church or chapel, mosque or synagogue, tabernacle or meetinghouse. Likewise the Constitution assures generous immunity to the individual from imposition of penalties for offending, in the course of his own religious activities, the religious views of others, be they a minority or those who are dominant in government. Cantwell v. Connecticut, \n310 \nU.S. 296\n, 60 S.Ct. 900, 84 L.Ed. --, decided this Term, May 20, 1940\n\n\n But the manifold character of man's relations may bring his conception of religious duty into conflict with the secular interests of his fellow-men. When does the constitutional guarantee compel exemption from doing what society thinks necessary for the promotion of some great common end, or from a penalty for conduct which appears dangerous to the general good? To state the \n\n[310 \nU.S. 586, 594]\n\u00a0\n problem is to recall the truth that no single principle can answer all of life's complexities. The right to freedom of religious belief, however dissident and however obnoxious to the cherished beliefs of others-even of a majority-is itself the denial of an absolute. But to affirm that the freedom to follow conscience has itself no limits in the life of a society would deny that very plurality of principles which, as a matter of history, underlies protection of religious toleration. Compare Mr. Justice Holmes in Hudson County Water Co. v. McCarter, \n209 \nU.S. 349, 355\n, 28 S.Ct. 529, 531, 14 Ann.Cas. 560. Our present task then, as so often the case with courts, is to reconcile two rights in order to prevent either from destroying the other. But, because in safeguarding conscience we are dealing with interests so subtle and so dear, every possible leeway should be given to the claims of religious faith.\n In the judicial enforcement of religious freedom we are concerned with a historic concept. See Mr. Justice Cardozo in Hamilton v. Regents, \n293 \nU.S. 245\n, at page 265, 55 S.Ct. 197, at page 205. The religious liberty which the Constitution protects has never excluded legislation of general scope not directed against doctrinal loyalties of particular sects. Judicial nullification of legislation cannot be justified by attributing to the framers of the Bill of Rights views for which there is no historic warrant. Conscientious scruples have not, in the course of the long struggle for religious toleration, relieved the individual from obedience to a general law not aimed at the promotion or restriction of religious beliefs. \n3\n The mere possession of religious convictions \n\n[310 \nU.S. 586, 595]\n\u00a0\n which contradict the relevant concerns of a political society does not relieve the citizen from the discharge of political responsibilities. The necessity for this adjustment has again and again been recognized. In a number of situations the exertion of political authority has been sustained, while basic considerations of religious freedom have been left inviolate. Reynolds v. United States, \n98 \nU.S. 145\n; Davis v. Beason, \n133 \nU.S. 333\n, 10 S.Ct. 299; Selective Draft Law Cases, \n245 \nU.S. 366\n, 38 S.Ct. 159, L.R.A.1918C, 361, Ann.Cas. 1918B, 856; Hamilton v. Regents, \n293 \nU.S. 245\n, 55 S.Ct. 197. In all these cases the general laws in question, upheld in their application to those who refused obedirence from religious conviction, were manifestations of specific powers of government deemed by the legislature essential to secure and maintain that orderly, tranquil, and free society without which religious toleration itself is unattainable. Nor does the freedom of speech assured by Due Process move in a more absolute circle of immunity than that enjoyed by religious freedom. Even if it were assumed that freedom of speech goes beyond the historic concept of full opportunity to utter and to disseminate views, however heretical or offensive to dominant opinion, and includes freedom from conveying what may be deemed an implied but rejected affirmation, the question remains whether school children, like the Gobitis children, must be excused from conduct required of all the other children in the promotion of national cohesion. We are dealing with an interest inferior to none in the hierarchy of legal values. National unity is the basis of national security. To deny the legislature the right to select appropriate means for its attainment presents a totally different order of problem from that of the propriety of subordinating the possible ugliness of littered streets to the free expression of opinion through distribution of handbills. Compare Schneider v. State of New Jersey, \n308 \nU.S. 147\n, 60 S.Ct. 146. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 586, 596]\n\u00a0\n Situations like the present are phases of the profoundest problem confronting a democracy-the problem which Lincoln cast in memorable dilemma: 'Must a government of necessity be too strong for the liberties of its people, or too weak to maintain its own existence?' No mere textual reading or logical talisman can solve the dilemma. And when the issue demands judicial determination, it is not the personal notion of judges of what wise adjustment requires which must prevail.\n Unlike the instances we have cited, the case before us is not concerned with an exertion of legislative power for the promotion of some specific need or interest of secular society-the protection of the family, the promotion of health, the common defense, the raising of public revenues to defray the cost of government. But all these specific activities of government presuppose the existence of an organized political society. The ultimate foundation of a free society is the binding tie of cohesive sentiment. Such a sentiment is fostered by all those agencies of the mind and spirit which may serve to gather up the traditions of a people, transmit them from generation to generation, and thereby create that continuity of a treasured common life which constitutes a civilization. 'We live by symbols.' The flag is the symbol of our national unity, transcending all internal differences, however large, within the framework of the Constitution. This Court has had occasion to say that '... the flag is the symbol of the nation's power,- the emblem of freedom in its truest, best sense. ... it signifies government resting on the consent of the governed; liberty regulated by law; the protection of the weak against the strong; security against the exercise of arbitrary power; and absolute safety for free institutions against foreign aggression.' Halter v. Nebraska, \n205 \nU.S. 34, 43\n, 27 S.Ct. 419, 422, 10 Ann.Cas. 525. And see \n\n[310 \nU.S. 586, 597]\n\u00a0\n United States v. Gettysburg Elec. R. Co., \n160 \nU.S. 668\n, 16 S.Ct. 427.4\n The case before us must be viewed as though the legislature of Pennsylvania had itself formally directed the flag-salute for the children of Minersville; had made no exemption for children whose parents were possessed of conscientious scruples like those of the Gobitis family; and had indicated its belief in the desirable ends to be secured by having its public school children share a common experience at those periods of development when their minds are supposedly receptive to its assimilation, by an exercise appropriate in time and place and setting, and one designed to evoke in them appreciation of the nation's hopes and dreams, its sufferings and sacrifices. The precise issue, then, for us to decide is whether the legislatures of the various states and the authorities in a thousand counties and school districts of this country are barred from determining the appropriateness of various means to evoke that unifying sentiment without which there can ultimately be no liberties, civil or religious. \n5\n To stigmatize legislative judgment in providing for this universal gesture of respect for the symbol of our national life in the setting of the common school as a lawless inroad on that freedom of conscience which the Constitution protects, would amount to no less than the pronouncement of pedagogical and psychological dogma in a field where courts possess no marked and certainly no \n\n[310 \nU.S. 586, 598]\n\u00a0\n controlling competence. The influences which help toward a common feeling for the common country are manifold. Some may seem harsh and others no doubt are foolish. Surely, however, the end is legitimate. And the effective means for its attainment are still so uncertain and so unauthenticated by science as to preclude us from putting the widely prevalent belief in flag-saluting beyond the pale of legislative power. It mocks reason and denies our whole history to find in the allowance of a requirement to salute our flag on fitting occasions the seeds of sanction for obeisance to a leader.\n The wisdom of training children in patriotic impulses by those compulsions which necessarily pervade so much of the educational process is not for our independent judgment. Even were we convinced of the folly of such a measure, such belief would be no proof of its unconstitutionality. For ourselves, we might be tempted to say that the deepest patriotism is best engendered by giving unfettered scope to the most crochety beliefs. Perhaps it is best, even from the standpoint of those interests which ordinances like the one under review seek to promote, to give to the least popular sect leave from conformities like those here in issue. But the court-room is not the arena for debating issues of educational policy. It is not our province to choose among competing considerations in the subtle process of securing effective loyalty to the traditional ideals of democracy, while respecting at the same time individual idiosyncracies among a people so diversified in racial origins and religious allegiances. So to hold would in effect make us the school board for the country. That authority has not been given to this Court, nor should we assume it.\n We are dealing here with the formative period in the development of citizenship. Great diversity of psychological and ethical opinion exists among us concerning the best way to train children for their place in society. Be- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 586, 599]\n\u00a0\n cause of these differences and because of reluctance to permit a single, iron-cast system of education to be imposed upon a nation compounded of so many strains, we have held that, even though public education is one of our most cherished democratic institutions, the Bill of Rights bars a state from compelling all children to attend the public schools. Pierce v. Society of the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary, \n268 \nU.S. 510\n, 45 S.Ct. 571, 39 A.L.R. 468. But it is a very different thing for this Court to exercise censorship over the conviction of legislatures that a particular program or exercise will best promote in the minds of children who attend the common schools an attachment to the institutions of their country.\n What the school authorities are really asserting is the right to awaken in the child's mind considerations as to the significance of the flag contrary to those implanted by the parent. In such an attempt the state is normally at a disadvantage in competing with the parent's authority, so long-and this is the vital aspect of religious toleration-as parents are unmolested in their right to counteract by their own persuasiveness the wisdom and rightness of those loyalties which the state's educational system is seeking to promote. Except where the transgression of constitutional liberty is too plain for argument, personal freedom is best maintained-so long as the remedial channels of the democratic process remain open and unobstructed6-when it is ingrained in a people's habits and not enforced against popular policy by the coercion of adjudicated law. That the flagsalute is an allowable portion of a school program for those who do not invoke conscientious scruples is surely not debatable. But for us to insist that, though the ceremony may be required, exceptional immunity must be \n\n[310 \nU.S. 586, 600]\n\u00a0\n given to dissidents, is to maintain that there is no basis for a legislative judgment that such an exemption might introduce elements of difficulty into the school discipline, might cast doubts in the minds of the other children which would themselves weaken the effect of the exercise.\n The preciousness of the family relation, the authority and independence which give dignity to parenthood, indeed the enjoyment of all freedom, presuppose the kind of ordered society which is summarized by our flag. A society which is dedicated to the preservation of these ultimate values of civilization may in self-protection utilize the educational process for inculcating those almost unconscious feelings which bind men together in a comprehending loyalty, whatever may be their lesser differences and difficulties. That is to say, the process may be utilized so long as men's right to believe as they please, to win others to their way of belief, and their right to assemble in their chosen places of worship for the devotional ceremonies of their faith, are all fully respected.\n Judicial review, itself a limitation on popular government, is a fundamental part of our constitutional scheme. But to the legislature no less than to courts is committed the guardianship of deeply-cherished liberties. See Missouri, K. & T.R. Co. of Texas v. May, \n194 \nU.S. 267, 270\n, 24 S.Ct. 638, 639. Where all the effective means of inducing political changes are left free from interference, education in the abandonment of foolish legislation is itself a training in liberty. To fight out the wise use of legislative authority in the forum of public opinion and before legislative assemblies rather than to transfer such a contest to the judicial arena, serves to vindicate the self-confidence of a free people. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n Reversed. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 586, 601]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concurs in the result.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE (dissenting).\n I think the judgment below should be affirmed.\n Two youths, now fifteen and sixteen years of age, are by the judgment of this Court held liable to expulsion from the public schools and to denial of all publicly supported educational privileges because of their refusal to yield to the compulsion of a law which commands their participation in a school ceremony contrary to their religious convictions. They and their father are citizens and have not exhibited by any action or statement of opinion, any disloyalty to the Government of the United States. They are ready and willing to obey all its laws which do not conflict with what they sincerely believe to be the higher commandments of God. It is not doubted that these convictions are religious, that they are genuine, or that the refusal to yield to the compulsion of the law is in good faith and with all sincerity. It would be a denial of their faith as well as the teachings of most religions to say that children of their age could not have religious convictions.\n The law which is thus sustained is unique in the history of Anglo- American legislation. It does more than suppress freedom of speech and more than prohibit the free exercise of religion, which concededly are forbidden by the First Amendment and are violations of the liberty guaranteed by the Fourteenth. For by this law the state seeks to coerce these children to express a sentiment which, as they interpret it, they do not entertain, and which violates their deepest religious convictions. It is not denied that such compulsion is a prohibited infringement of personal liberty, freedom of speech and religion, guaranteed by the Bill of Rights, except in so far as it may be justified and supported as a proper exercise of the state's power over public education. Since the state, \n\n[310 \nU.S. 586, 602]\n\u00a0\n in competition with parents, may through teaching in the public schools indoctrinate the minds of the young, it is said that in aid of its undertaking to inspire loyalty and devotion to constituted authority and the flag which symbolizes it, it may coerce the pupil to make affirmation contrary to his belief and in violation of his religious faith. And, finally, it is said that since the Minersville School Board and others are of the opinion that the country will be better served by conformity than by the observance of religious liberty which the Constitution prescribes, the courts are not free to pass judgment on the Board's choice.\n Concededly the constitutional guaranties of personal liberty are not always absolutes. Government has a right to survive and powers conferred upon it are not necessarily set at naught by the express prohibitions of the Bill of Rights. It may make war and raise armies. To that end it may compel citizens to give military service. Selective Draft Law Cases, \n245 \nU.S. 366\n, 38 S.Ct. 159, L.R.A.1918C, 361, Ann.Cas.1918B, 856, and subject them to military training despite their religious objections. Hamilton v. Regents, \n293 \nU.S. 245\n, 55 S.Ct. 197. It may suppress religious practices dangerous to morals, and presumably those also which are inimical to public safety, health and good order. Davis v. Beason, \n133 \nU.S. 333\n, 10 S.Ct. 299. But it is a long step, and one which I am unable to take, to the position that government may, as a supposed educational measure and as a means of disciplining the young, compel public affirmations which violate their religious conscience.\n The very fact that we have constitutional guaranties of civil liberties and the specificity of their command where freedom of speech and of relgion are concerned require some accommodation of the powers which government normally exercises, when no question of civil liberty is involved, to the constitutional demand that those liberties be protected against the action of govern- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 586, 603]\n\u00a0\n ment itself. The state concededly has power to require and control the education of its citizens, but it cannot by a general law compelling attendance at public schools preclude attendance at a private school adequate in its instruction, where the parent seeks to secure for the child the benefits of religious instruction not provided by the public school. Pierce v. Society of the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary, \n268 \nU.S. 510\n, 45 S.Ct. 571, 39 A.L.R. 468. And only recently we have held that the state's authority to control its public streets by generally applicable regulations is not an absolute to which free speech must yield, and cannot be made the medium of its suppression. Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization, \n307 \nU.S. 496\n, 514, et seq., 59 S.Ct. 954, 963, et seq., any more than can its authority to penalize littering of the streets by a general law be used to suppress the distribution of handbills as a means of communicating ideas to their recipients. Schneider v. State, \n308 \nU.S. 147\n, 60 S.Ct. 146.\n In these cases it was pointed out that where there are competing demands of the interests of government and of liberty under the Constitution, and where the performance of governmental functions is brought into conflict with specific constitutional restrictions, there must, when that is possible, be reasonable accommodation between them so as to preserve the essentials of both and that it is the function of courts to determine whether such accommodation is reasonably possible. In the cases just mentioned the Court was of opinion that there were ways enough to secure the legitimate state end without infringing the asserted immunity, or that the inconvenience caused by the inability to secure that end satisfactorily through other means, did not outweigh freedom of speech or religion. So here, even if we believe that such compulsions will contribute to national unity, there are other ways to teach loyalty and patriotism which are the sources of national unity, than by compelling the pupil to affirm that which he does not believe and by \n\n[310 \nU.S. 586, 604]\n\u00a0\n commanding a form of affirmance which violates his religious convictions. Without recourse to such compulsion the state is free to compel attendance at school and require teaching by instruction and study of all in our history and in the structure and organization of our government, including the guaranties of civil liberty which tend to inspire patriotism and love of country. I cannot say that government here is deprived of any interest or function which it is entitled to maintain at the expense of the protection of civil liberties by requiring it to resort to the alternatives which do not coerce an affirmation of belief.\n The guaranties of civil liberty are but guaranties of freedom of the human mind and spirit and of reasonable freedom and opportunity to express them. They presuppose the right of the individual to hold such opinions as he will and to give them reasonably free expression, and his freedom, and that of the state as well, to teach and persuade others by the communication of ideas. The very essence of the liberty which they guaranty is the freedom of the individual from compulsion as to what he shall think and what he shall say, at least where the compulsion is to bear false witness to his religion. If these guaranties are to have any meaning they must, I think, be deemed to withhold from the state any authority to compel belief or the expression of it where that expression violates religious convictions, whatever may be the legislative view of the desirability of such compulsion.\n History teaches us that there have been but few infringements of personal liberty by the state which have not been justified, as they are here, in the name of righteousness and the public good, and few which have not been directed, as they are now, at politically helpless minorities. The framers were not unaware that under the system which they created most governmental cur- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 586, 605]\n\u00a0\n tailments of personal liberty would have the support of a legislative judgment that the public interest would be better served by its curtailment than by its constitutional protection. I cannot conceive that in prescribing, as limitations upon the powers of government, the freedom of the mind and spirit secured by the explicit guaranties of freedom of speech and religion, they intended or rightly could have left any latitude for a legislative judgment that the compulsory expression of belief which violates religious convictions would better serve the public interest than their protection. The Constitution may well elicit expressions of loyalty to it and to the government which it created, but it does not command such expressions or otherwise give any indication that compulsory expressions of loyalty play any such part in our scheme of government as to override the constitutional protection of freedom of speech and religion. And while such expressions of loyalty, when voluntarily given, may promote national unity, it is quite another matter to say that their compulsory expression by children in violation of their own and their parents' religious convictions can be regarded as playing so important a part in our national unity as to leave school boards free to exact it despite the constitutional guarantee of freedom of religion. The very terms of the Bill of Rights preclude, it seems to me, any reconciliation of such compulsions with the constitutional guaranties by a legislative declaration that they are more important to the public welfare than the Bill of Rights.\n But even if this view be rejected and it is considered that there is some scope for the determination by legislatures whether the citizen shall be compelled to give public expression of such sentiments contrary to his religion, I am not persuaded that we should refrain from passing upon the legislative judgment 'as long as the remedial \n\n[310 \nU.S. 586, 606]\n\u00a0\n channels of the democratic process remain open and unobstructed.' This seems to me no more than the surrender of the constitutional protection of the liberty of small minorities to the popular will. We have previously pointed to the importance of a searching judicial inquiry into the legislative judgment in situations where prejudice against discrete and insular minorities may tend to curtail the operation of those political processes ordinarily to be relied on to protect minorities. See United States v. Carolene Products Co., \n304 \nU.S. 144, 152\n, 58 S.Ct. 778, 783, note 4. And until now we have not hesitated similarly to scrutinize legislation restricting the civil liberty of racial and religious minorities although no political process was affected. Meyer v. Nebraska, \n262 \nU.S. 390\n, 43 S.Ct. 625, 29 A.L.R. 1446; Pierce v. Society of the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary, supra; Farrington v. T. Tokushige, \n273 \nU.S. 284\n, 47 S.Ct. 406. Here we have such a small minority entertaining in good faith a religious belief, which is such a departure from the usual course of human conduct, that most persons are disposed to regard it with little toleration or concern. In such circumstances careful scrutiny of legislative efforts to secure conformity of belief and opinion by a compulsory affirmation of the desired belief, is especially needful if civil rights are to receive any protection. Tested by this standard, I am not prepared to say that the right of this small and helpless minority, including children having a strong religious conviction, whether they understand its nature or not, to refrain from an expression obnoxious to their religion, is to be overborne by the interest of the state in maintaining discipline in the schools.\n The Constitution expresses more than the conviction of the people that democratic processes must be preserved at all costs. It is also an expression of faith and a command that freedom of mind and spirit must be preserved, which government must obey, if it is to adhere to that justice and moderation without which no free govern- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 586, 607]\n\u00a0\n ment can exist. For this reason it would seem that legislation which operates to repress the religious freedom of small minorities, which is admittedly within the scope of the protection of the Bill of Rights, must at least be subject to the same judicial scrutiny as legislation which we have recently held to infringe the constitutional liberty of religious and racial minorities.\n With such scrutiny I cannot say that the inconveniences which may attend some sensible adjustment of school discipline in order that the religious convictions of these children may be spared, presents a problem so momentous or pressing as to outweigh the freedom from compulsory violation of religious faith which has been thought worthy of constitutional protection. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Reliance is especially placed on the following verses from Chapter 20 of Exodus:\n'3.

NATIONAL TEA COMPANY(1940)\nNo. 500\nArgued: March 7, 1940Decided: March 25, 1940\n\n\n\n Messrs. Matthias N. Orfield and George W. Markham, both of St. Paul, Minn., for petitioner.\n Mr. Michael J. Doherty, of St. Paul, Minn., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1933 Minnesota enacted a chain store tax (L.1933, c. 213) one item of which was a tax on gross sales. Sec. 2(b). The gross sales tax was graduated: one-twentieth of one per cent was applied on that portion of gross sales not in excess of $100,000; and larger percentages were applied as the volume of gross sales increased, until one per cent was exacted on that portion of gross sales in excess of $1,000,000. Respondents (chain stores conducting retail businesses in Minnesota) paid under protest the gross sales tax demanded by the Minnesota Tax Commission for the years 1933 and 1934 and thereafter \n\n[309 \nU.S. 551, 552]\n\u00a0\n sued in the state court for refunds. \n1\n Judgments granting refunds were affirmed by the Supreme Court of Minnesota, 205 Minn. 443, 286 N.W. 360. We granted certiorari, \n308 \nU.S. 547\n, 60 S.Ct. 294, 84 L.Ed. --, because of the importance of the constitutional issues involved in Stewart Dry Goods Co. v. Lewis, \n294 \nU.S. 550\n, 55 S.Ct. 525, and Valentine v. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., \n299 \nU.S. 32\n, 57 S.Ct. 56, which cases, it was asserted, controlled the decision below.\n At the threshold of an inquiry into the applicability of the Stewart and Valentine cases to these facts, we are met with a question which is decisive of the present petition. That is the question of jurisdiction.\n The Supreme Court of Minnesota discussed not only the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal constitution but also Art. 9,  1 of the Minnesota constitution which provides: 'Taxes shall be uniform upon the same class of subjects ....' It said that 'these provisions of the Federal and State Constitutions impose identical restrictions upon the legislative power of the state in respect to classification for purposes of taxation.' \n2\n It stated that the 'question is ... whether the imposition of a graduated gross sales tax upon all those engaged in conducting chain stores is discriminatory as between such owners, thus violating the constitutional requirement of uniformity.' It quoted the conclusion of the lower Minnesota court that the statute violated both the federal and the state constitution. It then adverted briefly to three of its former decisions which had \n\n[309 \nU.S. 551, 553]\n\u00a0\n interpreted Art. 9,  1 of the Minnesota constitution and quoted from one of them. \n3\n It merely added: 'So much for our own cases'; and proceeded at once to a discussion of cases based solely on the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal constitution. While its discussion of Art. 9,  1 of the Minnesota constitution was in general terms, its analysis of the Fourteenth Amendment was specifically related to chain store taxation. It distinguished decisions of this Court which held that the number of stores in a given chain affords an appropriate basis for classification for imposition of progressively higher taxes. \n4\n It then stated that the 'precise question here presented' had been directly passed upon adversely to the state's contention in five cases: Stewart Dry Goods Co. v. Lewis, supra; Valentine v. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., supra; Ed. Schuster & Co. v. Henry, 218 Wis. 506, 261 N.W. 20; Lane Drug Stores, Inc., v. Lee, D. C., 11 F.Supp. 672; Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. Harvey, 107 Vt. 215, 177 A. 423. It added that the tax here involved was on \n\n[309 \nU.S. 551, 554]\n\u00a0\n all fours with that struck down by this court in Stewart Dry Goods Co. v. Lewis, supra. It quoted with approval from the opinion in Ed. Schuster & Co. v. Henry, supra. And it concluded with the following statement:\n'We think the five cases to which we have referred have so definitely and finally disposed of the legal problem presented as to make it needless for us to analyze or discuss the great number of other tax cases where the same constitutional question was involved. These being the only cases to which our attention has been called directly deciding the question presented, we are of opinion that we should follow them and that it is our duty so to do.\"5 (Italics added.)\n\n Respondents contend that the court held the statute invalid for violation not only of the federal constitution but also of the state constitution. Hence they seek to invoke the familiar rule that where a judgment of a state court rests on two grounds, one involving a federal question and the other not, this Court will not take jurisdiction. Fox Film Corp. v. Muller, \n296 \nU.S. 207\n, 56 S.Ct. 183; Lynch v. New York ex rel. Pierson, \n293 \nU.S. 52\n, 55 S.Ct. 16; New York City v. Central Savings Bank, \n306 \nU.S. 661\n, 59 S.Ct. 790. In support of this position they point to the court's discussion of the Minnesota constitution and to the fact that the syllabus states that such a tax is violative of both the federal and state constitutions. \n6\n But as to the latter we are not referred to any Minnesota authority which, as in some states,7 makes the syllabi the law of the case. And as to the former the opinion is quite inconclusive. For the opinion as a whole leaves the impression that the court probably \n\n[309 \nU.S. 551, 555]\n\u00a0\n felt constrained to rule as it did because of the five decisions which it cited and which held such gross sales taxes unconstitutional by reason of the Fourteenth Amendment. That is at least the meaning, if the words used are taken literally. For if, as stated by the court, the 'precise question here presented' was ruled by those five cases, that question was a federal one. And in that connection it is perhaps significant that the court stated not only that it 'should follow' those decisions but that 'it is our duty so to do.'\n Enough has been said to demonstrate that there is considerable uncertainty as to the precise grounds for the decision. That is sufficient reason for us to decline at this time to review the federal question asserted to be present, Honeyman v. Hanan, \n300 \nU.S. 14\n, 57 S.Ct. 350, consistently with the policy of not passing upon questions of a constitutional nature which are not clearly necessary to a decision of the case.\n But that does not mean that we should dismiss the petition. This Court has frequently held that in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction it has the power not only to correct errors of law in the judgment under review but also to make such disposition of the case as justice requires. State Tax Commission v. Van Cott, \n306 \nU.S. 511\n, 59 S.Ct. 605; Patterson v. Alabama, \n294 \nU.S. 600\n, 55 S.Ct. 575. That principle has been applied to cases coming from state courts where supervening changes had occurred since entry of the judgment, where the record failed adequately to state the facts underlying a decision of the federal question, and where the grounds of the state decision were obscure. Honeyman v. Hanan, supra, and cases there cited. That principle was also applied in State Tax Commission v. Van Cott, supra, where it was said, 306 U.S. page 514, 59 S.Ct. page 606:\n'... if the State court did in fact intend alternatively to base its decision upon the State statute and upon an \n\n[309 \nU.S. 551, 556]\n\u00a0\n immunity it thought granted by the Constitution as interpreted by this Court, these two grounds are so interwoven that we are unable to conclude that the judgment rests upon an independent interpretation of the State law.'\n\n The procedure in those case was to vacate the judgment and to remand the cause for further proceedings, so that the federal question might be dissected out or the state and federal questions clearly separated.\n In this type of case we deem it essential that this procedure be followed. It is possible that the state court employed the decisions under the federal constitution merely as persuasive authorities for its independent interpretation of the state constitution. If that were true, we would have no jurisdiction to review. State Tax Commission v. Van Cott, supra. On the other hand we cannot be content with a dismissal of the petition where there is strong indication, as here, that the federal constitution as judicially construed controlled the decision below.\n If a state court merely said that the Fourteenth Amendment, as construed by this Court, is the 'supreme law of the land' to which obedience must be given, our jurisdiction would seem to be inescapable. And that would follow though the state court might have given, if it had chosen, a different construction to an identical provision in the state constitution. But the Minnesota Supreme Court did not take such an unequivocal position. On the other hand, it did not declare its independence of the decisions of this Court, when the state constitutional provision avowedly had identity of scope with the relevant clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In the latter respect this case differs from New York City v. Central Savings Bank, supra. The cases in which the New York Court of Appeals professes to go on both the state and federal due process clauses clearly rest upon an adequate nonfederal ground. For that court has \n\n[309 \nU.S. 551, 557]\n\u00a0\n ruled that its own conception of due process governs, though the same phrase in the federal constitution may have been given different scope by decisions of this Court. See Ives v. South Buffalo Railway Co., 201 N.Y. 271, 317, 94 N.E. 431, 34 L.R.A.,N.S., 162, Ann.Cas.1912B, 156. The instant case therefore presents an intermediate situation to which an application of the procedure followed in State Tax Commission v. Van Cott, supra, is peculiarly appropriate.\n It is important that this Court not indulge in needless dissertations on constitutional law. It is fundamental that state courts be left free and unfettered by us in interpreting their state constitutions. But it is equally important that ambiguous or obscure adjudications by state courts do not stand as barriers to a determination by this Court of the validity under the federal constitution of state action. Intelligent exercise of our appellate powers compels us to ask for the elimination of the obscurities and ambiguities from the opinions in such cases. Only then can we ascertain whether or not our jurisdiction to review should be invoked. Only by that procedure can the responsibility for striking down or upholding state legislation be fairly placed. For no other course assures that important federal issues, such as have been argued here, will reach this Court for adjudication; that state courts will not be the final arbiters of important issues under the federal constitution; and that we will not encroach on the constitutional jurisdiction of the states. This is not a mere technical rule nor a rule for our convenience. It touches the division of authority between state courts and this Court and is of equal importance to each. Only by such explicitness can the highest courts of the states and this Court keep within the bounds of their respective jurisdictions.\n For these reasons we vacate the judgment of the Supreme Court of Minnesota and remand the cause to that court for further proceedings. It is so ordered.\n Judgment vacated and cause remanded. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 551, 558]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS took no part in the decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES (dissenting).\n I think that sound principle governing the exercise of our jurisdiction requires the dismissal of the writ. I see no reason to doubt that the Supreme Court of Minnesota held that the tax in question was laid in violation of the uniformity clause of the State Constitution. Not only is that shown, as it seems to me, from the court's discussion of that question, but it conclusively appears from the syllabus which definitely states that the tax is 'violative of Minn.Const. art. 9,  1'. 205 Minn. 443, 286 N.W. 360. Minnesota requires that in all cases decided by the Supreme Court it shall give its decision in writing, 'together with headnotes, briefly stating the points decided'. Mason's Minn.Stat., Sec. 134. In obedience to the statute, the court has thus given explicitly in its syllabus its own deliberate construction of what it has decided.\n The decision thus rested upon an adequate non-federal ground and in accordance with long-established doctrine we are without jurisdiction. Fox Film Corporation v. Muller, \n296 \nU.S. 207, 210\n, 56 S.Ct. 183, 184.\n This is not a case where the record leaves us in uncertainty as to what has actually been determined by the state court. Honeyman v. Hanan, \n300 \nU.S. 14, 23\n, 26 S., 57 S.Ct. 350, 354, 355; State Tax Commission v. Van Cott, \n306 \nU.S. 511\n, 59 S.Ct. 605. Nor have there been supervening changes since the entry of the judgment. Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe R. Co. v. Dennis, \n224 \nU.S. 503, 507\n, 32 S.Ct. 542, 543; Patterson v. Alabama, \n294 \nU.S. 600, 607\n, 55 S.Ct. 575, 578. I find no warrant for vacating the judgment on either of these grounds.\n The fact that provisions of the state and federal constitutions may be similar or even identical does not justify us in disturbing a judgment of a state court which ade- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 551, 559]\n\u00a0\n quately rests upon its application of the provision of its own constitution. That the state court may be influenced by the reasoning of our opinions makes no differance. The state court may be persuaded by majority opinions in this Court or it may prefer the reasoning of dissenting judges, but the judgment of the state court upon the application of its own constitution remains a judgment which we are without jurisdiction to review. Whether in this case we thought that the state tax was repugnant to the federal constitution or consistent with it, the judgment of the state court that the tax violated the state constitution would still stand. It cannot be supposed that the Supreme Court of Minnesota is not fully conscious of its independent authority to construe the constitution of the State, whatever reasons it may adduce in so doing. As the Minnesota court said in Reed v. Bjornson, 191 Minn. 254, 257, 253 N.W. 102, 104, after referring to the question presented under the federal constitution, 'Our interpretation of our own Constitution is, of course, final'.\n The disposition of this case is directly within our recent and unanimous ruling in New York City v. Central Savings Bank, \n306 \nU.S. 661\n, 59 S.Ct. 790. In that case, the Court of Appeals of New York had decided that a state statute was repugnant to the due process clause of the state constitution, that clause being the same as the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment which the court held had also been violated. Central Sav. Bank v. City of New York, 280 N.Y. 9, 10, 19 N. E.2d 659, 121 A.L.R. 615. We declined jurisdiction upon the ground that the judgment of the state court in applying the state constitution rested upon an adequate non-federal ground, despite the reliance upon our decisions.\n Mr. Justice STONE and Mr. Justice ROBERTS join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Extra Sess.L.1933-1934, c. 16,  1.

DUNCAN(1940)\nNo. 30\nArgued: November 12, 1940Decided: December 9, 1940\n\n\n\n\n[311 \nU.S. 243, 244]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John A. Barr, of Chicago, Ill., and J. Merrick Moore, of Little Rock, Ark., for petitioner.\n Mr. Edward H. Coulter, of Little Rock, Ark., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In this case we are called upon to determine the appropriate procedure under Rule 50(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[311 \nU.S. 243, 245]\n\u00a0\n To recover damages for personal injuries, respondent (hereinafter spoken of as plaintiff) brought action against petitioner (hereinafter spoken of as defendant), pursuant to an Arkansas statute declaring that corporations should be liable for injuries to an employe attributable to the negligence of a fellow employe. The complaint alleged that the plaintiff, while in the defendant's service, had been so injured. The answer denied the plaintiff was an employe of the defendant; denied he was injured in the manner described or by the negligence of his co-employe, and set up assumption of risk. At the close of the evidence upon the trial, the defendant moved for a directed verdict. The motion was denied and the jury returned a verdict for plaintiff on which judgment was entered. Within ten days the defendant filed its written motion in the following form:\n'Comes the defendant, Montgomery Ward & Company, and files its motion praying that the jury's verdict herein and the judgment rendered and entered thereon be set aside and judgment entered herein for the defendant notwithstanding the verdict, and its motion for a new trial in the alternative, and as grounds therefor states:'\n\n Thereunder, in heading A, it set out nine reasons in support of the motion for judgment, four of which were general, to the effect that the verdict was contrary to law, to the evidence, to the law and the evidence, and that the court erred in refusing to direct a verdict. Four challenged the sufficiency of the evidence as to negligence, as to the existence of the employment relation, \n\n[311 \nU.S. 243, 246]\n\u00a0\n and as to assumption of risk, to support the verdict. One dealt with the preponderance of the evidence and was therefore inappropriate in support of the motion.\n Under heading B, in support of the motion for a new trial, the same reasons as were assigned for the other motion were, with an immaterial exception, repeated; and additional reasons were added to the effect that the damages were excessive; that the court erred in ruling upon evidence, and in refusing to give requested instructions.\n The motion concluded thus:\n'Wherefore, the defendant prays that the verdict of the jury herein, and the judgment rendered and entered thereon, be set aside, and a judgment rendered and entered herein in favor of the defendant; and defendant further prays in the alternative that in the event the Court refuses to set aside the verdict rendered for the plaintiff and the judgment in favor of the plaintiff rendered and entered on said verdict, and refuses to render and enter judgment herein in favor of the defendant notwithstanding said verdict and judgment, that the court set aside said verdict and judgment on behalf of the plaintiff and grant the defendant a new trial herein.'\n\n The District Court rendered an opinion2 holding that there was no evidence of negligence on the part of the co-employe and that, therefore, judgment should be entered for the defendant.\n The plaintiff filed a motion praying that, to limit the issues on appeal, the court's order and judgment specifically show the grounds on which relief was granted, and 'in order that the judgment of the appellate court may be final', the motion for a new trial be overruled. The court, however, merely entered a judgment for the defendant notwithstanding the verdict. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 243, 247]\n\u00a0\n The plaintiff filed a second motion reciting that, at a hearing upon his earlier motion, the defendant had resisted the contention that the court should rule on the motion for a new trial as that motion 'passed out of existence and consideration on the granting of its motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict.' The plaintiff further recited that the court did not pass upon the plaintiff's contentions but simply entered a judgment in favor of the defendant, and renewed his prayer that the court consider the motion, modify the judgment to specify the grounds upon which relief was granted, and dispose of all issues raised by both motions. This was denied.\n The plaintiff appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals, which decided that the District Court erred in holding the evidence insufficient to make a case for a jury. It reversed the judgment and remanded the cause with instructions to the District Court to enter judgment on the verdict in favor of the plaintiff. \n3\n It overruled the defendant's contention that the case should be remanded with leave to the trial court to dispose of the motion for a new trial.\n The importance of a decision by this court, respecting the proper practice under Rule 50(b), and a conflict of decisions,4 moved us to grant certiorari. \n309 \nU.S. 650\n, 60 S.Ct. 809\n\n\n The Circuit Court of Appeals said:\n'Strictly speaking the motion did not pray for relief in the 'alternative', giving the court a choice between \n\n[311 \nU.S. 243, 248]\n\u00a0\n two propositions either of which he might grant in the first instance. The court was asked to rule on the motion for a new trial only 'in the event' he 'refuses to set aside the verdict ... and judgment ... and refuses to enter judgment herein in favor of the defendant. ...' The court having granted the prayer of the motion as made did not err in not ruling on the motion for a new trial. The condition on which the court was asked to grant a new trial did not come into existence. The new rules are not intended to prolong litigation by permitting litigants to try cases piecemeal. Their purpose would not be accomplished if when relief is asked on condition or in the alternative the successful party could on reversal go back to the trial court and demand a ruling on his conditional or alternative proposition. The order sustaining the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict was equivalent to a denial of the motion for a new trial; and the latter motion passed out of the case upon the entry of the order.'\n\n The defendant contends that the rule continues the existing practice respecting granting of new trials, and also regulates the procedure for rendering judgment notwithstanding a verdict; that the provision for an alternative motion for a new trial would be meaningless and nugatory if the granting of the motion for judgment operated automatically to dismiss it, since the bases of the two motions are, or may be, different, and orderly procedure requires that the court first rule on the motion for judgment, the granting of which renders unnecessary a ruling upon the motion for a new trial, which should be reserved until final disposition of the former.\n The plaintiff insists that the trial court is limited to a choice of action on one motion or the other, but cannot rule upon the motion for judgment and leave that for a new trial to be disposed of only if judgment notwithstand- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 243, 249]\n\u00a0\n ing the verdict is denied. He further asserts, in support of the judgment below, that the uncontradicted allegations of his motion in the District Court disclose that defendant elected to stand upon its motion for judgment alone and that it cannot now repudiate the position thus taken.\n We shall consider the plaintiff's contentions in inverse order.\n\n 1. \nWhile we took the case to review the Circuit Court's construction of the rule, it is true that if the defendant elected to stand on its motion for judgment and, in effect, withdrew its motion for a new trial, we do not reach the question involved in our grant of certiorari. We are, however, unable to spell out any such election or withdrawal. The motion for a new trial assigned grounds not appropriate to be considered in connection with the motion for judgment. It put forward claims that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and was excessive; that the court erred in rulings on evidence and in refusing requested instructions. An affirmative finding with respect to any of these claims would have required a new trial whereas none of them could be considered in connection with the motion for judgment.\n We think that when the defendant urged upon the District Court that it should not decide the motion for a new trial because it passed out of existence and consideration on the granting of the motion for judgment, all that defendant meant was that, having granted the motion for judgment, the court had no occasion to pass upon the reasons assigned in support of the motion for a new trial. That would obviously have been true if no appeal had been taken from the District Court's action or if that action had been affirmed upon appeal.\n\n 2. \nWe come then to the substantial question which moved us to issue the writ, namely, whether under Rule \n\n[311 \nU.S. 243, 250]\n\u00a0\n 50(b) the District Court's grant of the motion for judgment effected an automatic denial of the alternative motion for a new trial. We hold that it did not.\n The rule was adopted for the purpose of speeding litigation and preventing unnecessary retrials. It does not alter the right of either party to have a question of law reserved upon the decision of which the court might enter judgment for one party in spite of a verdict in favor of the other. \n5\n Prior to the adoption of the rule, in order to accomplish this it was necessary for the court to reserve the question of law raised by a motion to direct a verdict. \n6\n The practice was an incident of jury trial at common law at the time of the adoption of the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n Rule 50(b) merely renders unnecessary a request for reservation of the question of law or a formal reservation and, in addition, regulates the time and manner of moving for direction and of moving for judgment on the basis of the refusal to direct. It adds nothing of substance to rights of litigants heretofore existing and available through a more cumbersome procedure.\n A motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict did not, at common law, preclude a motion for a new trial. \n8\n And the latter motion might be, and often was, presented after the former had been denied. The rule was not intended to alter the existing right to move for a new trial theretofore recognized and confirmed by statute. \n9\n It permits the filing of a motion for judgment \n\n[311 \nU.S. 243, 251]\n\u00a0\n in the absence of a motion for a new trial or the filing of both motions jointly or a motion for a new trial in the alternative.\n Each motion, as the rule recognizes, has its own office. The motion for judgment cannot be granted unless, as matter of law, the opponent of the movant failed to make a case and, therefore, a verdict in movant's favor should have been directed. The motion for a new trial may invoke the discretion of the court in so far as it is bottomed on the claim that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence, that the damages are excessive, or that, for other reasons, the trial was not fair to the party moving; and may raise questions of law arising out of alleged substantial errors in admission or rejection of evidence or instructions to the jury.\n We are of opinion that the provision of the rule,-'A motion for a new trial may be joined with this motion, or a new trial may be prayed for in the alternative'-does not confine the trial judge to an initial choice of disposing of either motion, the exercise of which choice precludes consideration of the remaining motion. We hold that the phrase 'in the alternative' means that the things to which it refers are to be taken not together but one in the place of the other. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n The rule contemplates that either party to the action is entitled to the trial judge's decision on both motions, if both are presented. A decision in favor of the moving party upon the motion for judgment ends the litigation and often makes it possible for an appellate court to dispose of the case without remanding it for a new trial. If, however, as in the present instance, the trial court erred in granting the motion the party against whom the verdict went is entitled to have his motion for a new trial considered in respect of asserted substantial trial errors \n\n[311 \nU.S. 243, 252]\n\u00a0\n and matters appealing to the discretion of the judge. In this case the reasons assigned in support of the motion for a new trial were in both categories. The grounds assigned for a new trial have not been considered by the court. In the circumstances here disclosed the uniform practice in state appellate courts has been to remand the case to the trial court with leave to pass upon the motion for new trial. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n The plaintiff urges that, whereas the rule was intended to expedite litigation, to prevent unnecessary trials, and to save the time of courts and litigants, the course urged by the defendant tends to extend the duration of litigation, to create unnecessary hardship, and to defeat the purpose of the rule.\n We are of opinion that the position is untenable. This case well illustrates the efficacy of the procedure sanctioned by the rule. In view of the trial judge's conclusion that the plaintiff failed to make out a case for the jury he would, under the earlier practice, simply have \n\n[311 \nU.S. 243, 253]\n\u00a0\n granted a new trial. Upon the new trial, the judge, if his view as to the law remained unchanged, would have directed a verdict for the defendant. The only recourse of the plaintiff would have been an appeal from this second judgment. If the appellate court had been of the view it here expressed, it would have reversed that judgment and remanded the cause for a third trial. Upon such third trial, if the trial court had ruled upon the evidence and given the instructions to which the defendant objects a judgment for the plaintiff would have been the subject of a third appeal and, if the defendant's position were sustained by the appellate court, the cause would be remanded for a fourth trial at which proper rulings would be rendered and proper instructions given.\n Much of the delay formerly encountered may be avoided by pursuing the course for which the defendant contends. But the courts should so administer the rule as to accomplish all that is permissible under its terms. Is it necessary, if the trial judge's order for judgment be reversed on appeal, that only thereafter he deal with the alternative motion? If so, and he then refuses to set aside the original judgment, a second appeal will lie,-not from his order denying a new trial, for that order, save in most exceptional circumstances, is not appealable,12 but from the judgment entered on the verdict, for errors of law committed on the trial. Can such a second appeal be avoided in the interest of speeding litigation? We think so.\n If alternative prayers or motions are presented, as here, we hold that the trial judge should rule on the motion for judgment. Whatever his ruling thereon he should also rule on the motion for a new trial, indicating the grounds of his decision. If he denies a judgment n.o.v. and also denies a new trial the judgment on the verdict stands, and the losing party may appeal \n\n[311 \nU.S. 243, 254]\n\u00a0\n from the judgment entered upon it, assigning as error both the refusal of judgment n.o.v. and errors of law in the trial, as heretofore. \n13\n The appellate court may reverse the former action and itself enter judgment n. o.v. or it may reverse and remand for a new trial for errors of law. If the trial judge, as he did here, grants judgment n.o.v. and denies the motion for a new trial, the party who obtained the verdict may, as he did here, appeal from that judgment. Essentially, since his action is subject to review, the trial judge's order is an order nisi. The judgment on the verdict may still stand, because the appellate court may reverse the trial judge's action. This being so, we see no reason why the appellee may not, and should not, cross-assign error, in the appellant's appeal, to rulings of law at the trial, so that if the appellate court reverses the order for judgment n.o.v., it may pass on the errors of law which the appellee asserts nullify the judgment on the verdict. \n14\n\u00a0\n\n Should the trial judge enter judgment n.o.v. and, in the alternative, grant a new trial on any of the grounds assigned therefor, his disposition of the motion for a new trial would not ordinarily be reviewable,15 and only his action in entering judgment would be ground of appeal. If the judgment were reversed, the case, on remand, would be governed by the trial judge's award of a new trial.\n We might reverse and direct that the cause be remanded to the District Court to pass on both motions. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 243, 255]\n\u00a0\n But that course would, in the circumstances, be neither fair nor practical. As respects federal courts, the procedure permitted by the rule is novel. The provision which is involved in this case substantially follows the first state statute to authorize such procedure. 16 The Supreme Court of that State has construed the statute to permit the trial judge to pass on the motion for judgment, leaving the motion for a new trial for later disposition. In the event that his decision is reversed, the practice is to remand the cause with leave to the trial judge to pass upon the motion for a new trial. \n17\n It was therefore not unnatural for the defendant to advocate that course, or for the trial judge to follow it.\n In the circumstances, we think the failure of the District Court to rule in the alternative on both matters can be cured without depriving the defendant of opportunity to have its motion for a new trial heard and decided by the trial court, by modifying the judgment below to provide that the cause be remanded to the District Court to hear and rule upon that motion.\n So ordered.\n Modified. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 308 U.S. Appendix, p. 63; U.S.C.A.Tit. 28, following section 723 c.

COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE(1940)\nNo. 210\nArgued: Decided: January 29, 1940\n\n\n\n As Amended on Denial of Rehearing Feb. 26, 1940.\n Mr. Brode B. Davis, of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 78, 79]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Richard H. Demuth, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We took this case because it raises an important question as to the construction of the Revenue Act of 1926,  302(f), amended by the Revenue Act of 1932,  803(b).1\n The question is to what extent and in what sense the law of the decedent's domicile governs in determining whether a power of appointment exercised by him is a general power within the meaning of the statute.\n The petitioner is the executor of Elizabeth S. Morgan who was the donee of two powers of appointment over property held in two trusts created by her father by will and by deed. The persons named are, or were, at death, citizens of Wisconsin. It is unnecessary to recite the terms of the trusts. Suffice it to say that under each, property remaining in the trustees' hands for Elizabeth S. Morgan was given at her death, to the appointee or appointees named in her will, with gifts over in case she failed to appoint. Under both trusts, if in the judgment \n\n[309 \nU.S. 78, 80]\n\u00a0\n of the trustees, property going to any beneficiary would be dissipated for any reason, or improvidently handled, the trustees were to withhold any part of such property; with directions for disposition, in such event, of what was withheld. The decedent appointed in favor of her husband.\n The Commissioner ruled that the value of the appointed property should be included in the gross estate and determined a tax deficiency. The Board of Tax Appeals approved his action. \n2\n The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the Board's decision. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Under the law of Wisconsin, the decedent could have appointed anyone to receive the trust property, including her estate and her creditors, the petitioner urges that, by statute and decision, Wisconsin has defined as special a power such as she held. \n4\n The respondent urges that this is not a correct interpretation of the State law. We find it unnecessary to resolve the issue, since we hold that the powers are general within the intent of the Revenue Act, notwithstanding they may be classified as special by the law of Wisconsin.\n State law creates legal interests and rights. The federal revenue acts designate what interests or rights, so created, shall be taxed. Our duty is to ascertain the \n\n[309 \nU.S. 78, 81]\n\u00a0\n meaning of the words used to specify the thing taxes. If it is found in a given case that an interest or right created by local law was the object intended to be taxes, the federal law must prevail no matter what name is given to the interest or right by state law. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n None of the revenue acts has defined the phrase 'general power of appointment'. The distinction usually made between a general and a special power lies in the circumstance that, under the former, the donee may appoint to anyone, including his own estate or his creditors, thus having as full dominion over the property as if he owned it; whereas, under the latter, the donee may appoint only amongst a restricted or designated class of persons other than himself. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n We should expect, therefore, that Congress had this distinction in mind when it used the adjective 'general'. The legislative history indicates that this is so.7 The Treasury regulations have provided that a power is within the purview of the statute, if the donee may appoint to any person. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n With these regulations outstanding Congress has several times reeacted Sec. 302(f), and has thus adopted the administrative construction. That construction is in accord with the opinion of several federal courts. 9 \n\n[309 \nU.S. 78, 82]\n\u00a0\n The petitioner claims, however, that the decision below is in conflict with two by other Circuit Courts of Appeal. \n10\n The contention is based on certain phrases found in the opinions. We think it clear that, in both cases, the courts examined the local law to ascertain whether a power would be construed by the state court to permit the appointment of the donee, his estate or his creditors, and on the basis of the answer to that question determined whether the power was general within the intent of the federal act.\n As the decedent in this case could have appointed to her estate, or to her creditors, we hold that she had a general power within the meaning of Sec. 302(f). This conclusion is not inconsistent with authorities on which the petitioner relies,11 holding that, in the application of a federal revenue act, state law controls in determining the nature of the legal interest which the taxpayer had in the property or income sought to be reached by the ststute.\n The petitioner's section position is that, inasmuch as the trustees had an unfettered discretion to withhold principal or income from any beneficiary, they could exercise their discretion as respects any appointee of the decedent. This fact, they say, renders the power a special one. Assuming that the trustees could withhold the appointed property from an appointee, we think the power must still be held general. The quantum or character of the interest appointed, or the conditions imposed by the terms of the trust upon its enjoyment, do not render the powers in question special within the purport \n\n[309 \nU.S. 78, 83]\n\u00a0\n of  302(f). The important consideration is the breadth of the control the decedent could exercise over the property, whatever the nature or extent of the appointee's interest.\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 44 Stat. 9, 71, 47 Stat. 169, 279, 26 U.S.C.  411(f), 26 U.S.C.A.

BROWNING(1940)\nNo. 789\nArgued: Decided: May 20, 1940\n\n\n\n\n[310 \nU.S. 362, 363]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wm. H. Swiggart and Edwin F. Hunt, both of Nashville, Tenn., for petitioner.\n Mr. W. F. Barry, Jr., of Nashville, Tenn., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here to review a judgment of the Supreme Court of Tennessee sustaining an assessment of petitioner's property, tangible and intangible, under that state's ad valorem tax law. All Tennessee property is subject to such a tax; but there are two schemes of procedure for making assessments, one for public service corporations and one for other taxpayers. As to ordinary property the task of valuation rests upon officials of the various counties. For public service corporations the assessments \n\n[310 \nU.S. 362, 364]\n\u00a0\n must be made by the Railroad and Public Utilities Commission, which is commanded to ascertain the 'actual cash value' of corporate property situated in Tennessee. Tennessee Code,  1526. Since petitioner operates an interstate railroad, the value of its entire system and not merely of that portion within Tennessee had first to be ascertained. This the Commission estimated at $23,996,604.14. From this figure was deducted the value of petitioner's 'localized' property, that is, its terminal buildings, shops, and non-operating real estate. The remaining sum served as the base for calculating the value of what in the language of Tennessee law is called the utility's 'distributable' property attributable to Tennessee,  1528, which the Commission ascertained by taking the ratio which petitioner's mileage in Tennessee bears to its total mileage. This was found to be $12,925,944; and that is the amount of the assessment here in dispute. From this action by the Commission petitioner appealed, in accordance with the local statute, to the State Board of Equalization, respondent here. After hearing and by formal opinion, the Board confirmed the Commission's valuation.\n In anticipation of a certification by the Board of its final assessment preliminary to the collection of taxes based upon it, the Railway brought an appropriate proceeding in the state courts to set aside what it claimed was the void 'excess of the fair taxable value' of its property. This suit was dismissed by the trial court and its judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Tennessee with two justices separately dissenting. 140 S.W.2d 781. Because of petitioner's claim that the result below was inconsistent with decisions of this Court, we granted certiorari. \n309 \nU.S. 651\n, 60 S.Ct. 888, 84 L.Ed. --. The assessment was contested below on objections grounded in both state and federal constitutions. Here, of course, only federal questions are open. Petitioner claims that the challenged \n\n[310 \nU.S. 362, 365]\n\u00a0\n assessment violates the Fourteenth Amendment in its guarantees of due process and the equal protection of the laws, and is offensive to the Commerce Clause, art. 1,  8, cl. 3.\n We shall first consider the claim based on the historic implications of the Commerce Clause as a limitation upon the state's taxing power. Petitioner argued that Tennessee has taxed values which are in truth outside its borders, thereby burdening that which the Commerce Clause has left free. The guiding principles for adjustment of the state's right to secure its revenues and the nation's duty to protect interstate transportation are by this time well settled. The problem to be solved is what portion of an interstate organism may appropriately be attributed to each of the various states in which it functions. Basic to the accommodation of these conflicting state and national interests is realization that by its very nature the problem is incapable of precise and arithmetical solution. In tapping these common sources of revenue a state cannot, we have held, use a fiscal formula, whatever may be its appearance of certitude, to project the taxing power of the state plainly beyond its borders. Wallace v. Hines, \n253 \nU.S. 66\n, 40 S.Ct. 435. In the light of these principles, Tennessee has not overstepped its bounds.\n In basing its apportionment on mileage, the Tennessee Commission adopted a familiar and frequently sanctioned formula. Pullman's Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n141 \nU.S. 18\n, 11 S.Ct. 876; Maine v. Grand Trunk R'y. Co., \n142 \nU.S. 217\n, 12 S.Ct. 121, 163; Pittsburgh & c. Railway Co. v. Backus, \n154 \nU.S. 421\n, 14 S.Ct. 1114; Branson v. Bush, \n251 \nU.S. 182\n, 40 S.Ct. 113. See 2 Cooley on Taxation, pp. 1660-1664. Its asserted inapplicability to the particular situation is rested on petitioner's evidence as to the comparative revenue- producing capacity of its lines in and out of Tennessee. But both the Commission and the Supreme Court of the state thought that this evidence, however weighty, was insufficient to displace the relevance of the formula. In a matter where exactness is con- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 362, 366]\n\u00a0\n cededly unobtainable and the feel of judgment so important a factor, we must be on guard lest unwittingly we displace the tax officials' judgment with our own. Certainly we cannot say that the combined judgment of Commission, Board, and state courts is baseless. Wherever the states' taxing authorities have been held to have intruded upon the protected domain of interstate commerce in their use of a mileage formula, the special circumstances of the particular situation, in the view which this Court took of them, precluded a defensible utilization of the mileage basis. Union Tank Line Co. v. Wright, \n249 \nU.S. 275\n, 39 S.Ct. 276; Wallace v. Hines, supra; Southern Ry. Co. v. Kentucky, \n274 \nU.S. 76\n, 47 S.Ct. 542. No such circumstances are here presented.\n This brings us to the Company's claims under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Railway first asserts that it is a victim of such invidious discrimination in the administration of Tennessee's tax statutes as is proscribed by the guaranty of 'the equal protection of he laws.' The claim is founded upon the following circumstances. As we have already indicated, there are two separate modes for the assessment of property in Tennessee, each with its distinctive procedure. The property of public service corporations is assessed by the Commission; all other property by local officials. This broad classification, separating two very different types of property, has been reflected, according to petitioner's contention, by a corresponding difference in the bases of assessment. For more than forty years, so it was urged before the courts of Tennessee and later here, the county assessors have systematically valued property at far less than its true worth, while utility and railroad properties have been assessed by the Commission at full value. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[310 \nU.S. 362, 367]\n\u00a0\n This systematic differentiation, petitioner claims, has been continuous and state-wide in its operation; has been 'repeatedly brought to the attention of the General Assembly of the State of Tennessee'; has been left uncorrected by that body; and until the present case, so far as we are informed, has been unchallenged. In support of its claim the Railway adduced official and unofficial reports as well as a volume of affidavits from local assessing officials in the counties through which its lines run- all to the effect that locally assessed property was undervalued. The issue of forbidden discrimination was thus squarely raised below. But the Tennessee Supreme Court did not deem petitioner's evidence sufficient to overcome the presumption that in the exercise of its reviewing function, the Board had equalized assessments in accordance with the command of state law. We should be reluctant on such a question to reject the state court's determination as without foundation, and there is not enough in the record to warrant its repudiation. At the bar of this Court petitioner proffered the minutes of the State Board of Equalization-not in the record- to show the absence of equalization. Considering the nature of the litigation, the vigor and ability with which it was contested before the Circuit Court of Davidson County, on motion for new trial there, on the original appeal to the Supreme Court of Tennessee and finally on petition for rehearing, it would indeed turn this Court into a board of tax review if we were now to receive evidence not offered in any of the tribunals below.\n But were we to take judicial notice of that which these minutes were offered to show, and therefore to regard the ground taken by the state court as a strained evasion of the differentiation between utility property on the one hand and all the rest on the other, we should still find no denial of the equal protection of the laws. It must be emphasized that the Company makes no claim \n\n[310 \nU.S. 362, 368]\n\u00a0\n that its property is singled out from among other public service corporations for discrimination. Its asserted grievance is common to the whole class. We must put to one side therefore all those cases relied on by the petitioner which invoked the Fourteenth Amendment against discriminations invidious to a particular taxpayer. Raymond v. Chicago Traction Co., \n207 \nU.S. 20\n, 28 S.Ct. 7, 12 Ann.Cas. 757; Sunday Lake Iron Co. v. Wakefield, \n247 \nU.S. 350\n, 38 S.Ct. 495; Sioux City Bridge v. Dakota County, \n260 \nU.S. 441\n, 43 S.Ct. 190, 28 A.L.R. 979; Bohler v. Callaway, \n267 \nU.S. 479\n, 45 S.Ct. 431; Cumberland Coal Co. v. Board, \n284 \nU.S. 23\n, 52 S.Ct. 48; Iowa-Des Moines Bank v. Bennett, 284 u.S. 239, 52 S.Ct. 133. All these cases are inapposite. None denied power to a state to apply different yardsticks to different classes of property. Equally irrelevant are those cases in which this Court, because of the nature of the litigation, was construing the uniformity clause of a state constitution, and was not applying the Fourteenth Amendment. Greene v. Louisville 3 I.R. Co., \n244 \nU.S. 499\n, 37 S.Ct. 673, ann.Cas.1917E, 88; Louisville & N.R. Co. v. Greene, \n244 \nU.S. 522\n, 37 S.Ct. 683, Ann.Cas.1917E, 97. This Court has previously had occasion to advert to the narrow and sometimes cramping provision of these state uniformity clauses, and has left no doubt that their inflexible restrictions upon the taxing powers of the state were not to be insinuated into that meritorious conception of equality which alone the equal protection clause was designed to assure. See Puget Sound Co. v. King County, \n264 \nU.S. 22, 27\n, 44 S.Ct. 261, 263.\n That the states may classify property for taxation; may set up different modes of assessment, valuation and collection; may tax some kinds of property at higher rates than others; and in making all these differentiations may treat railroads and other utilities with that separateness which their distinctive characteristics and functions in society make appropriate-these are among the commonplaces of taxation and of constitutional law. Kentucky Railroad Tax Cases, \n115 \nU.S. 321\n, 6 S.Ct. 57; Pacific Express \n\n[310 \nU.S. 362, 369]\n\u00a0\n Company v. Seibert, \n142 \nU.S. 339\n, 12 S.Ct. 250; Florida Central &c. R'd Co. v. Reynolds, \n183 \nU.S. 471\n, 22 S.Ct. 176; Southern Ry. Co. v. Watts, \n260 \nU.S. 519\n, 43 S.Ct. 192; Atlantic Coast Line v.

Since, so far as the Federal Constitution is concerned, a state can put railroad property into one pigeonhole and other property into another, the only question relevant for us is whether the state has done so. If the discrimination of which the Railway complains had been formally written into the statutes of Tennessee, challenge to its constitutionality would be frivolous. If the state supreme court had construed the requirement of uniformity in the Tennessee Constitution so as to permit recognition of these diversities, no appeal could successfully be made to the Fourteenth Amendment. Here, according to petitioner's own claim, all the organs of the state are conforming to a practice, systematic, unbroken for more than forty years, and now questioned for the first time. It would be a narrow conception of jurisprudence to confine the notion of 'laws' to what is found written on the statute books, and to disregard the gloss which life has written upon it. Settled state practice cannot supplant constitutional guarantees, but it can establish what is state law. The equal protection clause did not write an empty formalism into the Constitution. Deeply embedded traditional ways of carrying out state policy, such as those of which petitioner complains, are often tougher and truer law than the dead words of the written text. Compare Carin o v. Insular Government, \n212 \nU.S. 449, 459\n, 29 S.Ct. 334, 336. And if the state supreme court chooses to cover up under a formal veneer of uniformity the established system of differentiation between two classes of property, an exposure of the fiction is not enough to establish its unconstitutionality. Fictions have played an important and sometimes fruitful part in the development of law; and the equal protection clause is not a command of candor. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 362, 370]\n\u00a0\n So we are of opinion that such a discrimination, not invidious but long- sanctioned and indeed conventional, would not be offensive to the Fourteenth Amendment simply because Tennessee had reached it by a circuitous road. It is not the Fourteenth Amendment's function to uproot systems of taxation inseparable from the state's tradition of fiscal administration and ingrained in the habits of its people.\n Finally, the Railway claims that the valuation of its entire system, on the basis of which the Commission has measured Tennessee's shares, is so far in excess of 'full cash value' as to offend the due process clause. The details on which this claim is based are fully set forth in the opinions below and call only for summary treatment here. The argument basically derives from the fact that the Commission's valuation of petitioner's system was the same as that for the previous biennium, although numerous adverse economic factors are alleged to have greatly reduced the property's worth. But railroads, unlike farms and city lots and stocks and bonds, are not objects of exchange. The very notion of a 'full cash value' for a railroad is in many respects artifical. See 1 Bonbright, The Valuation of Property, pp. 511-632. Whatever may be the pretenses of exactitude in determining such a 'value', to claim for it 'scientific' validity, is to employ the term in its loosest sense. Compare Chicago, B. & Q. Ry. Co. v. Babcock, \n204 \nU.S. 585, 598\n, 27 S.Ct. 326, 329. Thorough canvass by the state courts found no justification for upsetting the determination of the Commission, and we could scarcely find warrant in the record for doing so. But even assuming that there was an over-assessment, constitutional invalidity would not follow. If the needs of a state require higher taxes, the Fourteenth Amendment certainly does not bar their imposition. The maintenance of higher assessment in the face of declining value is merely another way of achieving the same result. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 362, 371]\n\u00a0\n Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Weeks, \n297 \nU.S. 135\n, 56 S.Ct. 426, does not bar the way. That is the only case, and it was decided by a sharply divided Court, in which a non-discriminatory assessment was struck down simply because it was thought excessive. Plainly, therefore, the case must have rested upon considerations peculiar to its own facts. Those are not the facts now before us. We conclude, therefore, that the Commission's over-assessment of petitioner's property, if over-assessment there was, constitutes no deprivation of any right under the Federal Constitution.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] For a history of Tennessee railroad taxation, see Brannen, Taxation in Tennessee, p. 62 et seq.; Robison, Bob Taylor and the Agrarian Revolt in Tennessee, p. 123 et seq. \n\n\n\n\n","86":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BD. v.

Whether the court properly reached that conclusion is the single question here.\n We do not ordinarily grant certiorari to review judgments based solely on questions of fact. In its petition, however, the Board earnestly contended that the record before the Court of Appeals had presented 'clear and overwhelming proof' that the Waterman Steamship Company had been guilty of a most flagrant mass discrimination against its employees in violation of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq., and that the court had unwarrantedly interfered with the exclusive jurisdiction granted the Board by Congress. The Board's petition also charged that the present was one of a series of decisions in which the court below had failed 'to give effect to the provisions of the Act that the findings of the Board as to facts, if supported by evidence, shall be conclusive.' \n1\n\u00a0\n\n In that Act, Congress provided, 'The findings of the Board as to the facts, if supported by evidence, shall be conclusive.' \n2\n It is of paramount importance that courts not encroach upon this exclusive power of the Board if effect is to be given the intention of Congress to apply an orderly, informed and specialized procedure to the complex, administrative problems arising in the solution of industrial disputes. As it did in setting up other administrative bodies, Congress has left questions of law which arise before the Board-but not more-ultimately to the traditional review of the judiciary. Not by accident, but in line with a general policy, Congress has \n\n[309 \nU.S. 206, 209]\n\u00a0\n deemed it wise to entrust the finding of facts to these specialized agencies. It is essential that courts regard this division of responsibility which Congress as a matter of policy has embodied in the very statute from which the Court of Appeals derived its jurisdiction to act. And therefore charges by public agencies constitutionally created- such as the Board-that their duly conferred jurisdiction has been invaded so that their statutory duties cannot be effectively fulfilled, raise questions of high importance. For this reason we granted certiorari. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Respondent, Waterman Steamship Company, of Mobile, Alabama, is engaged in maritime transportation between this country, Europe, and the West Indies. Upon complaint made by the National Maritime Union, a labor organization affiliated with the Committee for Industrial Organization, the Board held hearings and found that respondent had, at Mobile, laid up the ships 'Bienville' (27 days) and 'Fairland' (7 days) for dry-docking and repairs, and had, in violation of the National Labor Relations Act:\n\n\n (a)\n discharged and refused to reinstate, because of membership in the N.M.U., the entire unlicensed crew and the chief steward, Edmund J. Pelletier, of the Steamship 'Bienville', and all but three of the crew of the Steamship 'Fairland';\n\n\n (b)\n discharged and refused to reinstate C. J. O'Conner, second assistant engineer of the 'Azalea City' because of his activities in representing aggrieved members of the Marine Engineers Beneficial Association, a labor organization of licensed ship personnel affiliated with the C.I.O.;\n\n\n (c)\n and, pending an election directed by the Board to permit the ships' crews to select their bargaining agencies, \n\n[309 \nU.S. 206, 210]\n\u00a0\n had interfered with its employees' free right to select a union of their own choosing under Section 7 of the Act by refusing to grant ships' passes to representatives of the C.I.O. affiliate, while at the same time issuing passes to representatives of the International Seaman's Union affiliated with the American Federation of Labor. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The Board's order in question was based on the foregoing findings.\n A clear understanding of the issues presented by the mass discharge of the crews of the 'Bienville' and the 'Fairland' necessitates initial reference to the Federal laws governing engagement of seamen for foreign voyages. There is provision, 46 U.S.C.  564, 46 U.S.C.A.  564, that a master of any vessel bound from the United States to foreign ports (with exceptions not pertinent) 'shall, before he proceeds on such voyage, make an agreement, in writing or in print, with every seaman whom he carries to sea as one of the crew ....' This written agreement, commonly referred to in maritime circles as articles, must specify the nature and duration of the intended voyage or engagement; the port or country at which the voyage will terminate; the number and description of the crew and their employments; the time each seaman must be on board to begin work and the capacity in which he is to serve; wages; provisions to be furnished each seaman; regulations to which the seaman will be subjected on board such as fines, short allowance of provisions or other \n\n[309 \nU.S. 206, 211]\n\u00a0\n lawful punishments for misconduct; and stipulations of any advance and allotment of the seaman's wages. And the provisions of 46 U.S.C.  567, 568, 46 U.S.C.A.  567, 568, impose penalties for carrying seamen in ships' crews on foreign voyages without entering into the required articles. All seamen 'discharged in the United States from merchant vessels engaged in voyages ... to any foreign port ... shall be discharged and receive their wages in the presence of a duly authorized shipping commissioner ....' Id.  641, 46 U.S.C.A.  641. The master and each seaman shall 'in the presence of the shipping commissioner, ... sign a mutual release of all claims for wages in respect of the past voyage or engagement'; the release must be recorded in a book which shall be kept by the commissioner, and such release 'shall operate as a mutual discharge and settlement of all demands for wages between the parties ..., on account of wages, in respect of the past voyage or engagement'. Id.,  644, 46 U.S.C.A.  644. (Italics supplied.)\n Respondent, the Waterman Company, has taken the position that when the crews of the 'Bienville' and 'Fairland' received their wages and signed off statutory articles in Mobile, all tenure of employment and employment relationship of these men were at an end. From this premise, the Company insists that vacancies were created as the men signed off and, under an outstanding contract with the I.S.U., preference in filling these vacancies had to be given to members of the I.S.U. unless contractual obligations were to be violated. \n5\n How- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 206, 212]\n\u00a0\n ever, the Board contends that the signing off of articles when the ship's voyage ended at Mobile served only to end employment 'in respect of the past voyage or engagement' and, therefore, it proceeded to examine the evidence to determine whether there was, after completion of the voyages in question of the 'Bienville' and 'Fairland', a continuing relationship, tenure, term or condition of employment between the Company and its men. The Act provides6 that\n'It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer-\n\n'(1) To interfere with ... (the employees' right of self- organization). ...\n\n'By discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization: ....'\n\n The protection to seamen embodied in the Federal statutes which have been referred to has existed in some form since the earliest days of the Nation. 7 This statutory plan was never intended to forbid the parties from mutually undertaking to assure a crew the right to continue as employees and to re-sign if it desires after signing off articles at a voyage's end. The design was to protect seamen from being carried to sea against their will; to prevent mistreatment as to wages and to assure against harsh application of the iron law of the sea during voyages. \n8\n The Board, therefore, properly heard evi- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 206, 213]\n\u00a0\n dence as to whether the crews of the 'Bienville' and 'Fairland' had, unless discharged for cause, a continuing tenure or relationship entitling them to re-sign when the temporary lay-ups of their ships ended. If, as the Board found, there were such continuing tenure and customary term or condition of employment, of course no vacancies occurred when the men of the 'Bienville' and the 'Fairland' signed off articles in Mobile. And respondent's contract with the I.S.U., which only provided preferential treatment of the I.S.U. (A.F. of L.) in filling vacancies, did not require the Company to discharge the N.M.U. (C.I.O.) men from these ships.\n If, therefore, there was substantial support in the evidence for the findings that these crews had a continuing right to and customary tenure, term or condition of employment within the purview of the Act even though their ships were temporarily laid up, and that this relationship was terminated by the Company because of the crews' C.I.O. affiliation, the court below was required to enforce the Board's order.\n Evidence as to the continuing tenure, and conditions and relation of employment. On the basis of nine to ten years at sea, one witness testified that a ship's crew is customarily kept on when she goes into dry dock and is laid up for temporary repairs; and that both the Waterman Company and the unions had observed that custom. Another, with a background of ten years experience at sea, in visiting some fifty ships in dry dock at Mobile during the preceding few months had learned of forty- nine which had not laid off their entire crews but had kept a substantial number of their crews working aboard ships; the fiftieth had laid off its entire crew after going into dry dock, but 'the company kept the jobs open.' He knew \n\n[309 \nU.S. 206, 214]\n\u00a0\n of one vessel that had remained 'in dry dock for a period of forty-five days and maintained its crew during that period', several which had done so recently for thirty-day periods, and many for periods 'from five to ten days, fifteen days.' He had himself been a member of a crew maintained in its entirety while his ship was in dry dock for twenty-two days.\n An oiler and deck engineer, with eight years in the service, had been on a Waterman ship which, as recently as 1936, spent six days in repairs, keeping its crew on; and had 'known them to stay on fifteen or twenty days and continue working that long.' Asked what obligation an employer owes a sailor after the latter returns from a foreign voyage, completes his contract under the ship's articles, is paid off and discharged before a Shipping Commissioner, he answered 'If my services are satisfactory and my work efficient, I have the right to stay on that ship, if I have not done anything to be discharged for. Why shouldn't I make another trip? ...\n'Q. Is it true to state that a seaman's job is still existent, although he may not be drawing pay while the boat is tied up for repairs? A. Yes, sir.\n\n'Q. There is no vacancy in his job? A. No; there is no vacancy.'\n\n The chief steward of the 'Bienville', employed by Waterman since 1934 and a seaman since 1918, testified that crews of ships in dry dock-tied up for repairs for a few days-'have to do their work and get paid for it by the Waterman Steamship Corporation' and unless they quit or are fired 'for cause' there is no vacancy. The giving of a discharge according to the ship's articles, he understood 'to be a termination of the voyage, but not a termination of the employment.'\n Although at sea but three years, a fireman and oiler testified that he had been resigned, upon the termination of articles, after each of fourteen trips on a single ship, from Southern ports including Mobile, had been kept as \n\n[309 \nU.S. 206, 215]\n\u00a0\n a member of a crew on a ship in for repairs nine days and had 'known of one ship that was laid up (for lack of cargo) for five weeks and the crew went back.'\n A marine fireman, oiler and watertender, at sea since 1922, had been on a Waterman ship in for repairs ten or twelve days, the crew of which was retained only in part, but those laid off 'were notified when the ship went into commission they can go out again.' He 'was on one (ship) that stayed two months in dry dock ... just part of the crew ... (were kept on, but) the whole crew was there for their jobs when she was commissioned again.' He had never heard of a mass discharge of an entire crew such as occurred on the 'Bienville' and 'Fairland'. In part, the testimony of this former I.S.U. member was: 'Q. Do the unions consider that there is no vacancy until a man resigns? A. Yes; they do not figure it is any vacancy until they call the (Union) Hall for another man.'\n A seaman in the employ of the Waterman Company intermittently since 1924, had been on a Waterman boat which kept its whole crew during six or seven days in dry dock. It had been his experience that a crew was kept on ships in dry dock or being repaired, unless a ship was to be laid up indefinitely, i.e., for two or three months, in which event only a skeleton crew whould be maintained. But, he added, the Waterman Company itself follows the custom of 'calling back to the ship' men who have been laid off indefinitely and 'are still around,' and men standing idly by without pay at the end of a voyage still regard themselves in the employ of the shipowner.\n One witness had served as a fireman on a Waterman ship that spent the period between the first of November and Thanksgiving of 1932 in dry dock and undergoing repairs; she kept 'approximately all of' her crew aboard ship working during this period; a few were permitted to go home in the interim, but returned when she started \n\n[309 \nU.S. 206, 216]\n\u00a0\n her voyage. On another occasion, he testified, the same Waterman boat stayed in dry dock about sixty days, retaining approximately the entire crew; although after five days in dry dock he was called out of town to appear as a witness, he later got his job back. In his capacity as a shipyard worker in which he was employed at Mobile at the time of this hearing, this same witness observed 'we have boats coming in from twenty- five up to thirty days ... and the crew works in there, and they may want to lay off part of the crew, or work a major part, or maybe they will be discharged, but those that want to go back, their jobs is open if they wish them.' Of some six hundred ships he had seen or worked on in dry dock or being repaired, he had seen but one complete discharge of an entire crew, but even that crew were told they could come back 'if they wanted their jobs.' According to his understanding and that of seamen as he knew it, articles 'were protection to the seamen by the United States Government for a certain voyage, and to a certain port, or your final port of discharge or first loading port. That is a termination of the articles to the seaman, but not the end of the employment.'\n A witness who had worked for the Waterman Company since 1929, who had been a marine engineer for fourteen years, and at sea twenty years, testified that a crew which is laid off is customarily re-employed when a ship emerges from dry dock, unless laid off 'for cause.' A Waterman ship, on which he had been at the time serving, laid up in Mobile from December, 1936, to about January 25, 1937, 'and the engineers were kept on her, and to the best of my knowledge the firemen and watertenders and oilers were kept on there.'\n The executive vice-president of the Waterman Company recalled that recently the crew of only one other vessel going in for repairs had been discharged, and that this particular crew also had been affiliated with the \n\n[309 \nU.S. 206, 217]\n\u00a0\n N.M.U. (C.I.O.). Of the several Waterman vessels which he mentioned as having been put up in Mobile for dry-docking or repairs during the previous year, he could note only the one that had not kept its entire crew (other than the 'Bienville' and 'Fairland'); the one other crew that was discharged en masse, he admitted, was the one other also affiliated with the C.I.O.\n The witness who had been captain of the 'Fairland' when she went into dry dock, had served the Waterman Company continuously since 1924, with the exception of one year, in capacities ranging from ordinary seaman to ship's master. Yet, in all his experience with the Company, he had never heard of a ship in dry dock that had laid off her entire crew. And Waterman's port captain, a veteran of twenty-four years, had taken perhaps a half dozen of Waterman ships into dry dock, never staying more than twenty-four hours in dry dock but with a total of eight to ten days in port, and his crews were never laid off; he preferred to retain a crew for a succeeding voyage.\n In the very contract which the Waterman Company made with the I.S.U. there are terms providing that 'In Home Port, all men may be required to work eight (8) hours daily ... (with provision for overtime).' And the section of the contract covering preference for I.S.U. men 'shall not be construed to require the discharge of any employee who may not desire to join the (I.S.U.) ....' That the contract contemplated an employment independent of the articles and subject to termination in a manner other than by the mere expiration of articles, is apparent from the provision that 'Nothing in this agreement shall prevent ... (the Company) from discharging any member of the crew who is not satisfactory to the Company.'\n All the evidence on this issue which the Board had before it has, of course, not been set out. In summary, it \n\n[309 \nU.S. 206, 218]\n\u00a0\n is glaringly apparent that men who had in various capacities followed the sea in the aggregate for roughly a hundred years, offered testimony that a seaman's tenure and relationship to his ship and employer are not terminated by the mere expiration of articles when his ship lays up in dry dock or for repairs, and that the Waterman Company-and maritime people generally-have recognized and followed this custom. Even the Waterman Company's executive vice-president could cite only one instance in the Company's recent past in which this custom had been departed from, but that particular mass firing of the crew of a ship headed for a temporary lay-up was directed against the only C.I.O. crew, other than those of the 'Bienville' and 'Fairland', with which the Waterman Company apparently had been asked to deal. And the master of the 'Fairland', with personal knowledge of the Company's practice reaching back to 1924, had never heard of 'another case where the entire crew was laid off.'\n In the words of the Act, an employer cannot terminate his employees' 'tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment'9 because of union activity or affiliation. These words are not limited so as to outlaw discrimination only where there is in existence a formal contract or relation of employment between employer and employee. They embrace, as well, as elements of the employment relationship which in fact customarily attend employment and with respect to which an employer's discrimination may as readily be the means of interfering with employees' right of self- organization as if these elements were precise terms of a written contract of employment. The Act, as has been said, recognizes the employer's right to terminate employment for \n\n[309 \nU.S. 206, 219]\n\u00a0\n normal reasons. \n10\n No obstacle of legal principle barred the Board from finding that there was, even after the ships were temporarily laid up, a relationship of employment or tenure between the Waterman Company and its men. That there may be a tenure or term of employment determinable at will is a recognized principle of law. \n11\n For the purpose of the Act, it is immaterial that employment is at will and terminable at any time by either party. \n12\n A large part of all industrial employment is of this nature. For illustration, factory workers are customarily employed at will, without obligation of employer or employed to continue the relationship when the day's work is done; or, if there is an agreement fixing salary or wages per unit of service, at so much per day, week or month, there may be an indefinite employment terminable by either party at the end of any unit period. But when such employees are customarily continued in their employment with recognition of their preferential claims to their jobs, it cannot be doubted that their wholesale discharge at the end of the day or other unit period, in order to favor one union over another, would be discrimination in regard to the 'tenure' or 'condition' of their employment in violation of the Act. And employees under such tenure of employment as these seamen were have a right guaranteed by the Act that they will not be dismissed because of affiliation with a particular union. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 206, 220]\n\u00a0\n Since the Board justifiably found that an employment relationship protected by the Act continued after the 'Bienville' and 'Fairland' were temporarily laid up, it becomes unnecessary to consider the additional finding of the Board that the 'dates and durations of the particular lay- ups were arranged for the purpose of making it possible to discharge the crews because they had joined the N.M.U.'\n The sole question remaining is whether the evidence supported the findings of the Board that the employment or tenure of the crews and of O'Conner and Pelletier were terminated because they had joined or engaged in the activities of the C.I.O.\n Evidence of discrimination because of C.I.O. affiliation. About July 1, 1937, the entire crew of the 'Bienville' and all but three of the 'Fairland', previously I.S.U. (A.F. of L.), joined the N.M.U. (C.I.O.) in Tampa, Florida. Such action had been decided on in June by the crew of the 'Bienville' while she was in Le Havre, France. After the crew of the 'Bienville' changed to the C.I.O. at Tampa and before she reached Mobile, the A.F. of L. representative at Tampa informed the A.F. of L. representative at Mobile, by telephone, that the change had taken place. And the Mobile A.F. of L. representative 'at that time' notified the Waterman Company of the change. Intervening scheduled stops of the 'Bienville' were cancelled by a memorandum purporting to have been written on July 1 and ordering her to Mobile to 'go on inactive status for a period of about twenty days.' The port captain of the Waterman Company, who signed this memorandum, stated that it was written on July 1, 'to the best of ... (his) knowledge.' He added that it had not been written until after the 'Bienville' was on her return voyage from Le Havre. That was after the ship's crew had, in assembly, determined to turn C.I.O. No such cancellation was directed to the \n\n[309 \nU.S. 206, 221]\n\u00a0\n 'Fairland'. The 'Fairland', he testified, was laid up because periodic repairs 'were due.' On the other hand, her master had no knowledge of any contemplated lay-up until she reached Mobile, and understood, according to advice given him, that she was laid up because 'she was behind schedule ... and they put her back to the next sailing.' The Waterman port captain thought she was laid up because repairs 'were due'; he had no knowledge that it was because she was behind schedule. Her master's testimony showed, 'Q. The laying up plan, then, had been something that was contemplated in Tampa? A. No, Sir.\n'Q. It was something that came into existence after you sailed from Tampa and before you came to Mobile, is that right? A. Yes.'\n\n The 'Fairland' is equipped with radio.\n The ships were in Mobile by July 6. There was testimony that a member of the crew of the 'Bienville', on the sixth, was asked by the executive vice-president of the Company why the change of unions was made and was told by that official 'a man has to use his own head.' This same witness testified that several of the discharged crew were given some work ashore and that 'on a Saturday afternoon we collected three days pay, they held back two days in the week, and about three o'clock in the afternoon the first assistant came around there and I was working on some safety valves on the boilers, and ... (the assistant port engineer of Waterman Company) said, 'Well, I got a chance to fire you at last,' and I said, 'What is that?' And he said, 'Well, you can get the rest of your money when you are finished,' and I said, 'What's the matter, aren't we going to sail the ship?' And he said, 'No, not unless you go back to the other place,' and I said, 'What other place?' And he said, 'The I.S.U.\" \n\n[309 \nU.S. 206, 222]\n\u00a0\n Pelletier, the steward on the 'Bienville' worked for Waterman from 1934 until discharged after joining the N.M.U. (C.I.O.). When the 'Bienville' arrived at Mobile, Waterman's port steward went to the boat, and talked with the mate, who informed him that some of the men had joined the N.M.U. According to the port steward's testimony, he then asked the mate, 'How is the Steward's Department?' and the mate replied, 'Well some of them joined the N.M.U. ... and later on I (the port steward) found the steward in his room. ... I asked Pelletier did he join the N.M.U. and he said 'Yes', and I said 'What about the rest of your crew?' and he said 'Well, they all did.' I asked him did they have any reason for it, and he said, 'Yes, everybody did', so I said 'All right' and I left the ship.' He returned to the Company's office. Two hours later, he came back to the ship, charged Pelletier with incompetency and discharged him. Pelletier testified that the port steward, when told that the crew and Pelletier had turned N.M.U. said, 'Well I have got orders to lay you all off.' Pelletier had been promoted just prior to the voyage in question. A new I.S.U. man was put on to finish up his work and remained on as watchman practically the full time the 'Bienville' was laid up.\n Although her captain had, prior to the coming aboard of a Company official, expressed a desire to keep the 'Fairland's' crew, as one of her crew testified, the crew was informed by this official that they could not sail, 'but if you take your books and give them to ... the I.S.U. you can keep your jobs;' another Waterman official 'told me I could not sail on any Waterman steamship as long as I was an N.M.U. man.' According to this witness, he had left his clothes on the 'Fairland' and slept aboard ship when she was in dry dock with the understanding he would resign; he was, however, ordered off the ship. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 206, 223]\n\u00a0\n An engineer on the Waterman vessel 'Azalea City', eight years with the Company, O'Conner, a member of the M.E.B.A., (also affiliated with the C.I.O.) testified that he acted as spokesman for other engineers on his ship in complaining about working conditions, hours of employment and rates of pay; when he discussed the complaint with the Company's representative, during July, he was told to take a vacation and left the ship on a promise of a more desirable job; neither the vacation, the promised job, nor re-employment of any kind was ever given him. Waterman's executive vice-president had never had an engineer act in such a representative capacity relative to asserted violations of a union contract. And the assistant port engineer stated that it was the custom to call a man of O'Conner's rank when not on vacation; that O'Conner had been promised and then denied a vacation, but had not been called although work had been available; and, in addition that O'Conner had in conversation with him asked 'Would Waterman give me employment.'\n The executive vice-president of the Company would not 'until the actual time came' answer the query whether he would reinstate the N.M.U. men even if there were no contract with the I.S.U. He stated that he had received a wire from the Board's regional Director at New Orleans on July 7, recommending and insisting on reinstatement of N.M.U. men dismissed at Mobile, and did not deny that he had first told the Director that his reason for not working N.M.U. men was the existence of the I.S.U. contract. He admitted, however, that later on the same day his decision that the men were removed because the vessels were laying up was attributable to an apparent change of his own mind.\n Additional evidence that the discharged N.M.U. men were again treated with discrimination in the allotment \n\n[309 \nU.S. 206, 224]\n\u00a0\n or repair work on the 'Bienville' and 'Fairland'; and were laid off in a block even from this work-all tended to buttress and illuminate the Board's finding that the tenure of employment of these men of the 'Bienville' and 'Fairland' was cut short because they had exercised their lawful right to join the C.I.O. One of the men who was given temporary repair work-subsequent to the Board's telegram of the seventh-testified:\n'Q. While you were a member of the N.M.U., did you ever wear you N.M. U. badge or button? A. Yes, sir; I used to wear it on my cap, on the dock while I was working down there.\n\n'Q. Was there anything ever said to you at the Waterman Steamship about wearing it? A. Mr. Ingram told me I would have to take that Maritime Union button off if I wanted to stay around there, and I took it off, and put it in my pocket.'\n\n From all this evidence, there can be no doubt of the substantial support for the Board's finding that the crews, O'Conner and Pelletier all lost their jobs because of C.I.O. affiliation and activities.\n Evidence of Discrimination as to ships' passes. The Board found 'that the respondent, by issuing passes to representatives of the I.S.U. and refusing to grant such passes to representatives of the N.M.U. for the same purpose and under the same conditions, had interfered with, restrained, and coerced its employees in the exercise of their rights guaranteed in Section 7 of the Act.' 13 An election to permit a choice of bargaining agency by \n\n[309 \nU.S. 206, 225]\n\u00a0\n the crews has been directed but has not been held pending termination of the present proceeding. \n 14\n\u00a0\n\n Upon this issue of discrimination concerning passes, N.M.U.'s representative testified that the Company's executive vice-president, about September 24 or 25, 1937, refused his request 'for passes for the election of the N.L.R.B.' because of the I.S.U. contract. But no provision of the I.S.U. contract referred to ships' passes for representatives of other unions. The respondent's attorney took the position that N.M.U. representatives would not be permitted on board under any conditions. Testifying that I.S.U. representatives were permitted aboard the 'Bienville' at all times to contact the men, Pelletier 'did not recollect seeing anyone with them.' Waterman's executive vice-president who pointed out that I.S.U. delegates were given passes on certain conditions, such as taking out insurance for delegates going aboard, did not know whether in fact there had been compliance by the I.S.U. with the conditions. He testified that he had issued instructions, July 13, to permit I.S.U. representatives aboard ship only to collect dues. But he also testified that they were still permitted to contact members. The master of the 'Fairland' stated that he did not receive the instructions of July 13 until August; and that even after the instructions were put in effect, he permitted I.S.U. representatives to board ship unaccompanied; he did not know what they said to the men, whether they brought literature aboard or whether they restricted themselves to the collection of dues. Although always present at the paying off and signing off of articles, when the I.S. U. representatives collected dues, the Company's port captain 'did not pay any strict attention whatever to what they were doing.' Asked whether he knew what these representatives did at such times, he \n\n[309 \nU.S. 206, 226]\n\u00a0\n replied, 'I did not follow them around to see what they were doing.'\n Enough has been shown to establish the reasons for the Board's decision that if the Company was to permit any opportunity for contact with the men, a fair election required that equal opportunities be given to both the C.I.O. and the A.F. of L. The control of the election proceedings, and the determination of the steps necessary to conduct that election fairly were matters which Congress entrusted to the Board alone. 15 Interference in those matters constituted error on the part of the court below.\n All of this is not to say that much of what has been related was uncontradicted and undenied by evidence offered by the Company and by the testimony of its officers. We have only delineated from this record of more than five hundred pages the basis of our conclusion that all of the Board's findings, far from resting on mere suspicion, are supported by evidence which is substantial. The Court of Appeals' failure to enforce the Board's order resulted from the substitution of its judgment on disputed facts for the Board's judgmernt,-and power to do that has been denied the courts by Congress. Whether the court would reach the same conclusion as the Board from the conflicting evidence is immaterial and the court's disagreement with the Board could not warrant the disregard of the statutory division of authority set up by Congress.\n The cause is reversed and remanded to the Court of Appeals with directions to enforce the Board's order in its entirety. It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice MURPHY took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Board specifically referred to National Labor Relations Board v.

It affirmatively ordered the Company to grant equal passes to the C.I.O. and the A.F. of L., if granted to either; to make whole and offer full reinstatement to those employees found to have suffered discrimination; and to post appropriate notices on the Waterman vessels. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] In part, that contract reads: 'Section 1. It is understood and agreed that as vacancies occur, members of the International Seamen's Union of America, who are citizens of the United States, shall be given preference of employment, if they can satisfactorily qualify to fill the respective positions; provided, however, that this Section shall not be construed to require the discharge of any employee who may not desire to join the Union, or to apply to prompt reshipment, or absence due to illness or accident.' Only the discharge of Pelletier is claimed by the Company to have been due to incompetency. The Court below held that O'Connor had taken a vacation and was not discharged, and was thus entitled to vacation pay and reinstatement; the Board had ordered that O'Conner be made whole 'for any loss of pay' suffered as a result of the Company's acts which the Board found had been discriminatory. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] 49 Stat. 449, 452, Secs. 7, 8. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] See 1 Stat. 131. \n[\nFootnote 8\n] See Lent Traffic Co. v.

Feely, of Washington, D.C., for Bradford Dyeing Ass'n Employees' Federation Local Union No. 16, intervener, respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals declined to decree effective enforcement of an order of the National Labor Relations Board upon the ground that the Board's order, in material respects, rested upon findings that were not supported by substantial evidence. 1 Cir., 106 F.2d 119. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 318, 320]\n\u00a0\n In its petition for certiorari, the Board took sharp issue with the Court of Appeals, asserting that some findings upset by the court were supported not merely by substantial but by 'uncontradicted' and 'undisputed evidence.' The petition also pointed out that the court's opinion was 'ambiguous and inconclusive' and 'left unclear the court's holding as to whether the Board had jurisdiction.' Our inspection of the court's opinion and decree disclosed that the court deemed the Board to be wholly lacking in jurisdiction. Nevertheless, the Board was ordered to proceed in accordance with the opinion which concluded with the indecisive statement that 'if the case should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction' a large part, but apparently not all, of the Board's order should be vacated. The court's decree did not direct enforcement even of those parts of the Board's order not expressly vacated. The Board's petition further pointed out that its motion for rehearing in order to clarify the question of its jurisdiction and to establish the status of 'those portions of the Board's order which the court neither vacated nor enforced' was denied without explanation. Because the Labor Board's petition in challenging the action of the Court of Appeals thus raised questions of grave public importance affecting the administration of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq., and judicial review as provided in the Act, we granted certiorari. \n 1\n\u00a0\n\n This proceeding was initiated upon charges filed by the Textile Workers Organizing Committee of the C.I.O. Thereupon, the Labor Board served a complaint and notice of hearing on the Bradford Dyeing Association (U.S.A.), respondent here.\n In the complaint, it was alleged that respondent in order to discourage membership in the C.I.O., had discharged and refused to reinstate its employees, Edward \n\n[310 \nU.S. 318, 321]\n\u00a0\n Nelson and Percy Schofield, because of their affiliation and activities in the Textile Workers Organizing Committee of the C.I.O., (T.W.O.C.); respondent had dominated and supported the Bradford Dyeing Association Employees' Federation, a labor organization, and had refused to bargain collectively with its employees through the T.W.O.C. after a majority had selected it as their bargaining representative.\n The Board's jurisdiction was unsuccessfully challenged on the ground that respondent's business involved no activities in or affecting interstate commerce within the meaning of the Act. And, answering, respondent alleged that Schofield was discharged because he smoked during working hours; 'that ... Nelson was not discharged, that he was insubordinate and defiant, that he did not work and refused to work during the times when he was supposed to be working, that he was on the premises during hours when he was not supposed to be on the premises of respondent and was taking up the time of other employees who were supposed to be working during such time, that ... Nelson went upon a vacation and has not returned to work after such vacation nor made any statement of his readiness to return to work or made any request that he be put to work again'; that respondent had not dominated or coerced the Federation; and that any labor disputes at its plant were attributable to the conduct of the T.W.O.C.\n The Federation was allowed to intervene in the extensive hearing held by the Board.\n After this hearing, the Board found that 'a labor dispute' in respondent's plant would widely affect 'the flow of commodities in interstate commerce', with consequent jurisdiction in the Board, and that the charges of the complaint had been substantiated.\n The Board accordingly ordered respondent to cease and desist from (1) interfering, or coercing its employees \n\n[310 \nU.S. 318, 322]\n\u00a0\n in the exercise of their rights to self-organization; (2) dominating and interfering with the Federation or any other labor organization; (3) discouraging membership in the T.W.O.C.; (4) refusing to bargain collectively with the T.W.O.C.; and (5) ordered respondent affirmatively to offer reemployment to Schofield and Nelson and to make them whole, to withdraw all recognition from and completely disestablish the Federation, to bargain collectively with its employees through T.W.O.C., and to post the usual notices throughout its plant stating that the company would cease its unlawful and unfair labor practices and would treat its agreement with the Federation as of no effect.\n In its final decree the Circuit Court of Appeals directed that 'until a new election has taken place by order of the Board, and the employees have expressed their preference as to what group or body shall represent them in any labor dispute between them and the respondent, the order of the Board except as to paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the case and desist portion of the order, and the entire paragraph 5 ordering affirmative action shall be vacated, the Board then to proceed in accordance with (the opinion passed down this day).' (106 F.2d 125.) As phrased, the decree is not clear but apparently the court vacated subdivisions (4) and (5) of the Board's order. The court's opinion did make clear that under its decree the company was left free to bargain collectively with the Federation and to decline to bargain with the T.W.O.C. Discharges of Schofield and Nelson were approved and the company was released from publishing notices which, if warranted, were 'essential if the employees were to feel free to exercise their rights without incurring the company's disfavor.' \n2\n Although those portions of the Board's order prohibiting the company's interfering with \n\n[310 \nU.S. 318, 323]\n\u00a0\n its employees' union affiliations were not expressly set aside or modified, neither were they ordered enforced. \n3\n Thus the court's decree gave the Board's order no effect at all.\n It did not explicitly so decree, but the Court of Appeals evidently was of the view that evidence was lacking upon which the Board could have found that respondent's business was in or affected interstate commerce. The court expressly found a lack of evidence to support the Board's conclusion that Schofield and Nelson were discharged for union activities and stated its belief that Schofield was discharged for smoking in the plant and Nelson for insubordination, and that 'the finding by the Board that the T.W.O.C. had a majority of the employees of the respondent signed up even to become members of a union under that name is without substantial evidence on which to rest.'\n Without specifically passing upon the Board's finding that respondent had unlawfully dominated the Federation, the opinion of the court stated, ' ... Assuming that the president or officers of the respondent influenced its employees to join the Federation, so called, it does not appear by clear and substantial evidence that a majority of the employees ever joined, or indicated an intent to join, the T.W.O.C., ....' (Italics supplied.) Since the court \n\n[310 \nU.S. 318, 324]\n\u00a0\n did not vacate that part of the Board's order directing the company to discontinue domination of the Federation, we might infer that the court accepted the Board's finding that the Federation had been so dominated. But this inference is opposed by the court's action in vacating the order of disestablishment. The uncertainty in which the court has left the questions of jurisdiction and company domination of the Federation makes necessary a review of the evidence on both, along with other evidence which we think amply demonstrates the justification for the Board's order in every respect.\nFirst. As to Jurisdiction.\n A major portion of the opinion of the court below is devoted to its expression of doubts about the Board's jurisdiction, i.e., 'there is no substantial evidence to warrant a finding that the transportation of these materials by the respondent was ever in interstate commerce'; 'there is also lacking substantial evidence that 40 percent of the supplies consisting of chemicals and dyes, which were contracted for in Rhode Island and delivered by the sellers to the respondent's plant in Bradford, were transported by the respondent in interstate commerce, or that they were used by the respondent except at Bradford, though the Board assumed without evidence that they were shipped by the respondent in interstate commerce, but its assumption lacks substantial evidence on which to rest, that would compel this court to accept it as a fact'; 'The respondent, according to uncontroverted testimony, neither sells, transports nor arranges for transportation of the goods into or out of Rhode Island in interstate commerce, which is done in each instance by the customer, ...' ; and 'The Board apparently assumed that the respondent transported goods to its plant and from it, which the uncontroverted evidence disclosed were not the facts.' Referring to waste products which respondent sells in interstate commerce, the court noted that they did \n\n[310 \nU.S. 318, 325]\n\u00a0\n not 'exceed 1 percent of the total goods processed' and said that they were but 'a mere incident (of the business) and to which the maxim de minimis might well be applied, even by the National Labor Relations Board.' And the conclusions of the opinion were only stated subject to the condition 'If the case should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.'\n There was evidence before the Board which showed:\n'The Bradford Dyeing Association (U.S.A.), as stated by its president, is 'engaged in the dyeing and finishing of cotton, rayon and acetate piece goods.' These piece goods reach the plant at Bradford, Town of Westerly, Rhode Island, as unfinished 'gray Goods.' Customers of Bradford, known as 'converters', ship the gray goods to the plant, retaining title, and direct shipment of the goods when processed. Bradford owns no goods or means of transportation, and its customers pay the cost of transportation to and from the plant. A New York office is maintained, however, 'where ... solicitors (who contact converters) make their headquarters', and advertisements are run in New York papers and trade journals. A majority of Bradford's (converters) are located in States other than Rhode Island, in Baltimore, Boston, Philadelphia, Trenton, and principally in New York City. There are 'very few customers' in Rhode Island. In 1936, 57,000,000 yards of goods were processed and for the first six months of 1937, 29,000, 000. About ninety per cent of all goods processed, the processing taking 'an average of between two and three weeks', are shipped out of Rhode Island. 'More than half' of the goods processed come from beyond the borders of Rhode Island.\n\n'Incidental to its business of processing, respondent accumulates and acquires title to 'remnants' which are ends of cloth processed and goods damaged in processing. In 1936, 588,000 yards of remnants were sold by respondent, ninety per cent of which was shipped in interstate commerce. These remnants represented roughly 'just less than one per cent' of the yards processed in that year. For the same year, respondent purchased $355, 856.00 worth of colors and dyestuffs, weighing over 235,111 pounds, of which forty per cent came from outside of \n\n[310 \nU.S. 318, 326]\n\u00a0\n Rhode Island. The company, during 1935, averaged 688 employees, with wages of $604,614.68, and its gross income from processing was $2,026,156.00. In 1937, the employees on the payroll were nearly 800.'\n\n That this evidence was abundantly sufficient to justify exercise of jurisdiction by the Board is not now open to controversy. It is settled that the Act is applicable to a processor, who constitutes even a relatively small percentage of his industry's capacity,4 where the materials processed are moved to and from the processor by their owners through the channels of interstate commerce,5 and it is not material, as the court below thought, that respondent's customers might be able to secure the same services from other Rhode Island processors if a labor dispute should stop the interstate flow of materials to and from respondent's plant. Since the purpose of the Act is to protect and foster interstate commerce, the Board's jurisdiction can attach, as here, before actual industrial strife materializes to obstruct that commerce. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n In its answer to the Board's complaint, the company contended that Nelson was not discharged April 3, 1937, but was merely 'laid off', and on April 2, 'went upon a vacation' and did not return or indicate a willingness to go back to work. However, the company insists, as it has throughout, that Nelson was not a diligent worker and was insubordinate; that he trespassed upon company property after work hours Thursday, April 1st; that 'one or two mornings that week he started work a little late \n\n[310 \nU.S. 318, 327]\n\u00a0\n and quit a little early'; that he did not start work Saturday, April 3, until 7:30, a half hour late.\n Some of the evidence supporting the Board's finding that Nelson was actually discharged for union activities on April 3, was:\n'Prior to Saturday, April 3, 1937, when Nelson was 'laid off', he had worked for the company two years as a carpenter. He had become actively interested in organizing the employees in a C.I.O. union the preceding Monday, March 29, 1937. On that day, he had obtained three hundred and fifty T.W.O.C. cards from a fellow employee (Schofield), who, he heard, 'had some applications for joining the union, the C.I.O.' His distribution of the cards met with quick response and many signed so that on Friday, the company official 'who does all the hiring', approached him and said, 'You're a ringleader of the C.I.O., but you are not going to be fired for it.' Nelson refused to tell this official the names of his collaborators in forming the union and also told him he would not reveal their names to Mr. Summersby, the company's president and general manager. Later that day, Nelson observed Schofield talking with Summersby and was introduced to the latter as 'helping ... (Schofield) to organize and get these pledge cards signed in the mill.' He was, that same day, Friday, refused admission to a meeting in Summersby's office between some employees and Summersby, but that afternoon, after work, he was called to Summersby's office. There Summersby asked 'why didn't we form a local union of our own' and 'thought it was a much better plan to form a local union.' And Summersby asked that the question of a local union be put up to a C.I.O. committee meeting to be held that night.\n\n'All day Friday and Saturday morning, his foreman 'didn't speak one word to' Nelson. Saturday morning, April 3, this foreman asked him 'when ( he) ... intended to start work' but added that he 'didn't hold anything against' him. When Saturday's work was over, Nelson was sent for by Summersby, who was affable at first, but who became hostile when Nelson indicated he would not go along with a local union. Sum- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 318, 328]\n\u00a0\n mersby then asked Nelson if he had been stealing on an occasion when he had returned to the plant after hours to get some T.W.O.C. cards, and asked him if he had begun work promptly that day (Saturday, April 3). Nelson was told by Summersby 'to take two weeks off and cool off.' Nelson insisted he was ready to go back to work Monday morning. His testimony narrated this conversation in part as follows\n\n\"A. ... I said, 'As far as being excited about it, you are more excited than I am and you are worried about it and I ain't.' He says, 'Sure, I am excited about it, but you are the cause of all it.' I said, 'I can't help that.' He said, 'You take the two weeks off and then come back and see Mr. Pierce.' I said, 'Meaning what, that I go back and see Mr. Pierce? I am not sure of a job when I come back? Or is this just a matter of beating about the bush to fire me?' He says, 'I won't give you nothing definite.' I says, 'I want something definite. I want to know whether or not you are firing me. If you are not telling me whether I go to work when I come back or not, I want to know whether you are firing me.' He says, 'I won't give you nothing definite.' I says, 'I can't go out without money. If you are going to fire me, I can't live without money.' He says, 'Silvia, get his money.' Mr. Silvia went out and got me my money and came in and I thanked Mr. Silvia for my money and went out. When I was halfway across the outer office I heard laughing, and I saw Silvia swing his arm down, and Mr. Silvia and Mr. Summersby were laughing for all they were worth, as though they had pulled a big joke.'\n\n\"Q. Did you ever go back after that for your job? A. No. I didn't. Mr. Summersby told me if I stepped foot on the premises within two weeks he was going to have me arrested.'\n\n'Nelson never went back because a T.W.O.C. official who conferred with Summersby said Summersby would not take him back. This T.W.O.C. official and a Conciliator of the United States Department of Labor said Summersby wouldn't take Nelson back because 'there would be a question of his authority.' In fact, a fellow employee told Nelson that Summersby had said some- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 318, 329]\n\u00a0\n thing about firing Nelson and Schofield and 'that he would find some way of getting around it.' On the morning of the day Nelson was fired he had spent a 'couple of minutes' telling other employees about a C.I.O. meeting of the previous night.'\n\n From the testimony of the T.W.O.C. official in question, a T.W.O.C. Director for Rhode Island, Summersby would not rehire 'especially Mr. Nelson.' And Summersby himself stated that he told the Federal Conciliator, 'I couldn't take back either of them because it would break down the discipline of our plant.'\n Nelson's foreman testified as a witness for respondent-\n'On Friday, April 2, 'I could see that he (Nelson) was talking around more or less, and so I had him come in the shop to work on the trucks. I thought that would be the place where I could watch him better.' He saw Nelson talking to the men early on April 3, before work and until 7:30, although work begins at 7. He reported to his superior that Nelson was 'talking to different ones', and went with Nelson to Summersby who asked Nelson 'if he decided, on some question that they were talking about the afternoon before' ... (Nelson) said, 'No,' and Summersby said, 'Well, then, if you can't give me a satisfactory answer on that I have thought it over and I have decided to lay you off for two weeks and let you think it over.' This foreman 'knew ... (Nelson) was interested in the C.I.O., but ... didn't know anything he said' to the men Saturday morning. On other occasions, he had seen Nelson start late or quit early without ever reporting the fact, and had seen Nelson talk around like that 'quite often' but 'this is the only time ... (the foreman) ever got mad at him.' This time, he was aware that Nelson had been connected with the C.I.O. for the past week 'and ... supposed he was still at it.' The foreman admitted that Nelson was 'a very good workman', that he may have worked between 7 and 7:10 on this particular Saturday morning and that on Saturday, April 3, Nelson, after having been spoken to, 'said he hadn't any feelings but what he would go on and do his work all right. And he did after that.' \n\n[310 \nU.S. 318, 330]\n\u00a0\n 'According to the Chief Engineer, who ranked above Nelson's foreman-\n\n'Nelson previously 'did a whole lot of talking.' In his three years with the company, he had seen others talking but never laid any one else off for talking. In his view 'when men are talking with one another there is very little work done', but the foreman did not report the men to whom Nelson was talking on April 3, although they also were 'surely' wasting time. The plant rules do not forbid talking.\n\n'Summersby, the president and general manager-\n\n'On April 2, 'inquired as to who (Nelson) ... was and what he did and if he had been active in the C.I.O. as an organizer.' Nelson, he stated, 'automatically forfeited his job' by not coming back at the end of his two weeks lay off, which was without pay. And if he should apply for work, his forced vacation 'would be on his record and would always be a black mark against him.\"\n\nThird. Discharge of Schofield.\n The court below saw no evidence supporting the Board's finding that this employee was discharged for union activities, and accepted the company's contention that he was discharged for smoking in the plant contrary to rules. Respondent admits that Schofield was discharged.\n Schofield, a machine operator, or 'jigger', testified-\n'On Saturday, March 27, 1937, he attended a C.I.O. meeting, obtained eight application cards for the C.I.O. and talked to some of his fellow employees about the C.I.O. All eight cards were signed that night. By Sunday, March 28, he had asked for and obtained seven hundred cards which he used during the following week, giving Nelson about one-half on Monday, March 29. By Wednesday, the cards gave out. On Friday, April 2, he and Summersby discussed certain difficulties with the piece work of 'jiggers.' Summersby, talking there in the plant, brought up the C.I.O. and said 'he couldn't see anything in an organization outside ... (with) ... \n\n[310 \nU.S. 318, 331]\n\u00a0\n big shots ... running big automobiles and hotel expenses.'\n\n'Summersby then suggested 'a union of our own in the stop.' Schofield attended a meeting in Summersby's office as a member of a committee of 'jiggers', and the subject of the C.I.O. arose again. Summersby said he wouldn't recognize an outside union. When Nelson attempted to enter this meeting, Summersby turned him away and referred to him as a 'troublemaker.' Sunday, April 4, there was a C.I.O. meeting at which Schofield and Nelson were both on the platform. Schofield went to work on Monday, the 5th, continuing to distribute C.I.O. cards. On Tuesday, the 6th, at 2:25 ( Nelson had been 'laid off' on the 3rd), a 'charge hand' notified Schofield that Summersby wanted to see him 'in his office right away.' He left his work and went directly to the locker room to wash and change from work clothes. While there, he and two other employees were smoking. An official of the company-a boss dyer-whom he had never seen 'in the locker room, not while the men were changing their clothes'-caught Schofield smoking and said, 'So that's it, you damn fool.' Schofield then went to Summersby's office as he had been directed, but did not find him there. Summersby's first words, on entering the office about twenty minutes later, charged Schofield with smoking, but Summersby refused to tell Schofield why he had originally been sent for-before he was caught smoking. Schofield was told to 'take a couple of weeks off.' He had been laid off once before for smoking.\n\n'On the Friday before the Tuesday on which this employee would, he thought, have been taken back to work, a Federal Conciliator and C.I.O. officials conferred with Summersby about Nelson and him. The C.I.O. official told Schofield that Summersby refused to rehire either, and as a result he never went back. Although he 'wanted to go back the first week', he took the word of the Federal Conciliator and the C.I.O. official that he would not be rehired. The two other employees who were smoking when he was caught were not disciplined, although the accosting official could see them. Despite 'No Smoking' signs, it was the practice of the men to smoke on the sly. Other men have been laid off two \n\n[310 \nU.S. 318, 332]\n\u00a0\n weeks for smoking, but Nelson was caught and 'others' have been seen by foremen and no lay-offs resulted. Schofield didn't 'know of any one being discharged' for smoking. He was made T.W.O.C. local financial secretary.\n\n'In the words of the C.I.O. official, 'Mr. Summersby saw red the minute I mentioned Schofield's and Nelson's names.\"\n\n As told by the boss dyer who found Schofield smoking-\n'This official had sent an employee to notify Schofield of Summersby's desire to see him; he himself went to the locker room to deliver the message. He asked one of the other employees in the locker room to remember the scene because he 'knew Percy Schofield's character.' It was his duty to detect smokers and he usually laid off, himself, any man found smoking. He had time to lay off Schofield while walking with him part of the way to Summersby's office, but he did not do so. 'It was a peculiar case and I wanted to think before I did anything.' This was the only case in which he had ever reported a smoker to a higher up. He had laid Schofield off for two weeks twice before, for smoking. In six or seven years, he had caught seven or eight smokers of whom, excepting Schofield, only one was discharged. He didn't go to the wash room 'very often.' 'A very short time before' he had heard that Schofield was somewhat active in the C.I.O.'\n\n One of the fellow employees present in the locker-room where Schofield was found smoking, stated that he also had been smoking but was not doing so when the boss dyer came in, and that the third man was smoking at that time but wasn't observed. He got the impression, then, that the boss dyer said something to the effect that he at last 'had' Schofield after having been after him for some time. He 'had never seen ... (the boss dyer) go to the locker room' before. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 318, 333]\n\u00a0\n Summersby testified that he had been told by Schofield that he was 'interested in organizing the C.I.O.'; and that he discharged Schofield for smoking.\nFourth. Domination of the Federation.\n As already noted, the Court of Appeals' opinion did not especially pass upon this contention. Since, however, the Court did not enforce the Board's order to cease dominating and to disestablish the Federation, as we think it should have, appropriate evidence on this issue will be pointed out.\n A machinist, employed eleven years by respondent, testified-\n'He attended a meeting in Summersby's office on April 6, the day of Schofield's discharge. Summersby 'said that he wouldn't recognize the C.I. O. and that it would be much better for us to join our own union than to be bothered by this C.I.O.' which would require the men to go out on sympathy strikes. This employee saw Federation cards and literature 'on the table' in the company's office. These were 'handed around' and one or two were picked up by the employees present; when Summersby and the vice president of the company left the room, the employees 'seemed to pick them up more frequently.' Temporary officers of the Federation were chosen there, in Summersby's office. A day or so later, the Federation met in the company's shipping room with one hundred and fifty to two hundred men present; Summersby addressed the meeting and said he would not recognize the C.I.O. and that it was better to have our own union. The machinist distributed in the plant the Federation cards which he had 'picked ... up' in 'Summersby's office'; the Federation cards 'were there.\"\n\n From testimony of other employees, it appeared that-\n'At the meeting on the 6th (the day Schofield was discharged) in Summersby's office, Federation cards and circulars were seen, and an employee distributed these \n\n[310 \nU.S. 318, 334]\n\u00a0\n cards; Summersby said 'he would like to have this local union' and 'wouldn't recognize the C.I.O.' Three 'jiggers' had seen Summersby on April 5 about wages and conditions of employment; he 'thought it would be better if we had our own union' instead of paying outside fellows. 'Someone' suggested that cards be passed out for a local union. Word was passed out by fellow workers that the company would pay for time spent at the meeting in the shipping room, at which Summersby 'said he wouldn't recognize C.I.O. or A.F. of L., no outside union', that it would 'be better if we had a local union' instead of paying others to ride around in big cars and that 'he would not tolerate C.I.O.' Workers were seen passing out Federation cards in the plant during working hours. Pay was given for the half-hour spent in the shipping room meeting and this time was included by instruction of the 'boss of the frames.' Federation cards were passed out 'openly' by men on the day of the shipping room meeting. Bosses were seen with cards. One employee was given his Federation card by the boss of his department. Another was asked by his foreman whether he had joined the Federation.'\n\n An employee testified-\n'Summersby sent for him on April 6 (the day of Schofield's discharge). The paymaster came to his house for him and said he was glad that this man wasn't 'deep ... in the C.I.O.', and took him to the office. There Summersby told him he was sorry that men in his line of work (in the gray room) had been left out of the meeting that morning in Summersby's office. This employee had told the men in the gray room that they shouldn't sign cards from a meeting at which they had not been represented. Summersby told him the C.I.O. would take money out of the plant and that a 'committee had gotten together ... to form this local union, because he informed them that he wouldn't recognize the C.I.O., and they started to organize a union that he would recognize. He said he would recognize the local.' He and Summersby then went into the meeting in an adjoining office ( 'one is Mr. Pawson's (respondent's vice president) and the other is Mr. Summersby's'). \n\n[310 \nU.S. 318, 335]\n\u00a0\n A leader at this meeting in company offices and attended by Summersby, 'said a few of them got together and decided they didn't want a C.I.O., that they thought they would be better off if they had a local union, that they had a talk with Mr. Summersby, and Mr. Summersby wouldn't recognize the C.I.O., and rather than have trouble he was going to see if we couldn't have a local union.' Summersby 'explained advantages of the local union and spoke of the B.D.A.\"\n\n Another employee supplied evidence that a week or two after Nelson was fired, the timekeeper took him to see Summersby, who asked about a C.I. O. card which had been on the back of this employee's car, and that Summersby then 'said he wouldn't recognize it' and could close the plant down.\n The financial Secretary of the Federation stated-\n'He was first given a temporary appointment at the meeting in Summersby's office, April 6, when Summersby said 'he didn't like the idea of bargaining outside.' The men present in the afternoon meeting in Summersby's office 'asked for the privilege of using the office to find out how we had made out on our cards.' The meeting in the shipping room was a day or so later. After the morning meeting in Summersby's office on the 6th, this temporary Federation official started passing out Federation cards for which Summersby had given permission. Federation circulars were posted on plant bulletin boards. Federation application cards were passed out by 'all of us that were in the office at that first meeting.' Officers of the Federation were subsequently elected (April 11). 'All us men who were in the office the first day, I think we acted as a committee.' Between April 6 and 11, Summersby permitted the temporary committee to meet in an old company office in the plant. The paymaster gave them a list of the men in the plant by which to determine the necessary fifty-one per cent. On April 9, prior to the election of the Federation's officers on the 11th, this temporary committee presented a letter to Summersby stating that they represented fifty-one per cent of the men. That same day, Summersby granted \n\n[310 \nU.S. 318, 336]\n\u00a0\n recognition to the Federation. This employee felt no need for organization, except for 'better feeling' which he thought 'was necessary because the C. I.O. was going to do the same thing.' He helped form the Federation 'partly' to stop the C.I.O., and because the C.I.O. had already started. A company car was used by him on one occasion for purposes of the Federation. Meetings of the executive committee of the Federation were held in a club room 'on property owned by the B.D.A.' This witness engaged as attorney for the Federation one who he knew 'had represented ... (the company) on some cases'; he himself lives in a house owned by the company. Some Federation dues were collected on the company's premises; members were not suspended for dues delinquency and may also be members of any labor union or society. The Federation started about a week after the C.I.O. drive; it had no income of its own prior to the last week in April. Eventually it affiliated with an outside union still designated 'as the B.D.A. Employees' Federation' 'to bring a little more prestige and to prove to the ones that were skeptical, that we were not a company union.\"\n\n The first vice president of the Federation testified-\n'He negotiated recognition of the Federation, April 9, (three and six days respectively after discharge of Schofield and Nelson) as its acting president. On that day, he called a meeting of the organizing committee in 'the little office in the gray room', showed them that they had fifty-one per cent signed cards, and then went to Summersby's office. In Summersby's office, the witness and company officials counted the signed cards and checked them against a list of employees which Summersby asked the paymaster to get. The cards were not checked to see if each signer was eligible; the management took the temporary committee's word for it. And the cards were left with Summersby. The witness didn't know that the Federation planned to do anything that 'was any different' from what the employees prevously could have done by grievance committees. He had heard rumors that a boss had Federation cards or spoke to employees about them, and believed one man quit work as the result of posting C.I.O. handbills. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 318, 337]\n\u00a0\n He spoke at the shipping room meeting and asked Summersby to speak there. Summersby did speak. Along the lines of his conversation at the two previous meetings in his office, Summersby told this gathering of employees that he preferred a local and 'was not in favor of bargaining with the C.I.O.\"\n\n T.W.O.C.'s State Director for Rhode Island stated-\n'On April 7, he saw Summersby and told him T.W.O.C. had 'about seventy-five per cent' of the men signed. Summersby refused to say then that he would recognize T.W.O.C. April 16, the Director, a Federal Conciliator and a T.W.O.C. organizer saw Summersby again and were told by Summersby that 'he had a union' and wouldn't recognize the C.I.O. as he was 'afraid of an outside union.' It was agreed that he would hear from Summersby's attorney after the first (April 7) meeting, but he never heard. A form contract was submitted to Summersby on the 16th, but by that date 'he had definitely decided that he would refuse to bargain with the C.I.O.\"\n\n According to the company's vice president-\n'He was present part of the time at one of the meetings in Summersby's office on April 6, where cards and literature were present and a union was discussed. Summersby was heard to express the opinion 'that he would prefer to deal with a union of his own employees rather than to deal with outside influences.\"\n\n One of the men present when Schofield was found smoking testified that a salaried employee who reports 'things which are done wrong' came around and asked everybody if he had joined the local union; at the meeting in the shipping room, Summersby said he would not recognize the C. I.O. but would recognize a local; the witness was paid for the fifteen minutes spent at that meeting; the men were told by the time-keeper that they would be so paid. An official of the Federation said, 'The impression was that Mr. Summersby probably wouldn't recognize' the C.I.O.; this official was 'one \n\n[310 \nU.S. 318, 338]\n\u00a0\n of the first' organizers of the Federation and conveyed to people the impression that Summersby wouldn't recognize the C.I.O.\n As related by Summersby, president and general manager of respondent-\n'A wage increase was announced March 31. After he met in his office on April 6, (the day of Nelson's discharge) with the committee of 'jiggers', later the same day he was asked for a place in which the Federation's temporary committee could meet. He answered the request by saying, 'You can have my office and make yourselves comfortable.' That afternoon, as he was ready to leave, the temporary committee met in his office and he was 'advised that they were organizing a local union .... I told them that I would grant them the same privileges I would grant any other union ....' Two days after recognizing the Federation, he placed and paid for an ad in a local paper, entitled 'The Strike that Failed' because in part, as he said, 'The B.D.A. Employees' Federation had formed and had taken the organization into their own hands, and had shown that they were still real citizens.' Respondent is owned by an English concern and a statement by him appeared in the local paper, on April 25, disclosing the possibility of the company's moving the plant out of the United States if there were to be 'labor uncertainties.'\n\n'He recognized the Federation April 9, and on April 13, told the Federal Conciliator that an election could not be held, since the Federation had already been recognized. And on the 16th, Summersby told Salerno that his proposed T.W.O.C. contract would be taken up with Summersby's lawyer.'\n\nFifth. Designation of T.W.O.C. as bargaining agent.\n The court below found no substantial evidence to support the Board's finding that a majority of respondent's employees joined the T.W.O.C., or that 'the T.W.O.C. ... ever came into actual existence with authority to negotiate a contract with the respondent.' Much of the testimony already referred to bore upon the genesis of T.W.O.C. at respondent's plant. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 318, 339]\n\u00a0\n Schofield said:\n'By April 4 he had 'four hundred and sixty-five or four hundred and sixty-seven' signed application cards 'marked down.' The cards were sent to Boston. A few men paid dues but collection was stopped. '... we had a majority of cards signed.' Dues are not collected until management grants recognition. No local C.I.O. (T.W.O.C.) entity had been formed for the plant; 'we had the fifty-one per cent, but this company union stuff and discharge and everything came along, and we have just had to wait for this hearing ....\"\n\n Nelson stated that he told the timekeeper, on April 2, 'It's all over but the shouting .... We have well over sixty per cent signed up all ready.' And from the testimony of an officer of the Federation it appeared that the C.I.O. drive resulted in a number of signatures, and that both organizations could possibly claim fifty-one per cent of the employees signed up.\n As explained by the T.W.O.C. State Director-\n'A charter or local is unnecessary for membership in T.W.O.C.; no charter to a local is granted until after recognition. Members of the Federation are members in good standing of T.W.O.C., even if they have not paid dues or initiation fees. The T.W.O.C. cards were brought to him during the first week in April. Summersby, April 9, refused to agree to have the Federal Conciliator, or a third party, count the T.W.O.C. cards. Employees are eligible to membership in T.W.O.C., without formation of a plant local.'\n\n The T.W.O.C. Director's Secretary stated that the T.W.O.C. cards were brought in before April 12. It was agreed at the hearing that, after respondent checked against the original signed cards, T.W.O.C. had a list of four hundred and eighty-two names taken from those cards. And it was stipulated that these cards were signed 'on or before April 10, 1937.'\nShift in membership.\n Respondent has contended before the Board, as here, that if the T.W.O. C. did actually represent a majority \n\n[310 \nU.S. 318, 340]\n\u00a0\n of its employees on April 4 (as the Board found), a shift in membership had given the Federation a majority when the company on April 9 recognized it as exclusive bargaining representative. However, the Board found that 'the record is clear that, had it not been for the unfair labor practices of the respondent in organizing and fostering the Federation and in persuading, intimidating and coercing its employees to join the Federation and leave the T.W.O.C., the respondent's employees would have remained members of the T.W.O.C.' In view of the substantial support in the evidence for the Board's findings that the company intimidated and coerced its employees and dominated the Federation, the Board properly concluded that 'The unfair labor practices of the respondent cannot operate to change the bargaining representative previously selected by the untrammelled will of the majority.' \n7\n And, accordingly, the Board was justified in its finding 'that on April 4, 1937, and at all times thereafter, the T.W.O.C., pursuant to Section 9(a) of the Act, was the exclusive representative of all the employees in the appropriate unit for purposes of collective bargaining ....'\n As one of the apparently alternative grounds of its decision, the Circuit Court of Appeals declared the Board without authority to order reinstatement of Nelson and Schofield because of so-called unlawful conduct and the alleged incitement of a 'sit down' strike within the meaning of the Fansteel case. \n8\n The opinion stated that 'Nelson even threatened truck drivers delivering materials to the plant with violence, and to destroy spur tracks over which materials were delivered to the plant. ... The \n\n[310 \nU.S. 318, 341]\n\u00a0\n affirmative action that is authorized is to make these remedies effective in the redress of the employees' rights, to assure them self-organization and freedom in representation, not to license them to commit tortious acts or to protect them from the appropriate consequences of unlawful conduct. We are of the opinion that to provide for the reinstatement or reemployment of employees guilty of the acts, which it is not denied were committed in this instance, would not only effectuate any policy of the Act, but would directly tend to make abortive its plan for peaceable procedure.'\n We find no such issue raised by respondent's pleadings before the Board. Respondent made request for special findings by the Board, but included none that Nelson and Schofield had been guilty of any unlawful conduct. Nelson categorically denied having made threats of violence. The court was apparently referring to the testimony of a truck driver which appears in the record. An objection of the Board's representative to the introduction of this particular testimony was overruled by the trial examiner when respondent's attorney made the following statement: 'If your Honor please, may I point out that while Mr. Nelson was on the witness stand in cross-examination I asked him if he did not say certain things at this time and place, that this witness has been referring to, which the witness Nelson denies. The testimony of this witness that Nelson did say those things is in contradiction of Mr. Nelson's testimony and is clearly admissible as tending to impeach the veracity of Mr. Nelson's testimony. Aside from that I also submit it as bearing on the type of conduct and the attitude of the representatives and organizers of this T.W.O.C. getting membership and conducting the affairs of this organization.'\n This truck driver's helper testified that on the morning of April 8, after Schofield and Nelson had been laid off, he saw Nelson, Schofield and a third 'little fellow from the \n\n[310 \nU.S. 318, 342]\n\u00a0\n C.I.O.' 'outside the mill yard.' He noticed Nelson 'going up and down motioning ... Going like this (illustrating by waiving arms, squatting and standing.)' As this truck driver recollected, Schofield was not 'doing anything.' 'If anybody was looking out the east door they could' see Nelson or Schofield moving their hands that morning; Nelson 'made a motion to sit down, that is all,' out 'on the main road going to the plant.' He 'couldn't say that' any workers would have seen Nelson; he 'couldn't say that, whether they could see out or not. I don't know.' An employee, not Nelson or Schofield, who 'went through the department shouting 'Sit-down strike,\" was taken for an automobile ride by the company's vice president, talked to, given lunch and sent home to bed without loss of pay and was still working for the company at the time of the hearing. When asked, 'You remember you said, 'Well, we can blow up the railroad?\", Nelson answered, 'No, absolutely not.'\n In vacating the Board's order of reinstatement on the ground that undenied evidence showed that Nelson and Schofield had, after their unlawful discharge, incited or threatened unlawful conduct, the court acted without any justification.\n Congress has placed the power to administer the National Labor Relations Act in the Labor Board, subject to the supervisory powers of the Courts of Appeals as the Act sets out. If the Board has acted within the compass of the power given it by Congress, has, on a charge of unfair labor practice, held a 'hearing', which the statute requires, comporting with the standards of fairness inherent in procedural due process, has made findings based upon substantial evidence and has ordered an appropriate remedy, a like obedience to the statutory law on the part of the Court of Appeals requires the court to grant enforcement of the Board's order. Until granted such enforcement, the Board is powerless to act upon the parties \n\n[310 \nU.S. 318, 343]\n\u00a0\n before it. And the proper working of the scheme fashioned by Congress to determine industrial controversies fairly and peaceably demands that the courts quite as much as the administrative body act as Congress has required.\n Mindful of the separate responsibilities Congress has imposed upon the Board and the courts, we have carefully scrutinized this entire record. Within the range of our examination has appeared not merely the testimony but also the procedure followed from the filing of the charge before the Board to final decree of the Court of Appeals. The Board and its representatives solicitously guarded respondent's and intervenor's right to a full and fair hearing; manifested liberality in ruling upon evidence proposed by both sides; and conducted the proceedings in a manner calculated to bring about a just result. And as we have pointed out, substantial evidence supported the result which the Board did reach. \n9\n Notwithstanding, the court below declined to order enforcement of the Board's order, and the implications of its opinion are that the Board without a proper regard for either the limitations on its power or the evidence made findings all of which had no substantial support.\n But in reaching this conclusion the Court of Appeals itself failed to give proper regard to the evidence which was before the Board, which appeared in the record before the court and which we have set out in this opinion. In refusing to enforce the Board's order, the court exceeded the power given it. The cause is reversed and remanded with directions to enforce the Board's order without conditions or qualifications.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \n308 \nU.S. 549\n, 60 S.Ct. 386, 84 L.Ed. --; cf.

The decisive question raised by the petition is whether a direction for an election made by the National Labor Relations Board in a representation proceeding under  9(c) of the Wagner Act, 49 Stat. 449, 453, 29 U.S.C., Supp. IV,  151-166, 29 U.S.C.A.  151-166, is reviewable by a circuit court of appeals under  10(f) of the Act. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 413, 414]\n\u00a0\n In February, 1938, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 876, one of the respondents, and an affiliate of respondent, American Federation of Labor, filed with the regional director of the Board a petition asking an investigation and the certification of a representative, for purposes of collective bargaining, of the employees of Consumers Power Company, pursuant to  9(c) of the Act. After a hearing, in which the petitioner, the employer, and the Utility Workers Organizing Committee, an affiliate of the Congress of Industrial Organization, participated, the Board issued a 'decision and direction of election.' 9 N. L.R.B. 742. At the election in January, 1939, 2,806 of the total 2,977 employees voted. Of these 1,072 voted for I.B.E.W. and 1,164 voted for U.W. O.C.\n After further proceedings and a hearing the Board found 'that the question concerning representation which has arisen can best be resolved by the holding of a run-off election in which the employees in the appropriate unit will be given the opportunity to decide whether or not they desire to be represented by U.W.O.C.' and made its 'direction' accordingly. 11 N.L.R.B. 848.\n Contending that the direction, contrary to law, excludes Union 876 from the ballot on the run-off election, respondents petitioned the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit to review the direction under the provisions of  10(f) of the Act.

FALK CORP.(1940)\nNo. 460\nArgued: Decided: January 2, 1940\n\n\n\n\n[308 \nU.S. 453, 454]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frank Murphy, Atty. Gen., and Charles Fahy, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. A. J. Engelhard and Leon B. Lamfrom, both of Milwaukee, Wis., for respondent Falk Corporation.\n Mr. Giles F. Clark, of Milwaukee, Wis., for respondent Independent Union of Falk Employees.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Upon charges filed by the Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel, and Tin Workers of North America, Lodge No. 1528, the Labor Board found that respondent, an employer conceded to be engaged in interstate commerce, had, in violation of the National Labor Relations Act, interfered with its employees' free right to self organization and had fostered and dominated a company union called the Independent Union. \n1\n Respondent was ordered to cease and desist from such interference and domination; to disestablish the company union completely, and to post notices in its plant of compliance with the Board's \n\n[308 \nU.S. 453, 455]\n\u00a0\n order. At the same time and in a proceeding consolidated2 with the determination of the alleged unfair albor practices, the Board, also upon petition of Amalgamated, directed an election of a representative for collective bargaining on a ballot to contain the Amalgamated and the Operating Engineers-a participant in the consolidated hearing-but not the Independent.\n On petition by the Board for enforcement of its order, the Court of Appeals concluded3 that 'the order of the Board is valid and ... its petition for enforcement ... is ... granted.' But, of its own volition, the court provided in its final order 'that the ... employees shall remain free to choose at the coming election, or any future election held or conducted pursuant to the provisions of the ... Act, the Independent Union to represent them in labor relation dealings with respondent;' and that respondent be permitted to add to the notices in its plant the qualification that the Independent would be disestablished and unrecognized only 'until and unless ... (the) employees freely and of their own choice select the Independent Union as their representative .... '4\n In its petition for certiorari, the Board contended that the court was without jurisdiction to review a direction of election and that, apart from the question of jurisdiction, the court had improperly interfered with the discretion given the Board by the Act. We granted certiorari to review these important questions. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n The first of the two consolidated proceedings before the Board was based upon the charge of the Amalgamated, a labor organization, that respondent had engaged in unfair labor practices contrary to Section 8(1), ( 2), (3) and \n\n[308 \nU.S. 453, 456]\n\u00a0\n (5) of the Act. As already noted, the Board found respondent had interfered with its employees' free choice of a bargaining agent in violation of section 8(1), (2) and (3). Because there was no clear showing that the Amalgamated then represented a majority of the employees, the Board did not sustain the charge that respondent's refusal to bargain collectively with Amalgamated amounted to an unfair labor practice under 8( 5).\n The second phase of the Labor Board's action was taken pursuant to Section 9(c)6 of the Act, authorizing the Board to investigate and ascertain representatives of employees for collective bargaining. As expressly permitted by subsection (c), the Board conducted this investigation, itself a distinct proceeding, 'in conjunction with a proceeding under section 10 (160 of this title)' and rendered its 'Direction of Election' at the same time the order relative to the unfair labor practices was entered 'under section 10 (160 of this title).' It was this 'Direction of Election' that provided for inclusion on the ballot of Amalgamated (C.I.O.) and the Operating Engineers (A.F. of L.), but omitted the Independent. The election was not actually to be held until after the Board was 'satisfied that the effects of the company's unfair labor practices ... (had) been dissipated by' compliance with the order to cease and desist and to disestablish the Independent.\n When the Board petitioned the Court of Appeals for enforcement of its order against respondent, if filed a transcript of the entire consolidated proceedings held under 9(c) and 10(c). \n\n[308 \nU.S. 453, 457]\n\u00a0\n Affirming the finding of unfair labor practices and order made by the Board under 10(c), 29 U.S.C.A.  160(c), the court considered its power to act at an end if nothing had been before it 'but the terms of an election by the employees about to take place.' But the court held, one judge dissenting, that it did have jurisdiction to attach a condition to the Board's order whereby Independent might become a candidate in the proposed election because it was 'disposing of a labor dispute case wherein the proceedings (had) gone beyond mere plans by the Board for the calling of an election' and therefore had before it 'for final disposition, the matter of the selection of the bargaining agent.' Having thus found jurisdiction in itself to make 'final disposition ... of the selection of the bargaining agent', the court thought it necessary so to condition the Board's order as to prevent the elimination 'for all time (of) one of the candidates-the Independent Union.'\n Respondent and the intervening Independent (company) union here contend that the court below did not actually modify the Board's 'Direction of Election', but if deemed to have done so, the modification was authorized under either Section 9(d) or Section 10(e).7 They also support \n\n[308 \nU.S. 453, 458]\n\u00a0\n the result below on the ground that, as the court below believed, the Board was without power to keep the company union-if purged from company influence-from the ballot in a future election to select a bargaining agent, because such proscription would impair the guarantee in Section 7 of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  157, that employees may bargain collectively through representatives of their own free choice.\n First. We think it apparent that the conditions attached by the court to the Board's order operated as a modification of the Board's Direction that Independent be omitted from the ballot in the coming election. In conditioning the Board's order, the court acted, as it said, 'that the coming election shall be free, uninfluenced by the employer and unhampered by any election order which eliminates (the Independent) as a contender.' In effect, the court's qualification of the Board's order judicially pronounced-in advance of the election-that election methods considered 'suitable' by the courts rather than by the Board must be followed. But Section 9 of the Act vests power in the Board, not in the court, to select the method of determining what union, if any, employees desire as a bargaining agent; to this end, the Board 'may take a secret ballot of employees, or utilize any other suitable method to ascertain such representatives.' \n\n[308 \nU.S. 453, 459]\n\u00a0\n Nor can authority for such anticipatory judicial control of election methods be found in Section 9(d) which permits a review only in those cases in which the Board makes an order relating to labor practices found to be unfair as a result of a prior certification of a selected bargaining agent. \n8\n Here, the Board's order that the employer cease its unfair practices, disestablish the company union and post notices was not 'based in whole or in part upon facts certified' as the result of an election or investigation made by the Board pursuant to Section 9(c). The proposed election here has not even been held and consequently no certification of a proper bargaining agent has been made by the Board. Until that election is held, there can be no certification of a bargaining representative and no Board order-based on a certification, has been or can be made, so as to invoke the court's powers under 9(d).\n The fundamental error of the court below lay in its assumption that there was before it 'for final disposition, the matter of the selection of the bargaining agent.' The court has no right to review a proposed election and in effect to supervise the manner in which it shall thereafter be conducted. \n9\n There can be no court review under 9(d) until the Board issues an order and requires the employer to do something predicated upon the result of an election.\n Since this employer has not been ordered by the Board to do anything predicated upon the results of an election the court had no authority to act under 9(d).\n Second. The company and Independent contend, as the court below held, that the Board's order of disestablishment-eliminating the Independent from the coming election even though purged of company influence-violates Section 710 of the Act which guarantees the right of \n\n[308 \nU.S. 453, 460]\n\u00a0\n employees to choose their own bargaining representatives. On this premise, they argue that under the power in 10(e) to modify orders of the Board, it was the duty of the court below to alter the Board's order of disestablishment so as to protect the right of the employees to choose the Independent if purged of company domination prior to the contemplated election.\n On the contrary, the Board reached the conclusion that full protection of the employees' right freely to choose bargaining representatives required complete disestablishment effecting elimination of the Independent as a candidate. The findings of the Board, on which it reached this conclusion, in part were:\n'Shortly after the passage of the National Industrial Recovery Act in 1933, 11 respondent brought into being a company dominated union of its employees called the 'Works Council' which functioned under company control until April, 1937. At that time, the A.F. of L. and the C.I.O. were making intensive efforts to organize respondent's employees in the face of respondent's hostility. As the campaign of the outside unions progressed, the company's personnel manager arranged, for April 12, the first of four meetings, held by Representatives of the Works Council during working hours in the company's plant hospital; in the course of these meetings there was a suggestion that the company would advance the date of a proposed wage income to influence the employees' choice of a union, and the necessity for prompt incorporation 'because the C.I.O. was working in the plant' was made clear; April 18, a meeting was held off of respondent's property, but no definite form of organiza- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 453, 461]\n\u00a0\n tion was decided upon; April 20, after conferring with an attorney whom respondent's president had suggested, three employees incorporated the Independent and notified respondent that it was ready to bargain collectively for some four hundred employees; on April 23, respondent recognized the Independent as the bargaining unit for all its employees upon the statement of the three incorporators, without proof, that they represented a majority of the employees.'\n\n In summary, the Board stated that respondent had used the Independent 'as a convenient weapon to prevent the exercise of its employees' rights to self-organization and collective bargaining.' And the court below, in approving the findings of the Board, held that the testimony showed that the company 'earnestly endeavored to prevent the unionizing of its employees and when the inevitable became imminent, it sought to dominate the formation, organization and activities of the' company union. The evidence abundantly supports the concurrent findings of the Board and the court below. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n From these findings the Board justifiably drew the inference that this company-created union could not emancipate itself from habitual subservience to its creator, and that in order to insure employees that complete freedom of choice guaranteed by Section 7, Independent must be completely disestablished and kept off the ballot.\n Congress has intrusted the power to draw such inferences to the Board and not to the courts. \n13\n In order that 9(c) might be an effective means of selecting freely chosen representatives for collective bargaining as guaranteed by Section 7, the Board acted within its power in disestablishing \n\n[308 \nU.S. 453, 462]\n\u00a0\n Independent so as to bar it from consideration as an employees' representative. \n14\n\u00a0\n\n Third. The court also modified the Board's order by omitting the requirement that the notices to be posted in the plant contain a statement that the company would 'cease and desist' from its unlawful activities. As stated in the first opinion of the court below,15 the purpose of the Board in requiring the company to publish notices assuring its employees that it would 'cease and desist' had been 'to convey to the employees the knowledge of a guarantee of an unhampered right in the future to determine their own labor affiliation.' Knowledge on the part of the men that the company would cease and desist from hampering, interfering with and coercing them in selection of a bargaining agent, which the Board found the company had done successfully in the past, was essential if the employees were to feel free to exercise their rights without incurring the company's disfavor. But the notices as permitted by the court's modifying order not only failed to assure the men that the company would cease its unlawful and coercive practices, but-backed with the prestige of a formal court order-told the men that Independent, while in terms disestablished for the time being, was still available for selection by the employees. Thus the modified notices neither renounced \n\n[308 \nU.S. 453, 463]\n\u00a0\n the company's unlawful practices nor promised their abandonment, and left as a candidate the Independent, toward which the unrenounced unlawful activities of the company had been directed. We think the plant notices as modified by the court's order fell far short of conveying 'to the employees the knowledge of a guarantee of an unhampered right in the future to determine their labor affiliations.'\n Other contentions of respondent have been considered and found without merit.\n The court below committed error in modifying the Board's order. Accordingly, the cause is remanded to the Court of Appeals with instructions to enforce the Board's order without any modification.\n It is so ordered.\n Remanded with instructions.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 49 Stat. 449, 452, Sec. 8, 29 U.S.C.A.  158. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Id., Sec. 9(c) 29 U.S.C.A.  159(c). \n[\nFootnote 3\n] 7 Cir., 102 F.2d 383, 390. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] 7 Cir., 106 F.2d 454, 456, 457. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] \n308 \nU.S. 544\n, 60 S.Ct. 176, 84 L.Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Sec. 9(c), 49 Stat. 453: 'Whenever a question affecting commerce arises concerning the representation of employees, the Board may investigate such controversy and certify to the parties, in writing, the name or names of the representatives that have been designated or selected.

NATIONAL LABOR R. BOARD(1940)\nNo. 272\nArgued: February 7, 1939Decided: March 4, 1940\n\n\n\n\n[309 \nU.S. 350, 351]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Abraham Mann and Edward M. Ladden, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Robert B. Watts, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Apart from the sufficiency of the evidence to support an order of the National Labor Relations Board, the questions of importance presented for our decision are whether the Board has authority to order an employer not to enforce contracts with its employees, found to have been procured in violation of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq., and to contain provisions violating that act, in the absence of the employees as parties to the proceeding; and whether the Board has authority to make its order relating to the contracts, although the unfair labor practices found to affect the contracts were not set up in the charge presented to the Board, on the basis of which it issued its complaint.\n On August 2, 1937, the Bakery & Confectionery Workers International Union of America, Local Union No. 405, a labor organization, affiliated with the American Federa- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 350, 352]\n\u00a0\n tion of Labor, lodged with the National Labor Relations Board an amended charge, alleging that petitioner had engaged in certain unfair labor practices in violation of the National Labor Relations Act. After a complaint by the Board charging petitioner with unfair labor practices had been served October 7, 1937, and after hearings, the Board found jurisdictional facts, which need not be repeated, and other facts which may be shortly summarized as follows: Petitioner is engaged in business in the manufacture of licorice products which it sells and ships in commerce, employing at its Brooklyn, New York plant about one hundred and forty production employees. The Board found that early in July, 1937, the Union began to secure signatures of petitioner's employees to applications for membership; that on July 14, 1937, ninety-nine of petitioner's one hundred and forty employees had signed applications for membership, designating the Union as the applicant's representative for collective bargaining; that the member had increased to one hundred and nine on July 19th or 20th. On that date a meeting was held between representatives of the Union and officers of petitioner, at which the Union demands were presented. The negotiations came to nothing and were promptly followed by an unsuccessful effort on the part of petitioner's representatives to circulate among the employees a petition, nominating a committee to act as their collective bargaining representative.\n On July 29th a second meeting took place between representatives of the Union and the president and other officers of the company, at which the petitioner declined to recognize the Union as the bargaining representative of all the employees, and declared that it would negotiate with the Union only as the bargaining representative of its members. The meeting adjourned without reaching any agreement. On August 2nd the employees went out on strike. The plant was closed and not reopened \n\n[309 \nU.S. 350, 353]\n\u00a0\n until the conclusion of the strike on August 25th. August 5th had been agreed upon for a third meeting, and on the evening of August 2nd, after the strike had begun, the Union representatives wrote to petitioner stating that the Union was ready to meet with petitioner at any time or place which it would designate 'in order to mediate the dispute and through collective bargaining arrive at a mutually satisfactory agreement.' Petitioner replied, declaring that it believed the Union had called the strike. It cancelled the meeting of August 5th and asserted that it would not 'set any further time for negotiations until we have a letter from you informing us as to whether or not this strike was instigated, ordered or approved by your Union or officials of the Union.' Representatives of the Union denied that it had called the strike. The Board found that the strike was the result of spontaneous action by the employees because of dissatisfaction with the course of negotiations between the Union and petitioner.\n On August 27th after the plant was reopened, petitioner sent a letter to each employee requesting him to return to work on August 30th. On the same day petitioner's representative met with three employees who stated that they were anxious to return to work, and asked whether they could have their own committee and bargain with petitioner. They were informed that if they could obtain the authorization of a majority of the employees, petitioner would deal with them. Thereafter, petitioner's president, at the request of one of the three, prepared a form of letter designating a committee of workers as the Collective Bargaining Representatives of the employees and revoking the authority to any other organization. The letter was signed by the members of the committee and one hundred and ten other employees, and returned to petitioner on September 9th.\n At a meeting with the Committee on September 10th petitioner's president renewed proposals for a contract, \n\n[309 \nU.S. 350, 354]\n\u00a0\n which he had made at the meetings with the Union representatives on July 20th and July 29th, stipulating for a five per cent. wage increase, time and a half for overtime, and one week's vacation with pay. The Committee's only request related to pay for holidays and a reduction of the term of the contract from five to three years, which was granted with some modification. As finally agreed upon the contract purports to be made between the petitioner, the Committee and 'each and every one of the employees'.1 Petitioner furnished the Committee members with mimeographed copies of the agreement, telling them to explain it to the best of their ability to the employees, and giving explicit instructions as to the manner in which the individual contracts were to be executed. There was testimony by a number of witnesses that petitioner's president informed the employees that he would not 'protect their jobs and they would not get five per cent. if they did not sign the agreement. One group of fourteen employees asked for \n\n[309 \nU.S. 350, 355]\n\u00a0\n representation on the Committee and were referred to petitioner's president, who, in refusing the request, informed them that 'the Committee had been picked already. There is enough right now on the Committee.' The contract is stated to be directly between the petitioner and the individual employee and under it the Committee as such has no rights or duties. It was signed by the Committee and one hundred and eighteen employees. The Committee appears to have functioned only so long as it was necessary to obtain the individual signatures on the contract. The benefits of the contract were limited to those employees who signed. In return the signers relinquished the right to strike, the right to demand a closed shop or signed agreement with any union. The contract also contained provisions for arbitration as to rate of wages and the number of regular hours of employment per week by an arbitrator designated by and mutually acceptable to petitioner and the Committee, but provided that the 'question as to the propriety of an employee's discharge is in no event to be one for arbitration or mediation. ...'\n From these subsidiary findings of fact the Board concluded that petitioner, by refusing to bargain collectively with the Union on July 20th and July 29th and thereafter had engaged in unfair labor practices within the meaning of  8(5) of the Act; that petitioner, by coercing and intimidating employees in the exercise of their rights to self- organization and collective bargaining, and by persuading and coercing its employees to refrain from becoming members of the Union and to sign individual contracts of employment, had engaged in an unfair labor practice within the meaning of  8(1) of the Act, and that by initiating, sponsoring and dominating a labor organization of its employees, the Collective Bargaining Committee, it had engaged in unfair labor practices within the meaning of  8(1) and (2) of the Act. The \n\n[309 \nU.S. 350, 356]\n\u00a0\n Board's order directed petitioner to desist from dominating and interfering with the administration of the Collective Bargaining Committee, from recognizing the Committee as representing petitioner's employees, from giving effect to petitioner's contracts with the Committee and with the individual employees, and from refusing to bargain collectively with the Union. As affirmative relief, designed to effectuate the policy of the Act as authorized by  10(c), the Board ordered petitioner to bargain collectively, on request, with the Union; to withdraw recognition from the Committee; to inform the Committee and employees who had contracted individually that 'such contract constitutes a violation' of the Act; that the employees are relieved from all obligations under it; that petitioner will 'no longer demand its performance' and to post appropriate notices.\n The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, upon petition of the Board for enforcement of the order, directed that it be enforced except for a modification of that part of the order which directed that petitioner recognize and bargain with the Union. The order of the Court of Appeals directed that this part of the Board's order be conditioned upon a determination in an election that the Union is still the choice as bargaining representative of a majority of the employees. 104 F.2d 655.\n Upon a petition which challenged the authority of the Board to make so much of its order as related to the contracts with petitioner's employees, without making the employees parties to the proceeding, we granted certiorari October 9, 1939, because of the importance of the question in the administration of the National Labor Relations Act, and because of an asserted misapplication of the principles of National Labor Relations Board v. Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines, \n303 \nU.S. 261\n, 58 S.Ct. 571, 115 A.L.R. 307 and Consolidated Edison Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 305 \n\n[309 \nU.S. 350, 357]\n\u00a0\n U.S. 197, 59 S.Ct. 206. Of lesser moment are questions, also raised by the petition,2 whether the Board's finding that the Union was still the authorized bargaining representative of a majority of petitioner's employees, is supported by substantial evidence and, if not, whether the Circuit Court of Appeals properly directed the Board to conduct an election to determine whether the Union still represents a majority of petitioner's employees, and, finally, whether the jurisdiction of the Board is limited to such unfair labor practices as are set up in the charge presented to the Board so as to preclude its determination that the creation of the Organization Committee and petitioner's contracts with individual employees involved unfair labor practices, since both occurred after the charge was lodged with the Board and after its complaint was served on petitioner.\n\n 1. \nThe Board found that petitioner, on July 20th and 29th, 1937, and thereafter, refused to recognize and to bargain collectively with the representative (the Union) of a majority of its employees. If we assume, as petitioner argues, that a majority of its employees had freely revoked their designation of the Union as bargaining representative and chosen in its stead the Collective Bargaining Committee, these circumstances do not militate against the findings of the Board that the Union represented the employees during July and August when the petitioner refused to bargain with it, nor do they relieve petitioner from the consequences of its refusal to bargain, which was an unfair labor practice.\n Since the Court of Appeals has confirmed the findings of the Board, there is no occasion here to review the evidence in detail. Cincinnati, etc., Ry. Co. v. Interstate \n\n[309 \nU.S. 350, 358]\n\u00a0\n Commerce Commission, \n206 \nU.S. 142, 154\n, 27 S.Ct. 648, 653; Illinois Central R.R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n206 \nU.S. 441, 456\n, 27 S.Ct. 700, 705. It is enough, with the findings not challenged, that there is evidence that by July 20th one hundred and nine of petitioner's one hundred and forty employees had signed applications for membership in the Union, designating it as the applicant's representative for collective bargaining, and that on that date negotiation began between petitioner and the Union representatives which was continued until August. The evidence shows that attempts by petitioner between that date and July 20th to circulate a petition among its employees nominating a committee to act as their collective bargaining representative failed. A few employees signed. Then, a number cancelled their signatures. The petition was returned to the petitioner's superintendent and was destroyed by an assistant secretary of the company. There is testimony that at the meeting with the Union representatives on July 29th petitioner's president declined to recognize the Union as the bargaining representative of all the employees, and declared that he would negotiate with it only as the bargaining representative of the Union members, refusing to bargain with it as the representative of all the employees, a plain violation of the Act.  8(5), 9(a). This was followed by petitioner's refusal, on August 2nd, to negotiate with Union representatives. There was also evidence from which the Board could have found that the negotiations on July 20th and July 29th were not entered into by the petitioner in good faith, and were but thinly disguised refusals to treat with the Union representatives.\n In view of the evidence already noted of the choice of the Union as bargaining representative by a large majority of the employees between July 14th and 20th, of the complete failure of petitioner's efforts to disturb that representation between the 20th and the 29th, there was \n\n[309 \nU.S. 350, 359]\n\u00a0\n substantial evidence to support the Board's conclusion that the Union was the choice as bargaining representative of appellant's employees during July and in August, at least until the 5th, when petitioner refused to treat with the Union.\n As will presently appear, the bargaining committee and the contracts obtained through its mediation were both the products of unfair labor practices, and the Committee, under the Board's order, was not entitled to recognition as the bargaining representative of the employees. Such injury, if any, as the petitioner might have suffered from the Board's order requiring it to recognize and bargain with the Union, is avoided by the direction of the Court of Appeals that this part of the order be conditioned upon a determination by an election that the Union is still the choice of a majority of the employees. The Board has not petitioned for certiorari and does not complain of this direction.\n\n 2. \nThe petition for certiorari does not assail the findings of the Board that petitioner's officials initiated the organization of the Committee, and that it 'sponsored and dominated the formation of the Committee and thereafter dominated its administration and contributed support to it'. We shall not re-examine those issues here, more than to say that the evidence discloses that the purpose of creating the Committee was to secure the contracts and by the contracts the Committee was left without any further function to perform except to join with the employer in choosing an arbitrator for the arbitration of specified labor disputes.\n But the petition raises the question whether the terms of the contract, as the Court of Appeals held, violate the National Labor Relations Act and it challenges the authority of the Board because of the absence of the individual employees, as parties, to make any order respecting the contracts. The contracts, as the Board found, were \n\n[309 \nU.S. 350, 360]\n\u00a0\n not only procured through the mediation of a company-dominated labor organization, but they were the means adopted to 'eliminate the Union as the collective bargaining agency of its employees'. We think it plain also that by their terms they imposed illegal restraints upon the employees' rights to organize and bargain collectively guaranteed by  7 and 8 of the Act.\n By the contract each employee agreed not 'to demand a closed shop or a signed agreement by his employer with any Union'. This provision foreclosed the employee from bargaining for a closed shop or a signed agreement with the employer, frequent subjects of negotiation between employers and employees, see Consolidated Edison Company v. National Labor Relations Board, supra, 305 U.S. page 236, 59 S.Ct. page 219, et seq.; National Labor Relations Board v. Sands Mfg. Co., \n306 \nU.S. 332, 342\n, 59 S.Ct. 508, 513; cf. Virginian Railway Co. v. System Federation No. 40, \n300 \nU.S. 515, 553\n, 555 S., note 7, 57 S.Ct. 592, 602, 603. In addition the restriction upon the employee's right to ask a signed agreement extending only to agreements with 'any union' is in plain conflict with the public policy of the Act to encourage the procedure of collective bargaining, see  1, since it discriminates against labor organizations by forbidding signed contracts with labor unions while it permits them with the individual workers. See Consolidated Edison Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, supra, 305 U.S. page 236, 59 S.Ct. page 219.\n It likewise forestalls collective bargaining with respect to discharged employees, first providing that a discharged employee may submit to the employer facts indicating that his discharge was unreasonable and then stipulating that the 'question as to the propriety of an employee's discharge is in no event to be one for arbitration or mediation.' The effect of this clause was to discourage, if not forbid any presentation of the discharged employee's grievances to appellant through a labor organization or his chosen representatives, or in any way except personally. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 350, 361]\n\u00a0\n Since the contracts were the fruits of unfair labor practices, stipulated for the renunciation by the employees of rights guaranteed by the Act, and were a continuing means of thwarting the policy of the Act, they were appropriate subjects for the affirmative remedial action of the Board authorized by  10 of the Act. National Labor Relations Board v. Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines, Inc., supra, 303 U.S. page 265, 58 S.Ct. page 573, 115 A.L.R. 307; National Labor Relations Board v. Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., \n308 \nU.S. 241\n, 60 S.Ct. 203, this term, decided December 4, 1939. Hence the Board was free by its order to direct that the appellant should take no benefit from the contracts unless it was without authority to act because the individual signers of the contracts had not been made parties to the proceeding. It is urged that in the absence of the employees who signed the contract, the Board was powerless to declare it void and of no effect as to those employees, and that consequently it could make no order forbidding petitioner to make use of the contracts as the means of defeating the policy and purposes of the Act.\n Consolidated Edison Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, supra, is not decisive of this question. There, page 236 of 305 U.S., page 220 of 59 S.Ct., after pointing out that the Board's 'power to command affirmative action is remedial, not punitive, and is to be exercised in aid of the Board's authority to restrain violations and as a means of removing or avoiding the consequences of violation where those consequences are of a kind to thwart the purposes of the Act', decision was rested specifically on the ground that 'here, there is no basis for a finding that the contracts with the Brotherhood and its locals were a consequence of the unfair labor practices found by the Board or that these contracts in themselves thwart any policy of the Act or that their cancellation would in any way make the order to cease the specified practices any more effective.' \n\n[309 \nU.S. 350, 362]\n\u00a0\n It is elementary that it is not within the power of any tribunal to make a binding adjudication of the rights in personam of parties not brought before it by due process of law. Pennoyer v. Neff, \n95 \nU.S. 714\n; Riverside & Dan River Cotton Mills v. Menefee, \n237 \nU.S. 189\n, 35 S.Ct. 579; cf. Arizona v. California, \n298 \nU.S. 558, 571\n, 572 S., 56 S.Ct. 848, 854, 855. For that reason there is no occasion to consider now how far the contract rights, if any, of the employees may be passed upon by the Board and their exercise restricted by its order in proceedings to which the employees have been made parties. As the Board's power can be effectively exercised only upon petitioner, the employees are entitled to notice and hearing only if the statute requires them to be made parties to the proceeding. Consequently the only question we are called on to decide is whether, in the circumstances of this case, the exercise of the Board's authority is such a departure from accepted modes of procedure as rightly to be regarded as beyond the power conferred on the Board by  10 of the Act.\n The proceeding authorized to be taken by the Board under the National Labor Relations Act is not for the adjudication of private rights. Amalgamated Utility Workers, etc., v. Consolidated Edison Co. et al., \n309 \nU.S. 261\n, 60 S.Ct. 561, 84 L.Ed. --, H.Rept. No. 1147, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. Committee on Labor, p. 24; cf. Federal Trade Commission v. Klesner, \n280 \nU.S. 19\n, 50 S.Ct. 1, 68 A.L.R. 838. It has few of the indicia of a private litigation and makes no requirement for the presence in it of any private party other than the employer charged with an unfair labor practice. The Board acts in a public capacity to give effect to the declared public policy of the Act to eliminate and prevent obstructions to interstate commerce by encouraging collective bargaining and by protecting the 'exercise by workers of full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of their own choosing, for the purpose of negotiating the terms and conditions of their employment ....'  1. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 350, 363]\n\u00a0\n The immediate object of the proceeding is to prevent unfair labor practices which, as defined by  7, 8, are practices tending to thwart the declared policy of the Act. To that end the Board is authorized to order the employer to desist from such practices, and by  10(c) it is given authority to take such affirmative remedial action as will effectuate the policies of the Act. National Labor Relations Board v. Pennsylvania Greyhound, supra.\n In a proceeding so narrowly restricted to the protection and enforcement of public rights, there is little scope or need for the traditional rules governing the joinder of parties in litigation determining private rights. Ordinarily where the rights involved in litigation arise upon a contract, courts refuse to adjudicate the rights of some of the parties to the contract if the others are not before it. Shields v. Barrow, 17 How. 130, 140; Carroll v. New York Life Ins. Co., 8 Cir., 94 F.2d 333; cf. Waterman v. Canal-Louisiana Bank Co., \n215 \nU.S. 33, 48\n, 30 S.Ct. 10, 14. Such a judgment or decree would be futile if rendered, since the contract rights asserted by those present in the litigation could neither be defined, aided nor enforced by a decree which did not bind those not present.\n But different considerations may apply even in private litigation where the rights asserted arise independently of any contract which an adverse party may have made with another, not a party to the suit, even though their assertion may affect the ability of the former to fulfill his contract. The rights asserted in the suit and those arising upon the contract are distinct and separate so that the Court may, in a proper case, proceed to judgment without joining other parties to the contract, shaping its decree in such manner as to preserve the rights of those not before it. General Investment Co. v. Lake Shore Ry., \n260 \nU.S. 261, 285\n, 286 S., 43 S.Ct. 106, 116; American Brake Shoe & Foundry Co. v. Interborough Rapid Transit Co., D.C., 10 F.Supp. 512, \n\n[309 \nU.S. 350, 364]\n\u00a0\n 515, affirmed 2 Cir., 76 F.2d 1002; Fidelity & Deposit Co. of Maryland v. Montana, 9 Cir., 92 F.2d 693, 698; Brogdex Co. v. Food Machinery Co., 3 Cir., 92 F.2d 787, 789; Commercial Casualty Insurance Co. v. Lawhead, 4 Cir., 62 F.2d 928, 931, 932; cf. Hamilton v.

Husting Co. v. Coca-Cola Co., 194 Wis. 311, 216 N.W. 833; Nokol Co. v. Becker, 318 Mo. 292, 300 S.W. 1108\n\n\n Here the right asserted by the Board is not one arising upon or derived from the contracts between petitioner and its employees. The Board asserts a public right vested in it as a public body, charged in the public interest with the duty of preventing unfair labor practices. The public right and the duty extend not only to the prevention of unfair labor practices by the employer in the future, but to the prevention of his enjoyment of any advantage which he has gained by violation of the Act, whether it be a company union or an unlawful contract with employees, as the means of defeating the statutory policy and purpose. Obviously employers cannot set at naught the National Labor Relations Act by inducing their workmen to agree not to demand performance of the duties which it imposes or by insisting more than in a private litigation, that the employer's obedience to the Act, cannot be compelled in the absence of the workers who have thus renounced their rights.\n The Board's order runs only against petitioner. It directs that it shall cease recognizing the Committee as the representative of any of the employees for the purpose of dealing with petitioner concerning grievances, labor disputes, wages, rates of pay, hours of employment or conditions of work; that it shall not 'give effect' to the contracts with its employees; that it notify each \n\n[309 \nU.S. 350, 365]\n\u00a0\n employee that the contract violates the Act and that petitioner 'is therefore obliged to discontinue such contract as a term or condition of employment, and the employees are released from its obligations and the respondent (petitioner here) will no longer demand its performance', and that it 'will no longer offer, solicit, enter into, continue, enforce or attempt to enforce such contracts with its employees.'\n The effect of the Board's order, as we construe it, is to preclude the petitioner from taking any benefit of the contracts which were procured through violation of the Act and which are themselves continuing means of violating it, and from carrying out any of the contract provisions, the effect of which would be to infringe the rights guaranteed by the National Labor Relations Act. It does not foreclose the employees from taking any action to secure an adjudication upon the contracts, nor prejudge their rights in the event of such adjudication. We do not now consider their nature and extent. It is sufficient to say here that it will not be open to any tribunal to compel the employer to perform the acts, which, even though he has bound himself by contract to do them, would violate the Board's order or be inconsistent with any part of it. Section 10(a) and (c) of the Act commits to the Board the exclusive power to decide whether unfair labor practices have been committed and to determine the action the employer must take to remove or avoid the consequences of his unfair labor practice.\n In these respects the order does not go beyond those in suits brought by the United States to restrain violations of the Sherman Act, where the injunction was broad enough to prevent the offender from carrying out contracts with persons not parties to the suits. United Shoe Machinery Co. v. United States, \n258 \nU.S. 451, 456\n, 42 S.Ct. 363, 364; Paramount Famous Corp. v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 30\n, 51 S.Ct. 42; \n\n[309 \nU.S. 350, 366]\n\u00a0\n Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. United States, \n306 \nU.S. 208, 220\n, 59 S.Ct. 467, 471. Similarly, in proceedings before the Federal Trade Commission, the order restraining unfair methods of competition may preclude the performance of outstanding contracts by the offender. Such orders have never been challenged because the holders of the contracts were not made parties. E.g. Butterick Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 2 Cir., 4 F.2d 910; Q.R.S. Music Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 7 Cir., 12 F.2d 730; J. W. Kobi Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 2 Cir., 23 F.2d 41. Cf. Federal Trade Commission v. Beech Nut Co., \n257 \nU.S. 441\n, 42 S.Ct. 150, 19 A.L.R. 882. In Virginian Railway Co. v. System Federation No. 40, supra, 300 U.S. pages 539, 540, 57 S.Ct. 595; System Federation No. 40 v. Virginian R. Co., D.C., 11 F.Supp. 621, 623, the effect of the decree was to order the employer to deal exclusively with the Federation, although the employer had a contract with an association not a party to the suit, found to be a dominated labor organization. In every case the third persons were left free to assert such legal rights as they might have acquired under their contracts. But in all, the public right was vindicated by restraining the unlawful actions of the defendant even though the restraint prevented his performance of the contracts.\n As the National Labor Relations Act contemplates no more than the protection of the public rights which it creates and defines, and as the Board's order is directed solely to the employer and is ineffective to determine any private rights of the employees and leaves them free to assert such legal rights as they may have acquired under their contracts, in any appropriate tribunal, we think they are not indispensable parties for purposes of the Board's order and the statute does not require their presence as parties to the present proceeding and there was no abuse of the Board's discretion in its failure to make them parties. \n3\n It is unnecessary to consider now to what ex- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 350, 367]\n\u00a0\n tent or by what procedure it would be necessary to make the employees parties to a proceeding pending before the Board in the event that it undertook to make an order directed to the employees foreclosing any asserted rights under their contracts in order to effectuate the policies of the Act. Compare the procedure used in New England Divisions Case, \n261 \nU.S. 184, 197\n, 43 S.Ct. 270, 275.\n The Board's order to post notices requires the notice to announce that the contracts with the employees are 'void and of no effect'. In order that the notice may more accurately represent the affirmative action of the Board and that misinterpretation of its action may be avoided, the order appealed from should be so modified as to omit the quoted words and direct that clause (3) of the Board's order, numbered 2(d) specifying the contents of the notice, read as follows:\n\n\n (3)\n That the individual contracts of employment entered into between the respondent and some of its employees were made by the respondent in violation of the National Labor Relations Act; and that the respondent will no longer offer, solicit, enter into, continue, enforce, or attempt to enforce such contracts with its employees; but this is without prejudice to the assertion by the employees of any legal rights they may have acquired under such contracts.\n\n 3. \nThe amended charge, which initiated the present proceeding pursuant to  10(b) of the Act, was lodged \n\n[309 \nU.S. 350, 368]\n\u00a0\n with the Board by the Union on August 2, 1937, before petitioner had succeeded in organizing the Committee and in securing the signatures of its employees to the contracts, but after petitioner's unsuccessful attempt in July to deal with its employees independently of the Union. The charge, in addition to other unfair labor practices not now material, alleged that petitioner had 'coerced and attempted to coerce its employees into signing individual contracts with the said company; in that the said company has called meetings of its employees and has compelled said employees to attend said meetings, and has attempted to compel said employees to form committees, not of their own choosing, to bargain collectively with the said company; ...'\n The complaint elaborated the charge with particularity, setting forth that petitioner had formed and initiated a labor organization of its employees, dominated and interfered with the administration of that organization and had continued to do so down to the date of the complaint, October 2, 1937; that petitioner 'has made signing of individual contracts a condition of employment'; and that by these and other acts petitioner 'is interfering with, restraining, and coercing its employees in exercise of the rights guaranteed by  7 of the Act'.\n Petitioner contends that the charge is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the complaint and subsequent proceedings, and that they are restricted to the specific unfair labor practices alleged in the charge. See National Labor Relations Board v. Hopwood Retinning Co., 2 Cir., 98 F.2d 97. It argues that in the proceedings before the Board there was a fatal departure from the charge insofar as the Board's finding and order are concerned with the subsequent organization of the Committee and the signing of the employees' contracts. The argument is addressed only to want of power in the Board and raises no question of unfairness to petitioner in the preparation and prosecution of his case. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 350, 369]\n\u00a0\n It is unnecessary for us to consider now how far the statutory requirement of a charge as a condition precedent to a complaint excludes from the subsequent proceedings matters existing when the charge was filed, but not included in it. Whatever restrictions the requirements of a charge may be though to place upon subsequent proceedings by the Board, we can find no warrant in the language or purposes of the Act for saying that it precludes the Board from dealing adequately with unfair labor practices which are related to those alleged in the charge and which grow out of them while the proceeding is pending before the Board. The violations alleged in the complaint and found by the Board were but a prolongation of the attempt to form the company union and to secure the contracts alleged in the charge. All are of the same class of violations as those set up in the charge and were continuations of them in pursuance of the same objects. The Board's jurisdiction having been invoked to deal with the first steps, it had authority to deal with those which followed as a consequence of those already taken. We think the Court below correctly held that 'the Board was within its powers in treating the whole sequence as one.' (104 F. 2d 658.)\n We find it unnecessary to discuss other points raised by the petitioner. We have considered them and find them without merit.\n The order below will be modified as directed by this opinion and as so modified it will be affirmed. So ordered.\n Order modified and affirmed.\n Mr. Justice MURPHY took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS.\n Mr. Justice BLACK and I see no reason or occasion for the modification of the order. For as stated in the \n\n[309 \nU.S. 350, 370]\n\u00a0\n opinion of the Court, the Board has not undertaken to pass on the rights of the employees under those contracts. Nor has any employee urged, here or below, that the order affects his contractual rights or casts a cloud on them. Whether the employees would be indispensable parties to the proceeding should the Board in order to effectuate the policies of the Act undertake to nullify their rights is a question on which we want to reserve decision until the Board passes on it and until it is put in issue by persons who have a standing to raise it. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] An officer of petitioner admitted that he had consulted with the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce in forming the contracts.

COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE(1940)\n\nArgued: Decided: November 12, 1940\n\n\n\n\n[311 \nU.S. 83, 84]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wilbur H. Friedman and Joseph M. Proskauer, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n Messrs. Robert H. Jackson, Atty. Gen., and J. Louis Monarch, Sp. Asst. to Atty. Gen., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner, a resident of New York, was a member of the New York Stock Exchange. He was engaged in the business of trading in securities on the floor of the Exchange for the partnership of Hilson & Neuberger, of which he was a member, executing orders on behalf of customers of the partnership. In addition he made numerous purchases and sales of securities for his own account.\n During the year 1932, the one here in question, Hilson & Neuberger derived a profit of $142,802.29 from the sale of securities which were not capital assets as defined in Section 101 of the Revenue Act of 1932, 47 Stat. 169, 191, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 504. The firm had other income of $170,830.65 and deductions of $203,981.78, or net income of $109, 651.16. Petitioner's distributive share was $44,158.55. During the same year petitioner sustained a net loss of $25,588.93 on his private transactions in stocks and bonds which were not capital assets as defined in Section 101.\n In his income tax return for the year 1932 petitioner deducted from gross income the loss of $25,588.93. The Commissioner disallowed the deduction and assessed a deficiency. The Board of Tax Appeals upheld the action of the Commissioner. 37 B.T.A. 223. On appeal the \n\n[311 \nU.S. 83, 85]\n\u00a0\n Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 104 F.2d 649. Because of substantial conflict with Jennings v. Commissioner, 5 Cir., 110 F.2d 945, and Craik v. United States, Ct.Cl., 31 F.Supp. 132, we granted certiorari limited to the questions whether Section 23(r)(1) of the Revenue Act of 1932, 47 Stat. 169, 183, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 493, authorized the claimed deduction and whether, in the event that it did not, the statute as so construed was constitutional. \n310 \nU.S. 655\n, 60 S.Ct. 1085\n\n\n Section 23 of the Revenue Act of 1932 sets out the allowable deductions from gross income. Section 23(r)(1) provides: 'Losses from sales or exchanges of stocks and bonds (as defined in subsection (t) of this section) which are not capital assets (as defined in section 101) shall be allowed (as deductions from gross income) only to the extent of the gains from such sales or exchanges ....'\n The basic and narrow queston is whether, in computing the income of an individual partner, the word 'gains' in Section 23(r)(1) includes gains from sales or exchanges of partnership stocks and bonds which are not capital assets as defined in Section 101. We are of opinion that it does.\n In computing gross income prior to the Revenue Act of 1932, subject to certain limitations a taxpayer was entitled to deduct the full amount of his losses from transactions in securities. Revenue Act of 1928,  23( e), 23(g), 101(b), 113, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, pages 357, 371, 380. But the growing custom of diminishing ordinary income by deducting losses realized on the sale of securities which had shrunk in value, due no doubt to the fall in prices after 1929, led Congress to provide in Section 23(r)( 1) that deductions for such losses should be limited to gains from similar transactions.\n That this was the purpose and the only purpose of Section 23(r)(1) abundantly appears from the Report of the Senate Finance Committee accompanying the bill. 1 Nowhere \n\n[311 \nU.S. 83, 86]\n\u00a0\n does there appear any intention to deny to a taxpayer who chooses to execute part of his security transactions in partnership with another the right to deductions which plainly would be available to him if he had executed all of them singly. Nowhere is there any suggestion that Congress intended to tax noncapital security gains until they exceeded similar losses. The language of Section 23(r)(1) does not require such a construction. Nor do the available evidences of Congressional intent indicate such a purpose.\n Respondent points out, however, that under Sections 181-189 of the Revenue Act of 1932, 47 Stat. 169, 222, 223, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, pages 544-546, 2 part- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 83, 87]\n\u00a0\n nership income is computed on an entity basis, that items of partnership gross income do not appear on a partner's return, that only partnership net income is reflected in the individual partner's income and is reported only in the form of a distributable or distributed share. He contends that since partnership income is computed in the same way as an individual's the deduction afforded by Section 23(r)(1) to the partnership is a distinct privilege not to be confused or combined with that afforded to the individual. Thus, he argues, the deduction claimed here is inconsistent with the general scheme created for reporting partnership income as well as, in effect, a second or double use of Section 23(r)(1). \n\n[311 \nU.S. 83, 88]\n\u00a0\n It is not to be doubted that in the enactment of Section 23(r)(1) Congress intended not only to deal with individual security gains and losses, but also to permit losses suffered in partnership security transactions to be applied against partnership gains in like transactions. It does not follow, however, and the language of the statute does not provide, either expressly or by necessary implication, that losses sustained in an individual capacity may not be set off against gains from identical though distinct partnership dealings. If the individual losses are actually incurred in similar transactions it cannot justly be said that the same deduction is taken a second time, or that the real purpose of the statute, which is ultimately to tax the net income of the individual partner, would thereby be impaired.\n Sections 181-189 of the Revenue Act of 1932, 47 Stat. 169, 222-223, provide generally for computation and reporting of partnership income. In requiring a partnership informational return although only individual partners pay any tax, Congress recognized the partnership both as a business unit and as an association of individuals. This weakens rather than strengthens respondent's argument that the privileges are distinct or that the unit characteristics of the partnership must be emphasized. Compare Jennings v. Commissioner, 5 Cir., 110 F.2d 945; Craik v. United States, Ct.Cl., 31 F.Supp. 132; United States v. Coulby, D.C., 251 F. 982, affirmed, 6 Cir., 258 F. 27. Nor is the deduction claimed here precluded because Congress, in Sections 184-188, has particularized instances where partnership income retains its identity in the individual partner's return. The maxim 'expressio unius est exclusio alterius' is an aid to construction not a rule of law. It can never override clear and contrary evidences of Congressional intent. United States v. Barnes, 222 U.S 513, 32 S.Ct. 117.\n It is true that the Treasury Department adopted a contrary position and denied the claimed deduction. G. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 83, 89]\n\u00a0\n C.M. 14012, XIV-1 Cum.Bull. 145; I.T. 2892, XIV-1 Cum.Bull. 148. Under different circumstances great weight has been attached to administrative practice and treasury rulings, but beyond question they cannot narrow the scope of a statute when Congress plainly has intended otherwise. Rasquin v. Humphreys, \n308 \nU.S. 54\n, 60 S.Ct. 60; Norwegian Nitrogen Products Co. v. United States, \n288 \nU.S. 294\n, 53 S.Ct. 350.\n It is true, too, that in some cases the characteristics of partnerships as business units have been emphasized, Forres v. Commissioner, 25 B.T.A. 154; Wilson v. Commissioner, 17 B.T.A. 976, appeal dismissed, 10 Cir., 55 F.2d 1086; Burns v. Commissioner, 12 B.T.A. 1209; Appeal of Menken, 8 B.T.A. 1062, while in others the characteristics of partnerships as associations of individuals have been stressed. United States v. Coulby, supra. Compare Bence v. United States, Ct.Cl., 18 F.Supp. 848. These cases, not decided under the Revenue Act of 1932 and turning, as they must, on their own peculiar facts are little aid in ascertaining the effect to be given to Section 23(r)(1).\n It is not true, however, as respondent argues, that the asserted deduction cannot be allowed because petitioner has suggested no way to calculate it properly or to import items of gross income from the partnership informational return. The Board of Tax Appeals expressly found the amount of partnership gains from security transactions and the proportion in which petitioner was to share in the profits of the partnership. 37 B.T.A. 223, 224. Since petitioner's share of these noncapital security gains is greater than his loss of $25,588.93, the limit on deductions set by Section 23(r)(1) is not exceeded.\n Our conclusion that this is the proper construction of Section 23(r)( 1) is confirmed by the action of Congress since 1932. In 1933 Congress amended Section 182(a) of the Revenue Act of 1932 to deny to individual partners deductions for partnership losses which had been disallowed in the \n\n[311 \nU.S. 83, 90]\n\u00a0\n partnership return, the converse of the instant case. 48 Stat. 195, 209, 26 U.S.C.A. Int. Rev. Acts, page 544.3 More significantly, in 1938, after the Treasury Department had ruled to the contrary, G.C.M. 14012, XIV-1 Cum. Bull. 145; I.T. 2892, XIV-1 Cum.Bull. 148, Congress expressly provided for the deduction of individual security losses from similar partnership gains. Revenue Act of 1938,  182, 183, 52 Stat. 447, 521, 26 U.S.C.A. Int. Rev. Code,  182, 183. 4 That the amendment of 1933 changed and the Revenue Act of 1938 restored the law of 1932 as we have explained it is plain from the legislative history of the two Acts and of  23(r)(1).\n Shearer v. Burnet, \n285 \nU.S. 228\n, 52 S.Ct. 332, is not contrary to the conclusion we reach here. There the decision turned on the proper construction to be given to Section 218(a) of the Revenue Act of 1924, 43 Stat. 253, 275, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 28, and the court correctly concluded that Congress had not intended to allow the asserted credit.\n We conclude that petitioner is entitled to the deduction. The decision of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded with directions \n\n[311 \nU.S. 83, 91]\n\u00a0\n to remand to the Board of Tax Appeals for proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS, Mr. Justice BLACK, and Mr. Justice DOUGLAS are of opinion that the judgment should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Report of Senate Finance Committee, 72d Congress, 1st Sess., Number 705, p. 10: 'Your committee believes that security gains and losses should be segregated, that security losses should be deducted solely from security gains; but that security gains should not be taxed until they actually exceed security losses.'\n See, also, Report of House Ways and Means Committee, 72d Congress, 1st Sess., Number 708, pp. 12, 13: 'There are no provisions in existing law corresponding to section 23(r). ...

It should be noted that this method involves a departure from the principle adopted in the Revenue Acts of 1934 and 1936. ...' \n\n\n\n\n","92":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOKLAHOMA PACKING CO. v. OKLAHOMA GAS & ELEC. CO.(1940)\nNo. 19\nArgued: Decided: January 15, 1940\n\n\n\n Rehearing Denied Jan. 29, 1940\n\n\n See \n309 \nU.S. 693\n, 60 S.Ct. 465, 84 L.Ed. --.\n Messrs. Paul Ware and W. R. Brown, both of Chicago, Ill., for petitioners. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 4, 5]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. I. J. Underwood, of Tulsa, Okl., and Streeter B. Flynn, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The case concerns a rate controversy which has been winding its slow way through state and federal courts for thirteen years. \n1\n While the relationship of two utilities with Wilson & Co., a consumer of natural gas, complicates the situation, the legal issues before us may be disposed of as though this were a typical case of a utility resisting an order reducing its rates. \n2\n Oklahoma Gas & Electric Company (hereafter called Gas & Electric) appealed to \n\n[309 \nU.S. 4, 6]\n\u00a0\n the Oklahoma Supreme Court from such an order by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission. The reduction was stayed pending the appeal, but to protect Wilson & Co. against a potential overcharge, Gas & Electric gave a supersedeas bond. Gas & Electric lost its appeal, Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. v. Wilson & Co., 146 Okl. 272, 288 P. 316, and Wilson & Co. brought suit on the bond. That suit was instituted on December 3, 1931, in one of the district courts of Oklahoma. To enjoin prosecution of the latter suit Gas & Electric on May 20, 1932, invoked the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma. \n3\n After a complicated series of moves in both state and federal courts, not necessary here to detail, this relief was granted by the District Court on September 10, 1937, and on December 19, 1938, sustained by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Oklahoma Packing Co. v. Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co., 10 Cir., 100 F.2d 770. Since the case in part was in conflict with the Second Circuit's decision in Neirbo Co. v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., 103 F.2d 765, and also presented novel aspects of important questions of federal law, we granted certiorari, \n306 \nU.S. 629\n, 59 S.Ct. 789. We are not concerned with the merits of the Commission's order.\n At the threshold we are met by the procedural objection, seasonably made, that Wilson & Co., a Delaware corporation, was improperly sued in the District Court of the Western District of Oklahoma. The objection is \n\n[309 \nU.S. 4, 7]\n\u00a0\n unavailable. Prior to this suit, Wilson & Co. had, agreeable to the laws of Oklahoma, designated an agent for service of process 'in any action in the State of Oklahoma.' Both courts below found this to be in fact a consent on Wilson & Co.'s part to be sued in the courts of Oklahoma upon causes of action arising in that state. The Federal District Court is, we hold, a court of Oklahoma within the scope of that consent, and for the reasons indicated in Neirbo Co. et al. v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., \n308 \nU.S. 165\n, 60 S.Ct. 153, decided November 22, 1939, Wilson & Co. was amenable to suit in the Western District of Oklahoma.\n Petitioners further urge (1) that their plea of res judicata should have been sustained, and (2) that  265 of the Judicial Act, Act of March 3, 1911, 36 Stat. 1162, 28 U.S.C.  379, 28 U.S.C.A.  379, derived from  5 of the Act of March 2, 1793, 1 Stat. 333, 335, was a bar to the suit.\n The claim of res judicata is based on the prior determination in 1930 by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma that the contested order of the Corporation Commission was valid. Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. v. Wilson & Co., 146 Okl. 272, 288 P. 316. The pronouncements of the Oklahoma Supreme Court concerning the character of such a determination-whether under the Oklahoma Constitution it was a 'legislative' or 'judicial' review-have for a time, however, been ambiguous and fluctuating. After the present bill was filed but before the challenged injunction was decreed, the Oklahoma Supreme Court had held that its decision in cases like that of Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. v. Wilson & Co., was a judicial judgment. Oklahoma Cotton Ginners' Association v. State, 174 Okl. 243, 51 P.2d 327. But, in Community Natural Gas Co. v. Corporation Commission, 182 Okl. 137, 76 P.2d 393, decided after the decree here in issue, the Oklahoma court formally characterized its review in cases prior to the decision in the Ginners' case as 'legislative', re- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 4, 8]\n\u00a0\n fused to give that decision retroactive effect, and therefore deemed the res judicata doctrine inapplicable to these prior reviews. Hence, the plea of res judicata in this case must fail, for on that issue state law is determinative here. Union & Planters' Bank v. Memphis, \n189 \nU.S. 71\n, 23 S. Ct. 604; City of Covington v. First National Bank, \n198 \nU.S. 100\n, 25 S.Ct. 562; Wright v. Georgia R.R. & Banking Co., \n216 \nU.S. 420\n, 30 S.Ct. 242.\n There remains, therefore, the applicability of  265 of the Judicial Code. 4 That provision would operate as a bar upon the power of the District Court to enjoin proceedings previously brought in the state court on the supersedeas bond, if 'the only thing sought to be accomplished by this equitable action' is to stay the continuance of that action. Such was the construction placed upon the bill by the earlier District Court of three judges, and such was this Court's assumption when the latter decision came here on appeal. Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. v. Oklahoma Packing Co., D.C., 6 F.Supp. 893, 865; Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. v. Oklahoma Packing Co., \n292 \nU.S. 386, 389\n, 54 S.Ct. 732. That case eliminated the Corporation Commission as party to the litigation. The District Court to which this Court remanded the matter summarized Gas & Electric's claim by way of answer to the action brought by Wilson & Co. in the state court as an attack upon the Commission's order 'for substantially the same reasons as set out' in the present bill.\n The present suit, therefore, is one for an injunction 'to stay proceedings' previously begun in a state court. The decree below is thus within the plain interdiction of an Act of Congress, and not taken out of it by any of the exceptions which this Court has heretofore engrafted upon a limitation of the power of the federal courts dat- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 4, 9]\n\u00a0\n ing almost from the beginning of our history and expressing an important Congressional policy-to prevent needless friction between state and federal courts. Compare Madisonville Traction Co. v. St. Bernard Mining Co ., \n196 \nU.S. 239\n, 25 S.Ct. 251; Simon v. Southern Railway, \n236 \nU.S. 115\n, 35 S.Ct. 255; Wells Fargo & Co. v. Taylor, \n254 \nU.S. 175\n, 41 S.Ct. 93. See Warren, 'Federal and State Court Interference', 43 Harv.L.Rev. 345, 372-77. That the injunction was a restraint of the parties and was not formally directed against the state court itself is immaterial. Hill v. Martin, \n296 \nU.S. 393, 403\n, 56 S.Ct. 278. Cf. Kohn v. Central Distributing Co., \n306 \nU.S. 531\n, 59 S.Ct. 689. Steelman v. All Continent Corp., \n301 \nU.S. 278\n, 57 S.Ct. 705, pressed upon us by respondents and relied upon below, is plainly inapplicable.\n Neither record nor findings below give any other basis for injunctive relief save the threatened injury implied in the state court lawsuit; and that could not be enjoined. The decree below is reversed, with directions to dismiss the bill.\nREVERSED.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice ROBERTS adhere to the views expressed in their separate opinion in this case. See 60 S.Ct. 219.\n The decision of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma in Community Natural Gas Co. v. Corporation Commission, 182 Okl. 137, 76 P.2d 393, having been brought to the attention of this Court for the first time in the petition of respondents for a rehearing of the disposition of this cause in the opinion delivered on December 4, 1939, that opinion is hereby withdrawn and replaced by the opinion of this day.\n The petition for rehearing is denied.\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES.\n I concur in the reversal of the judgment upon the ground that Wilson & Co., a Delaware corporation, was not amenable to suit in the Federal District Court in Oklahoma. The question is essentially the same as that presented in No. 38, Neirbo v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, \n308 \nU.S. 165\n, 60 S.Ct. 153, decided November 22, 1939, and what was said in the dissenting opinion in that case need not be repeated here. See, as to the scope of the consent under the Oklahoma statute, the \n\n[309 \nU.S. 4, 10]\n\u00a0\n observations of the Circuit Court of Appeals in the Neirbo case, 2 Cir., 103 F.2d 765, 769.\n But if it be granted that the Delaware corporation was amenable to the process in question, I am unable to agree that the complainants should be denied relief because of the defense of res judicata. The judgment to which this effect is given was rendered by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma in 1930, sustaining, on appeal, an order of the Corporation Commission requiring gas to be furnished to Wilson & Co. at a specified rate. Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. v. Wilson & Co., 146 Okl. 272, 288 P. 316. At the time of that decision, the review by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma of such an order of the Corporation Commission was considered to be legislative in character. Oklahoma Gas Co. v. Russell, \n261 \nU.S. 290, 291\n, 43 S.Ct. 353; McAlester Gas & Coke Co. v. Corporation Commission, 101 Okl. 268, 270, 224 P. 698; City of Poteau v. American Indian Oil & Gas Co., 159 Okl. 240, 242, 243, 18 P.2d 523, in which the state court cited with approval the decision to that effect of the Circuit Court of Appeals in Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. v. Wilson & Co., 10 Cir., 54 F.2d 596, 598, 599, applying the Oklahoma decisions. Compare Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. v. Oklahoma Packing Co., \n292 \nU.S. 386, 388\n, 54 S.Ct. 732, 733; Corporation Commission v. Cary, \n296 \nU.S. 452, 458\n, 56 S.Ct. 300, 301. The contention of the complainants before the state court was that the Commission's order violated their rights under the Federal Constitution. 146 Okl. 272, 281, 288, 288 P. 316. But in the view, as then held, that the action of the state court was legislative in character, no appeal lay to this Court from the state court's determination of the federal question. Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., \n211 \nU.S. 210, 226\n, 227 S., 29 S.Ct. 67, 69; Oklahoma Gas Co. v. Russell, supra. Accordingly, the complainants brought this suit in the Federal Court to enjoin the enforcement of the Commission's order. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 4, 11]\n\u00a0\n It was not until several years later (in 1935) that the Oklahoma Supreme Court decided, in a suit between other parties, that its action in reviewing such an order of the Commission was judicial and not legislative in character. Oklahoma Cotton Ginners' Association v. State, 174 Okl. 243, 51 P.2d 327. The manifest injustice of holding that complainants are bound by the state court's ruling in 1930 as a judicial determination, when at that time under the state court's construction of the state constitution the complainants were not at liberty to treat the ruling as a judicial determination and to obtain a review of the federal question by this Court upon that ground, is not met, as it seems to me, by invoking the general doctrine of res judicata.\n Whether the judgment of a state court is res judicata is a question of state law. The federal courts are not bound to give such domestic judgments any greater force than that awarded them by the courts of the State where rendered. Union & Planters Bank v. Memphis, \n189 \nU.S. 71, 75\n, 23 S.Ct. 604, 606; Covington v. First National Bank, \n198 \nU.S. 100, 109\n, 25 S.Ct. 562, 564; Wright v. Georgia R. & Banking Co., \n216 \nU.S. 420, 429\n, 30 S.Ct. 242, 245. I think that we are not at liberty to assume that the Oklahoma court would so far depart from the plain requirements of justice as to preclude in these circumstances a review of the federal question in a court of competent jurisdiction. The state court has not spoken to that effect and what the state court has said I think clearly imports the contrary.\n This appears from its decision in Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. v. Wilson & Co., 178 Okl. 604, 63 P.2d 703. That was an action in the state court on the supersedeas bond given on the appeal to the Supreme Court from the Commission's order in question, and Wilson & Co., the plaintiff, had judgment. The Supreme Court reversed that judgment and directed a stay pending the deter- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 4, 12]\n\u00a0\n mination in this very suit in the federal court of the validity of the Commission's order. The Supreme Court expressly referred to its decision, in 1935, in Oklahoma Cotton Ginners' Association v. State, supra, that its action in reviewing orders of the Commission affecting rates of public utilities constituted a judicial determination of the questions involved. But instead of holding that the ruling in 1930, upon the order now under review, constituted a final adjudication of the validity of that order, the Supreme Court held that the question of validity was an open one for determination by the federal court in the present suit. After saying that in view of the uncertainty with respect to the 'right to a judicial remedy in the state courts', the federal court had acquired jurisdiction of this suit, the state court concluded as follows:\n'That remedy was available to them as the only certain method of obtaining a judicial determination of the validity of the commission's order. The suit was a direct attack upon such order, and until its validity was established in that suit, the state court was without jurisdiction to proceed with an action based upon such order. This for the reason that where direct attack in equity is made upon the order of the commission the defendants' liability on such order is not finally determined judicially until final determination of the equitable action'.\n\n If under the state law as thus declared in Oklahoma upon consideration of the particular circumstances of this case, liability on the Commission's order is not finally determined judicially until the determination of that question in this equity suit, I am at a loss to understand how the action of the state court on the 1930 appeal can be regarded as res judicata and thus a bar to that determination.\n The decree below enjoining enforcement of the Commission's order appropriately followed the determination of its invalidity. The point that the decree should not \n\n[309 \nU.S. 4, 13]\n\u00a0\n have gone further and enjoined the prosecution of the action in the state court upon the supersedeas bond is at best only one of technical importance, as the state court itself enjoined such proceedings pending the determination of this suit, apparently in the view that a determination herein of the invalidity of the order would dispose of the merits.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice ROBERTS join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] A history of the controversy is to be found in Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. v. Wilson & Co., 146 Okl. 272, 288 P. 316; Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. v. Wilson & Co., 10 Cir., 54 F.2d 596; Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. v. Oklahoma Packing Co., D.C., 6 F.Supp. 893; Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. v. Oklahoma Packing Co., \n292 \nU.S. 386\n, 54 S.Ct. 732; Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. v. Wilson & Co., 178 Okl. 604, 63 P.2d 703; Oklahoma Packing Co. v. Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co., 10 Cir., 100 F. 2d 770. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Oklahoma Natural Gas Co. and Oklahoma Gas and Electric Co., both engaged in the sale of natural gas in and about Oklahoma City, had agreed to a division of territory. Under that agreement, Wilson & Co. bought gas from Gas & Electric. The Oklahoma Corporation Commission found that Natural Gas had held itself out to provide gas to industrial consumers at a lower rate than that at which Wilson & Co. was able to buy from Gas & Electric. The Commission then ordered Natural Gas to provide Wilson & Co. with its gas at prevailing industrial rates. Both Natural Gas and Gas & Electric resisted the order. Natural Gas contended that it had never held itself out to industrial consumers; Gas & Electric claimed that it was being unconstitutionally deprived of its right to sell to Wilson & Co. at the higher rate. If, pending appeal from the Commission, the order were not stayed, Wilson & Co. would have been able to purchase gas from Natural Gas at the lower rate and Gas & Electric would have been forced either to lower its rates to meet the competition or to lose the business. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] In 1928 Natural Gas complied with the order; and since that time Wilson & Co. has been buying gas at the lower rate prescribed by the Commission. The sole question now involved in these proceedings is the liability of Gas & Electric to Wilson & Co. for alleged overcharges between 1926 and 1928. The District Court found specifically that the Corporation Commission had made no threat to enforce penalties for violations of the 1926 order, and as to the Commission, declined to grant any injunctive relief. Cf. Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. v. Oklahoma Packing Co., \n292 \nU.S. 386, 390\n, 54 S.Ct. 732. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Section 265 provides: 'The writ of injunction shall not be granted by any court of the United States to stay proceedings in any court of a State, except in cases where such injunction may be authorized by any law relating to proceedings in bankruptcy.' \n\n\n\n\n","93":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOSBORN v. OZLIN(1940)\nNo. 592\nArgued: March 27, 1940Decided: April 22, 1940\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court for the Eastern District of virginia. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 53, 54]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John Lord O'Brian, of Buffalo, N.Y., and Andrew D. Christian, of Richmond, Va., for appellants.\n\n\n\n[310 \nU.S. 53, 57]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Abram P. Staples, of Richmond, Va., for appellees.\n\n\n\n[310 \nU.S. 53, 58]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellants have challenged the validity of a Virginia statute regulating the insurance of Virginia risks and have brought this suit to enjoin state officers from enforcing \n\n[310 \nU.S. 53, 59]\n\u00a0\n it. Its relevant provisions, copied in the margin,1 forbid contracts of insurance or surety by companies authorized to do business within that Commonwealth 'except through regularly constituted and registered resident agents or agencies of such companies.'  4222, c. 218, Acts of 1938. Such resident agents 'shall be entitled to and shall receive the usual and customary commissions allowed on such contracts,' and may not share more than half of this commission with a non-resident broker.  4226a, as amended by Acts 1938, c. 218. Disobedience of these provisions (from which life, title and marine companies are exempted) may entail a fine or revocation of the corporate license in Virginia, or both. A district court of three judges, convened under  266 of the Judicial Code as amended, 28 U.S.C.  380, 28 U.S.C.A.  380, dismissed appellants' bill on the basis of elaborate findings of fact and conclusions of law, set forth in an opinion by Circuit Judge Soper. 29 F.Supp. 71. From this \n\n[310 \nU.S. 53, 60]\n\u00a0\n decree the case comes here on appeal under  238 of the Judicial Code as amended, 28 U.S.C.  345, 28 U.S.C.A.  345.\n The bill was brought by foreign corporations authorized to do casualty and surety business in Virginia, and by some of their salaried employees. It is their claim that the statute deprives them of rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution. The exact nature of these claims will appear more clearly in the setting of the illuminating findings below which may here be abbreviated.\n The 'production' of insurance-'production' being insurance jargon for obtaining business-is, in the main, carried on by two groups, agents and brokers. Though both are paid by commission, the different ways in which the two groups perform their functions have important practical consequences in the conduct of the insurance business, and hence in its regulation. The agent is tied to \n\n[310 \nU.S. 53, 61]\n\u00a0\n his company. But his liability to 'produce' business depends upon the confidence of the community in him. He must therefore cultivate the good will and sense of dependence of his clients. He may finance the payment of premiums; he frequently assists in the filing and prosecution of claims; he acts as mediator between insurer and assured in the diverse situations which arise. The broker, on the other hand, is an independent middleman, not tied to a particular company. He meets more specially the needs of large customers, using their concentrated bargaining power to obtain the most favorable terms from competing companies. His activities, being largely confined to the big commercial centers, take place mostly outside Virginia.\n A policy, whether 'produced' by broker or agent, must be 'serviced'- an insurance term for assistance rendered a customer in minimizing his risks. To this end the companies exert themselves directly, but the 'producer' may render additional service. Only to a limited extent can risks be minimized at long range; local activity is essential. When the contract is 'produced' by a non-resident broker the 'servicing' function is normally performed by the company exclusively. When the 'producer' is a resident agent the case is ordinarily otherwise. For this, as well as for other reasons, it is obvious that non-resident brokers prefer to negotiate their contracts covering Virginia risks with companies authorized to do business in that Commonwealth.\n These basic elements in the insurance business attain special significance in the case of enterprises operating not only in Virginia but in other states as well. For them the brokerage system offers the attractions of large-scale production. Through what is known as a master or 'hotchpotch' policy, the assured may obtain a cheaper rate by pooling all his risks, whether in or out of Virginia. This wholesale insurance may furnish not only a reduced rate \n\n[310 \nU.S. 53, 62]\n\u00a0\n but a reduced commission to the customer. These are advantages which naturally draw the Virginia business of interstate enterprises away from local agents in Virginia to the great insurance centers.\n In effecting the cost of these master policies, say the appellants, Virginia is intruding upon business transactions beyond its borders. Not only is a licensed company forbidden to write insurance except through a resident agent, but the agent cannot retain less than one-half of the customary commission allowed on such a contract for what may, so far as the requirements of the law are concerned, be no more than the perfunctory service of countersigning the policy.\n But the question is not whether what Virginia has done will restrict appellants' freedom of action outside Virginia by subjecting the exercise of such freedom to financial burdens. The mere fact that state action may have repercussions beyond state lines is of no judicial significance so long as the action is not within that domain which the Constitution forbids. Alaska Packers Ass'n v. Industrial Accident Comm'n., \n294 \nU.S. 532\n, 55 S.Ct. 518; Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. Grosjean, \n301 \nU.S. 412\n, 57 S.Ct. 772, 112 A.L.R. 293. Compare Equitable Life Assur. Society v. Pennsylvania, \n238 \nU.S. 143\n, 35 S.Ct. 829. It is equally immaterial that such state action may run counter to the economic wisdom either of Adam Smith or of J. Maynard Keynes, or may be ultimately mischievous even from the point of view of avowed state policy. Our inquiry must be much narrower. It is whether Virginia has taken hold of a matter within her power, or has reached beyond her borders to regulate a subject which was none of her concern because the Constitution has placed control elsewhere. Compare Wallace v. Hines, \n253 \nU.S. 66, 69\n, 40 S.Ct. 435, 436.\n Virginia has not sought to prohibit the making of contracts beyond her borders. She merely claims that her interest in the risks which these contracts are designed to prevent warrants the kind of control she has here \n\n[310 \nU.S. 53, 63]\n\u00a0\n imposed. This legislation is not to be judged by abstracting an isolated contract written in New York from the organic whole of the insurance business, the effect of that business on Virginia, and Virginia's regulation of it.\n A network of legislation controls the surety and casualty business in Virginia. Insolvent companies may not engage in it. Virginia Code,  4180. Neither companies nor agents may give rebates.  4222(c). Rates for workmen's compensation, automobile liability and surety contracts are determined by its Corporation Commission.  1887(75), 4326a1, 4350(3). The difficulty of enforcing these regulations, so the District Court found, may be increased if policies covering Virginia risks are 'produced' without participation by responsible local agents. Rebates evading local restriction may be granted under cover of business done outside the state. Contrariwise, if resident Virginia agents are made necessary conduits for insurance on Virginia risks now included in master policies, the state may have better means of acquiring accurate information for the effectuation of measures which it deems protective of its interests. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[310 \nU.S. 53, 64]\n\u00a0\n It is claimed that the requirement that not less than one-half of the customary commission be retained by the resident agent is a bald exaction for what may be no more than the perfunctory service of countersigning policies. The short answer to this is that the state may rely on this exaction as a mode of assuring the active use of resident agents for procuring and 'servicing' policies covering Virginia risks. These functions, when adequately performed, benefit not only the company, the producer, and the assured. By minimizing the risks of casualty and loss, they redound in a pervasive way to the benefit of the community. \n3\n At least Virginia may so have believed. And she may also have concluded that an agency system, such as this legislation was designed to promote, is better calculated to further these desirable ends than other modes of 'production.' \n4\n When \n\n[310 \nU.S. 53, 65]\n\u00a0\n these beliefs are emphasized by legislation embodying similar notions of policy in a dozen states,5 it would savor of intolerance for us to suggest that a legislature could not constitutionally entertain the views which the legislation adopts. Compare Prudential Ins. Co. v. Cheek, \n259 \nU.S. 530, 537\n, 42 S.Ct. 516, 520, 27 A.L.R. 27.\n The present case, therefore, is wholly unlike those instances in which a 'so-called right is used as part of a scheme to accomplish a forbidden result.' Fidelity & Deposit Co. v. Tafoya, \n270 \nU.S. 426, 434\n, 46 S.Ct. 331, 332. For it is clear that Virginia has a definable interest in the contracts she seeks to regulate and that what she has done is very different from the imposition of conditions upon appellants' privilege of engaging in local business which would bring within the orbit of state power matters unrelated to any local interests. It is not our province to measure the social advantage to Virginia of regulating the conduct of insurance companies within her borders insofar as it affects Virginia risks. Government has always had a special relation to insurance. The ways of safeguarding against the untoward manifestations of nature and other vicissitudes of life have long been withdrawn from the benefits and caprices of free competition. 6 The state may fix insurance rates, German Alliance Ins. Co. v. Lewis, \n233 \nU.S. 389\n, 34 S.Ct. 612, L.R.A.1915C, 1189; it may regulate the compensation of agents, \n\n[310 \nU.S. 53, 66]\n\u00a0\n O'Gorman & Young v. Hartford Ins. Co., \n282 \nU.S. 251\n, 51 S.Ct. 130, 72 A.L.R. 1163; it may curtail drastically the area of free contract, National Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Wanberg, \n260 \nU.S. 71\n, 43 S.Ct. 32. States have controlled the expenses of insurance companies, New York Insurance Law, Consolidated Laws of New York, c. 28,  244, and Wisconsin Statutes,  201.21; and see Report of Joint (Armstrong) Insurance Investigation Committee (N.Y.) pp. 403-418 (1906). They have also promoted insurance through savings banks; see Berman, The Massachusetts System of Savings Bank Life Insurance, Bulletin No. 615, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and New York Laws of 1938, c. 471. In the light of all these exertions of state power it does not seem possible to doubt that the state could, if it chose, go into the insurance business, just as it can operate warehouses, flour mills, and other business ventures, Green v. Frazier, \n253 \nU.S. 233\n, 40 S.Ct. 499, or might take 'the whole business of banking under its control,' Noble State Bank v. Haskell, \n219 \nU.S. 104, 113\n, 31 S.Ct. 186, 188, 32 L.R.A.,N.S., 1062, Ann. Cas.1912A, 487. If the state, as to local risks, could thus preempt the field of insurance for itself, it may stay its intervention short of such a drastic step by insisting that its own residents shall have a share in devising and safeguarding protection against its local hazards. LaTourette v. McMaster, \n248 \nU.S. 465\n, 39 S.Ct. 160. All these are questions of policy not for us to judge. For it can never be emphasized too much that one's own opinion as to the wisdom of a law must be wholly excluded when one is doing one's judicial duty. The limit of our inquiry is reached when we conclude that Virginia has exerted its powers as to matters within the bounds of her control.\n In reaching this conclusion we have been duly mindful of the cases urged upon us by appellants. In Allgeyer v. Louisiana, \n165 \nU.S. 578\n, 17 S. Ct. 427, apart from the doubts that have been cast upon the opinion in that case, the state attempted to penalize the making of contracts by its residents outside its borders with companies which had never subjected themselves to local control. Thus the statute \n\n[310 \nU.S. 53, 67]\n\u00a0\n was thought to be directed not at the regulation of insurance within the state, but at the making of contracts without. This was followed in St. Louis Cotton Compress Co. v. Arkansas, \n260 \nU.S. 346\n, 43 S.Ct. 125; but see the refined distinctions drawn in Compania General de Tabacos v. Collector, \n275 \nU.S. 87\n, 48 S.Ct. 100. In Fidelity & Deposit Co. v. Tafoya, supra, the Court found that New Mexico had exceeded its power by forbidding 'the payment of any emolument of any nature to any ( non-resident) for the obtaining, placing or writing of any policy covering risks in New Mexico'. The Court was of opinion that this statute went 'beyond any legitimate interest of the State ...,' Id., 270 U.S. at page 435, 46 S.Ct. at page 332, but carefully withheld its judgment as to the validity of a later New Mexico statute not unlike the Virginia law here under review. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n The decree must be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS.\n I am unable to agree with the decision in this case. I think it sanctions an exertion of power by Virginia over transactions beyond her jurisdiction. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 53, 68]\n\u00a0\n Virginia may, of course, regulate the making of contracts of insurance within her borders. She may require such contracts to embody specified provisions. She may regulate the enforcement of these contracts in her courts. She may supervise and condition the activities of registered foreign insurance companies, agents or brokers within the Commonwealth. The statute in question has no such purpose.\n The purpose and effect of the statute is to compel an insurance company which is a citizen of another state, and which negotiates a contract of insurance with an agent or broker within such other state, to pay a resident of Virginia for a service not rendered by him, but rendered by another in another state. By force of the statute a Virginia agent must countersign a contract negotiated outside of Virginia with an assured whose residence is outside of Virginia, which contract of insurance was negotiated by an agent or broker living outside of Virginia. The countersigning Virginia agent must be paid one-half the usual commission, even though the broker or agent who produced the business is licensed as a non-resident broker by Virginia, although the only service such Virginia agent is required to render and, in many cases all he does render, is the mere countersignature of the policy. With respect to this situation the court below said, 29 F.Supp. 71, 83:\n'We do not overlook the peculiar situation of the non-resident assured who form no part of the Virginia public which the state desires to protect. Undoubtedly their business methods will be disturbed by the enforcement of the statute. It is contended, not without merit, that they have no need for the services of the resident commission agents, and that in fact, the latter cannot assume the function of producing agents in their behalf without harmfully intruding themselves into confidential business affairs. Moreover, it is fair to say that these affairs are so important and so widespread in their scope as to be \n\n[310 \nU.S. 53, 69]\n\u00a0\n beyond the technical knowledge and skill of the average Virginia agent, and that the interests of the non-resident assureds can be best looked after by the brokers at the great centers of population where the head offices of the insurance companies and of the assureds are located, and in Virginia by the engineering and claim personnel of the companies. It is also true that the substantial compensation required by the statute to be paid to the Virginia agents will increase the cost of the business.'\n\n The plain effort of Virginia is to compel a nonresident to pay a resident of Virginia for services which the latter does not in fact render and is not required to render. The principles underlying former decisions of this court are at war with the existence of any such asserted power. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The relevant portions of the Virginia statute are as follows: 'Section 4222. ... (a) Insurance companies, legally authorized to do business in this State, except life, title and ocean marine insurance companies, shall not make contracts of insurance or surety on persons or property herein, except through regularly constituted and registered resident agents or agencies of such companies; no contract of insurance or surety covering persons or property in this State, except contracts of life, title and ocean marine insurance and except temporary binders covering other forms of insurance shall be written, issued or delivered by any such authorized insurance company, or any of its representatives, unless such contract is duly countersigned in writing by a resident agent or agency of such company; provided, however, that the countersignature of an insurance agency shall not be considered valid unless such countersignature be attested to in writing by a regularly constituted and registered resident agent of such company.\n'No State agent, special agent, company representative, salaried officer, manager or other salaried representative of any legally authorized insurance company, except a mutual insurance company, shall countersign any contract of insurance or surety, or any renewal thereof, covering persons or property in this State, except contracts of life, title and ocean marine insurance; provided that this sections shall not apply to railroad companies and other common carriers engaged in interstate commerce.\n\n'Section 4226-a. ... No resident agent or agency may write, countersign, issue or deliver any contract of insurance or surety upon persons or property in this State unless there shall be collected at the time the contract is written, issued or delivered, or within a reasonable time thereafter, the full premium on such contract, and the resident agent or agency shall be entitled to and shall receive the usual and customary commissions allowed on such contracts, provided that such resident agent or agency may write such contracts at the request only of such other resident agents or agencies, when such agent or agencies are properly licensed to transact the class of business involved in such exchange, and licensed non-resident insurance brokers who may be authorized by law to broker such contracts, and on exchange of business between resident agents or agencies in Virginia and licensed nonresident insurance brokers in other states the resident agent or agency in Virginia may allow or pay to such licensed non-resident insurance brokers, a commission not exceeding fifty per centum of the resident agent's or agency's commission allowed on such business.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Where out-of-state 'production' actually leads to rebating in defiance of  4222(c), there would seem little doubt of a substantial basis for Virginia's contention that the requirement of participation by a resident agent will make the illegal practices more susceptible of detection and control. Cf. LaTourette v. McMaster, \n248 \nU.S. 465\n, 39 S.Ct. 160. Virginia has also contended that the master policy makes it possible for the companies to reduce their rates below the requirements of state law, and to attribute the reductions to risks in other states with requirements less stringent than those of Virginia. Appellants strenuously contend that no law of Virginia prohibits the reduction of rates for out-of-state risks to compensate for the higher rates which might be required by Virginia and, therefore, there is no illegal practice in this connection which the existence of a resident agent could aid in uncovering. This argument, if met on the merits, would lead us into the particularities of Virginia's rate laws. It is enough to say that even if these practices are not illegal, Virginia may have a legitimate interest in discovering the extent of their prevalence in order to devise, if she so chooses, effective laws to prevent them. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See Hardy, Risk and Risk-Bearing, pp. 9-28, 66-67; Kulp, Casualty Insurance, pp. 188-91, 467-68; Michelbacher, Casualty Insurance Principles, pp. 448-78, 583-84; Crobaugh and Redding, Casualty Insurance, pp. 17-20; Huebner, Foreword to Modern Insurance Tendencies, 157 Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, pp. 3-4; Burns, Service of Casualty Insurance, 15th Annual Meeting, Chamber of Commerce of the United States, p. 4. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] 'The broker is not required to render any technical service beyond the placing of business.'

But even if the broker does 'service' the contract, his activities will take place in Virginia, and will affect the welfare of those inside Virginia who may be subject to the incidence of those risks which the 'servicing' function tends to reduce. If this be true, it is Virginia's concern and not ours to prefer the agency to the brokerage method of 'production.' \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Alabama Code,  8379; Kansas, General Statutes (Supp.) 40-246; Louisiana, Acts of 1918, No. 153; Maryland, Annotated Code, Art. 48A,  65; Mississippi, Code,  5205; Montana, Laws of 1937, c. 95; Oklahoma, Statutes Ann., Title 36,  126, 142, 249; South Carolina, Code,  7972; South Dakota, Code,  31.2218; Washington, Rev.Statutes,  7080; Wisconsin, Statutes,  201.44; Wyoming, Rev.Statutes, 57-203. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] See Gephart, Principles of Insurance, pp. 233-55; Dawson, Insurance Legislation (1895); Abstract of the Laws of Virginia in Relation to Insurance Companies, etc., issued by the Auditor of Public Accounts (1878); Patterson, The Insurance Commissioner in the United States. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Hartford Accident & Ind.

Dick, \n281 \nU.S. 397\n, 50 S.Ct. 338, 74 A.L.R. 701, held that the terms of a contract validly made in Tennessee could not be subsequently enlarged by Mississippi as to a condition of 'substantial importance' when suit was later brought on the policy in Mississippi, simply because 'the interest insured was in Mississippi when the obligation to indemnify ... matured, and it was (the company's) duty to make payment there.' 292 U.S. at page 149, 54 S.Ct. at page 636, 92 A.L.R. 928. At the time the contract was entered into Mississippi had no interest in the risk covered. The Court felt that, even at the time of suit, 'performance at most involved only the casual payment of money in Mississippi,' 292 U.S. at page 150, 54 S.Ct. at page 636, 92 A.L.R. 928, and that was an interest so subordinate to that of Tennessee that the latter was entitled to have the right of way. No question was thus involved touching the right of a state to regulate companies doing business within its borders as to contracts of insurance covering local risks. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Allgeyer v.

MARSHALL(1940)\nNo. 271\nArgued: January 30, 1940Decided: March 11, 1940\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Washington. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 370, 371]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Stanley B. Long, of Seattle, Wash., for appellants.\n\n\n\n[309 \nU.S. 370, 374]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Oscar A. Zabel, of Seattle, Wash., for appellee, John T. Clark.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question is whether the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment is violated by a private act of Congress directing a review of an order for compensation under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act1 after there had been a final award by the deputy commissioner and after the time for review of the award had expired.\n On January 17, 1931, the appellee Clark fell and fractured a rib while working on the navigable waters of the United States as a longshoreman for the appellant Paramino Lumber Company. The other appellant, the Union Insurance Company of Canton, Ltd., is the in- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 370, 375]\n\u00a0\n surance carrier of the Lumber Company under the Compensation Act. The fall having disabled Clark, the appellants voluntarily paid him compensation. Then, on Clark's application, hearings were had under the Compensation Act which resulted in a determination on August 26, 1931, by the deputy commissioner that Clark had been wholly disabled from the date of his fall to July 4, 1931, that on the latter date he had recovered from the disability, and that he had been paid by appellants all the compensation due him. No proceedings being brought to review this award, it became final in thirty days. \n2\n Almost five years later, the Congress passed a private act ordering the Compensation Commission to review Clark's case and to issue a new order, the provisions in the Compensation Act limiting time for reviewing awards 'to the contrary notwithstanding.' \n3\n The information which led the House and Senate Committees on Claims to recommend passage of the act4 indicated that \n\n[309 \nU.S. 370, 376]\n\u00a0\n Clark had first been treated by his employer's physician who operated on his twelfth rib and reported that an examination of the eleventh rib showed a firm union at the site of the fracture of that rib. On the basis of this report the deputy commissioner concluded that Clark had recovered and terminated his compensation. But Clark's pain continued, and within four months of the deputy commissioner's order x-rays taken by other physicians disclosed that the fracture of the eleventh rib was un-united, and in order to give Clark relief an operation fusing the bone fragments had to be performed. After this the rib healed, but in March, 1935, the physician who performed the second operation reported that Clark was still experiencing pain in the region of his injury. Since the deputy commissioner had no jurisdiction over the case after he made his order, and since the time for judicial review expired prior to the time of the operation on the eleventh rib, Clark had no opportunity under the act to have his compensation readjusted. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n After an unsuccessful attempt by appellants to enjoin a hearing under the private act,6 a hearing was had and \n\n[309 \nU.S. 370, 377]\n\u00a0\n the deputy commissioner issued a new award granting Clark compensation for total disability from the date of the prior award, July 4, 1931, to January 5, 1939. Appellants brought two actions against Clark and the deputy commissioner seeking injunctions against the operation of the private act through prohibition of any further steps under the new award. The first bill was framed as an independent suit in equity; the second sought relief under the section of the Compensation Act providing for 'injunction proceedings' to review awards made under the Act. \n7\n Under the Act of August 24, 1937,8 a three-judge court was convened and the Attorney General duly notified. The causes having been transferred to the admiralty side of the court and consolidated for all purposes, the appellees filed exceptions claiming that the appellants had failed to state a cause of action. The court upheld the validity of the special act and sustained the appellee's exceptions. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n By direct appeal the appellants challenge the decree below, contending that the private act violates the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. The argument of appellants is that the original award was an adjudication on which further review was barred prior to the enactment of the private act; that thereby rights and obligations were finally determined, the deprivation of which took from appellants a substantive immunity from further claims of Clark and created in Clark new substantive rights.\n An award under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act determines the liability of \n\n[309 \nU.S. 370, 378]\n\u00a0\n employer to employee. \n10\n But we do not agree that the immunity obtained by the lapse of the time for review is the type of immunity which protects its beneficiary from retroactive legislation authorizing review of the claim. This private act does not set aside a judgment, create a new right of action or direct the entry of an award. The hearing provided for is subject to the provisions of the general act for longshoremen's and harbor workers' compensation. It does not operate to create new obligations where none existed before. It is an act to cure a defect in administration developed in the handling of a compensable claim. If the continuing injury had been known during the period of compensation, payments of the same amount due under the award authorized by this act would have been due to the employee. \n11\n In such circumstances we see no violation of the due process clause.\n The principle underlying this conclusion is illustrated by Graham & Foster v. Goodcell. \n12\n There a retroactive act of the Congress barred recovery by taxpayers of payments for taxes, properly owing but collection of which was barred by limitation. At the time of the enactment of the controverted statute, the taxpayer had a right to recover the payment. Limitation had been permitted to run in favor of the taxpayer under a mistake of law. This Court upheld the legislation as consistent with due process on the ground that it was a curative act to remedy mistakes in administration where the remedy 'can be applied without injustice.' \n13\n\u00a0\n\n[309 \nU.S. 370, 379]\n\u00a0\n Rights obtained by an attaching creditor were subjected to the equity of a prior mortgage, invalid because improperly recorded by a subsequent act in McFaddin v. Evans-Snider-Buel Company. \n14\n This Court refused to accept the argument that such a retroactive statute deprived the holder of the attachment lien with notice of the prior equity, of property without due process. \n15\n Even more recently in Carpenter v. Wabash Railway Company, 16 we upheld as valid and applicable an act granting priority to railroad employees for damages for personal injuries over other claimants in equity receiverships. The act there in question was passed while certiorari was pending in this Court from a contrary decision upon priority which we assumed to be correct. This ruling resulted from the 'superior equities' of the employees. \n17\n\u00a0\n\n It is unimportant whether the claim persisted after the bar18 or ended with the running of limitation. \n19\n To cure a fault of administration Congress may validly enact this act.\n It is urged by appellant, however, that the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment should be \n\n[309 \nU.S. 370, 380]\n\u00a0\n read into the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. If so read, it is argued, this private act violates the rule of equal protection. This conclusion, however, we find untenable. Private acts, as such, are not forbidden by the Constitution. That instrument contains no provision against private acts enacted by the federal government except for a prohibition of bills of attainder and grants of nobility. \n20\n It took an act of Congress to outlaw them in the territories,21 even though the Fifth Amendment is applicable to the territories. \n22\n The states have different situations as to the validity of private acts. \n23\n The constitutions of many of the states, unlike the federal, forbid private legislation without regard to the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. \n24\n\u00a0\n\n[309 \nU.S. 370, 381]\n\u00a0\n Nor can we say that this legislation is an excursion of the Congress into the judicial function. \n25\n\u00a0\n\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS dissents.\n Mr. Justice MURPHY took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 33 U.S.C.  901-950, 33 U.S.C.A.  901-950. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 44 Stat. 1436,  21, 33 U.S.C.  921, 33 U.S.C.A.  921. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] 49 Stat., pt. 2, p. 2244.

On May 26, 1934, the section was amended ( 48 Stat. 807) to allow new awards because of changed conditions to be made 'at any time prior to one year after the date of the last payment of compensation.' Had this been in force at the time of Clark's injury, presumably it would have afforded him a remedy for a new award, but when it was passed more than a year had expired from the last payment of compensation. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] 9 Cir., 95 F.2d 203. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] 44 Stat. 1436,  21, 33 U.S.C.  921, 33 U.S.C.A.  921. \n[\nFootnote 8\n] 50 Stat. 752,  3, 28 U.S.C.  380a, 28 U.S.C.A.  380a. \n[\nFootnote 9\n] Paramino Lumber Co. v.

RUBERT HERMANOS, INC.(1940)\nNo. 582\nArgued: Decided: March 25, 1940\n\n\n\n Mr. Wm. Cattron Rigby, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Melvin H. Siegel, of Washington, D.C., amicus curiae for the United States.\n Messrs. Henri Brown, of San Juan, P.R., and George M. Wolfson, of New York City, for respondent. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 543, 544]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question here in controversy is a matter of great importance to Puerto Rico and involves the power of its legislature to enforce Congressional policies affecting the Island. We therefore brought the case here on a writ of certiorari, \n309 \nU.S. 642\n, 60 S.Ct. 467, 84 L.Ed. --, to review a decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. 106 F.2d 754. That court had reversed the judgment of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, 53 P.R.R. 779 (Spanish edition) sustaining a proceeding in quo warranto brought against respondent.\n The proceeding was initiated in the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico under jurisdiction conferred upon it by the local legislature. The substance of two measures, enacted in 1935, and set out below, authorized the Government of Puerto Rico to bring a quo warranto proceeding in its Supreme Court against any corporation violating federal law. \n1\n Accordingly, the Attorney General of the Island \n\n[309 \nU.S. 543, 545]\n\u00a0\n brought the present suit against respondent, a corporation organized in 1927 under Puerto Rico's corporation law. The gravamen of the suit was alleged defiance by respondent of the Congressional restriction imposed upon 'every corporation authorized to engage in agriculture ... to the ownership and control of not to exceed five hundred acres of land.' This restriction, according to the complaint, embodied 'the public policy of the \n\n[309 \nU.S. 543, 546]\n\u00a0\n People of Puerto Rico' first declared by Congress in its Joint Resolution of May 1, 1900, 31 Stat. 715, supplementing the Foraker Act of April 12, 1900, 31 Stat. 77.2 This limitation upon the corporate ownership of land was continued when Congress in 1917 revised the constitutional framework of Puerto Rico's government in what is the existing Organic Act,  39 of the Act of March 2, 1917, 39 Stat. 951, 964, 48 U.S.C.  752, 48 U.S.C.A.  752.\n The present controversy derives from the fact that Congress affixed no direct consequences to disobedience of its land policy for Puerto Rico. The main issue presented here is whether Puerto Rico's Legislative Assembly has power to graft such consequences upon the Con- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 543, 547]\n\u00a0\n gressional prohibition. This was the issue as the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico conceived it, and we are not disposed to deal with it differently. It was suggested by the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeals that the Supreme Court's judgment may be supported by construing the 1935 legislation as a means of enforcing the local land policy-identic, to be sure, with that declared by Congress-embodied in the 1911 corporation law of Puerto Rico. To do so, however, would take us into niceties of pleading and of local law which were not canvassed by the insular court. Such a course would be peculiarly gratuitous when the issue which the local court in fact decided is easily resolved.\n In the setting of the traditional relation between the broad outlines designed by Congress for the government of territories and the powers of local legislatures to move freely within those outlines, the difficulties conjured up against the view taken by the Puerto Rican court rapidly evaporate. The objections urged against it illustrate vividly the power of subtle argument to give an appearance of difficulty to what is relatively simple. The breadth of local autonomy reposed by Congress in the Legislative Assembly was elucidated too recently and too thoroughly in Puerto Rico v. Shell Co., \n302 \nU.S. 253\n, 58 S.Ct. 167, to call for repetition here. Suffice it to say that the opinion in that case underlined the fullness of scope which Congress gave to Puerto Rico when it provided by  37 of the Organic Act of 1917 that 'the legislative authority shall extend to all matters of a legislative character not locally inapplicable ....' 39 Stat. 964, 48 U.S.C.  821, 48 U.S.C.A.  821. Drawing on the practice of Congress in its treatment of territories throughout our history, and assimilating that practice into the Puerto Rican situation, the Court concluded that 'The grant of legislative power in respect of local matters, contained in section 32 of the Foraker Act and continued in force by section 37 of the \n\n[309 \nU.S. 543, 548]\n\u00a0\n Organic Act of 1917 (48 U.S.C.A.  774, 821), is as broad and comprehensive as language could make it.' 302 U.S. at page 261, 58 S.Ct. at page 171.\n Surely nothing more immediately touches the local concern of Puerto Rico than legislation giving effect to the Congressional restriction on corporate land holdings. This policy was born of the special needs of a congested population largely dependent upon the land for its livelihood. \n3\n It was enunciated as soon as Congress became responsible for the welfare of the Island's people, was retained against vigorous attempts to modify it,4 and was reaffirmed when Congress enlarged Puerto Rico's powers of self-government. Surely Congress meant its action to have significance beyond mere empty words. To treat the absence of a specific remedy for violation of the restriction as an implied bar against local enforcement measures is to impute to Congress a dog-in-the-manger attitude bordering on disingenuousness. We refuse to believe that Congress was bent on the elaborate futility of a brutum fulmen. What was said in another context, Texas & N.O.R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Ry. Clerks, \n281 \nU.S. 548, 569\n, 50 S. Ct. 427, 433, is apposite here: 'The definite prohibition which Congress inserted in the act can not therefore be overridden in the view that Congress intended it to be ignored. As the prohibition was appropriate to the aim of Congress, and is capable of enforcement, the conclusion must be that enforcement was contemplated.' The suggestion that enforcement might come only through \n\n[309 \nU.S. 543, 549]\n\u00a0\n quo warranto proceedings by the Attorney General of the United States is equally feckless.\n A much more rational explanation, consistent with the organic relation between Congress and the local government, is at hand. As the ultimate legislative guardian of the Island's welfare, Congress confined the legislature's discretion within the limits of the five hundred-acre restriction. How this policy was to be realized was for Puerto Rico to say. 'Local authorities may ascertain facts and decide questions upon which depends appropriate exertion of the power much more conveniently than may the Congress.' Public Service Commission v. Havemeyer, \n296 \nU.S. 506, 515\n, 516 S., 56 S.Ct. 360, 364.\n It is admitted, as indeed in view of the Shell case it could not be denied, that the remedy here pursued would have been available to the Legislative Assembly if that body had adopted the Congressional policy in a substantive statute of its own. But respondent contends that the same result cannot be achieved by investing the insular courts with jurisdiction directly to enforce the Congressional policy. Such useless indirection is compelled neither by the Organic Act nor by any general consideration underlying the distribution of power between Congress and the insular legislature. So long as the Legislative Assembly acts within the framework which Congress has set up it merely avails itself of the power conferred in  37 of the Organic Act. It has done so here.\n There remains for consideration an objection based on  256 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  371, 28 U.S.C.A.  371. That section vests in 'the courts of the United States ... exclusive of the courts of the several States' jurisdiction of all suits 'for penalties and forfeitures incurred under the laws of the United States.' Whether a law passed by Congress is a 'law of the United States' depends on the meaning given to that phrase by its context. A law \n\n[309 \nU.S. 543, 550]\n\u00a0\n for the District of Columbia, though enacted by Congress, was held to be not a 'law of the United States' within the meaning of  250 of the Judicial Code, 36 Stat. 1087, 1159. American Security Co. v. Dist. of Columbia, \n224 \nU.S. 491\n, 32 S.Ct. 553. Likewise, we hold that  39 of the Organic Act is not one of 'the laws of the United States' within the meaning of  256. Section 39 is peculiarly concerned with local policy calling for local enforcement from which local courts should not be excluded by a statutory provision plainly designed for the protection of policies having general application throughout the United States.\n Other objections urged at the bar and in respondent's brief do not call for particular mention. On the only questions now before us, we think the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico acted within the scope of power validly conferred upon it by the Legislative Assembly. \n5\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals must therefore be reversed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS did not participate in the decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act No. 33 of July 22, 1935, Laws of Puerto Rico, Special Session, 1935, p. 418, providing:\n'Section 1.-The is hereby conferred upon the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico exclusive original jurisdiction to take cognizance of all Quo Warranto proceedings that the Government of Puerto Rico may hereafter institute for violations of the provisions of Section 752, Title 48, United States Code (48 U.S.C.A.  752) and for that purpose it is provided that the violation of said provisions shall constitute sufficient cause to institute a proceeding of the nature of Quo Warranto.\n\n'Section 2.-All laws or parts of laws in conflict herewith are hereby repealed.\n\n'Section 3.-This Act, being of an urgent character, shall take effect immediately after its approval.'\n\n Act No. 47 of August 7, 1935, Laws of Puerto Rico, Special Session, 1935, pp. 530-532, providing:\n'Section 1.-Section 2 of An Act entitled 'An Act establishing Quo Warranto proceedings', approved March 1, 1902, is hereby amended as follows:\n\n\n'Section 2.-In case any person should usurp, or unlawfully hold or execute any public office or should unlawfully make use of any franchise, or likewise shall hold any office in any corporation created by and existing under the laws of Puerto Rico, or any public officer shall have done or suffered any act which, by the provisions of the law, involves a forfeiture of his office, or any association or number of persons shall act within Puerto Rico as a corporation, without being legally incorporated, or any corporation does or omits any act which amounts to a surrender or forfeiture of its rights and privileges as a corporation, or exercises rights not conferred by law, the Attorney General, or any prosecuting attorney of the respective district court, either on his own initiative or at the instance of another person, may file before any district court of Puerto Rico a petition for an information in the nature of Quo Warranto in the name of The People of Puerto Rico; or whenever any corporation, by itself or through any other subsidiary or affiliated entity or agent, exercises rights, performs acts, or makes contracts in violation of the express provisions of the Organic Act of Puerto Rico or of any of its statutes, the Attorney General or any district attorney, either on his own initiative or at the instance of another person, may file before the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico a petition for an information in the nature of Quo Warranto in the name of The People of Puerto Rico; and if from the allegations such court shall be satisfied that there is probable ground for the proceeding, the court may grant the petition and order the information accordingly. Where it appears to the court that the several rights of divers parties to the same office or franchise may properly be determined on the same proceeding, the court may give leave to join all such persons in the same petition, in order to try their respective rights to such office or franchise.'\n\n'When any corporation by itself or through any other subsidiary or affiliated entity or agent is unlawfully holding, under any title, real estate in Puerto Rico, the People of Puerto Rico may, at its option, through the same proceedings, institue (sic) in its behalf the confiscation of such property, or the alienation thereof at public auction, within a term of not more than six months counting from the date on which final sentence is rendered.\n\n'In every case, alienation or confiscation shall be through the corresponding indemnity as established in the law of eminent domain.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 3 of the Joint Resolution, 48 U.S.C.A.  752, provides: 'No corporation shall be authorized to conduct the business of buying and selling real estate or be permitted to hold or own real estate except such as may be reasonably necessary to enable it to carry out the purposes for which it was created, and every corporation hereafter authorized to engage in agriculture shall be its charter be restricted to the ownership and control of not to exceed five hundred acres of land; and this provision shall be held to prevent any member of a corporation engaged in agriculture from being in any wise interested in any other corporation engaged in agriculture. Corporations, however, may loan funds upon real estate security, and purchase real estate when necessary for the collection of loans, but they shall dispose of real estate so obtained within five years after receiving the title. Corporations not organized in Porto Rico, and doing business therein, shall be bound by the provisions of this section so far as they are applicable.'\n Whether the restriction operates directly as a limitation upon the powers of the corporation or merely as a limitation upon the Legislative Assembly's power to confer corporate privileges, its effect is to render corporate land ownership in excess of the prescribed acreage unlawful.

LUKENS STEEL CO.(1940)\nNo. 593\nArgued: April 3, 1940Decided: April 29, 1940\n\n\n\n\n\n[310 \nU.S. 113, 115]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert H. Jackson, Atty. Gen., and Francis B. Biddle, Sol. Gen., for petitioners.\n Mr. Wm. Clarke Mason, of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondents.\n\n\n[310 \nU.S. 113, 116]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In exercise of its authority to determine conditions under which purchases of Government supplies shall be made, Congress passed the Public Contracts Act of June 30, 1936.1 By virtue of that Act, sellers must agree to pay employees engaged in producing goods so purchased 'not less than the minimum wages as determined by the Secretary of Labor to be the prevailing minimum wages for persons employed on similar work or in the particular \n\n[310 \nU.S. 113, 117]\n\u00a0\n or similar industries or groups of industries currently operating in the locality in which the ... supplies ... are to be manufactured or furnished under said contract.' The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has held that the Secretary erroneously construed the term 'locality' to include a larger geographical area than the Act contemplates, and has ordered six Members of the Cabinet including the Secretary of Labor, the Director of Procurement and all other officials responsible for purchases necessary in the operation of the Federal Government, not to abide by or give effect to the wage determination made by the Secretary for the iron and steel industry either as to the complaining companies or any others. In this vital industry, by action of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the Act has been suspended and inoperative for more than a year.\n We must, therefore, decide whether a Federal court, upon complaint of individual iron and steel manufacturers, may restrain the Secretary and officials who do the Government's purchasing from carrying out an administrative wage determination by the Secretary, not merely as applied to parties before the Court, but as to all other manufacturers in this entire nation-wide industry. Involving, as it does, the marking of boundaries of permissible judicial inquiry into administrative and executive responsibilities, this problem can best be understood against the background of what took place before the Court of Appeals for the District acted:\n July 11, 1938, all the iron and steel companies in the United States were given notice that the Secretary contemplated proceedings for determining the minimum prevailing wage for their industry. On the 25th and 26th of that month, hearings were had before the Public Contracts Board also functioning under the Act. Many companies, and all of those involved here, were represented in the hearings. Companies from the entire United \n\n[310 \nU.S. 113, 118]\n\u00a0\n States filed briefs and submitted information and suggestions, and these producers who are parties here had notice of and actively participated in the various stages of the proceedings. After the hearing, time for filing of briefs was allowed. Following investigation of testimony, exhibits, letters, telegrams, briefs, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and arguments of representatives of both labor and industry itself, the Board, October 27, 1938, made its findings of fact, conclusions and recommendations: (a), Accepting recommendations of industry and labor, the Board adopted-with minor exceptions-the definition of the steel industry previously in effect under the National Industrial Recovery Act, 48 Stat. 195; (b), 'the base rates paid to the workers classified as common laborers' was utilized as a basis for finding the minimum wage prevailing in the industry and a common laborer was defined as 'one who performs physical or manual labor of a general character and simple nature, requiring no special training, judgment nor skill'; (c), the view that municipalities be treated as the geographical limit of a 'locality' and that different minimum prevailing wage standards be adopted for small as distinguished from larger companies, was rejected. The Board pointed out that 'the main channels of trade in the industry take their course far beyond the confines of local producing areas'; that 'conventional measurement of miles on the map to out-line the marketing areas of the iron and steel producers' was unsuitable; that 'geographic location does not limit the efforts of iron and steel manufacturers to secure Government business'; that 'the workers being paid wages below the base rates are employed in large, medium and small size companies and in plants located in all parts of the country'; and that in fixing a 'locality' all these factors as well as geographic and economic considerations were relevant. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 113, 119]\n\u00a0\n The majority of the Board suggested two localities, one for the Southern States and another for the remainder of the steel producing States. One member disagreed and insisted upon four localities throughout the nation, but noted that 'the Board is agreed on all the essential facts before it in the case.' He recognized that 'the law ... permits the division of the country into localities for the purpose of determining minimum wages. No rule is laid down to define the extent of any localities .... A too minute concept of locality would obviously nullify the law, for each plant must necessarily occupy a different locale or site from every other. To reduce the interpretation of locality to its most minute point would be to find a minimum wage prevailing in each plant .... When we depart from this interpretation we are immediately thrown upon judgment . ... Obviously we must look for wage patterns or uniformities. ... Again judgment must be relied upon for the answer.' Excepting to the Board's recommendations, the companies now before this Court urged that the Secretary make a finding of minimum prevailing wages with 'locality' given the connotation of a subdivision of the respective States as originally provided in the Bacon-Davis Act. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n On December 20, 1938, the Assistant Secretary of Labor, acting for the Secretary, heard arguments and received briefs both from industry and labor organizations. He did not adopt the recommendations of the Board in full, but instead divided the industry of the entire country into six 'localities', proceeding, however, upon the view that to construe 'locality' to mean small political divisions of the States, as the Bacon- Davis Act had done in express terms, would render 'effective administration of the Act ... almost impossible.' It was pointed out that \n\n[310 \nU.S. 113, 120]\n\u00a0\n 'this narrowly restricted construction of the word 'locality' ... is contrary to the administrative construction consistently adhered to by the Secretary of Labor in the administration of the Act', and that while Congress had closely followed the language of the Davis-Bacon Act in some respects, it had 'carefully avoided the use of the more narrowly restrictive language of 'city, town, village or other civil subdivision.\" In the twenty-two preceding wage determinations under this Act the Secretary's administrative construction of the term had been-with a sole exception-that of geographic areas no smaller than those determined for the steel industry. \n3\n The determintion in question was made January 16, 1939, but was not made operative until March 1, 1938, 'in order that industry may make necessary readjustments to comply with the decision.'\n In their bill for an injunction and a declaratory judgment, these seven producers of iron and steel (respondents here) sought to enjoin as individuals and in their official capacities, the Secretaries of the Labor, Treasury, War, Navy, and Interior Departments, the Postmaster General, the Director of Procurement of the Treasury Department, the Assistant Secretary of Labor, and the Administrator of the Division of Public Contracts of the Department of Labor and their 'officers, agents, assistants, employees, representatives and attorneys, and any one associated with or acting in concert or participation with them, or any of them, and their successors in office and each of them, and their officers,' etc. The seven companies named as complainants by the bill did not merely pray relief for themselves against the Secretary's wage determination but insisted that all these \n\n[310 \nU.S. 113, 121]\n\u00a0\n Government officials be restrained from requiring the statutory stipulation as to minimum wages in contracts with any other steel and iron manufacturers throughout the United States.\n The District Court declined to interfere so sweepingly with the administration of the Act, even in the temporary restraining order which it granted. Its order ran only against the Secretaries of Labor and the Navy, and specifically limited its benefits to but three of the complaining companies. Recitals in the order indicate that only the Secretary of the Navy had actually solicited bids and that only those three companies were 'desirous of bidding.' After hearing, this order was dissolved and the Court granted a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, inadequacy of the complaint, lack of standing to sue, and because the suit was one against the United States without its consent. \n4\n A stay pending appeal was denied by the District Court, but the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, Justice Edgerton dissenting, by temporary injunction granted the sweeping prayer that all the Government officials and agents designated in the bill be restrained from continuing in effect the Determination made by the Secretary of Labor. By motion for reargument, the restrained officials, represented by attorneys of the Government, asked that the injunction be clarified so as to be 'restricted to enjoining enforcement of the Determination against parties to this proceeding ... and ... not be extended to other bidders, not parties to this action, and who, for all that appears, may desire to abide by the Determination.' In the same motion, the Government asked that employees who might be irreparably injured be protected by 'a bond or other security to pay the minimum wages if the appel- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 113, 122]\n\u00a0\n lants do not eventually succeed in this case.' \n5\n The record discloses no action by the Court of Appeals on this motion or on a subsequent motion to dissolve the temporary injunction. \n6\n But the temporary injunction, rendering the Act wholly inoperative as to the iron and steel industry was kept in effect and, reversing the District Court, the Court of Appeals, Justice Edgerton again dissenting, remanded with instructions that relief as prayed in the bill be granted. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n[310 \nU.S. 113, 123]\n\u00a0\n In our judgment the action of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia goes beyond any controversy that might have existed between the complaining companies and the Government officials. The benefits of its injunction, and of that ordered by it, were not limited to the potential bidders in the 'locality', however construed, in which the respondents do business. All Government officials with duties to perform under the Public Contracts Act have been restrained from applying the wage determination of the Secretary to bidders throughout the Nation who were not parties to any proceeding, who were not before the court and who had sought no relief.\n As a result of this judicial action, Federal officials had no feasible alternative except to make contracts for imperatively needed supplies for the War and Navy Departments without inclusion of the stipulation which Congress had required. The Public Contracts Act, so far as the steel industry is concerned, has been suspended for more than a year, with no bond or security to protect the public's interest in the maintenance of wage standards contemplated by Congress, should the suspension ultimately appear unwarranted or unauthorized. Here, and below, the Government has challenged the right of the judiciary to take such action, alleging that it constitutes an unwarranted interference with deliberate legislative policy and with executive administration vital to the achievement of governmental ends, at the instance of parties whose rights the Government has not invaded and who have no standing in court to attack the Secretary's determination. The manifestly far-reaching importance of the questions thus raised prompted us to grant certiorari. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n Of the six 'localities' into which the Secretary's determination divided the steel industry, respondents do business in that consisting of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Delaware, \n\n[310 \nU.S. 113, 124]\n\u00a0\n Maryland, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, the District of Columbia, and a part of West Virginia. \n9\n Their stated grievance was that the construction given to the term 'locality' by the Secretary amounted to 'a plain error of law in interpreting the Act, ... and, consequently, in purporting ... to determine the prevailing minimum wages for persons employed in the manufacture ... of the iron and steel industry in the six so-called 'localities' set forth in this determination (the Secretary) acted arbitrarily and capriciously and wholly without warrant or authority in law.' In particular, the complaint alleged-'Respondents had been selling their products to agents of the United States for many years; they wished to continue to bid on Government contracts; their minimum wages had ranged from 53\u00f5 to 56 1\/2\u00f5 per hour; if required to pay the 62 1\/2\u00f5 per hour minimum rate determined by the Secretary there was grave danger that they would be unable successfully to compete with others for Government contracts; they had a legal right to bid for Government contracts free from any obligation to abide by the minimum wage determination because of alleged illegal administrative construction of 'locality'; and if denied the right to bid without paying their employees this minimum wage they would suffer 'irreparable and irrecoverable damages' for which the law provided no 'plain adequate or complete remedy.\" \n\n[310 \nU.S. 113, 125]\n\u00a0\n In staying the effect of the administrative wage determination, the Court of Appeals for the District was of the opinion that 'the word locality is one of somewhat indefinite meaning' requiring the Secretary to exercise judgment and discretion 'within the proper limits of the meaning of locality', but held that the Secretary's determination in this case went 'so far beyond any possible proper application of the word as to defeat its meaning and to constitute an attempt arbitrarily to disregard the statutory mandate.' (107 F.2d 630.)\n We are of opinion that no legal rights of respondents were shown to have been invaded or threatened in the complaint upon which the injunction of the Court of Appeals was based. It is by now clear that neither damage nor loss of income in consequence of the action of Government, which is not an invasion of recognized legal rights, is in itself a source of legal rights in the absence of constitutional legislation recognizing it as such. 10 It is not enough that the Secretary of Labor is charged with an erroneous interpretation of the term 'locality' as an element in her wage determination. Nor can respondents vindicate any general interest which the public may have in the construction of the Act by the Secretary and which must be left to the political process. Respondents, to have standing in court, must show an injury or threat to a particular right of their own, as distinguished from the public's interest in the administration of the law. \n11\n They claim a standing by asserting that they have particular rights under and even apart from statute to bid and negotiate for Government contracts free from compliance with the determination \n\n[310 \nU.S. 113, 126]\n\u00a0\n made by the Secretary of Labor for their industry. Respondents point to Section 3709 of the Revised Statutes, 41 U.S.C.A.  5, and to the Public Contracts Act itself.\n Section 3709 of the Revised Statutes requires for the Government's benefit that its contracts be made after public advertising. \n12\n It was not enacted for the protection of sellers and confers no enforceable rights upon prospective bidders. \n13\n 'The United States needs the protection of publicity, form, regularity of returns and affidavit (Rev.Stat.,  3709, 3718-3724, 3745-3747 (34 U.S.C.A.  561-563, 570, 572-574, 41 U.S.C.A.  5, 17-19)), in order to prevent possible frauds upon it by officers. A private person needs no such protection against a written undertaking signed by himself. The duty is imposed upon the officers of the government, not upon him.' \n14\n That duty is owing to the Government and to no one else. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 113, 127]\n\u00a0\n Like private individuals and businesses, the Government enjoys the unrestricted power to produce its own supplies, to determine those with whom it will deal, and to fix the terms and conditions upon which it will make needed purchases. \n15\n Acting through its agents as it must of necessity, the Government may for the purpose of keeping its own house in order lay down guide posts by which its agents are to proceed in the procurement of supplies, and which create duties to the Government alone. It has done so in the Public Contracts Act. That Act does not depart from but instead embodies the traditional principle of leaving purchases necessary to the operation of our Government to administration by the executive branch of Government, with adequate range of discretion free from vexatious and dilatory restraints at the suits of prospective or potential sellers. It was not intended to be a bestowal of litigable rights upon those desirous of selling to the Government; it is a self-imposed restraint for violation of which the Government-but not private litigants-can complain. Thus, a wage determination by the Secretary contemplates no controversy between parties and no fixing of private rights; the process of arriving at a wage determination contains no semblance of these elements which go to make up a litigable controversy as our law knows the concept. \n16\n Courts have never reviewed or supervised the administration of such an executive responsibility even where executive duties 'require an interpretation of the law.' \n17\n Judicial restraint of those who administer the \n\n[310 \nU.S. 113, 128]\n\u00a0\n Government's purchasing would constitute a break with settled judicial practice and a departure into fields hitherto wisely and happily apportioned by the genius of our polity to the administration of another branch of Government.\n This Act's purpose was to impose obligations upon those favored with Government business and to obviate the possibility that any part of our tremendous national expenditures would go to forces tending to depress wages and purchasing power and offending fair social standards of employment. As stated in the Report of the House Committee on the Judiciary on the Bill,18 'The object of the bill is to require persons having contracts with the Government to conform to certain labor conditions in the performance of the contracts and thus to eliminate the practice under which the Government is compelled to deal with sweat shops.'\n We find nothing in the Act indicating any intention to abandon a principle acted upon since the Nation's founding under which the legislative and executive departments have exercised complete and final authority to enter into contracts for Government purchases. The Committee Hearings and Reports and the construction of the measure by its sponsors disclose no purpose to invoke judicial supervision over agents chosen by Congress to perform these duties. And Sections 4 and 5, 41 U.S.C.A.  38, 39, do not subject a wage determination to such review. Provision for hearings and findings by the Secretary with respect to decisions upon breaches of stipulations by contractors, once purchases have been made, is indicative of a lack of intention to create any rights for prospective bidders before a purchase is concluded.\n The Act does not represent an exercise by Congress of regulatory power over private business or employment. \n19\n\u00a0\n\n[310 \nU.S. 113, 129]\n\u00a0\n In this legislation Congress did no more than instruct its agents who were selected and granted final authority to fix the terms and conditions under which the Government will permit goods to be sold to it. The Secretary of Labor is under a duty to observe those instructions just as a purchasing agent of a private corporation must observe those of this principal. In both instances prospective bidders for contracts derive no enforceable rights against the agent for an erroneous interpretation of the principal's authorization. For erroneous construction of his instructions, given for the sole benefit of the principal, the agent is responsible to his principal alone because his misconstruction violates no duty he owes to any but his principal. The Secretary's responsibility is to superior executive and legislative authority. Respondents have no standing in court to enforce that responsibility or to represent the public's interest in the Secretary's compliance with the Act. \n20\n That respondents sought to vindicate such a public right or interest is made apparent both by their prayer that the determination be suspended as to the entire steel industry and by the extent of the injunction granted.\n The contested action of the restrained officials did not invade private rights in a manner amounting to a tortious violation. On the contrary, respondents in effect seek through judicial action to interfere with the manner in which the Government may dispatch its own internal affairs. And in attempted support of the injunction granted they cite many cases involving contested Government regulation of the conduct of private business. \n21\n Their cited cases, however, all relate to problems different from those \n\n[310 \nU.S. 113, 130]\n\u00a0\n inherent in the imposition of judicial restraint upon agents engaged in the purchase of the Government's own supplies.\n The Government can supply its needs by its own manufacturing or by purchase. And Congress can as it always has, either do the purchasing of the Government's goods and supplies itself, or it can entrust its agents with final power to do so and make these agents responsible only to it. \n22\n Courts should not, where Congress has not done so, subject purchasing agencies of Government to the delays necessarily incident to judicial scrutiny at the instance of potential sellers, which would be contrary to traditional governmental practice and would create a new concept of judicial controversies. A like restraint applied to purchasing by private business would be widely condemned as an intolerable business handicap. It is, as both Congress and the courts have always recognized, essential to the even and expeditious functioning of Government that the administration of the purchasing machinery be unhampered. The Constitution prohibits appropriations for the Army for more than two years,23 and by statute contracts for the purchase of Departmental supplies are in general limited to one year. \n24\n These prohibitions emphasize the grave importance of leaving the restraint of the Government's purchasing agents to Congress and their executive superiors.\n The record here discloses the 'confusion and disorder'25 that can result from the delays necessarily incident to \n\n[310 \nU.S. 113, 131]\n\u00a0\n judicial supervision of administrative procedure developed to meet present day needs of Government and capable of operating efficiently and fairly to both private and public interests. In the appropriate words of Mr. Justice Sutherland, 'The bare suggestion of such a result, with its attendant inconveniences, goes far to sustain the conclusion which we have reached, that a suit of this character cannot be maintained.' 26 For more than a year, Cabinet officers and their subordinates have been enjoined from making the Secretary's determination of minimum wages effective. Meanwhile, iron and steel were needed for the Army and Navy. In order that the military program could proceed, the declared policy of the Congress was abandoned under judicial compulsion and contracts without a minimum wage stipulation have been awarded for more than $65,000,000.00 worth of iron and steel products since the injunction issued. \n27\n If the genberal law permits prospective bidders to challenge each wage determination of the Secretary in the courts, by a like token all employees affected could obtain judicial review. Such a possibility places in bold relief those conditions which led Congress to proceed in this Act upon the belief, to which we have recently alluded,28 that 'legislatures are ultimate guardians of the liberties and welfare of the people in quite as great a degree as the courts.' \n29\n\u00a0\n\n The case before us makes it fitting to remember that 'The interference of the courts with the performance of the ordinary duties of the executive departments of the government, would be productive of nothing but mis- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 113, 132]\n\u00a0\n chief; and we are quite satisfied, that such a power was never intended to be given to them.' \n 30\n\u00a0\n\n The District Court properly dismissed the bill and the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia was in error in finding respondents with standing to bring this action, in ordering the Secretary's determination restrained and in holding respondents entitled to declaratory judgment. \n31\n\u00a0\n\n Our decision that the complaining companies lack standing to sue does not rest upon a mere formality. We rest it upon reasons deeply rooted in the constitutional divisions of authority in our system of Government and the impropriety of judicial interpretations of law at the instance of those who show no more than a mere possible injury to the public. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and that of the District Court dismissing the bill is affirmed.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS is of opinion that the challenged judgment should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 49 Stat. 2036, 41 U.S.C.A.  35 et seq. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 46 Stat. 1494, 40 U.S.C.A.  276a. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 2 Fed.Reg. 233, 1333, 1335, 1336, 1337, 1338, 1339, 2960, 2976; 3 Fed.Reg. 64, 224, 257, 889, 1613, 895, 901, 1612, 1153, 2371, 2370, 2537, 3043; 4 Fed.Reg. 4005. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The District Court's judgment was rendered without opinion. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Sections of the Public Contracts Act provide that 'breach or violation of any of the representations and stipulations in any contract for the purposes set forth ... shall render the party responsible therefor liable to the United States of America for liquidated damages, in addition to damages for any other breach of such contract, ... a sum equal to the amount of any deductions, rebates, refunds, or underprayment of wages due to any employee engaged in the performance of such contract ....

Crawley and Earle Farwell, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Chauncey I. Clark, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The steamer Eastern Glade, owned by petitioner, collided with the steamer El Isleo, owned by respondent, in the waters of Baltimore harbor. Each owner filed a libel against the vessel of the other. The District Court found that the Eastern Glade was solely at fault (The Eastern Glade, 20 F.Supp. 373) and decrees dismissing petitioner's suit and awarding damages to respondent were affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 2 Cir ., 101 F.2d 4. In the view that there was involved an important question of maritime law which had not been, and should be, settled by this court, certiorari was granted. October 9, 1939. \n308 \nU.S. 532\n, 60 S.Ct. 77, 84 L. Ed. --.\n That question is said to arise from rulings of the Circuit Court of Appeals with respect to the validity of \n\n[308 \nU.S. 378, 380]\n\u00a0\n Rules II and VII of the Board of Supervising Inspectors1 in the light of the applicable provisions of the Act of Congress. \n2\n See The Fulton, 2 Cir., 54 F.2d 467, 468.\n The facts are thus stated by the Circuit Court of Appeals (101 F.2d 5 ): 'The collision occurred in the waters of Baltimore Harbor near the junction of Curtis Bay Channel with Fort McHenry Channel. The latter is about 600 feet wide and runs in a northwesterly direction toward Baltimore; the former, running nearly east and west, comes into Fort McHenry Channel from the west but does not cross it. The night was clear, the tide ebb, and a 15 mile breeze was blowing from the northwest. The steamship Eastern Glade, light, was bound out of Curtis Bay Channel and was intending to turn left into Fort McHenry Channel and proceed to Baltimore. The steamer El Isleo, laden with 1,000 tons of steel ore, also bound for Baltimore, was proceeding up Fort McHenry Channel at full speed-about eight miles through the water, as she was working only one boiler. When the vessels sighted each other they were more than a mile apart, the El Isleo being about four points on the starboard bow of the Eastern Glade. The latter stopped her engines and shortly thereafter sounded a two blast signal to indicate, as her master says, that his course was to the left and up Fort McHenry Channel. El Isleo answered the two blast signal with an alarm followed by one blast, to indicate that she would keep her course and speed. Captain Korn of El Isleo testified that the Eastern Glade responded with four blasts followed by one, while her captain says she responded with three blasts to indicate that she was reversing her engines. El Isleo kept on until she reached \n\n[308 \nU.S. 378, 381]\n\u00a0\n a buoy just opposite Curtis Bay Channel, when, believing collision imminent, she put her rudder hard right and swung out of Fort McHenry Channel to her starboard. The Eastern Glade, although her master testified that he intended to hold back in Curtis Bay Channel until El Isleo had passed the junction, came clear across Fort McHenry Channel and brought her stem into contact with the port side of El Isleo about amidships. The place of collision was east of Fort McHenry Channel. The district court did not determine how far to the east, but McDonald testified it was about 200 yards'.\n After referring to the question whether the vessels were on crossing courses as the district court had held, or whether the situation was one of special circumstances, as petitioner contended, the Court of Appeals continued: 'It is not disputed that El Isleo's course up Fort McHenry Channel was always apparent to the Eastern Glade. But the latter's course was not immediately apparent to El Isleo; when the Eastern Glade should reach the end of Curtis Bay Channel, she might turn left, she might turn right, or she might conceivably, though improbably, cross Fort McHenry Channel, since there was water enough to the East of that channel, although neither pier, port nor anchorage to which she might be bound appears on the chart. When, however, she sounded her two blast signal, she indicated an intention either to cross the bows of El Isleo by proceeding across Fort McHenry Channel, or to turn to the left and proceed up that channel. The former alternative would clearly result in crossing courses; the latter would result in converging courses, since the Eastern Glade's course, if projected, would carry her into the starboard lane of Fort McHenry Channel, unless she violated her duty by going up on the wrong side. Such converging courses involve the very risk that resulted in the collision, and the rights \n\n[308 \nU.S. 378, 382]\n\u00a0\n and duties of the vessels are governed by Articles 19, 22 and 23 of the Inland Rules 33 U.S.C.A.  204, 207, 208. ... Accordingly, the district court was right in treating the situation as one of crossing courses'.\n The Articles of the Inland Rules established by Congress3 provide:\n'Art. 19. When two steam vessels are crossing, so as to involve risk of collision, the vessel which has the other on her own starboard side shall keep out of the way of the other.'\n\n'Art. 21. Where, by any of these rules, one of the two vessels is to keep out of the way, the other shall keep her course and speed.'\n\n'Art. 22. Every vessel which is directed by these rules to keep out of the way of another vessel shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, avoid crossing ahead of the other.'\n\n'Art. 23. Every steam vessel which is directed by these rules to keep out of the way of another vessel shall, on approaching her, if necessary, slacken her speed or stop or reverse.'\n\n Applying these statutory provisions, and viewing the situation as one of 'crossing courses', the Court of Appeals found that no fault appeared in the navigation of El Isleo, the 'privileged vessel'. The fault of the Eastern Glade was found to be glaring and alone sufficient to account for the disaster.\n Petitioner does not contest the ruling that the Eastern Glade was at fault but insists that the El Isleo was also at fault. Petitioner argues the El Isleo violated Rules II and VII of the Supervising Inspectors, purporting to have been adopted under the authority of the statute. \n3\n These rules are as follows:4 \n\n[308 \nU.S. 378, 383]\n\u00a0\n 'Rule II. Steam vessels are forbidden to use what has become technically known among pilots as 'cross signals', that is, answering one whistle with two, and answering two whistles with one.\n'Rule VII. When two steam vessels are approaching each other at right angles or obliquely so as to involve risk of collision, other than when one steam vessel is overtaking another, the steam vessel which has the other on her own port side shall hold her course and speed; and the steam vessel which has the other on her own starboard side shall keep out of the way of the other by directing her course to starboard so as to cross the stern of the other steam vessel, or, if necessary to do so, slacken her speed or stop or reverse.\n\n'If from any cause the conditions covered by this situation are such as to prevent immediate compliance with each other's signals, the misunderstanding or objection shall be at once made apparent by blowing the danger signal, and both steam vessels shall be stopped and backed if necessary, until signals for passing with safety are made and understood'.\n\n Petitioner says that these rules are not inconsistent with the statute and have the force of law; that they provide in substance 'that where the so-called privileged vessel in a crossing situation receives an unacceptable proposal to cross ahead, the privileged vessel may not maintain her course and speed until collision becomes imminent but must at once sound danger signals and stop and back if necessary until a safe passage has been agreed upon.' Hence, it is argued, that El Isleo was required to 'stop, and reverse if necessary,' when the Eastern Glade sounded her two-blast signal, and that the only question here is as to the validity of the Inspectors' requirements.\n Respondent contends that the statutory provisions of Articles 19-23 govern; that it was not only the privilege \n\n[308 \nU.S. 378, 384]\n\u00a0\n but the duty of El Isleo to 'keep her course and speed'; that it was not the intention of the Supervising Inspectors to modify that affirmative duty; that El Isleo was not bound to agree to the two-blast signal from the Eastern Glade; that the signals had been made and were understood by each vessel and the collision was due to the miscalculation of the master of the Eastern Glade; and that if there were any errors in El Isleo's navigation they were errors in extremis for which she is not liable.\n The Inspectors' prohibition against 'cross signals', found in Rule II, was originally applicable to 'vessels approaching each other from opposite directions'5 but was amended so that its terms apply to crossing situations as well. \n6\n The Fulton, supra. But the Court of Appeals in a number of decisions involving crossing situations has disregarded the Inspectors' rule and has 'exonerated a vessel which pressed her statutory privilege by crossing the signal and holding her course and speed'.7 Id. It is unnecessary to review the many cases which the present parties cite, as the court itself has summarized its position: 'Our reasoning has been, that, as the statute (Inland Rules) article 21 (33 U.S.C.A.  206), puts a duty upon the privileged ship to keep her course and speed, no rule can be valid which affects to relieve her of it, and that she may announce her determination to insist by crossing the first signal. The doctrine has been too long and too repeatedly established to allow any question now, but it is plain that the inspectors have never assented to it'. Id. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 378, 385]\n\u00a0\n Although the Court of Appeals, after making this statement in The Fulton, said that, as the court was then constituted, it could not see any necessary inconsistency between the Inspectors' rule and the statute, the court concluded that 'unless the Supreme Court chooses finally to settle the whole matter otherwise', it had no option 'in crossing situations' and would 'continue to disregard the rule'. The Fulton, however, presented a 'head-on situation', and the Court of Appeals, feeling that it was not committed in such a case, decided that the steamship there in question was 'at fault for crossing the signal'. Id., 54 F.2d page 469.\n In the instant case, the Court of Appeals again referred to the rule as established in the second circuit, 'that in a crossing situation the privileged vessel may 'cross' the signal of the burdened vessel and hold her course and speed until it becomes evident that the burdened vessel either cannot or will not keep out of the way'. And the court observed that although this rule was criticised in The Fulton, it was thought to be 'too firmly established to be departed from until the Supreme Court speaks'. The court added that it still adhered to that view. The Eastern Glade, 101 F.2d, page 6.\n We may assume that the Supervising Inspectors had no intention to depart from the statute under which they claimed authority to make their regulations. And Articles 19-23 of the statute are to be read in the light of Article 27 which has the following controlling qualification: 'Art. 27. In obeying and construing these rules due regard shall be had to all dangers of navigation and collision, and to any special circumstances which may render a departure from the above rules necessary in order to avoid immediate danger'.\n Moreover, the Inspectors expressly recognize and follow the statute in providing in Rule VII, first paragraph, that 'the steam vessel which has the other on her own port \n\n[308 \nU.S. 378, 386]\n\u00a0\n side shall hold her course and speed;' and 'the steam vessel which has the other on her own starboard side shall keep out of the way of the other by directing her course to starboard so as to cross the stern of the other steam vessel, or, if necessary to do so, slacken her speed or stop or reverse'. The second paragraph of Rule VII, providing for the stoppage and backing of both vessels if necessary 'until signals for passing with safety are made and understood', was clearly intended to apply to the dangerous situation envisaged in Article 27 of the statute.\n The grounds for criticising the rulings of the Court of Appeals of the second circuit in disregarding the Inspectors' requirement cannot be better stated than in the court's own language in The Fulton. After referring to its former decisions, by which it felt itself bound, the court observed that 'concededly there comes a time when the privileged vessel must yield'; that there is never a 'right of way into collision'; that the point at best 'is one of degree'; and that if the question were res integra the Inspectors' rule would be held valid. The court continued: 'The inspectors apparently believe that in the greater number of cases it will conduce to collision to allow a pilot to keep on in the face of a proposal by the approaching vessel that she put herself across his bows. True, the proposer often will not act without consent; but it is certainly possible that prudence forbids speculation as to whether he has still time or disposition to keep out of the way. Again and again cases arise in which the proposal is repeated, the vessels coming nearer all the time; sometimes it is repeated even after it has been crossed by a refusal. No substantial interest is at stake except to escape collision which will certainly be avoided if both stop'. Stopping 'is more likely to avoid disaster than going on in the teeth of what is at least a proposal, and may be a declaration'. So, the court thought that the situation was a proper one 'for the exercise of the in- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 378, 387]\n\u00a0\n spectors' function in providing for cases not covered explicitly'. The court could not see 'any conflict with the statute, unless that be read without regard to its purpose'. For Articles 19 and 21 'do not require any signals at all'; and 'if one is given proposing a dangerous course', the court thought it 'too verbal and rigid an interpretation to say that the privileged vessel is inevitably still bound; at least officials, vested with general authority, are not helpless to meet the situation by a rule'. And after noting that Article 27 of the statute authorized a departure 'to avoid immediate danger', the court posed the question-'Can it be that though vessels themselves may so depart, the inspectors may not say that a situation likely to be dangerous shall be treated as such?'\n We are in accord with the criticism thus effectively expressed by the Court of Appeals of its established rule, and we think that the court should be relieved of its assumed obligation to follow its former decisions holding that Inspectors' requirement invalid. We think that Inspectors' Rule II should be read in connection with their Rule VII and that both should be construed in the light of the statutory provision in Article 27.\n The plain purpose of the Inspectors' Rules is to minimize the danger of collision. The so-called privileged vessel has no absolute right to keep her course and speed regardless of the danger involved in that action. Her right to maintain her privilege ends when there is danger of collision and in the presence of that danger both vessels must be 'stopped and backed if necessary, until signals for passing with safety are made and understood'.\n In the Quogue, 2 Cir., 47 F.2d 873, 874, where the Court of Appeals of the second circuit had before it a 'head-on situation', the court condemned a vessel 'for crossing signals and insisting upon her rights'. That vessel was The Transfer and the right insisted upon was that of port \n\n[308 \nU.S. 378, 388]\n\u00a0\n to port passage. The fault of the other vessel, The Quogue, in undertaking to cross the bow of The Transfer was found to be 'most glaring', but The Transfer was also held at fault because her master was not justified in acting on the assumption that The Quogue would not carry out the maneuver indicated by her signals unless he consented. He did not 'reverse as promptly as he should', for when the dangerous situation was presented 'he was not privileged to continue on his course on the chance that the other vessel would change her announced purpose if he refused to consent'. The Court of Appeals aptly said: 'It is a hard rule which requires a master when he sees another vessel about to cross his bow with wanton disregard of his rights to stop and allow the arrogant usurper to pursue his wrongful course. But safety is better than pride; and, however slight the hope that rules to promote safety will be observed under such circumstances, whatever courts may say, the vessels must be judged according to their legal duties'.\n The Court of Appeals in The Fulton considered these observations in The Quogue to be pertinent, and we think that they are pertinent to a dangerous situation arising in connection with crossing courses. We see no sufficient ground for a distinction in upholding and applying the Inspectors' requirements in such cases.\n We deal simply with the question presented with respect to the validity of the Inspectors' rules here in question. We hold these rules are not essentially inconsistent with the statute and are valid, both the statutory provisions and the Inspectors' Rules being designed to promote safety in situations fraught with danger. We do not pass, or intimate any opinion, upon the particular facts of the instant case, as it is the appropriate province of the Court of Appeals to deal with these. As the Court of Appeals apparently did not consider the conduct of El Isleo in the light of the Inspectors' requirements, but \n\n[308 \nU.S. 378, 389]\n\u00a0\n thought, under the compulsion of its former decision, that it must disregard those requirements, we think that the cause should be returned to the Court of Appeals to be decided by it, free of that compulsion.\n To afford that freedom we reverse the judgment and remand.\n It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Pilot Rules for Certain Inland Waters', etc., effective, as amended, May 1, 1912. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Inland Rules, Act of June 7, 1897, Arts. 19, 21-23, 27, 30 Stat. 101, 102; 33 U.S.C.  204, 206-208, 212, 33 U.S.C.A.  204, 206-208, 212. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Act of June 7, 1897, c. 4, sec. 2, 30 Stat. 102, 33 U.S.C.  157, 33 U.S.C.A.  157. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] See Note 1. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] See Rule III, 'Pilot Rules for Atlantic and Pacific Coast Inland Waters', edition October 23, 1906. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] See Rule II, edition July 1, 1907; edition May 1, 1912. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] In the Fulton, 2 Cir., 54 F.2d 467, page 468, the Circuit Court of Appeals cited to this effect The John King, 2 Cir., 49 F. 469; The Cygnus, 2 Cir., 142 F. 85; The Transfer No. 15, 2 Cir., 145 F. 503; The John H.

Revised Civil Statutes, Art. 6014 et seq., Vernon's Ann.Civ.St. art. 6014 et seq. In conformity with this statute, which has familiar procedural provisions, the Commission in the fall of 1938 issued the assailed proration order covering the East Texas oil field, where respondent's wells are located. By this order each well was allowed to produce 2.32% of its 'hourly potential'-that is, 2.32% of its hourly productive capacity under unrestricted flow. But the practical operation of this order was largely cut across by allowances made to 'marginal wells'. These are wells which, if their low productive capacity were legally curtailed, would have to be prematurely abandoned. Therefore the Texas statute gives them a special status. In accord with its policy toward these marginal wells, the Commission freed them from the burden of its hourly potential formula by allowing them production up to twenty barrels a day. Because of the large number of these low capacity units in the East Texas field, approximately 385,000 barrels out of a total daily 'allowable' of 522,000 barrels were exempt from the restricting formula, leaving only about 136,000 for the class within which respondent's wells fell. Application to them of the hourly potential formula resulted in an allotment of only about twenty-two barrels a day to each well. Claiming that such a mode of regulation disregarded its right to the oil in place beneath its leases, respondent sought and obtained a decree from the District \n\n[310 \nU.S. 573, 578]\n\u00a0\n Court for the Western District of Texas enjoining the Commission from carrying its proration plan into effect. 28 F.Supp. 131. With modification not here relevant the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decree. 107 F. 2d 70. We brought the case here by certiorari, \n309 \nU.S. 646\n, 60 S.Ct. 613, 84 L.Ed. --, because of the importance of the matter in the administration of the Texas law and kindred conservation statutes.\n As sustained by the findings of the District Court and accepted by the Circuit Court of Appeals, respondent's claims may be summarized by what follows. The Commission's proration formula as applied permits other leaseholders, more leniently treated, to capture oil at a more rapid rate than is possible for the respondent, thereby draining away oil which underlies respondent's leased lands. This is due both to the allocating formula itself, and more especially to the permission granted marginal wells to produce without limit up to twenty barrels a day. The 'potential' method of allocation fails to give sufficient weight to relevant factors in the measurement of oil in place, especially to the depth of respondent's reserves situated in the 'Fairway', a deep and rich portion of the East Texas field. Only an allocation based upon acrefeet of sand or its equivalent would be a reasonable means of measuring the oil in place beneath respondent's leases; and any formula failing to do this takes respondent's property without due process of law. Moreover, the allowance made to marginal wells absorbs so much of the total 'allowable' as to make the Commission's order in effect an allocation on a flat per well basis, regardless of great variation in the capacity of the wells and the density with which different leases have been drilled. An important factor in producing this result is the permission frequently granted by the Commission, under power conferred upon it by statute, for departure from its spacing and drilling rules whereby the field has \n\n[310 \nU.S. 573, 579]\n\u00a0\n been drilled with an irregular density. As a consequence, the more densely drilled tracts adjoining respondent's leases may, by virtue of their marginal allowances, produce oil in such quantities as to drain away respondent's reserves. Such is the basis for respondent's resistance to the order.\n Underlying these claims is as thorny a problem as has challenged the ingenuity and wisdom of legislatures. In major part it was created by the discovery of vast oil resources and by their development under rules of law fashioned in the first instance by courts on the basis of analogies drawn from other fields of the common law. In Texas, according to conventional doctrine, the holder of an oil lease 'owns' the oil in place beneath the surface. LeMar v. Garner, 121 Tex. 502, 50 S.W.2d 769; Stephens County v. Mid-Kansas Oil & Gas Co., 113 Tex. 160, 254 S.W. 290, 29 A.L.R. 566; 1 Summers, Oil and Gas (2nd ed.), page 16,  5. But equally recognized is the 'rule of capture' which subjects the lessee's interest to his neighbors' power to drain his oil away. Therefore, to speak of ownership in its relation to oil, is to imply a contingency of control not applicable to ordinary interests in realty. See Ely, The Conservation of Oil, 51 Harv.L.Rev. 1209, 1218-22. Each leaseholder, that is to say, is at the mercy of all those who adjoin him, since oil is a fugacious mineral, the movements of which are not confined by the artificial boundaries of surface tracts. This gap between the geological nature of the oil pool and the formal surface rights of the lessees is frequently bridged by the drilling of 'offset wells' at the boundary of each surface tract, so that owners may protect themselves against the exercise of one another's capture rights. Partly to mitigate the undesirable consequences of this unsystematized development, the oil-producing states, Texas among them, have enacted conservation laws with appropriate administrative mechanisms to control drilling and production. The \n\n[310 \nU.S. 573, 580]\n\u00a0\n general scheme of the Texas statute is not challenged. Its constitutionality is here settled. Champlin Rfg. Co. v. Commission, \n286 \nU.S. 210\n, 52 S.Ct. 559, 86 A.L.R. 403.\n But merely writing laws is only the beginning of the matter. The administration of these laws is full of perplexities. State agencies have encountered innumerable difficulties in trying to adjust the many conflicting interests which grow out of the rule of capture and its implications. The experience of Texas illustrates that a brood of litigation almost inevitably follows the inherent empiricism of these attempted solutions. See Ely, op. cit. supra, at pp. 1225-29; Marshall and Meyers, The Legal Planning of Petroleum Production: Two Years of Proration, 42 Yale L.J. 701. For some years the Texas Commission has been engaged in experimental endeavor to devise appropriate formulas for a fair allotment of the allowable production. The commitment of such a delicate task to the administrative process has not escaped challenge in the courts, and at times the challenge has been successful. Compare MacMillan v. Railroad Commission, D.C., 51 F.2d 400; Constantin v. Smith, D.C., 57 F.2d 227; Peoples' Petroleum Producers v. Smith, D.C., 1 F.Supp. 361; Amazon Petroleum Corp. v. Railroad Commission, D.C., 5 F.Supp. 633. But such cases are only episodes in the evolution of adjustment among private interests and in the reconciliation of all these private interests with the underlying public interest in such a vital source of energy for our day as oil. Certainly so far as the federal courts are concerned the evolution of these formulas belongs to the Commission and not to the judiciary. A controversy like this always calls \n\n[310 \nU.S. 573, 581]\n\u00a0\n for fresh reminder that courts must not substitute their notions of expediency and fairness for those which have guided the agencies to whom the formulation and execution of policy have been entrusted.\n General as these considerations may be, they are decisive of the present case. Both the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals appear to have been dominated by their own conception of the fairness and reasonableness of the challenged order. For all we know, the judgment of these two lower courts may have been wiser than that of the Commission, and their standard of fairness a better one. But whether a system of proration based upon hourly potential is as fair as one based upon estimated recoverable reserves or some other factor or combination of factors, is in itself a question for administrative and not judicial judgment. According to the Commission's experts, theories of allocation urged by the respondent and accepted by the courts below would in fact give to respondent more than its fair share of the oil in the field. Respondent, the Commission's witnesses contend, would gain undue benefit from the constant eastward migrations of oil caused by the gradual influence of subsurface pressure gradients-and this at the expense of other lessees in geologically less fortunate portions of the field. The Commission's experts further insisted that, though much technical progress has been made, estimates of recoverable reserves beneath the surface of a particular tract remain largely an indeterminate venture; and that hourly potential actually takes into account, at least in some measure, all relevant factors for ascertaining recoverable reserves. Certainly in a domain of knowledge still shifting and growing, and in a field where judgment is therefore necessarily beset by the necessity of inferences bordering on conjecture even for those learned in the art, it would be presumptuous for courts, on the basis of conflicting expert testimony, to deem the view of the ad- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 573, 582]\n\u00a0\n ministrative tribunal, acting under legislative authority, offensive to the Fourteenth Amendment. Compare South Carolina Hwy. Dept. v. Barnwell Bros., \n303 \nU.S. 177, 191\n, 58 S.Ct. 510, 517, et seq.\n Equally enmeshed in a conflict of expertise is the claim most vigorously urged by respondent that, taken in connection with exceptions made by the Commission to its spacing rules and with the unrestricted twenty barrel allowance to marginal wells, the proration order substantially places production on a flat per well basis. Such a result, according to respondent's claim as accepted by the lower courts, gives a constitutionally inadmissible advantage to smaller and more densely drilled tracts as against those owned by respondent. But this claim really presents a more specialized aspect of the general problem. In regulating flow of production the treatment to be accorded to small and irregularly shaped tracts which do not fit neatly into the Commission's general scheme for spacing, has presented a difficulty almost as great as the framing of proration formulas. Compare Walker, The Problem of the Small Tract under Spacing Regulations, 17 Tex.L.Rev. 157 (Supp.Bar Association Proceedings). To deny the holders of these tracts permission to drill might subject them to the risk of losing their oil in place or of being put at the mercy of adjoining holders. In many instances, therefore, the Commission has granted exceptions to its general spacing rule on the basis of which investments have been made and wells drilled. If these wells, most of them small, were restricted to production on the basis of an hourly potential formula, it might be unprofitable to operate them at all. Not only are the individual interests of these small operators involved, but their effect on the state's economy is an appropriate factor to be taken into account when plans are devised to keep the wells open. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 573, 583]\n\u00a0\n A flat per well allowance to these producers was not an unnatural answer to the problem. Whether, as contended by the respondent, the maximum figure set by the Commission is too high in that it leads to the capture of oil from beneath its leases by neighboring operators, and whether a lower limit might suffice to assure profitable production-these questions take us into that debatable territory which it is not the province of federal courts to enter. The record is redolent with familiar dogmatic assertions by experts equally confident of contradictory contentions. These touch matters of geography and geology and physics and engineering. No less is there conflict in the evidence as to the solidity of respondent's apprehension that there will be drainage of the oil beneath its surface by neighboring wells. The Commission's experts insist that the threat, if existent at all, is speculative, and that the Commission's power of continuous oversight is readily available for relief if real danger should arise in the future.\n Plainly these are not issues for our arbitrament. The state was confronted with its general problem of proration and with the special relation to it of the small tracts in the particular configuration of the East Texas field. \n1\n It has chosen to meet these problems through the day-to- day exertions of a body specially entrusted with the task because presumably competent to deal with it. In striking the balances that have to be struck with the compli- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 573, 584]\n\u00a0\n cated and subtle factors that must enter into such judgments, the Commission has observed established procedure. If the history of proration is any guide, the present order is but one more item in a continuous series of adjustments. It is not for the federal courts to supplant the Commission's judgment even in the face of convincing proof that a different result would have been better. While the presence of a federal question may also open up state issues, Siler v. Louisville & N.R.R., \n213 \nU.S. 175\n, 29 S.Ct. 451, the claim here founded on Texas law is derived from a statute requiring proration on a 'reasonable basis.' Vernon's Texas Annotated Civil Statutes, art. 6049c,  7. The Texas decisions, insofar as they have been brought to our attention, do not make clear whether the local courts may exercise an independent judgment on what is 'reasonable.' Compare Brown v. Humble Oil & Refining Co., 126 Tex. 296, 316, 83 S.W.2d 935, 87 S. W.2d 1069, 99 A.L.R. 1107, 101 A.L.R. 1393. But, in any event, as we read the Texas cases, the standard of 'reasonable basis' under the statute opens up the same range of inquiry as the respondent in effect asserted to exist in his claims under the Due Process Clause. These latter claims we have found untenable. What ought not to be done by the federal courts when the Due Process Clause is invoked ought not to be attempted by these courts under the guise of enforcing a state statute. Whether the respondent may still have a remedy in the state courts is for the Texas courts to determine, and is not foreclosed by the denial, on the grounds we have indicated, of the extraordinary relief of an injunction in the federal courts. The challenged decree must therefore be Reversed. The motion for leave to present oral argument is denied. The petition for rehearing is denied. Mr. Justice ROBERTS. The petitioners' proration order is challenged not merely as unfair or unreasonable but as confiscatory of the respondent's property. Upon the allegations of the bill, the District Court had jurisdiction. Although the problem of proration presented technical and difficult questions, and although the Commission was vested with a broad discretion in dealing with them, these facts could not justify the court's abdicating its jurisdiction to test the Commission's order. The case was tried de novo and neither the full record made before the Commission nor its findings appear in the evidence, except for what is contained in the Commission's orders. After a painstaking trial, and upon detailed and well supported findings of fact, the court reached the conclusion that the order worked a confiscation of respondent's property. \n2\n The court said: 'The respondents' ( petitioners') engineers frankly admitted that the present scheme of proration is nothing more or less than one on a per well basis.' Referring to such a basis, the court added: 'It is sufficient to say that it takes no account of the difference in the wells, of the richness or thickness of the sand, of the \n\n[310 \nU.S. 573, 585]\n\u00a0\n location upon the structure, of the porosity or permeability of the sand, of the estimated oil reserves, or of the acreage upon which the respective wells are situated. The worst property is raised to the level of the best and the best is lowered to the level of the worst.' The court concluded that the order operated to appropriate, for the benefit of others, the respondent's oil without compensation.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals approved and adopted the findings and conclusions of the District Court. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The opinion of this court, in my judgment, announces principles with respect to the review of administrative action challenged under the due process clause directly contrary to those which have been established. A recent exposition of the applicable principles is found in the opinion of Mr. Justice Brandeis, written for a unanimous court, in Thompson v. Consolidated Gas Utilities Corporation, \n300 \nU.S. 55\n, 57 S.Ct. 364, dealing with a proration order affecting gas, entered by the same commission which entered the order here in issue. I think that adherence to the principles there stated requires the affirmance of the decree.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] We are here not concerned with a statute, or orders under it, not thought to enforce state policy 'for the prevention of waste, and the protection of correlative rights of owners in the common pool,' but directed solely 'to compel those who may legally produce, because they have market outlets for permitted uses, to purchase gas from potential producers whom the statute prohibits from producing because they lack such a market for their possible product.'

UNITED STATES(1940)\nNo. 229\nArgued: January 5, 1940Decided: January 15, 1940\n\n\n\n Messrs. Joseph Neff Ewing and Maurice Bower Saul, both of Philadelphia, Pa., for petitioner.\n Miss Helen R. Carloss, Sp. Asst. to Atty. Gen., for respondent. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 13, 14]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner, a pennsylvania corporation, was formed in October 1927 as a result of a statutory consolidation or merger of three companies. Two of the constituent companies owned title search plants which were among the assets acquired by petitioner as a result of the consolidation. While it was known that two title plants would be acquired on the consolidation, there was at that time no definite plan for their disposition. But an immediate investigation was made and it was decided to store one of the plants in order to effect economies of operation. That was done substantially simultaneously with the consummation of the consolidation. About two months thereafter it was decided that the plant retained in use was adequate and that the one in storage would not be needed. Although for a brief period some slight use appears to have been made of the stored plant,1 it was not kept up to date by the addition of current recordings. As a result it had only a salvage value by October 31, 1928. Meanwhile, negotiations for its sale had been unsuccessful.\n In this action petitioner seeks a refund of income taxes for the fiscal year ended October 31, 1928, based on the refusal of the Collector of Internal Revenue to allow a deduction for obsolescence of this plant. It had been carried on the books of the constituent company at $275,000 and was brought into the consolidation at $800,000. The District Court, however, found that its value on March 1, 1913, was $1,000,000; on October 31, 1928, $125,000-making an actual loss of $875,000, which that court allowed as a deduction for obsolescence for the taxable year 1928. It accordingly allowed a refund. That judgment was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 3 Cir., 102 \n\n[309 \nU.S. 13, 15]\n\u00a0\n F.2d 582. We granted certiorari, \n308 \nU.S. 539\n, 60 S.Ct. 101, 84 L.Ed. --, because of the asserted conflict of that decision with Crooks v. Kansas City Title & Trust Co., 8 Cir., 46 F.2d 928.\n Sec. 23[k] of the Revenue Act of 1928, 45 Stat. 791, 26 U.S.C.A. Int. Rev.Code,  23(l), allows as a deduction from gross income a 'reasonable allowance for the exhaustion, wear and tear of property used in the trade or business, including a reasonable allowance for obsolescence.' Admittedly, if the deduction is allowed under this provision it must be for obsolescence, as there has been no exhaustion, wear or tear of the title plant within the meaning of the Act. Now it is true that in the popular sense a thing which is obsolete is one which is no longer used, a meaning which gives color to petitioner's claim for deduction since there is no question that the title plant here involved is no longer utilized to any degree whatsoever. But the term 'allowance for obsolescence', as used in the Act and in the Treasury Regulations, has a narrower or more technical meaning than that derived from the common, dictionary definition of obsolete. The Treasury Regulations2 state the cir- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 13, 16]\n\u00a0\n cumstances under which an allowance for obsolescence of physical property may be allowed, viz., where such property is 'being affected by economic conditions that will result in its being abandoned at a future date prior to the end of its normal useful life, so that depreciation deductions alone are insufficient to return the cost (or other basis) at the end of its economic term of usefulness.' This Court, without undertaking a comprehensive definition, has held that obsolescence for purposes of the revenue acts 'may arise from changes in the art, shifting of business centers, loss of trade, inadequacy, supersession, prohibitory laws, and other things which, apart from physical deterioration, operate to cause plant elements or the plant as a whole to suffer diminution in value.' United States Cartridge Co. v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 511, 516\n, 52 S.Ct. 243, 245. See, also, Burnet v. Niagara Falls Brewing Co., \n282 \nU.S. 648, 654\n, 51 S.Ct. 262, 264. Such specific examples illustrate the type of 'economic conditions' whose effect on physical property is recognized as obsolescence by the Treasury Regulations. Others could be mentioned which similarly cause or contribute to the relentless march of physical property to the junk pile. But in general, obsolescence under the Act connotes functional depreciation, as it does in accounting and engineering terminology. \n3\n More than non-use or disuse is necessary to establish it. \n4\n To be sure, reasons of economy may cause a management to discard a title plant either where it has become outmoded by improved devices or where it is acquired as a duplicate and therefore is useless. But not every deci- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 13, 17]\n\u00a0\n sion of management to abandon facilities or to discontinue their use gives rise to a claim for obsolescence. For obsolescence under the Act requires that the operative cause of the present or growing uselessness arise from external forces which make it desirable or imperative that the property be replaced. What those operative causes may be will be dependent on a wide variety of factual situations. 'New and modern methods' appear to have been one of the real causes of abandonment of the title plant in Crooks v. Kansas City Title & Trust Co., supra. Suffice it here to say that no such external causes are present, for the record shows little more than the desire of a management to eliminate one plant which was a needless duplication of another but which functionally was adequate. \n5\n The fact that fewer employees were required to operate the one retained than the one discarded is inconclusive here. For this is not the case of acquisition of a new plant to take the place of one outmoded or less efficient. Rather the conclusion is irresistible that the plant was discarded only as a proximate result of petitioner's voluntary action in acquiring excess capacity.\n In view of this conclusion, we do not reach respondent's further objections to allowance of this claim on grounds of obsolescence.\n But petitioner contends that in any event it has abandoned the plant and hence is entitled to a deduction under  23(f) of the 1928 Act, 26 U.S. C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  23(f), which allows a corporation to deduct 'losses sustained during the taxable year and not compensated for by insurance or otherwise.' Whether petitioner has satisfied those requirements we do not de- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 13, 18]\n\u00a0\n cide, for its claim for refund was based exclusively and solely on the ground that it was entitled to an allowance for obsolescence. Hence, in absence of a waiver by the government, Tucker v. Alexander, \n275 \nU.S. 228\n, 48 S.Ct. 45, or a proper amendment, petitioner is precluded in this suit from resting its claim on another ground. United States v. Felt & Tarrant Mfg. Co., \n283 \nU.S. 269\n, 51 S.Ct. 376. There has been no amendment and there are no facts establishing a waiver.\n Accordingly, the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS and Mr. Justice REED took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Evidence of use subsequent to the consolidation or merger is quite tenuous, the only specific instances occurring immediately prior to the actual consummation of the consolidation on October 31, 1927. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Treasury Regulations 74, Art. 206, promulgated under the Revenue Act of 1928, provide in full:\n'With respect to physical property the whole or any portion of which is clearly shown by the taxpayer as being affected by economic conditions that will result in its being abandoned at a future date prior to the end of its normal useful life, so that depreciation deductions alone are insufficient to return the cost (or other basis) at the end of its economic term of usefulness, a reasonable deduction for obsolescence, in addition to depreciation, may be allowed in accordance with the facts obtaining with respect to each item of property concerning which a claim for obsolescence is made. No deduction for obsolescence will be permitted merely because, in the opinion of a taxpayer, the property may become obsolete at some later date. This allowance will be confined to such portion of the property on which obsolescence is definitely shown to be sustained and can not be held applicable to an entire property unless all portions thereof are affected by the conditions to which obsolescence is found to be due.'

Patton, both of Cleveland, Ohio, Joseph W. Henderson, of Philadelphia, Pa., and Mortimer S. Gordon, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Robert H. Jackson, Atty. Gen., and Thomas E. Harris, of Washington D.C., for respondent, National Labor Relations Board.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The National Labor Relations Board, finding that the Republic Steel Corporation had engaged in unfair labor practices in violation of Section 8(1), 8(2) and 8(3) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  158( 1-3), ordered the company to desist from these practices, to withdraw recognition from a labor organization found to be dominated by the company, and to reinstate certain employees, with back pay, found to have been discriminatorily discharged or denied reinstatement. The Board, in providing for back pay, directed the company to deduct from the payments to the reinstated employees the amounts they had received for work performed upon 'work relief projects' and to pay over such amounts to the appropriate governmental agencies. Except for a modification, not now important, the Circuit Court of Appeals directed enforcement of the Board's order. 3 Cir., 107 F.2d 472. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 7, 9]\n\u00a0\n In view of conflict with decisions in National Labor Relations Board v. Leviton Manufacturing Co., 2 Cir., 111 F.2d 619 and National Labor Relations Board v. Tovrea Packing Co., 9 Cir., 111 F.2d 626, we granted certiorari limited to the question whether the Board had authority to require the company to make the described payments to the agencies of the Government. \n310 \nU.S. 655\n, 60 S.Ct. 1072\n\n\n The amounts earned by the employees before reinstatement were directed to be deducted from their back pay manifestly because, having already been received, these amounts were not needed to make the employees whole. That principle would apply whether the employees had earned the amounts in public or private employment. Further, there is no question that the amounts paid by the governmental agencies were for services actually performed. Presumably these agencies, and through them the public, received the benefit of services reasonably worth the amounts paid. There is no finding to the contrary.\n The Board urges that the work relief program was designed to meet the exigency of large-scale unemployment produced by the depression; that projects had been selected, not with a single eye to costs or usefulness, but with a view to providing the greatest amount of employment in order to serve the needs of unemployed workers in various communities; in short, that the Work Projects Administration has been conducted as a means of dealing with the relief problem. Hence it is contended that the Board could properly conclude that the unfair labor practices of the company had occasioned losses to the Government financing the work relief projects.\n The payments to the Federal, State, County, or other governments concerned are thus conceived as being required for the purpose of redressing, not an injury to \n\n[311 \nU.S. 7, 10]\n\u00a0\n the employees, but an injury to the public,-an injury thought to be not the less sustained although here the respective governments have received the benefit of the services performed. So conceived, these required payments are in the nature of penalties imposed by law upon the employer,- the Board acting as the legislative agency in providing that sort of sanction by reason of public interest. We need not pause to pursue the application of this theory of the Board's power to a variety of circumstances where community interests might be asserted. The question is,- Has Congress conferred the power upon the Board to impose such requirements.\n We think that the theory advanced by the Board proceeds upon a misconception of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq. The Act is essentially remedial. It does not carry a penal program declaring the described unfair labor practices to be crimes. The Act does not prescribe penalties or fines in vindication of public rights or provide indemnity against community losses as distinguished from the protection and compensation of employees. Had Congress been intent upon such a program, we cannot doubt that Congress would have expressed its intent and would itself have defined its retributive scheme.\n The remedial purposes of the Act are quite clear. It is aimed, as the Act says (Section 1) at encouraging the practice and procedure of collective bargaining and at protecting the exercise by workers of full freedom of association, of self-organization and of negotiating the terms and conditions of their employment or other mutual aid or protection through their freely chosen representatives. This right of the employees is safeguarded through the authority conferred upon the Board to require the employer to desist from the unfair labor practices described and to leave the employees free to organize and choose their representatives. They are thus protected from coercion and interference in the formation \n\n[311 \nU.S. 7, 11]\n\u00a0\n of labor organizations and from discriminatory discharge. Whether the Act has been violated by the employer-whether there has been an unfair labor practice-is a matter for the Board to determine upon evidence. When it does so determine the Board can require the employer to disestablish organizations created in violation of the Act; it can direct the employer to bargain with those who appear to be the chosen representatives of the employees and it can require that such employees as have been discharged in violation of the Act be reinstated with back pay. All these measures relate to the protection of the employees and the redress of their grievances, not to the redress of any supposed public injury after the employees have been made secure in their right of collective bargaining and have been made whole.\n As the sole basis for the claim of authority to go further and to demand payments to governments, the Board relies on the language of Section 10(c) which provides that if upon evidence the Board finds that the person against whom the complaint is lodged has engaged in an unfair labor practice, the Board shall issue an order-'requiring such person to cease and desist from such unfair labor practice, and to take such affirmative action, including reinstatement of employees with or without back pay, as will effectuate the policies of this Act (chapter)'.\n This language should be construed in harmony with the spirit and remedial purposes of the Act. We do not think that Congress intended to vest in the Board a virtually unlimited discretion to devise punitive measures, and thus to prescribe penalties or fines which the Board may think would effectuate the policies of the Act. We have said that 'this authority to order affirmative action does not go so far as to confer a punitive jurisdiction enabling the Board to inflict upon the employer any penalty it may choose because he is engaged in unfair \n\n[311 \nU.S. 7, 12]\n\u00a0\n labor practices, even though the Board be of the opinion that the policies of the Act might be effectuated by such an order'. We have said that the power to command affirmative action is remedial, not punitive. Consolidated Edison Company v. National Labor Relations Board, \n305 \nU.S. 197, 235\n, 236 S., 59 S.Ct. 206, 219. See, also, National Labor Relations Board v. Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines, \n303 \nU.S. 261, 267\n, 268 S., 58 S.Ct. 571, 574, 575, 115 A.L.R. 307. We adhere to that construction.\n In that view, it is not enough to justify the Board's requirements to say that they would have the effect of deterring persons from violating the Act. That argument proves too much, for if such a deterrent effect is sufficient to sustain an order of the Board, it would be free to set up any system of penalties which it would deem adequate to that end.\n We think that affirmative action to 'effectuate the policies of this Act (chapter)' is action to achieve the remedial objectives which the Act sets forth. Thus the employer may be required not only to end his unfair labor practices; he may also be directed affirmatively to recognize an organization which is found to be the duly chosen bargaining- representative of his employees; he may be ordered to cease particular methods of interference, intimidation or coercion, to stop recognizing and to disestablish a particular labor organization which he dominates or supports, to restore and make whole employees who have been discharged in violation of the Act, to give appropriate notice of his compliance with the Board's order, and otherwise to take such action as will assure to his employees the rights which the statute undertakes to safeguard. These are all remedial measures. To go further and to require the employer to pay to governments what they have paid to employees for services rendered to them is an exaction neither to make the employees whole nor to assure that they can bargain collectively with the employer through representatives of \n\n[311 \nU.S. 7, 13]\n\u00a0\n their own choice. We find no warrant in the policies of the Act for such an exaction.\n In truth, the reasons assigned by the Board for the requirement in question-reasons which relate to the nature and purpose of work relief projects and to the practice and aims of the Works Project Administration- indicate that its order is not directed to the appropriate effectuating of the policies of the National Labor Relations Act, but to the effectuating of a distinct and broader policy with respect to unemployment. The Board has made its requirement in an apparent effort to provide adjustments between private employment and public work relief, and to carry out supposed policies in relation to the latter. That is not the function of the Board. It has not been assigned a role in relation to losses conceived to have been sustained by communities or governments in connection with work relief projects. The function of the Board in this case was to assure to petitioner's employees the right of collective bargaining through their representatives without interference by petitioner and to make good to the employees what they had lost through the discriminatory discharge.\n We hold that the additional provision requiring the payments to governmental agencies was beyond the Board's authority, and to that extent the decree below enforcing the Board's order is modified and the cause is remanded with directions to enter a decree enforcing the Board's order with that provision eliminated. It is so ordered.\n Modified and remanded, with directions.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration and decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice DOUGLAS.\n It might fairly be implied by the words 'reinstatement of employees with or without back pay' that the \n\n[311 \nU.S. 7, 14]\n\u00a0\n employees must themselves be the recipients of the back pay. Were the opinion based on that ground we would acquiesce. But the judgment here does not rest upon such an interpretation. The holding appears to be on the broad ground that the Board may not require full back pay, even to a wrongfully discharged employee, if he has received pay for services performed on a governmental relief project provided exclusively for the needy unemployed. With this conclusion we cannot agree.\n The statute commands that the Board must order 'back pay' if the policy of the Act will thereby be effectuated. At least two persons are immediately involved in 'back pay', as here used; one who pays and one who receives. The propriety of a 'back pay' order as an instrumentality for effectuating the Act's policies, must therefore be determined by the manner in which it influences the payor and payee, one, or both. The central policy of the Act is protection to employees from employer interference, intimidation and coercion in relation to unionization and collective bargaining. We cannot doubt but that a back pay order as applied to the employer will effectually aid in safeguarding these rights. We believe, as did the Board and the court below, that it may well be said that the policies of the Act will be effectuated by denying to an offending employer the opportunity of shifting to government relief agencies the burden of supporting his wrongfully discharged employees. The knowledge that he may be called upon to pay out the wages his employees would have earned but for their wrongful discharge, regardless of any assistance government may have rendered them during their unemployment, might well be a factor in inducing an employer to comply with the Act.\n And the construction of the provision for back pay is not helped by labeling the Act's purpose or the Board's action as either 'punitive' or 'remedial.' The 'back \n\n[311 \nU.S. 7, 15]\n\u00a0\n pay' provision is clear and unambiguous. Hence, it is enough here for us to determine what Congress meant from what it said.\n Nor is there substance to the expressed fear that complete acceptance of the words as Congress wrote them would vest unlimited discretion in the Board, because it would not. That discretion is narrowly limited, by the fact that as to 'back pay' the Board can in no instance award any greater sum than 'back pay' for the period in which the employee was absent from his employer's services by reason of his employer's violation of the law. \n\n\n\n","102":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRUSSELL v.

Petitioners, among other defense, pleaded the New York three-year statute of limitations. Section 49(4), N.Y.Civil Practice Act. The District Court found, as is conceded here, that the cause of action accrued April 6, 1928; that plaintiffs in the suit had notice of its accrual on April 15, 1928, and that the suit was commenced three years and eight months later, on December 16, 1931. It overruled the plea of limitations and gave judgment for respondents. D.C., 1 F.Supp. 788; D.C., 20 F.Supp. 930, 936. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, 104 F.2d 169.\n Both courts, holding that the suit was exclusively within the equity jurisdiction of the court, ruled that the doctrine of laches and not the state statute of limitations was applicable, and held that respondents had not been guilty of laches. We granted certiorari October 16, 1939, limited to the question of the application of the New York statute, upon a petition which challenged the decision below as in conflict with the decisions of this Court applying the three-year statute of limitations in a suit to enforce the liability of stockholders of a state bank in Platt v. Wilmot, \n193 \nU.S. 602\n, 24 S.Ct. 542; cf. as to liability of stockholders of national banks, McDonald v. Thompson, \n184 \nU.S. 71\n, 22 S.Ct. 297; McClaine v. Rankin, \n197 \nU.S. 154\n, 25 S.Ct. 410, 3 Ann.Cas. 500. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 280, 285]\n\u00a0\n Section 16 of the Federal Farm Loan Act provides that the shareholders of every joint stock land bank 'shall be held individually responsible, equally and ratably, and not one for another, for all ... debts ... of such bank to the extent of the amount of stock owned by them at the par value thereof ....' Unlike the comparable provisions of the National Bank Act, R.S.  5151, 5234, 12 U.S.C.  63, 192, 12 U.S.C. A.  63, 192, which authorize the receiver of a national bank to enforce the liability of stockholders of an insolvent national bank assessed against them by the Comptroller of the Currency, this section of the Federal Farm Loan Act confers no power on the receiver of a farm loan bank to levy an assessment on the stockholders of an insolvent bank or to maintain a suit to enforce their liability. Wheeler v. Greene, \n280 \nU.S. 49\n, 50 S.Ct. 21; Christopher v. Brusselbank, \n302 \nU.S. 500, 502\n, 58 S.Ct. 350, 351; Brusselback v. Cago Corporation, 2 Cir., 85 F.2d 20.\n As the liability of the stockholders as prescribed by this section is to pay 'equally and ratably', the sole remedy is by plenary representative suit brought in equity in behalf of all creditors of the bank, in which the existence and extent of insolvency, and the ratable shares of the contribution by shareholders can be ascertained and an equitable distribution made of the fund recovered. But this amount cannot be determined and its distribution effected without resort to the procedures traditionally employed by equity upon a bill for an accounting and for the distribution of a fund brought into its custody. No stockholder is liable for more than his proportion of the debts not exceeding the par value of his stock. His proportion can be ascertained only upon an accounting of the debts and of the stock and a pro rata distribution of the liability among the shareholders and of the proceeds of recovery among the creditors. Such a suit during its progress and at its conclusion by a final decree of distribution requires the exercise of powers which are pecu- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 280, 286]\n\u00a0\n liarly those of a court of equity to bring before it in a single suit all the necessary parties to ascertain their rights and liabilities, and to adjust and settle them by its decrees. Pollard v. Bailey, 20 Wall. 520; Terry v. Little, \n101 \nU.S. 216\n; Richmond v. Irons, \n121 \nU.S. 27\n, 7 S.Ct. 788; Christopher v. Brusselback, supra.\n When the receiver or officer performing like functions is authorized by statute to assess the shareholders, the assessment is binding on them by reason of their membership in the corporation, and each shareholder then becomes liable in a suit at law for the amount of the assessment. See Christopher v. Brusselback, supra, 302 U.S. at page 503, 58 S.Ct. at page 352, and cases cited. It is for this reason that there is a divergence between the procedure for recovering assessments of shareholders of national banks, and that for enforcing the liability of shareholders in a federal land bank. In the latter case there is no legal remedy, the relief being afforded exclusively in equity. The test of the inadequacy of the legal remedy prerequisite to resort to a federal court of equity is the legal remedy which federal rather than state courts afford. Di Giovanni v. Camden Fire Insurance Ass'n, \n296 \nU.S. 64\n, 56 S.Ct. 1; Atlas Life Insurance Co. v. Southern, Inc., \n306 \nU.S. 563\n, 59 S.Ct. 657. And the jurisdiction of federal courts of equity, as determined by that test, is neither enlarged nor diminished by the names given to remedies or the distinction made between them by state practice. Stratton v. St. Louis S.W.R., \n284 \nU.S. 530, 534\n, 52 S.Ct. 222, 223.\n The present suit is not any the less in equity because it turns out that the liability of the shareholders equals the full par value of their stock. The amount of the liability could not be determined and assessed without an accounting of assets and liabilities, and distribution could not be effected among creditors without resort to the power traditionally that of a court of equity to make its determination of the rights of the parties effective \n\n[309 \nU.S. 280, 287]\n\u00a0\n through its decrees in personam. Here the decree directs payment into court of the amount found to be due, for distribution among the creditors in conformity to the further order of the court.\n The suit being in equity, brought in a federal District Court, the question decisive of this case is what lapse of time will bar recovery in the absence of an applicable federal statute of limitations. The Rules of Decision Act does not apply to suits in equity. Section 34 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 28 U.S.C.  725, 28 U.S.C.A.  725, directing that the 'laws of the several states' 'shall be regarded as rules of decision' in the courts of the United States, applies only to the rules of decision in 'trials at common law' in such courts, but applies as well to rules established by judicial decision in the states as those established by statute. Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n, 58 S.Ct. 817, 114 A.L.R. 1487.\n From the beginning, equity, in the absence of any statute of limitations made applicable to equity suits, has provided its own rule of limitations through the doctrine of laches, the principle that equity will not aid a plaintiff whose unexcused delay, if the suit were allowed, would be prejudicial to the defendant. Wagner v. Baird, 7 How. 234, 258; Stearns v. Page, 7 How. 819, 828, 829; Philippi v. Philippe, \n115 \nU.S. 151, 153\n, 157 S., 5 S.Ct. 1181; United States v. Beebe, \n127 \nU.S. 338\n, 8 S.Ct. 1083; Curtner v. United States, \n149 \nU.S. 662, 676\n, 13 S.Ct. 985, 990, 1041; Alsop v. Riker, \n155 \nU.S. 448, 460\n, 15 S.Ct. 162, 166; Abraham v. Ordway, \n158 \nU.S. 416, 420\n, 15 S.Ct. 894, 895. In the application of the doctrine of laches it recognized that prejudice may arise from delay alone, so prolonged that in the normal course of events evidence is lost or obscured, and the English Court of Chancery early adopted the rule, followed in the federal courts, that suits to assert equitable interests in real estate will, without more, be barred after the lapse of twenty years when ejectment or the right of entry for the assertion of a comparable legal interest in the land would be barred. Elmendorf v. Taylor, 10 \n\n[309 \nU.S. 280, 288]\n\u00a0\n Wheat. 152, 173; Hovenden v. Lord Annesly, 2 Sch. & Lef. 607. And where resort was had to equity in aid of a legal right, equity, following the law, would refuse its aid if the legal right had been barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Carrol v. Green, \n92 \nU.S. 509\n; Godden v. Kimmell, \n99 \nU.S. 201\n, 210; Wood v. Carpenter, \n101 \nU.S. 135\n; Philippi v. Philippe, supra; McDonald v. Thompson, supra; Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence (4th Ed.),  1441, and cases cited.\n In federal courts of equity the doctrine of laches was early supplemented by the rule that when the question is of lapse of time barring relief in equity, such courts, even though not regarding themselves as bound by state statutes of limitations, will nevertheless, when consonant with equitable principles, adopt and apply as their own, the local statute of limitations applicable to the equitable causes of action in the judicial district in which the case is heard. Bacon v. Howard, 20 How. 22, 26; Clarke v. Boorman's Executors, 18 Wall. 493, 505, 506; Boone County v. Burlington, etc. R.R. Co., \n139 \nU.S. 684, 692\n, 11 S.Ct. 687, 689; Pearsall v. Smith, \n149 \nU.S. 231, 233\n, 237 S., 13 S.Ct. 833, 835; Benedict v. City of New York, \n250 \nU.S. 321\n, 39 S.Ct. 476.1 \n\n[309 \nU.S. 280, 289]\n\u00a0\n Even though there is no state statute applicable to similar equitable demands, when the jurisdiction of the federal court is concurrent with that of law, or the suit is brought in aid of a legal right, equity will withhold its remedy if the legal right is barred by the local statute of limitations. It thus stays its hand in aid of a legal right which, under the Rules of Decision Act, would be unenforcible in the federal courts of law as well as in the state courts. Wilson v. Koontz, 7 Cranch 202, 205, 206; Michoud v. Girod, 4 How, 503, 561; Stearns v. Page, 7 How. 819; Clarke v. Boorman's Executors, supra, 18 Wall. 505; Carrol v. Green, supra; Godfrey v.

Thompson, supra; Hughes v. Reed, 10 Cir., 46 F.2d 435; cf. Wagner v. Baird, 7 How. 234; Godden v. Kimmell, supra; Wood v. Carpenter, supra.\n But where the equity jurisdiction is exclusive and is not exercised in aid or support of a legal right, state statutes of limitations barring actions at law are inapplicable, and in the absence of any state statute barring the equitable remedy in like cases, the federal court is remitted to and applies the doctrine of laches as controlling. Wagner v. Baird, supra, 7 How. 234, 258; Badger v. Badger, 2 Wall. 87, 94, 95; Kirby v. Lake Shore & Michigan Southern R. Co., \n120 \nU.S. 130, 139\n, 7 S.Ct. 430, 435; Metropolitan Bank v. St. Louis Dispatch Co., supra, \n149 \nU.S. 436, 448\n, 13 S.Ct. 944, 948; Speidel v. Henrici, \n120 \nU.S. 377, 386\n, 387 S., 7 S.Ct. 610, 611, 612; see Southern Pacific Co. v. Boegert, \n250 \nU.S. 483\n, 39 S.Ct. 533, where no statute of limitations was pleaded; Id., 2 Cir., 244 F. 61, 65. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 280, 290]\n\u00a0\n The question remains whether the court below correctly held that the doctrine of laches and not the local three-year statute of limitations is controlling. The present suit being, as we have seen and as the court below held, exclusively of equitable cognizance, in that it is not predicated upon any legal cause of action, the statute is not one which a federal court of equity will adopt and apply as a substitute for or a supplement to its own doctrine of laches, unless it is applied to like causes of action in the state courts.\n The present suit was brought in less than four years after the cause of action had accrued, and it is conceded that the cause of action is not barred unless by the three-year statute. Section 49 of the Civil Practice Act provides that 'the following actions must be commenced within three years after the cause of action has accrued:\n'4. An action against a director or stockholder of a moneyed corporation, or banking association ... to enforce a liability created by the common law or by statute. The cause of action is not deemed to have accrued until the discovery by the plaintiff of the facts under which ... the liability was created.' This Court has recognized that this statute is a bar to actions at law and has so applied it in suits to recover assessments on shareholders of a bank. See Platt v. Wilmot, supra.\n\n Respondents, admitting that the statute is a bar to suits at law, argue that it is inapplicable to suits in equity and that when the remedy at law is so inadequate that resort must be had to remedies which are traditionally equitable, the limitation is not that of the three-year but of the ten-year statute, which is made applicable to all actions for which no limitation is otherwise specially prescribed.  53, N.Y.Civil Practice Act.\n At the outset we are confronted with those cases in which this Court in McDonald v. Thompson, supra, and \n\n[309 \nU.S. 280, 291]\n\u00a0\n the state courts2 have recognized and applied the statutory bar to an action at law to equity suits brought in aid of the legal right to recover an assessment upon stockholders. But as we have seen, those cases are referable to the doctrine accepted and applied in the federal courts of equity that equity does not give relief predicated on a legal right which the statute has barred.\n Here the jurisdiction being exclusively in equity to enforce rights cognizable only in equity, statutes barring legal causes of action, as we have seen, are not controlling and we turn to the argument of petitioners that the three-year statute is a bar as well to such suits brought in the state courts, even though they are suits in which it is necessary to resort to remedies which are exclusively or traditionally equitable.\n The precise question thus raised appears not to have been decided by the New York Court of Appeals. In Mencher v. Richards, 256 App.Div. 280, 9 N.Y.S.2d 990, which was a stockholders' suit brought against directors of a moneyed corporation for an accounting for profits gained through their malfeasance in office, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court held that the three-year statute did not apply. It pointed out that the statute relates only to causes of action for which a money judgment will suffice and not to suits which, al- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 280, 292]\n\u00a0\n though specifically within the language of the statute, require resort to the equitable remedy for an accounting, and that as to them the ten-year statute applies. In so construing the statute, it followed the rulings of the Court of Appeals that under the New York statutory scheme of limitations, suits in equity brought against corporate directors for an accounting for want of an adequate legal remedy are governed by the ten- year statute of limitations and not statutes fixing a shorter period of limitations which would be applicable if the suit were at law. Hanover Fire Insurance Co. v. Morse Dry Dock & Repair Co., 270 N.Y. 86, 200 N.E. 589; Potter v. Walker, 276 N.Y. 15, 11 N.E.2d 335; 3 Cf. Gilmore v. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 280, 293]\n\u00a0\n Ham, 142 N.Y. 1, 36 N.E. 826, 40 Am.St. Rep. 554; Treadwell v. Clark, 190 N.Y. 51, 82 N.E. 505.\n In the absence of a definitive ruling by the highest court of the state, we accept the decision of the Appellate Division and the reasoning of the Court of Appeals upon which it rests as persuasive that the three- year statute does not apply to suits like the present where the remedy is exclusively equitable. See Wichita Royalty Co. v. City Bank, \n306 \nU.S. 103, 107\n, 59 S.Ct. 420.\n We take it that in the absence of a controlling act of Congress federal courts of equity, in enforcing rights arising under statutes of the United States, will without reference to the Rules of Decision Act, adopt and apply local statutes of limitations which are applied to like causes of action by the state courts. Cf. Mason v. United States, \n260 \nU.S. 545\n, 43 S.Ct. 200; Jackson County v. United States, \n308 \nU.S. 343\n, 60 S.Ct. 285, this term. In thus giving effect to state statutes of limitations as a substitute or supplement for the equitable doctrine of laches, it must appear with reasonable certainty that there is a state statute applicable to like causes of action. As that does not appear here with respect to the three-year statute, the court be- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 280, 294]\n\u00a0\n low rightly declined to give effect to that statute and as it found that the cause of action was not barred by laches, it rightly gave judgment for respondents.\n Petitioners argue that under New York law, laches is not a defense to actions like the present and that in the light of our decisions in Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, supra, Ruhlin v. New York Life Insurance Co., \n304 \nU.S. 202\n, 58 S.Ct. 860, federal courts in the exercise of the equity jurisdiction conferred upon them by section 24 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  41, 28 U.S.C.A.  41, are no longer free to apply a different rule. But in this case laches has not bee held to be a defense and the Court has not declined to give effect to a state statute shown to be applicable. In the circumstances we have no occasion to consider the extent to which federal courts, in the exercise of the authority conferred upon them by Congress to administer equitable remedies, are bound to follow state statutes and decisions affecting those remedies.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS is of opinion that the judgment should be reversed for the reasons stated in the dissenting opinion of Clark, Circuit Judge, in the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n Mr. Justice MURPHY took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] But federal courts of equity have not always held themselves bound to follow local statutes which, in ordinary circumstances, they could adopt and apply by analogy. In each case the refusal has been placed upon the ground of special equitable doctrines, making it inequitable to apply the statute. Laches may bar equitable remedy before the local statute has run.

Y. 86, 200 N.E. 589, the Court of Appeals declared 270 N.Y. at pages 89, 90, 200 N.E. at page 590:\n'In an action in equity the ten-year limitation prescribed by section 53 of the Civil Practice Act is applicable unless, in a particular action, a party has a choice of two remedies, one at law, the other in equity, both complete and adequate, and he selects the action in equity. In that event the party whose cause of action would be barred under the six-year statute, if he should elect to proceed at law, may not enlarge this time by electing to proceed in equity. Such is the rule where the remedies are concurrent. Rundle v. Allison, 34 N.Y. 180; Keys v. Leopold, 241 N.Y. 189, 149 N.E. 828; Clarke v. Boorman's Executors, 18 Wall. 493, 85 U.S. (493).\n\n'The exception is not applicable in cases of concurrent jurisdiction, however, if a party's remedy at law is inadequate and imperfect and he is required to go into equity to procure complete and adequate relief. Rundle v. Allison, supra; Mann v. Fairchild, 14 Barb. 548.\n\n'If relief may be had at law in an action for damages and in equity for rescission of a contract on the ground of fraud with a reconveyance of land and an accounting for profits, the action in equity is subject to the ten-year limitation though the action for damages is barred under the six- year statute. Schenck v. State Line Telephone Co., 238 N.Y. 308, 144 N.E. 592, 35 A.L.R. 1149.'\n\n In Potter v. Walker, 276 N.Y. 15, 11 N.E.2d 335, the court said, 276 N.Y. at pages 25, 26, 11 N.E.2d at page 337: 'In respect to those causes of action by which is sought to recover profits received by directors by reason of wrongful acts, an action at law would not afford adequate relief. To the extent that an accounting is necessary, the right and the remedy must necessarily be of an equitable nature. The Appellate Division is therefore clearly right in applying the ten-year statute of limitations as to such causes of action. Civil Practice Act,  53; Hanover Fire Ins. Co. v. Morse Dry Dock & Repair Co., 270 N.Y. 86, 200 N.E. 589.'\n Wright v. Russell, 269 N.Y. 683, 245 App.Div. 708, 281 N.Y.S. 994; Id ., 155 Misc. 877, 280 N.Y.S. 614, and Reisman v. Hall, 257 App.Div. 892, 12 N.Y.S.2d 442, cited by petitioner, do not qualify this doctrine. There, although representative actions were brought, the Illinois constitution under which the liability arose had been interpreted as permitting actions at law, Golden v. Cervenka, 278 Ill. 409, 116 N.E. 273. Since the legal action would have been barred within three years, the court, as in McDonald v. Thompson, \n184 \nU.S. 71\n, 22 S.Ct. 297, and consistently with Potter v. Walker, supra, applied the same period to the equitable action founded upon it. \n\n\n\n\n","103":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSANCHO v. TEXAS CO.(1940)\nNo. 132\nArgued: December 11, 1939Decided: January 2, 1940\n\n\n\n\n[308 \nU.S. 463, 464]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wm. Cattron Rigby, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Jerrold H. Ruskin and Lionel P. Marks, both of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent brought this action in a Puerto Rico court to enjoin the Treasurer of Puerto Rico from enforcing by distraint, orders of the Puerto Rico Workmen's Relief Commission awarding compensation for the death of each of three laborers while in the employ of respondent. The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico interpreted the Workmen's Accident Compensation Act of Puerto Rico1 as not permitting such collateral attack on orders of the Commission and affirmed a judgment dismissing the bill. 52 D.P.R. 658, 53 D.P.R. 475. On appeal (43 Stat. 936, 28 U.S.C.A.  225) the Circuit Court of Appeals vacated that judgment and remanded the cause with directions to issue the in- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 463, 465]\n\u00a0\n junction. 1 Cir., 102 F.2d 710. We granted certiorari, \n308 \nU.S. 538\n, 60 S. Ct. 85, 84 L.Ed. --, because of the asserted violation by the Circuit Court of Appeals of the well established rule that Puerto Rican tribunals must not be overruled on their construction of local statutes in absence of 'clear or manifest error.' Sancho v. Yabucoa Sugar Co., \n306 \nU.S. 505\n, \n307 \nU.S. 613\n, 59 S.Ct. 626, 629.\n The theory underlying respondent's bill was that it was an insured employer and therefore the awards should have been said out of the state fund,2 and that its remedy at law was not adequate. The bill so alleged, and attacked the orders of the Commission adjudging that it was not an insured employer. The cause was submitted, without an answer, on a stipulation which included, inter alia, an admission by petitioner of 'the ultimate facts of the bill, except the conclusions of fact or of law that it might contain.' The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico in effect treated this stipulation as a demurrer and concluded that petitioner had not thereby admitted that respondent was an insured employer. This seems to have been a reasonable construction-certainly not manifest error.\n Treating the bill then as one brought by an uninsured employer, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico construed the Act on two points: (1) the right of respondent to appeal; (2) the power of petitioner to distrain.\n Right to Appeal. It held that respondent had an adequate remedy at law under  9 of the Act which provided that 'the employer may appeal from any decision of the commission when such decision is to the effect that the accident is one for which compensation is granted under this Act.' \n3\n And it indicated that on such appeal the \n\n[308 \nU.S. 463, 466]\n\u00a0\n question of whether or not respondent was uninsured was among the issues which could have been reviewed. \n4\n The Commission, however, had directed the awards to the Attorney General on April 24, 1928, for collection under  7 of the Act, a section providing for collection of awards against uninsured employers. \n5\n But eight years passed and the Attorney General made no attempt to collect. Respondent contended that it did not appeal under  9 since it was waiting to defend, on the ground that it was insured, an action by the Attorney General under  7. And though a new method of collection of such awards was created within a few months after these awards were made,6 respondent contended that the new law, in pro- \n\n[308 \nU.S. 463, 467]\n\u00a0\n viding that pending litigation was not to be affected,7 preserved its former opportunity to defend under  7. To this the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico replied that the purpose of the saving clause in the new act8 was merely to preserve the rights of workmen to compensation, not to make the new procedure inapplicable to pending cases in contradiction to the well settled rule that procedural statutes are immediately applicable. It also added that in any event the procedure of  7 had not survived the issuance of the order by the Commission since by the 1935 amendment that procedure was to be 'followed in such litigations or claims, until their termination'9-the issuance of the orders of the Commission having terminated the case within the meaning of the amendment. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 463, 468]\n\u00a0\n The Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed with this construction of the Act. It held that  9 gave an appeal only to insured employers and that only  7 provided for review of orders issued against those who were uninsured. It said that when  9 stated that 'the employer may appeal from any decision of the commission when such decision is to the effect that the accident is one for which compensation is granted under this Act', it meant that only insured employers could appeal since the compensation granted by the Act was payment out of the state fund. \n10\n Hence, in its view, the orders of the Commission here in question were 'to the effect' that the accident was not one for which compensation was granted under the Act, since the Commission had adjudged respondent to be uninsured. Consistently with that construction it held that the remedy of an aggrieved uninsured employer was to defend any suit brought under  7. For in its view, the procedure under  7 was not abolished by the amendments, the issuance of the orders of the Commission not having terminated the case within the meaning of the saving clause quoted above. Accordingly, it held that unless petitioner were restrained from collecting the awards, respondent would be deprived of its day in court.\n Power of Petitioner to Distrain. The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico concluded that petitioner had the power \n\n[308 \nU.S. 463, 469]\n\u00a0\n to distrain by virtue of the amendments to the Act made subsequent to the issuance of the orders of award. By the 1928 amendments11 summary procedure was authorized for collection of a claim 'as if it were a tax levied on such property'.  25. Although that phrase was eliminated by the 1935 amendments,  15 of the latter made such claims 'liens preferred over any other charge or lien for taxes or any other cause' with specified exceptions. \n12\n The court held that since under both the 1928 and 1935 amendments petitioner had the duty to collect the claims and since under both the claim had the status or legal effect of a tax, the power to distrain survived.\n But the Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed with that conclusion. It reasoned that petitioner had no power to collect in that manner since by  15 of the 1935 amendments the person who was to 'determine' the amount of the claim and 'certify its decision'13 to petitioner was the Manager of the State Fund created under that law. \n14\n That person not being the same as the Workmen's Relief Commission which had issued the orders in question,  15 was not operative as respects respondent. This reasoning \n\n[308 \nU.S. 463, 470]\n\u00a0\n was interwoven with the conclusion of that court that the new procedure provided by the 1928 and 1935 amendments15 did not reach back to touch pending cases, a result contrary to the opinion of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, as we have noted.\n The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, on the other hand, did not reach the precise point determinative of the power of the Manager of the State Fund to certify an award of the former Workmen's Relief Commission apparently because it was tacitly admitted that that power existed,16 if the remedy provided by former section 7 had been abolished. But however that may be, it did conclude that the Act as amended, though not clear, was designed to give the petitioner power to distrain and that the procedure followed was authorized by law.\n For over sixty years this Court has consistently recognized the deference due interpretations of local law by such local courts unless they appeared to be clearly wrong. From Sweeney v. Lomme, 22 Wall. 208, decided in 1874, to Sancho Bonet v. Yabucoa Sugar Co., supra, decided in 1939, repeated admonitions to that effect have been given. That rule is founded on sound policy. \n17\n As this court \n\n[308 \nU.S. 463, 471]\n\u00a0\n recently stated, 'Orderly development of the government of Porto Rico as an integral part of our governmental system is well served by a careful and consistent adherence to the legislative and judicial policy of deferring to the local procedure and tribunals of the Island.' Sancho Bonet v. Yabucoa Sugar Co., supra, 306 U.S. page 510, 59 S.Ct. page 629.\n We now repeat once more that admonition. And we add that mere lip service to that rule is not enough. To reverse a judgment of a Puerto Rican tribunal on such a local matter as the interpretation of an act of the local legislature, it would not be sufficient if we or the Circuit Court of Appeals merely disagreed with that interpretation. Nor would it be enough that the Puerto Rican tribunal chose what might seem, on appeal, to be the less reasonable of two possible interpretations. And such judgment of reversal would not be sustained here even though we felt that of several possible interpretations that of the Circuit Court of Appeals was the most reasonable one. For to justify reversal in such cases, the error must be clear or manifest; the interpretation must be inescapably wrong; the decision must be patently erroneous.\n Measured by such a test the judgment of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico should not have been reversed. In concluding that under  9 an uninsured employer could have an award of the Commission reviewed, including the issue of whether or not he was insured, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico did not take a patently absurd position. \n\n[308 \nU.S. 463, 472]\n\u00a0\n The most that can be said is that the contrary position is a tenable one. In holding that the amendments substituted collection by the petitioner for collection by the Attorney General even in case of pending claims, that tribunal did not commit manifest error. The conclusion that the latter procedure survived the amendments is merely another possible view. And the decision of that tribunal that the petitioner had the power to distrain18 cannot be said to be inescapably wrong in view of the legislative design to leave no hiatus in the statutory scheme as a result of cumulative amendments. The contrary conclusion, though it might seem wholly reasonable, would not warrant a reversal.\n Intimations that respondent was not accorded due process of law and that the question of whether or not it was insured was a jurisdictional fact open to collateral attack are untenable. According to the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, respondent had not only an opportunity to be heard before the Commission but also a right of appeal. The fact that the period for review by appeal was very limited and that on respondent's interpretation of the law its right to appeal was uncertain are immaterial. Here, as on other aspects of this case, we cannot say that the conclusion of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico that under this statute the remedy of respondent at law was adequate is obviously erroneous.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico is affirmed. It is so ordered.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice STONE did not participate in the consideration or disposition of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act No. 102, 1925, as amended by Act No. 85, 1928 and Act No. 45, 1935. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] As to the creation of that fund, see  11, 27 of Act No. 102, 1925. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Act No. 102, 1925,  9.

The court held that the writ did not lie since it applied only to review the actions of courts. 40 P.R.R. 456. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] Sec. 7 of Act No. 102, 1925, provided in part:\n'In the case of an accident to a laborer while working for an employer who in violation of the law is uninsured, the Workmen's Relief Commission shall determine proper compensation, plus expenses incurred by it, and shall report the same to the Attorney General for institution of proper action, in a court of competent jurisdiction, against said employer to recover the aforesaid sum; Provided, however, That the commission shall grant the employer as well as the laborer in the case an opportunity to be heard and to defend themselves, and shall conform, as far as possible, to the practices observed by the courts of justice.' \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Act No. 85, 1928, became effective ninety days after its approval on May 14, 1928.  58. This Act by  7 created an Industrial Commission to administer the Act. And by  25 collection of claims against uninsured employers was provided as follows:\n'In case of an accident to a laborer while working for an employer who in violation of the law is uninsured, the Industrial Commission shall determine proper compensation, plus expenses incurred by it, and shall certify its decision to the Treasurer of Porto Rico who shall assess said compensation, plus expenses, on the employer and collect them from him; and both such compensation and such expenses shall constitute a lien on all the property of said employer, with the same legal effect and priority as if it were a tax levied on such property; Provided, however, That the Commissioner shall grant both the employer and the laborer in the case an opportunity to be heard and to defend themselves, and he shall conform, as far as possible, to the practices observed by the district courts.'\n\n This procedure, according to the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, took the place of that provided by  7 of the 1925 Act, supra, note 5, by reason of  57, 'all laws or parts of laws in conflict herewith are hereby repealed.'\n On September 14, 1936, the Industrial Commission issued an order requesting the petitioner to levy an attachment on properties of respondent. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Act No. 85, 1928,  48, provided: 'The provisions of this Act shall in no way affect pending litigation relative to workmen's compensation under previous laws.' \n[\nFootnote 8\n] Act No. 45, 1935,  34, also provided:\n'The provisions of this Act shall in no way affect pending litigations or claims relative to workmen's compensation under previous laws. The procedure followed in such litigations or claims, until their termination, shall be in accordance with the laws in force on the date of the accident, and the workmen shall be entitled to such sum of money as may be prescribed by said laws.' \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Supra, note 8. \n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] The Circuit Court of Appeals referred to  2 of the 1925 Act which provided in part:\n'This Act shall apply to every employer who employs any laborer or employee whose wages do not exceed the sum of fifteen hundred (1,500) dollars computed annually; Provided, That pursuant to the provisions of this Act, compensation shall be paid to injured laborers who become disabled or who lose their lives through accident originating from any act or function inherent in their work or employment and occurring during the course of their employment as a consequence thereof or from occupational diseases or death due to such occupation contracted in any work performed by administration under the direction of the Insular Government, payable from the government trust fund.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] Supra, note 6. \n[\nFootnote 12\n] Sec. 15 of Act No. 45, 1935, provided in part:\n'In case of an accident to a workman or employee while working for an employer who, in violation of law, is not insured, the Manager of the State Fund shall determine the proper compensation plus the expenses in the case, and shall certify its decision to the Treasurer of Puerto Rico who shall collect from the employer such compensation and expenses, both of which shall constitute a lien on all the property of the employer; Provided, That said compensation and expenses are hereby declared to be liens preferred over any other charge or lien for taxes or any other cause, with the exception of the mortgage credits, crop loans, and property taxes on the encumbered property for three years and the current year, burdening the property of the employer when it is attached to secure the said compensation and expenses.' \n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] Supra, note 12. \n[\nFootnote 14\n] Act No. 45, 1935,  6. \n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] Supra, notes 6, 12. \n[\nFootnote 16\n] In its motion for reconsideration respondent stated:\n'As taxes can be collected by distraint, it is clear that under the law of 1928 the compensations, which were given the same legal priority and effect of taxes, could be collected by distraint. But the Act of 1935 does not give them such legal effect or priority, and only states that the Treasurer shall collect them. That being the case, it shall be taken that he can only collect them by an ordinary action.' \n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] In Diaz v. Gonzalez, \n261 \nU.S. 102, 105\n, 106 S., 43 S.Ct. 286, 287, another Puerto Rico case, Mr. Justice Holmes observed:\n'This Court has stated many times the deference due to the understanding of the local courts upon matters of purely local concern. It is enough to cite De Villanueva v. Villanueva, \n239 \nU.S. 293, 299\n, 36 S.Ct. 109 (111); Nadal v. May, \n233 \nU.S. 447, 454\n, 34 S.Ct. 611 ( 612). This is especially true in dealing with the decisions of a Court inheriting and brought up in a different system from that which prevails here. When we contemplate such a system from the outside it seems like a wall of stone, every part even with all the others, except so far as our own local education may lead us to see subordinations to which we are accustomed. But to one brought up within it, varying emphasis, tacit assumptions, unwritten practices, a thousand influences gained only from life, may give to the different parts wholly new values that logic and grammar never could have gotten from the books.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico also held that  243 of the Code of Civil Procedure, barring execution of a judgment for the payment of money after five years from the date of its entry, does not apply to orders of the Commission covering compensation awards, a construction which does not seem to be manifest error. \n\n\n\n\n","104":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSCHRIBER-SCHROTH CO. v.

John H. Sutherland and John H. Bruninga, both of St. Louis, Mo., for petitioners.\n Messrs. Arthur C. Denison and F. O. Richey, both of Cleveland, Ohio, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Decision in these cases turns on the question whether, in the light of the patent office history of the Jardine patent on a piston for gas engines, the court below, in construing the specifications and claims, erroneously included one element, 'flexible' or 'yielding' webs in the patented combination.\n A related question was considered by this Court in connection with the Gulick and Maynard patents, also involved in this litigation, in Schriber-Schroth Company v. Cleveland Trust Co., \n305 \nU.S. 47\n, 59 S.Ct. 8. Respondent the Cleveland Trust Co. is the assignee in trust under a pooling agreement of some eighty patents relating to \n\n[311 \nU.S. 211, 213]\n\u00a0\n pistons for gas engines. It brought suit in the district court for northern Ohio against petitioners, three piston dealers, customers of the Sterling Products Company, to restrain infringement of five of the patents, including the Gulick patent No. 1,815,733, applied for November 30, 1917 and allowed July 31, 1931, the Jardine patent, No. 1,763,523, applied for March 11, 1920 and allowed June 10, 1930, and the Maynard patent No. 1,655, 968, applied for January 3, 1921 and allowed June 10, 1928.\n The cases were consolidated and tried before a special master who, upon the basis of elaborate special findings, concluded that the Gulick patent was invalid because of want of invention and because of the addition to the application by amendment in 1922 of a new element of the alleged invention; that the Maynard patent was invalid for want of invention and for failure to describe and claim the alleged invention, and that the Jardine patent was invalid as not showing invention over the prior art exhibited by Ricardo, Franquist and Long. He held the other patents invalid for reasons not now material.\n The district court adopted the master's findings and gave its decree for petitioners. The court of appeals reversed as to two of the five patents, holding the Gulick and Maynard patents valid and infringed. 6 Cir ., 92 F.2d 330, 334. The elements of the combination as stated in claim 39, of the Gulick patent, are:\n'A piston for an engine cylinder comprising a skirt, a head separated from the skirt wall around its entire periphery, said skirt being longitudinally split to render the skirt wall yieldable on every diameter in response to cylinder wall pressure, wrist pin bosses, and means rigidly connecting said bosses to the head and yieldingly connecting said bosses to the skirt whereby said skirt is yieldable in response to cylinder wall pressure.'\n\n Reference to a combination, including with other elements web connections 'whereby said piston skirt is \n\n[311 \nU.S. 211, 214]\n\u00a0\n rendered yieldable during operation in response to cylinder wall pressure' appears in number 18, one of the sustained claims.\n The court of appeals found invention in both the Gulick and Maynard patents, in a combination of elements of which one was 'webs laterally flexible', which was not specifically described or claimed in the Gulick patent before its amendment of 1922 and was never so described or claimed in the Maynard patent.\n Conceding that other elements in the combinations were old in the piston art it said: 'But to combine insulation of head from skirt, retraction of the bosses from the skirt periphery, connection of such bosses to the skirt with webs laterally flexible and yet so carried from the head as to support the load upon the wrist pin with sufficient strength and rigidity, and to utilize the mechanical force of the cylinder wall upon the skirt and the thermal expansion of the bosses so as to compensate evenly and fully for head expansion and to secure a balanced flexibility of the skirt with no bending concentration at any point therein, discloses, we think a meritorious concept beyond the reach of those skilled in the art'. 92 F.2d at page 334.\n Upon an examination of the Gulick application before amendment and the Maynard patent we concluded, \n305 \nU.S. 47\n, 59 S.Ct. 8, that neither described or claimed flexible or yieldable webs as an element in the patented inventions. For that reason alone we held that if the flexible web constituted an essential element of the inventions both patents failed to satisfy the requirement of the statute that the patentee describe his invention so that others may construct and use it after the expiration of the patent and that it 'inform the public during the life of the patent of the limits of the monopoly asserted, so that it may be known which features may be safely used or manufactured without a license and which may not.' \n\n[311 \nU.S. 211, 215]\n\u00a0\n Permutit Co. v. Graver Corp., \n284 \nU.S. 52, 60\n, 52 S.Ct. 53, 55; that consequently the patent monopoly did not extend beyond the invention described and explained by the patent as the statute requires and could not be enlarged by amendment so as to embrace in the invention and element not described or claimed in the application as filed, at least when adverse rights of the public had intervened. See Schriber-Schroth Co. v. Cleveland Trust Co., supra, \n305 \nU.S. 57\n, 59 S.Ct. 12.\n Upon the remand the court of appeals held in the present suit, Cleveland Trust Co. v. Schriber-Schroth Co., 6 Cir., 108 F.2d 109, that the elements of the combination described and claimed in the Gulick patent before amendment and in the Maynard patent without including the flexible web element which was added only by amendment to the Gulick patent, did not disclose invention over the prior art. But considering that the flexible web element which had not been included in the combination patented by Gulick and Maynard had been described and claimed in the Jardine patent, it recalled its mandate to the district court by which it had directed dismissal without prejudice of the suit brought on that patent. See Cleveland Trust Co. v. Schriber-Schroth Co., supra, 108 F.2d 112, 113. Upon an examination of the Jardine specifications and claims it found there described and claimed the invention which it had previously found in Gulick and Maynard, but which this Court had found the patentees had failed to describe and claim in their applications.\n The Jardine claims, 1, 8 and 11, which it sustained, recite the webs as an element but do not describe them as flexible or point to flexibility as an element in the invention claimed. But in the specifications of the patent, which so far as now material appeared in Jardine's application describing the invention, he makes specific reference to the webs constructed in such proportions as to enable them to 'bend' in response to the reaction force of the cylinder wall on the outer faces of the guide \n\n[311 \nU.S. 211, 216]\n\u00a0\n segments as the piston expands, and to the cooperation of the 'bending' web with the thermal expansion of the guide part of the piston without a corresponding increase in its outer diameter. \n1\n He explained the principle of his device saying, 'I have found that these difficulties can be overcome by constructing a piston with its skirt or guide portion supported and slotted or divided in a manner to permit deformation and deflection of parts thereof without interfering with the performance of the essential functions of the respective parts.'\n Reading specifications and claims together, the Court of Appeals interpreted the latter as incorporating the element of web flexibility in the combination claimed and concluded that Jardine had explained and claimed 'the principle of operation of his machine and the flexibility of its webs'. It said that 'the knowledge that was not Gulick's or was by him concealed is clear to Jardine and by him proclaimed.' It held the Jardine patent valid and infringed as it had found Gulick infringed in its earlier decision. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 211, 217]\n\u00a0\n We granted certiorari, \n309 \nU.S. 648\n, 60 S.Ct. 709, 710, on a petition which raised, among others, the question whether the court of appeals had misinterpreted or unduly limited this Court's earlier decision in this case and its decision in Permutit Co. v. Graver Corp., supra, by refusing to hold a patent invalid where a feature found to be an essential element of the patented combination was not mentioned in the claims of the patent and was in fact surrendered during the prosecution of the application and after adverse decisions in interferences. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The claims of a patent are always to be read or interpreted in the light of its specifications, Hogg v. Emerson, 11 How. 587; Carnegie Steel Co. v. Cambria Iron Co., \n185 \nU.S. 403\n, 22 S.Ct. 698; Smith v. Snow, \n294 \nU.S. 1\n, 55 S.Ct. 279; and we may assume that if in the present case the specifications and claims of the patent were to be interpreted without reference to its file wrapper history, the webs referred to in the claims are the webs described in the specifications as capable of bending in cooperation with the slotted piston guides or skirts so as to compensate for thermal expansion and so supply the element of webs laterally flexible which was wanting to Gulick and to Maynard. But the particular invention to which the patentee has made claim in conformity to the statute is not always to be \n\n[311 \nU.S. 211, 218]\n\u00a0\n ascertained from an inspection of the specifications and claims of the patent alone. Where the patentee in the course of his application in the patent office has, by amendment, cancelled or surrendered claims, those which are allowed are to be read in the light of those abandoned and an abandoned claim cannot be revived and restored to the patent by reading it by construction into the claims which are allowed. Hence, petitioners argue, the effect to be given to the omission from the Jardine claims of any reference to the flexible web feature, which the court below thought distinguished his alleged invention from that of the Gulick and Maynard patents, cannot rightly be determined without some examination of the claims pointing to flexible webs as a feature of his invention, which Jardine added to his application by amendment and later surrendered as a result of interference proceedings in the patent office.\n The Jardine patent was described as of the slipper type of piston although not limited to that type, the skirt consisting of two separated parts circumferentially separated from the piston head, supported by the webs which connect the skirt or slippers with the piston head and support wrist pin bosses from which the skirt is retracted or cut away. The claims of the Jardine application as filed or later amended and ultimately allowed made no reference to the webs as flexible, yielding, or resilient, which the court of appeals found, when cooperating with other structural elements, to be a distinguishing feature of Jardine's invention. Claim 8 of the Jardine patent, which is typical of the three which the court below sustained, reads:\n'In a piston for an internal combustion engine, the combination of a head having a cylindrical ring flange, oppositely disclosed webs integral with the flange and carrying diametrically opposite piston pin bosses, and skirt integral with said webs and cut away to expose the sides \n\n[311 \nU.S. 211, 219]\n\u00a0\n of said webs and separated from the ring flange by circumferential slits and provided with a longitudinal slit disposed between the ends of the webs.'\n\n Claims 5 and 6 refer to the 'skirt portion cut away from the head to expose the bosses.'\n While the application was pending Jardine amended his claims so as to supply this omission. In various forms he claimed the piston head, skirt and web combination with piston head separated at its flange or periphery from the skirt, the skirt slotted or separated into parts and connected with the head by the webs, variously described as 'yielding ribs', 'resilient arms', 'skirt carriers ... susceptible of being slightly flexed radially' or as 'joining means being resiliently yieldable', or as 'means for yieldingly connecting the said skirt section with said head'. These claims, as a result of being thrown into interference with Hartog, No. 1,842,022, applied for February 16, 1920, allowed January 19, 1932, and in some instances with Gulick and with Long, No. 1,872,772, applied for March 7, 1919, allowed August 23, 1932, were rejected by the patent office. Jardine then withdrew all of these amendments. Of these amended and cancelled claims, Claim 18(19E) is typical. It reads as follows:\n'In a piston of the class described, a cup-like head comprising a pressure receiving end and a wall portion, a skirt, circumferentially disconnected from the wall portion of the head and divided from end to end, and skirt carriers connecting said skirt to the pressure receiving end, said skirt carriers being disconnected from the wall portion of the head and susceptible of being slightly flexed radially.'\n\n Upon comparison of the withdrawn claim with Claim 8 of the patent as allowed it will be observed that both are combination claims for a piston having a head, a divided or slotted skirt disconnected from the wall portion of the \n\n[311 \nU.S. 211, 220]\n\u00a0\n head and connected with the head by ribs, webs or skirt carriers. The only material difference in view of what has been said to be the invention is the statement in the withdrawn claims that the skirt carriers (webs) are 'susceptible of being slightly flexed radially' or the like. Whatever would have been the proper construction of the claims as allowed, read in the light of the specifications alone, there being no amendments, the question now presented is whether in view of the amendments and their withdrawal the patent can rightly be construed as including the flexible webs in the claim allowed.\n In addition to the fact of the cancellation of the only claims specifying flexing webs or their equivalents as a feature of the invention, it is to be noted that at no time during the prosecution of the Jardine application did he urge that he was the inventor of a piston having flexible webs. Before the interferences and in distinguishing his invention from the Ricardo piston, Jardine urged as his only advance over Ricardo the addition of the slotted skirt which 'changes the structure and the resistance to a disposal of the forces within and without the piston when the piston is in use', although in this litigation it is contended that the Ricardo patent did not disclose flexing webs. In submitting the final amendment cancelling the flexible web claims in interference and presenting the claims 8 and 11 of the Jardine patent held valid by the court below, there is no mention of flexing webs, the features stressed being in the case of Claim 8 that the webs are integral with the ring flange and in the case of Claim 11 that the webs are integral with the flange and extend 'convergingly inwardly' therefrom.\n It is a rule of patent construction consistently observed that a claim in a patent as allowed must be read and interpreted with reference to claims that have been cancelled or rejected and the claims allowed cannot by construction be read to cover what was thus eliminated from \n\n[311 \nU.S. 211, 221]\n\u00a0\n the patent. Shepard v. Carrigan, \n116 \nU.S. 593\n, 6 S.Ct. 493; Sutter v. Robinson, \n119 \nU.S. 530\n, 7 S.Ct. 376; Roemer v. Peddie, \n132 \nU.S. 313\n, 10 S.Ct. 98; Phoenix Caster Co. v.

Rubber Co. v. Essex Rubber Co., \n272 \nU.S. 429, 443\n, 47 S.Ct. 136, 141. The patentee may not, by resort to the doctrine of equivalents, give to an allowed claim a scope which it might have had without the amendments, the cancellation of which amounts to a disclaimer. Smith v. Magic City Club, \n282 \nU.S. 784, 790\n, 51 S.Ct. 291, 293; Weber Electric Co. v. E. H. Freeman Electric Co., supra, \n256 \nU.S. 677, 678\n, 41 S. Ct. 603; I. T. S. Rubber Co. v. Essex Rubber Co., supra, \n272 \nU.S. 444\n, 47 S.Ct. 141. The injurious consequences to the public and to inventors and patent applicants if patentees were thus permitted to revive cancelled or rejected claims and restore them to their patents are manifest. See Leggett v. Avery, \n101 \nU.S. 256\n, 259.\n True, the rule is most frequently invoked when the original and cancelled claim is broader than that allowed, but the rule and the reason for it are the same if the cancelled or rejected claim be narrower. Morgan Envelope Co. v. Albany Paper Co., \n152 \nU.S. 425, 429\n, 14 S.Ct. 627, 629; Wm. B. Scaife & Sons Co. v. Falls City Woolen Mills Co., 6 Cir., 209 F. 210, 213; see Computing Scale Co. v. Automatic Scale Co., \n204 \nU.S. 609, 620\n, 621 S., 27 S.Ct. 307, 311, 312; cf. in case of disclaimer Altoona Publix Theatres v. Tri-Ergon Corp., \n294 \nU.S. 477, 492\n, 493 S., 55 S.Ct. 455, 461, 462.\n In view of the prior art which precluded, as the court below held, invention in Gulick and Maynard, absent the flexible webs, and in Jardine without the inclusion of the surrendered flexible web feature in the patented combination, it does not appear why the patent office allowed the broad claims after rejecting the narrower ones. But in any case the patentee, having acquiesced in their rejection, is no longer free to gain the supposed advantage of the rejected claims by a construction of the allowed \n\n[311 \nU.S. 211, 222]\n\u00a0\n claims as equivalent to them. Morgan Envelope Co. v. Albany Paper Co., supra.\n The application of that principle in the present case is not foreclosed as respondent suggests because the combination of elements surrendered differs from the combination which the court below found to be preserved in the allowed claims and in which it found invention. The combination which it found to be preserved in Jardine's claims was 'a combination with balanced skirt flexibility due to cooperation of longitudinal and vertical slotting with flexing webs supporting retracted bosses and connected to a skirt thereby made responsive to physical compression and thermal expansion so as to permit of minute clearances between piston and cylinder, a concept perceived in Gulick as amended and minus amendment no longer perceived.' 108 F.2d 114.\n But the amended and cancelled claims are to be read in the light of the specifications. So read cancelled claim 18(19E) already quoted claims a piston 'of the class described' and embraces the combination in which the court below found invention, longitudinal and vertical slotting, flexing webs supporting 'retracted bosses' and connected to a skirt thereby made responsive to physical compression and thermal expansion. True the amended and cancelled claim and allowed claims 1, 8 and 11 did not specifically mention retraction of the skirt from the bosses. Nor did either the amended claims or the allowed claims specify balanced skirt flexibility due to co-operation of the parts. For them recourse must be had to the specifications and drawings in which the court below found the elements of the invention which it described but in which, absent the flexible web element, it found no invention. In view of such want of invention and of the prior art the only material difference between the amended and the allowed claims is the presence in the former of the flexible web element and, in consequence of the surrender of the former particularizing the flexible web feature of \n\n[311 \nU.S. 211, 223]\n\u00a0\n the alleged invention, the latter cannot be construed as including that feature.\n We have no occasion to determine whether, in view of the prior art, the Jardine patent disclosed invention if the flexible web feature had not been surrendered. Without it the court below concluded that Jardine, like Gulick and Maynard, disclosed no invention. It rejected the Schmiedeknecht patent, No. 1,256,265, one of those in suit, on like grounds, saying, 'It discloses no web flexibility cooperating with other elements of resiliency to achieve the balanced flexibility perceived in Jardine on the basis of which alone the latter is thought to be valid ....' We accept this conclusion as supported by the evidence of the prior art in the master's findings and the only one which could be reached consistently with the decision below with respect to the Gulick and Maynard patents which stand adjudged as invalid.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] An excerpt from the Jardine Specifications reads:\n'The webs 6 and guide segments preferably are so designed that this displacement of the segments 10, 10a, is permitted by virtue of a bending of the webs 6 at points remote from the guide segments. To this end, as shown in Fig. 4, the thickness of the guide segments is increased toward the webs 6 and the webs 6 are decreased in thickness from the guide portions inward toward the bosses to points in line with the inner ends of the slots 11a. This gives in effect a cantilever structure weakest at its support, ... Thus the reaction force of the cylinder wall on the outer faces of the guide segments as the piston expands tends to cause bending of the webs 6 along said lines 13. Due to the bending of the web sections 6 and the forcing together of each pair of segments, the guide part of the piston may undergo a considerable thermal expansion without a corresponding increase in the outer diameter thereof and thus a small initial clearance can be used without danger of scoring or seizure of the piston.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] A question raised by the petition for certiorari was whether respondent could prosecute its suit for injunction in the absence, as a party, of the licensee to whom respondent had granted the exclusive right to manufacture, under the patents in question, aluminum pistons, the only field in which concededly the patent has present practical utility. The special master found against petitioners on this point and no exceptions were taken to his finding, nor was the point argued when the case was first before the circuit court of appeals and this court. The court below thought that in view of these circumstances the right of respondents to an injunction was no longer an issue. We do not here pass on the question since we find that, in any case, for reasons appearing in the opinion, no injunction should issue. \n\n\n\n\n","105":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. U. S. REALTY & IMP. CO.(1940)\nNo. 796\nArgued: Decided: May 27, 1940\n\n\n Realty & Imp. Co. \n310 \nU.S. 434\n (1940) ]\n\n\n[310 \nU.S. 434, 436]\n\u00a0\n Robert H. Jackson, Atty.

Marx, both of New York City, for respondent.\n\n\n[310 \nU.S. 434, 441]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The questions are whether respondent's petition for an arrangement of its unsecured debts under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A.  701 et seq., should be dismissed because the relief obtainable under that chapter is inadequate, and whether the Securities and Exchange Commission is entitled to raise and litigate that question by intervention and appeal.\n Respondent, a New Jersey corporation doing business in New York as owner of and manager of real estate invest- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 434, 442]\n\u00a0\n ments, has outstanding 900,000 shares of capital stock without par value, which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and are stated by respondent to be held by some seven thousand stockholders. It has liabilities of $5,051,416, of which only $74,916 is current. This indebtedness includes two series of publicly held debentures aggregating $ 2,339,000, maturing January 1, 1944, which are secured by a pledge of corporate stock of little value and a $3,000,000 note, due August 12, 1939, which is secured by a first mortgage owned by respondent. In addition respondent is also liable as a guarantor of payment, principal and interest, and sinking fund of mortgage certificates in the sum of $3,710, 500, issued by its wholly owned subsidiary Trinity Building Corporation of New York and now in the hands of some nine hundred holders. These certificates have been in default for failure to pay interest, principal and sinking fund since January 1, 1939. They are secured by mortgage of real estate and buildings which are Trinity's only substantial assets. Each year since 1936 respondent has suffered a net loss in the conduct of its business and is now unable to pay its debts as they mature. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Before maturity of the first mortgage certificates, respondent and the Trinity Company joined in proposing to certificate holders a plan for the modification of the \n\n[310 \nU.S. 434, 443]\n\u00a0\n obligation of the certificates, leaving unaffected the other indebtedness and stock of respondent. By this plan the maturity of the certificates was to be extended, the rate of interest reduced, and the terms of the provisions for payment of the sinking fund modified. Respondent's guarantee, as to the extension and interest was to be modified accordingly, and its guarantee of sinking fund payments was to be eliminated. The plan was to be consummated by resort to two proceedings, one to be instituted by respondent under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.Supp. V,  701 et seq., 52 Stat. 840, 905, 11 U.S.C.A.  701 et seq., for an 'arrangement' modifying its guarantee of the certificates in the manner already indicated. The other was to be instituted on behalf of Trinity in the New York state courts under the Burchill Act, New York Real Property Law, Consol. Laws, c. 50,  121-123, to secure the appropriate modification of Trinity's primary obligation on the certificates. The plan provided that modification of respondent's guarantee by the Chapter XI proceeding should stand, even though the state court should refuse to confirm the proposed modification of Trinity's obligation on the certificates. When the assent to the plan of holders of certificates amounting to approximately 55 per cent. in number and amount, had been obtained, the present proceeding was gegun May 31, 1939, by the filing in the district court for Southern New York of a petition praying that the proposed 'arrangement' affecting the unsecured indebtedness of respondent be approved.\n The district court found that the petition was properly filed2 under  322 of Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act, \n\n[310 \nU.S. 434, 444]\n\u00a0\n and directed that respondent debtor continue in possession of the property. On July 18, 1939, the district court entered an order permitting the Securities and Exchange Commission to intervene. The motions of the Commission to vacate the order approving the debtor's petition, to dismiss the proceeding under Chapter XI, and to deny confirmation of the proposed arrangement, were denied by the district court and the cause was referred to a referee for further proceedings. On appeal by the Commission from these several orders and on appeal of the respondent from the order of the district court permitting the Commission to intervene, the appeals being consolidated and heard together, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the order permitting the Commission to intervene and dismissed the appeal of the Commission. 108 F.2d 794. We granted certiorari April 1, 1940, the questions raised bring of public importance in the administration of the Bankruptcy Act. \n309 \nU.S. 649\n, 60 S.Ct. 724, 84 L.Ed. --.\n The Court of Appeals held that the proceeding to secure approval of the arrangement, embodied in the plan proposed by respondent, was properly brought under Chapter XI of theBankruptcy Act; that the intervention by theCommission was not authorized by any provision of the Bankruptcy Act and that it had no interest affected by the proceeding under that chapter entitling it to intervene under the applicable rules controlling intervention in the federal courts, and that consequently it was not aggrieved by the order appealed from and so was not entitled to maintain its appeal.\n The Commission argues that Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act prescribes the exclusive procedure for reorganization of a large corporation having its securities \n\n[310 \nU.S. 434, 445]\n\u00a0\n outstanding in the hands of the public such as respondent,3 and that consequently the district court was without jurisdiction to entertain respondent's petition under Chapter XI; that in any case the district court should have dismissed the petition because in the circumstances no fair and equitable arrangement affecting respondent's unsecured creditors alone such as is prescribed by Chapter XI, can be consummated in a proceeding under that chapter. Such being the status of the cause under Chapter XI, the Commission insists that it was properly allowed to intervene in order to protect the interest of the public specially committed to its guardianship by the provisions of Chapter X, and to forestall the impairment of its own functions under that chapter by an unauthorized or improper resort by respondent to Chapter XI, and that for the same reason the Commission was entitled to appeal from the order of the district court refusing to dismiss the Chapter XI proceedings.\n To this it is answered, as the Court of Appeals held, that respondent, although a large corporation with its securities widely distributed in the hands of the public, is nevertheless within the literal terms of Chapter XI, which unqualifiedly authorizes a debtor to petition under that chapter for an arrangement with respect of its unsecured indebtedness, and that the district court was accordingly bond to entertain the petition, however desirable it might be that the reorganization should proceed \n\n[310 \nU.S. 434, 446]\n\u00a0\n under Chapter X, whose procedure is better adapted in cases like the present to protect the public interest and to secure a fair and equitable reorganization, than are the provisions of Chapter XI.\n Chapter XI provides a summary procedure by which a debtor may secure judicial confirmation of an 'arrangement' of his unsecured debts. The debtor who is defined as a 'person who could become a bankrupt under section 4(22) of the Act (title)',  306(3), may, according to sections 4 and 1(23), 11 U.S.C.A.  22 and 1(23), be any person (which includes corporations), except a municipal, railroad, insurance or banking corporation or a building and loan association. The debtor files his original voluntary petition for an arrangement in such a court as would have jurisdiction of a petition in ordinary bankruptcy4 and must file with the petition the proposed arrangement.  322, 323. An arrangement is defined as 'any plan of a debtor for the settlement, satisfaction, or extension of the time of payment of his unsecured debts, upon any terms.'  306(1). The unsecured debtors may be treated generally or in classes.  356, 357.\n It is evident that the language of the sections to which we have referred in terms confers on the court jurisdiction of a petition for an arrangement, which the present petition is, filed by a debtor, which the respondent is, in the technical sense that it confers on the court power to make orders in the cause which are not open to collateral attack. See Pennsylvania v. Williams, \n294 \nU.S. 176\n, 180 et seq., 55 S.Ct. 380, 382, 96 A.L.R. 1166. But the Commission points out that a proceeding begun under Chapter X may be begun and continued under that chapter only if the petition is filed in good faith,  130(7), 143, 146(2), 221, and that under  146(2) 'a petition shall be deemed not to be filed in good faith if ... (2) adequate relief would be obtainable by a debtor's peti- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 434, 447]\n\u00a0\n tion under the provisions of chapter XI (11)'; that Chapter X, devised as a substitute for the equity receivership, is specially adapted to the reorganization of large corporations whose securities are held by the public, and sets up a special procedure for the protection of widely scattered security holders and the public through the intervention of the Commission, while Chapter XI which is peculiarly adapted to the speedy composition of debts of small individual and corporate businesses, omits the machinery for reorganization set up by Chapter X, and contains no provision for participation by the Commission in a proceeding under Chapter XI. From this it argues that the district court was without jurisdiction to entertain respondent's petition under Chapter XI, and the readjustment of its indebtedness through judicial action can properly proceed only with the safeguards, public and private, afforded by Chapter X.\n While we do not doubt that in general, as will presently appear more in detail, the two chapters were specifically devised to afford different procedures, the one adapted to the reorganization of corporations with complicated debt structures and many stockholders, the other to composition of debts of small individual business and corporations with few stockholders, we find in neither chapter any definition or classification which would enable us to say that a corporation is small or large, its security holders few or many, or that its securities are 'held by the public', so as to place the corporation exclusively within the jurisdiction of the court under one chapter rather than the other. But granting the jurisdiction of the court, the question remains of the propriety, in the circumstances, of its order retaining jurisdiction, and of the extent of its duty to go forward with the proceeding under Chapter XI in the face of the contention that Chapter X alone affords a remedy adequately protecting the public and private interests involved. The answer \n\n[310 \nU.S. 434, 448]\n\u00a0\n turns not on the court's statutory jurisdiction to entertain a proceeding under Chapter XI, but on considerations growing out of the public policy of the Act found both in its legislative history and in an analysis of its terms, and of the authority of the court clothed with equity powers and sitting in bankruptcy to give effect to that policy through its power to withhold relief under Chapter XI when relief is available under Chapter X, which is adequate and more consonant with that policy.\n Before the enactment of Section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act, 48 Stat. 911, 912, 11 U.S.C.A.  207, the bankruptcy mechanism was designed for the final liquidation of the bankrupt's estate, except to the extent only that a compromise with creditors was authorized by  12, 74, 11 U.S.C.A.  30, 202. Bankruptcy afforded no facilities for corporation reorganization which, in consequence, could be effected only through resort to the equity receivership with its customary mortgage foreclosures and its attendant paraphernalia of creditors' and security holders' committees, and of rival reorganization plans. Lack of knowledge and control by the court of the conditions attending formulation of reorganization plans, the inadequate protection of widely scattered security holders, the frequent adoption of plans which favored management at the expense of other interests, and which afforded the corporation only temporary respite from financial collapse, so often characteristic of reorganizations in equity receiverships, led to the enactment of 77B. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n The creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission, specially charged by various statutes with the protection of the interests of the investing public, 6 and \n\n[310 \nU.S. 434, 449]\n\u00a0\n observed inadequacies of  77B,7 led to its revision and enactment in changed form as Chapter X, so as to provide for a larger measure of control by the court over security holders' committees and the formulation of reorganization plans and to secure impartial and expert administrative assistance in corporate reorganizations through participation of the Commission. Except where the liabilities are less than $250,000, Chapter X requires the appointment of a disinterested trustee,  156-158, and a thorough examination and study by the trustee of the debtor's financial problems and management,  167(3)(5). The trustee is required to report the result of his study, to send the report to all security holders with \n\n[310 \nU.S. 434, 450]\n\u00a0\n notice to submit to him proposals for a plan of reorganization,  167(5)(6 ). He then formulates a plan or reports the reasons why a plan cannot be formulated,  169. By  176 consent to a plan in advance of its initial approval by the judge is void unless procured with his consent. A large measure of control is given to the court over the reorganization and of committees of security holders and their compensation,  163, 165, 209, 212, 241-243.\n If the judge finds the plan presented worthy of consideration he may refer it to the Commission for report and must do so where the liabilities of the debtor, as in the present case, exceed $3,000,000.  172. When the plan is submitted to creditors after approval by the judge it is accompanied by the report of the Commission and the opinion of the judge approving the plan,  175. The Commission with the approval of the court is authorized to participate generally in the proceedings as a party, and it is its duty to do so upon request of the court,  208.\n No comparable safeguards are found in Chapter XI. \n8\n Every phase of the procedure bearing on the administration of the estate and the development of the arrangement is under the control of the debtor. The process of formulating an arrangement and thesolicitation of consent of creditors, sacrifices to speed and economy every safeguard, in the interest of thoroughness and disinterest- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 434, 451]\n\u00a0\n edness, provided in Chapter X. The debtor is generally permitted to stay in possession and operate the business under the supervision of the Court ,  342, and a trustee is provided for only in the case where a trustee in bankruptcy has previously been appointed and is in possession, or if 'necessary' a receiver may be appointed.  332. The debtor proposes the arrangement,  306(1), 323, 357, and the only opportunity afforded the creditors in respect to the proposed plan is to accept or reject it as submitted by the debtor. Acceptances may be solicited either before or after filing the petition and always before approval of the plan by the Court,  336(4). Section 361 authorizes confirmation of an arrangement when accepted by all the creditors affected by it, 'if the court is satisfied that the arrangement and its acceptance are in good faith,' and Section 362 permits confirmation if only a majority of the creditors affected accept. The arrangement is to be confirmed if the Court is satisfied that '(1) the provisions of this Chapter have been complied with ; (2) it is for the best interests of the creditors; (3) it is fair and equitable and feasible ...; and (5) the proposal and its acceptance are in good faith ...'.  366.\n There are no provisions for an independent study of the debtor's affairs by court or trustee, or for advice by them to creditors with respect to their rights or interests in advance of their consent to the arrangement. Committees of the creditors are permitted,  334, 338, but there is no restriction on or supervision over their selection and conduct as in Chapter X. The arrangement may be consummated at the conclusion of a single creditors' meeting. The Court in passing upon the arrangement, is without the benefit of investigation and study by the trustee or Commission, which Congress has required in reorganization proceedings under Chapter X, and is then faced with the fact that a majority of the creditors have already accepted the plan. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 434, 452]\n\u00a0\n Still more important are the differences in the remedies obtainable under the two chapters which result from differences in the nature of the two proceedings and in the securities which may be affected by them. A plan under Chapter X may affect one or more classes of debts or securities of the corporation to be reorganized, and a subsidiary of the debtor may be brought into such a proceeding and reorganized with the debtor.  129. Under Chapter XI only the rights of unsecured creditors of the debtor may be arranged and this without alteration of the status of any other classes of security holders or of subsidiaries. Both chapters provide for confirmation of the plan or arrangement by the judge 'if satisfied that' it 'is fair and equitable and feasible' and if 'the proposal' of the plan or arrangement 'and its acceptance are in good faith',  221, 366. 'Fair and equitable', taken from  77B and made the condition of confirmation under both Chapter X or Chapter XI are 'words of art' having a well understood meaning in reorganizations in equitable receiverships and under  77B which is incorporated in the structure of both Chapters X and XI. See Case v. Los Angeles Lumber Products Co., \n308 \nU.S. 106\n, 115 et seq., 60 S.Ct. 1, 7. The phrase signifies that the plan or arrangement must conform to the rule of Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Boyd, \n228 \nU.S. 482\n, 33 S.Ct. 554, which established the principal which we recently applied in the Los Angeles case, that in any plan of corporate reorganization unsecured creditors are entitled to priority over stockholders to the full extent of their debts and that any scaling down of the claims of creditors without some fair compensating advantage to them which is prior to the rights of stockholders is inadmissible.\n Since the sections under Chapter XI already considered admit of an 'arrangement' only with respect to unsecured creditors without alteration of the relations of any other \n\n[310 \nU.S. 434, 453]\n\u00a0\n class of security holders, and since it contemplates, as required by  366, that the arrangement shall be fair and equitable within the meaning of the Boyd case, it is evident that Chapter XI gives no appropriate scope for an arrangement of an unsecured indebtedness held by some nine hundred individual creditors of a corporation having seven thousand stockholders. The hope of securing an arrangement which is fair and equitable and in the best interests of unsecured creditors, without some readjustment of the rights of stockholders such as may be had under Chapter X, but is precluded by Chapter XI, is at best but negligible and, if accomplished at all, must be without the aids to the protection of creditors and the public interest which are provided by Chapter X, and which would seem to be indispensable to a just determination whether the plan is fair and equitable.\n Respondent suggests that the proposed arrangement may be taken to satisfy the test of the Boyd case since under it the certificate holders would receive a new guarantee, enforcible as to principal notwithstanding the New York moratorium law, in place of the old guarantee to which that law applies. See Honeyman v. Hanen, 275 N.Y. 382, 9 N.E.2d 970, appeal dismissed \n302 \nU.S. 375\n, 58 S.Ct. 273. It also insists that it is not impossible that an arrangement of its unsecured indebtedness under Chapter XI may be proposed which would meet the test. It states that, availing itself of the privilege afforded by  363, it has proposed an amended arrangement which is not in the record and the terms of which are not disclosed. But it suggests that the arrangement could be amended so as to provide for a ratable distribution to certificate holders of preferred stock of Trinity, respondent's subsidiary, held by respondent or for a similar distribution of cash. But such suggestions raise the question whether the supposed advantage to the creditors is a fair and adequate substitute for the elimination of stockholders within the \n\n[310 \nU.S. 434, 454]\n\u00a0\n requirements of the Boyd case-a question which obviously cannot be answered with any assurance in the present case without resort to the facilities for investigation of the financial condition and structure of the debtor and its subsidiary, and to the expert aid and advice of the Commission available under Chapter X.\n Confirmation of an arrangement follows a finding of the court that it is for the best interests of the creditors,  366(2). Here determination of what is in the 'best interest of the creditors' depends on the answer to the question whether the stockholders should be eliminated or, the creditors should receive some substitute compensation, and whether that compensation is fair and euqitable. In a situation like the present it is in the best interests of the creditors that these questions should be answered in a Chapter X proceeding.\n While this means that arrangements of unsecured debts of corporations, like respondent, may not be 'in the best interests of creditors' and 'feasible' under Chapter XI, it does not mean that there is no scope for application of that chapter in many cases where the debtor's financial business and corporate structure differ from respondent's. This is especially the case with small individual or corporate business where there are no public or private interests involved requiring protection by the procedure and remedies afforded by Chapter X. In cases where subordinate creditors or the stockholders are the managers of its business, the preservation of going-concern value through their continued management of the business may compensate for reduction of the claims of the prior creditors without alteration of the management's interests, which would otherwise be required by the Boyd case. See Case v. Los Angeles Lumber Products Co., supra, 308 U.S. at pages 121, 122, 60 S.Ct. at page 10.\n Under  146(2) a petition may not be filed under Chapter X unless the judge is satisfied that 'adequate relief' would not be obtainable under Chapter XI. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 434, 455]\n\u00a0\n Obviously the adequacy of the relief under Chapter XI must be appraised in comparison with that to be had under Chapter X, and in the light of its effect on all the public and private interests concerned including those of the debtor. Applying this test, if respondent had proceeded under Chapter X the judge would have been compelled upon inquiry to approve its petition on the ground that it complied with the requirements of Chapter X, and that adequate relief could not be obtained under Chapter XI. That being the case the question here is whether, in the absence of any provision of Chapter XI specifically authorizing the dismissal of the petition, the district court should on that ground have dismissed the proceeding under Chapter XI, leaving respondent free to proceed under Chapter X which affords every remedy which could be obtained under Chapter XI and more.\n A bankruptcy court is a court of equity,  2, 11 U.S.C.  11, 11 U.S. C.A.  11, and is guided by equitable doctrines and principles except in so far as they are inconsistent with the Act. Bardes v. Hawarden Bank, \n178 \nU.S. 524, 534\n, 535 S., 20 S.Ct. 1000, 1004; Continental Illinois Nat. Bank & T. Co. v. Chicago R.I. & Pacific Ry., \n294 \nU.S. 648, 675\n, 55 S.Ct. 595, 605; Wayne United Gas Co. v. Owens- Illinois Glass Co., \n300 \nU.S. 131\n, 57 S.Ct. 382; Pepper v. Litton, \n308 \nU.S. 295\n, 60 S.Ct. 238. A court of equity may in its discretion in the exercise of the jurisdiction committed to it grant or deny relief upon performance of a condition which will safeguard the public interest. It may in the public interest, even withhold relief altogether, and it would seem that it is bound to stay its hand in the public interest when it reasonably appears that private right will not suffer. Pennsylvania v. Williams, supra, 294 U.S. at page 185, 55 S.Ct. at page 385, 96 A.L.R. 1166, and cases cited; Virginian Railway v. Federation, \n300 \nU.S. 515\n, 549 et seq., 57 S.Ct. 592, 600. Before the provisions for alternative remedies were brought into the Bankruptcy Act by Chapters X and XI the occasion was rare when a court could have felt free to deny a petition in order to serve some public \n\n[310 \nU.S. 434, 456]\n\u00a0\n or collateral interest at the expense of the petitioner's right to an adjudication. But here respondent, if dismissed, need not go without remedy. All that it can secure rightly or equitably in a Chapter XI proceeding is to be had in a Chapter X proceeding. The case stated most favorably to respondent is that it has proposed an arrangement which appears on its face not to be 'fair and equitable' and hence not to be entitled to confirmation under Chapter XI. Respondent's circumstances, as disclosed by its petition and proposed arrangement, are such as to raise a serious question whether any fair and equitable arrangement in the best interest of creditors can be effected without some re-arrangement of its capital structure. In any case that and subsidiary questions cannot be answered in the best interest of creditors without recourse to the procedure of a Chapter X proceedings. Pending the litigation respondent seeks to stay the hand of its creditors and in the meantime to avoid that inquiry into its financial condition and practices and its business prospects, provided for by Chapter X without which there is at least danger that any adjustment of its indebtedness will not be just and equitable, and that its revived financial life will be too short to serve any public or private interest other than that of respondent.\n In this situation, we think the court was as free to determine whether the relief afforded by Chapter XI was adequate as it would have been if respondent had filed its petition under Chapter X. What the court can decide under  146 of Chapter X as to the adequacy of the relief afforded by Chapter XI, it can decide in the exercise of its equity powers under Chapter XI for the purpose of safeguarding the public and private interests involved and protecting its own jurisdiction from misuse. Here, we think it was plainly the duty of the district court in the exercise of a sound discretion to have dismissed the \n\n[310 \nU.S. 434, 457]\n\u00a0\n petition remitting respondent if it was so advised to the initiation of a proceeding under Chapter X, in which it may secure a reorganization which, after study and investigation appropriate to its corporate business structure and ownership, is found to be fair, equitable and feasible, and in the best interest of creditors. While a bankruptcy court cannot, because of its own notions of equitable principles, refuse to award the relief which Congress has accorded the bankrupt, the real question is, what is the relief which Congress has accorded the bankrupt and is it more likely to be secured in a Chapter X or Chapter XI proceeding? In answering it we cannot assume that Congress has disregarded well settled principles of equity, the more so when Congress itself has provided that the relief to be given shall be 'fair and equitable and feasible'. Good sense and legal tradition alike enjoin that an enactment of Congress dealing with bankruptcy should be read in harmony with the existing system of equity jurisprudence of which it is a part.\n If respondent had sought relief by way of an equity receivership such would have been the duty of the Court. Pennsylvania v. Williams, supra. We think it is no less so here. Before the enactment of Chapters X and XI, the district court in a 77B proceeding was 'not bound to clog its docket with visionary or impracticable schemes for resuscitation', however honest the efforts of the debtor and however sincere its motives, and it was its duty to dismiss the proceeding whenever it appeared that a fair and equitable plan was not feasible, leaving the debtor to the alternative remedy of bankruptcy liquidation, see Tennessee Publishing Co. v. American National Bank, \n299 \nU.S. 18, 22\n, 57 S.Ct. 85, 87. And it has long been the practice of bankruptcy courts to permit creditors or others not entitled to file pleadings or otherwise contest the allegations of a petition to move for the vacation of an adjudication \n\n[310 \nU.S. 434, 458]\n\u00a0\n or the dismissal of a petition on grounds, whether strictly jurisdictional or not,9 that the proceeding ought not to be allowed to proceed.\n The Court of Appeals thought that the Commission had no such special interest as to entitle it to intervene as of right in the Chapter XI proceeding and concluded that the district court erred in permitting the intervention and that from this it followed that the Commission had no right to appeal. Its decision is in effect that a governmental agency not asserting the right to possession or control of specific property involved in a litigation may not be permitted to intervene without statutory authority. Neither Chapter X nor Chapter XI, in terms, gives a right of 'intervention', but the Commission is authorized, with the permission of the court, to appear in any Chapter X proceedings,  208. Such right as the Commission may have to intervene in a Chapter XI proceeding is, therefore, governed by the Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c, and the general principles governing intervention. We are not here concerned with the refinements of the distinction between intervention, as a matter of right, which the Court of Appeals thought was restricted to cases where the intervenor has a direct pecuniary interest in the litigation, and permissive intervention, a distinction which has been preserved by Rule 24 of the Rules of Civil Procedure. For here the question is not of the Commission's intervention 'as of right', but whether the district court abused its discretion in permitting it to intervene.\n The Commission is, as we have seen, charged with the performance of important public duties in every case brought under Chapter X, which will be thwarted, to the \n\n[310 \nU.S. 434, 459]\n\u00a0\n public injury, if a debtor may secure adjustment of his debts in a Chapter XI proceeding when, upon the applicable principles which we have discussed, he should be required to proceed, if at all, under Chapter X. The Commission's duty and its interest extends not only to the performance of its prescribed functions where a petition is filed under Chapter X, but to the prevention, so far as the rules of procedure permit, of interferences with their performance through improper resort to a Chapter XI proceeding in violation of the public policy of the Act which it is the duty of the court to safeguard by relegating respondent to a Chapter X proceeding. The Commission did not here intervene to perform the advisory functions required of it by Chapter X, but to object to an improper exercise of the court's jurisdiction which, if permitted to continue, contrary to the court's own equitable duty in the premises, would defeat the public interests which the Commission was designated to represent. Sen.Rep.No. 1916, 75th Cong., 3d Sess., p. 31.\n Rule 24 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, made applicable to bankruptcy proceedings by paragraph 37 of the General Orders for Bankruptcy, 11 U.S.C.A. following section 53, authorizes 'permissive intervention'. It directs that 'upon timely application anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action ... (2) when an applicant's claim or defense and the main action have a question of law or fact in common. In exercising its discretion the court shall consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties.' This provision plainly dispenses with any requirement that the intervenor shall have a direct personal or pecuniary interest in the subject of the litigation. Cf. Pennsylvania v. Williams, supra. If, as we have said, it was the duty of the court to dismiss the Chapter XI proceeding because its maintenance there would defeat the public interest in having any scheme of reorganization of re- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 434, 460]\n\u00a0\n spondent subjected to the scrutiny of the Commission, we think it plain that the Commission has a sufficient interest in the maintenance of its statutory authority and the performance of its public duties to entitle it through intervention to prevent reorganizations, which should rightly be subjected to its scrutiny from proceeding without it. The Exchange v. M'Faddon, 7 Cranch. 116; Stanley v. Schwalby, \n147 \nU.S. 508\n, 13 S.Ct. 418; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Oregon- Washington R. Co., \n288 \nU.S. 14\n, 53 S.Ct. 266; Pennsylvania v. Williams, supra. See, Hopkins Saving Ass'n v. Cleary, \n296 \nU.S. 315\n, 56 S. Ct. 235, 100 A.L.R. 1403. Cf. In re Debs, \n158 \nU.S. 564\n, 15 S. Ct. 900; New York v. New Jersey, \n256 \nU.S. 296\n, 307-308, 41 S.Ct. 492, 495, 496.\n This interest of the Commission does not differ from that of a liquidator under a state statutory proceeding who may, in a proper case, intervene in an equity receivership in a federal court to ask the court to relinquish its jurisdiction in favor of the state proceeding. Pennsylvania v. Williams, supra. Neither the liquidator nor the state has any personal, financial or pecuniary interest in the property in the custody of the federal court. Their only interest, like that of the Commission, is a public one, to maintain the state authority and to secure a liquidation in conformity to state policy. The 'claim or defense' of the Commission founded upon this interest has a question of law in common with the main proceeding in the course of which any party or a creditor could challenge the propriety of the court's proceeding under Chapter XI. \n10\n The claim or defense is thus within the requirement of Rule 24 and intervention was properly allowed. The Commission was, therefore, a party aggrieved by the court's order refusing to dismiss and was entitled to appeal under  24 and 25 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A.  47, 48. See Interstate Commerce Commission v. Oregon-Washington R. Co., supra; Texas v. Anderson, Clayton & Co., 5 Cir., 92 F.2d 104. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 434, 461]\n\u00a0\n Section 208, applicable to proceedings under Chapter X, gives the Commission, upon filing its notice of appearance, 'the right to be heard on all matters arising in such proceeding', but provides that it 'may not appeal or file any petition for appeal in any such proceeding.' As  208 has no application to a proceeding under Chapter XI, it is unnecessary to consider the suggestion of the Commission that the limitation of the section is upon appeals to review questions arising in the proceeding from the performance by the Commission of its advisory functions and does not preclude it from appealing to challenge the exercise or non-exercise by the district court of its jurisdiction under Chapter X.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS did not participate in the decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS.\n The Chandler Act1 revised the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, as amended, and, in chapters X, XI, XII, XIII, and XIV, provided for corporate reorganizations, arrangements, real property arrangements, wage earners' plans, and Maritime Commission liens. These, with chapter VIII, authorizing agricultural compositions, chapter IX, dealing with indebtedness of local taxing agencies, chapter XV, added by Act of July 28, 1939, 53 Stat. 1134, and  77, relating to reorganization of interstate railroads, in addition to the seven chapters of the original Act, constitute a comprehensive system for accommodating or liquidating indebtedness in the interest of both debtors and creditors. In chapters X to XIII, inclusive, added by the Chandler Act, the first section states: 'The provisions of this chapter shall apply exclusively to proceedings under this chapter,' 11 U.S.C.A.  501, thus evidencing the purpose to \n\n[310 \nU.S. 434, 462]\n\u00a0\n make each type of proceeding complete and exclusive of the others.\n The proceeding instituted by the respondent, as is conceded, falls precisely within the terms of chapter XI, which deals with arrangements, and confers jurisdiction on the District Court to entertain the cause. But it is said that for the court to exercise that jurisdiction would be so contrary to the unexpressed purpose of Congress that the court should have refused to act. The decision assumes that if Congress had been interrogated as to its intent it would have expressed its will that an arrangement by one having such a financial structure as the respondent should not be permitted, and that, in order to prevent such a result, Congress, if it had been prescient, would have so stated. This seems to me to go beyond the construction of the Act as it is written and to amount to an amendment of it. I think that this is not admissible on the ground advanced that to hold otherwise would be to nullify rather than to effectuate the intent of Congress which is thought to pervade the statutory scheme.\n Where the words are as plain and unambiguous as they are in chapter XI recourse cannot be had to legislative history or other extraneous aids to construe them in some other sense, to add to, or to subtract from, what is written. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n But if resort to conventional aids to construction were admissible, they seem to me to confirm the statutory right of the respondent to proceed under chapter XI and to \n\n[310 \nU.S. 434, 463]\n\u00a0\n preclude a holding that it should have proceeded under chapter X.\n Under  12 of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 a corporation could propose a composition, but, as recourse to bankruptcy, whether for the purpose of liquidation or of proposing a composition, was dependent upon insolvency as defined in the statute rather than mere inability to pay debts as they accrued, a company finding itself in the latter condition could not avail itself of the bankruptcy jurisdiction but had to resort to an equity receivership.\n In 1932 the Solicitor General, in a report to the President on the Bankruptcy Act and its administration,3 pointed out the difficulties of proposing a composition in bankruptcy and suggested relief of the sort which was ultimately accorded by the adoption of  77B.\n By an Act of March 3, 1933,4 there was added to the Act a provision which permitted 'any person excepting a corporation,' by petition, or by answer in an involuntary proceeding, to assert his insolvency or his inability to meet his debts as they accrued and his desire to effect a composition or an extension of time to pay his debts, and to adjust his indebtedness in that way. Thus an arrangement procedure was provided for individuals who were not insolvent in the bankruptcy sense. The same legislation also provided for agricultural compositions and extensions and for reorganizations of interstate railroads, but Congress did not, at that time, afford any further relief to corporations generally.\n By the Act of June 7, 1934,5  77B was added, permitting the reorganization of a corporation unable to meet its debts as they mature. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 434, 464]\n\u00a0\n When, by the Chandler Act, Congress determined to revise and codify the entire bankruptcy system, it repealed  12 and  74, and, in liew of them, adopted chapter XI, permitting arrangements of unsecured debts by individuals, partnerships, and corporations. \n6\n It thus clearly drew a distinction between a reorganization which affects various classes of creditors and stockholders and an arrangement which is merely an extension, adjustment, or accommodation of unsecured claims without disturbing either secured claims or stock interests. Where this simple form of accommodation would suffice, it was not intended that the corporation should have the privilege of a reorganization under chapter X, the successor of  77B, for it is provided in chapter X ( 146) that a petition shall not be deemed to be filed in good faith if adequate relief would be obtainable by a debtor's petition under the provisions of chapter XI and further ( 147) that a petition filed under chapter X improperly, because adequate relief can be obtained under chapter XI, may be amended to comply with chapter XI and may be proceeded with as if originally filed under the latter. No such provision is found in chapter XI with respect to a case properly falling under chapter X. Obviously the right to proceed under chapter X was deemed a privilege of which a corporation could not avail itself if it could proceed under chapter XI.\n The gravamen of petitioner's argument is that Congress intended the more detailed and cumbersome procedure of chapter X to apply wherever securities of the corporation were held by the public whereas chapter XI was intended to apply only in the case of individuals or corporations not having such securities outstanding.\n The Act will be searched in vain for any hint of such a distinction. Small corporations are permitted to avail \n\n[310 \nU.S. 434, 465]\n\u00a0\n themselves of chapter X if stockholders' or secured creditors' rights are to be affected; large corporations, under the very letter of chapter XI, may avail themselves of its provisions if all they desire to do is to extend or accommodate their unsecured indebtedness. The smallest corporation cannot come in under chapter XI if it desires what has been traditionally known as a reorganization. The largest corporation may proceed under chapter XI if it does not desire a reorganization.\n The argument of the Commission comes merely to this: That foresight and providence on the part of Congress would have dictated a different line of demarcation between the two chapters and that what Congress should have said in chapter XI was that any debtor which did not have securities outstanding in the hands of the public might file a petition under chapter XI but that all others must file under chapter X.\n The legislative history furnishes but the scantiest support for the argument. Indeed it bears quite as strongly against the Commission's contention as in its favor. The only item to which counsel is able to point is a committee report to the House7 wherein it is said:\n'Section 12 has been recast; such features of section 74 are incorporated as are deemed of value and the combined sections are made Chapter XI of the Act under the title 'Arrangement' ... The inclusion of corporations will permit a large number of the smaller companies such as are now seeking relief under Section 77B but do not require the complex machinery of that section, to resort to the simpler and less expensive though fully adequate relief afforded by Section 12.'\n\n It is undoubtedly true that many more small corporations will find chapter XI available than large ones but this does not at all support the Commission's claim that \n\n[310 \nU.S. 434, 466]\n\u00a0\n the chapter was not intended to be available to companies having securities in the hands of the public.\n On the other hand, testimony before the Congressional Committee was to the effect that large corporations would not come under chapter X if they were seeking merely to adjust their unsecured debts and should go, therefore, under chapter XI. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n One of the draftsmen of the Chandler Act, in a public exposition,9 has said:\n'What is the line of demarcation between proceedings under Chapter X and Chapter XI? Without attempting to go into detail, Chapter XI proceedings are intended for the reorganization of corporations with simple debt structures-reorganizations under which the interests of stockholders and secured creditors are not to be modified or readjusted. If secured claims or stock interests are to be changed without the consent of all of the stockholders and secured creditors, proceedings must be instituted under Chapter X.'\n\n That chapters X and XI were not written in ignorance of the distinction between corporations having publicly owned securities and those which have not, is shown by the fact that a special committee's report called attention to this difference and suggested that corporations not having such securities outstanding be permitted to go under the arrangements chapter whereas the first named should be required to file under what is now chapter X. \n10\n With this suggestion before it Congress adopted a different criterion.\n When all is considered it is evident that little support for the Commission's argument can be gained from the \n\n[310 \nU.S. 434, 467]\n\u00a0\n legislative history. It is of no avail to urge that it would have been far better for Congress to adopt a different scheme and that the public interest which Congress had in mind in writing chapter X extends quite as much to a composition such as that proposed in the instant case as to the reorganizations envisaged in chapter X. These considerations may well be urged upon Congress in support of an amendment of the statute but they can have no weight with a court called upon to apply its plain language.\n Equally unavailing is the argument that the present case must belong under chapter X since secured creditors and stockholders must be brought into the reckoning and because one of the requirements of  366 is that the court must find the arrangement is 'fair and equitable and feasible'. It is said that this phrase is a term of art, given meaning by our decision in Northern Pacific R. Co. v. Boyd, \n228 \nU.S. 482\n, 33 S.Ct. 554, and that, within that meaning, no fair, equitable, and feasible plan can here be accomplished under chapter XI although it could be under chapter X.\n The short answer is that the phrase is used not only in chapter XI and chapter X but also in chapter XII respecting real property arrangements, and in chapter XIII respecting wage earners' plans. \n11\n Obviously the phrase as used in the Chandler Act must be given the connotation appropriate to the section in which it is used.\n Another argument put forward is that, as courts of bankruptcy are courts of equity, they may, as a chancellor might in the case of a bill for receivership, find that the balance of convenience requires a refusal to exercise a jurisdiction possessed. I think this is a complete misapplication of the principle that a court of bankruptcy is a court of equity. That has been many times stated but never in connection with the right of a debtor to invoke the remedy provided by Congress in the bankruptcy laws. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 434, 468]\n\u00a0\n The legislature has specified who is entitled to the relief provided by the statute and in what circumstances. The court has no power to refuse that relief on the ground that some other relief would better serve the purpose. What is meant by the statement that a court of bankruptcy is a court of equity is that its function is to make an equitable distribution of the estate among the creditors, but the principle has not been applied in the sense that the court may, in its better judgment, refuse to award the relief which Congress has accorded the bankrupt.\n No stockholder or creditor, secured or unsecured, has attempted to raise the question of the District Court's jurisdiction under chapter XI. The Securities and Exchange Commission, although charged with no duty by the Act in connection with proceedings under chapter XI, has sought to intervene and to appeal from a decision by the District Court adverse to the Commission's views. Although the Commission may be permitted to appear in chapter X proceedings, it is expressly provided that it may not appeal from any decision. \n12\n No analogous provision is found in chapter XI although that chapter does, in certain instances, grant interested parties the right to be heard. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n By general order the Rules of Civil Procedure are made applicable in bankruptcy so far as practicable. It is suggested that Rule 24 authorizes the Commission's intervention but a mere reading of the rule shows that neither intervention of right, nor permissive intervention, is available to the Commission in this case. The Commission may not intervene as of right under the rule because no statute confers on it an unconditional right to intervene; the Commission has no interest which may be bound by a judgment in the action; and it cannot be \n\n[310 \nU.S. 434, 469]\n\u00a0\n adversely affected by the court's decision. It is not entitled to permissive intervention because no statute confers a conditional right to intervene and because it has no claim or defense which will be affected by any decision of law or fact by the court. The cases in which bankruptcy courts have allowed creditors to raise questions of venue or of jurisdiction to adjudicate under the terms of the statute, where the proceeding would affect the creditors' financial interest, are inapposite, as are also equity receivership cases where an official intervenes in order to claim the right, as such official, to take over and administer the property in the possession of the court.\n I am of the opinion that the judgment should be affirmed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS agree with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The alleged value of debtor's assets is $7,076,515. Of this $5,200, 000 is represented by the stock of the subsidiary and a first mortgage on a building owned by the subsidiary which is pledged to secure respondent's $ 3,000,000 note. Current assets are less than $400,000.

METRO-GOLDWYN PICTURES CORPORATION(1940)\nNo. 482\nArgued: Decided: March 25, 1940\n\n\n\n\n[309 \nU.S. 390, 391]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Arthur F. Driscoll, of New York City, for petitioners.\n\n\n\n[309 \nU.S. 390, 396]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John W. Davis, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The questions presented are whether, in computing an award of profits against an infringer of a copyright, there may be an apportionment so as to give to the owner of the copyright only that part of the profits found to be attributable to the use of the copyrighted material as distinguished from what the infringer himself has supplied, and, if so, whether the evidence affords a proper basis for the apportionment decreed in this case.\n Petitioners' complaint charged infringement of their play 'Dishonored Lady' by respondents' motion picture 'Letty Lynton', and sought an injunction and an accounting of profits. The Circuit Court of Appeals, reversing the District Court, found and enjoined the infringement and directed an accounting. 2 Cir., 81 F.2d 49. Thereupon the District Court confirmed with slight modifications the report of a special master which awarded to petitioners all the net profits made by respondents from their exhibitions of the motion picture, amounting to $587,604.37. D.C., 26 F. Supp. 134, 136. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding that there should be an apportionment and fixing petitioners' share of the net profits at one-fifth. 2 Cir., 106 F.2d 45, 51. In view of the importance of the question, which appears \n\n[309 \nU.S. 390, 397]\n\u00a0\n to be one of first impression in the application of the copyright law, we granted certiorari, December 4, 1939, \n308 \nU.S. 545\n, 60 S.Ct. 261, 84 L.Ed . --.\n Petitioners' play 'Dishonored Lady' was based upon the trial in Scotland, in 1857, of Madeleine Smith for the murder of her lover,-a cause celebre included in the series of 'Notable British Trials' which was published in 1927. The play was copyrighted as an unpublished work in 1930, and was produced here and abroad. Respondents took the title of their motion picture 'Letty Lynton' from a novel of that name written by an English author, Mrs. Belloc Lowndes, and published in 1930. That novel was also based upon the story of Madeleine Smith and the motion picture rights were bought by respondents. There had been negotiations for the motion picture rights in petitioners' play, and the price had been fixed at $30, 000, but these negotiations fell through.\n As the Court of Appeals found, respondents in producing the motion picture in question worked over old material; 'the general skeleton was already in the public demesne. A wanton girl kills her lover to free herself for a better match; she is brought to trial for the murder and escapes'. (106 F.2d 50). But not content with the mere use of that basic plot, respondents resorted to petitioners' copyrighted play. They were not innocent offenders. From comparison and analysis, the Court of Appeals concluded that they had 'deliberately lifted the play'; their 'borrowing was a deliberate plagiarism'. It is from that standpoint that we approach the questions now raised.\n Respondents contend that the material taken by infringement contributed in but a small measure to the production and success of the motion picture. They say that they themselves contributed the main factors in producing the large net profits; that is, the popular actors, the scen- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 390, 398]\n\u00a0\n ery, and the expert producers and directors. Both courts below have sustained this contention.\n The District Court (26 F.Supp. 141) thought it 'punitive and unjust' to award all the net profits to petitioners. The court said that, if that were done, petitioners would receive the profits that the 'motion picture stars' had made for the picture 'by their dramatic talent and the drawing power of their reputations'. 'The directors who supervised the production of the picture and the experts who filmed it also contributed in piling up these tremendous net profits'. The court thought an allowance to petitioners of 25 per cent. of these profits 'could be justly fixed as a limit beyond which complainants would be receiving profits in no way attributable to the use of their play in the production of the picture'. But, though holding these views, the District Court awarded all the net profits to petitioners, feeling bound by the decision of the Court of Appeals in Dam v. Kirk La Shelle Co., 2 Cir., 175 F. 902, 903, 41 L.R.A.,N. S., 1002, 20 Ann.Cas. 1173, a decision which the Court of Appeals has now overruled.\n The Court of Appeals was satisfied that but a small part of the net profits was attributable to the infringement, and, fully recognizing the difficulty in finding a satisfactory standard, the court decided that there should be an apportionment and that it could fairly be made. The court was resolved 'to avoid the one certainly unjust course of giving the plaintiffs everything, because the defendants cannot with certainty compute their own share'. The court would not deny 'the one fact that stands undoubted', and, making the best estimate it could, it fixed petitioners' share at one-fifth of the net profits, considering that to be a figure 'which will favor the plaintiffs in every reasonable chance of error'.\n First.-Petitioners insist fundamentally that there can be no apportionment of profits in a suit for a copyright infringement; that it is forbidden both by the statute and the decisions of this Court. We find this basic argument to be untenable. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 390, 399]\n\u00a0\n The Copyright Act in Section 25(b)1 provides that an infringer shall be liable-\n'(b) To pay to the copyright proprietor such damages as the copyright proprietor may have suffered due to the infringement, as well as all the profits which the infringer shall have made from such infringement, ... or in lieu of actual damages and profits such damages as to the court shall appear to be just, ...'.\n\n We agree with petitioners that the 'in lieu' clause is not applicable here, as the profits have been proved and the only question is as to their apportionment.\n Petitioners stress the provision for recovery of 'all' the profits, but this is plainly qualified by the words 'which the infringer shall have made from such infringement'. This provision in purpose is cognate to that for the recovery of 'such damages as the copyright proprietor may have suffered due to the infringement'. The purpose is thus to provide just compensation for the wrong, not to impose a penalty by giving to the copyright proprietor profits which are not attributable to the infringement.\n Prior to the Copyright Act of 1909, 17 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq., there had been no statutory provision for the recovery of profits, but that recovery had been allowed in equity both in copyright and patent cases as appropriate equitable relief incident to a decree for an injunction. Stevens v. Gladding, 17 How. 447, 455. That relief had been given in accordance with the principles governing equity jurisdiction, not to inflict punishment but to prevent an unjust enrichment by allowing injured complainants to claim 'that which, ex oequo et bono, is theirs, and nothing beyond this'. Livingston v. Woodworth, 15 How. 546, 560. See Root v. Lake Shore & M.S. Railway Company, \n105 \nU.S. 189, 194\n, 195 S.. Statutory provision for the recovery of profits in patent cases was en- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 390, 400]\n\u00a0\n acted in 1870.2 The principle which was applied both prior to this statute and later was thus stated in the leading case of Tilghman v. Proctor, \n125 \nU.S. 136, 146\n, 8 S.Ct. 894, 899: 'The infringer is liable for actual, not for possible, gains. The profits, therefore, which he must account for, are not those which he might reasonably have made, but those which he did make, by the use of the plaintiff's invention; or, in other words, the fruits of the advantage which he derived from the use of that invention over what he would have had in using other means then open to the public and adequate to enable him to obtain an equally beneficial result. If there was no such advantage in his use of the plaintiff's invention, there can be no decree for profits, and the plaintiff's only remedy is by an action at law for damages'.\n In possing the Copyright Act, the apparent intention of Congress was to assimilate the remedy with respect to the recovery of profits to that already recognized in patent cases. Not only is there no suggestion that Congress intended that the award of profits should be governed by a different principle in copyright cases but the contrary is clearly indicated by the committee reports on the bill. As to section 25(b) the House Committee said:3\n'Section 25 deals with the matter of civil remedies for infringement of a copyright. ... The provision that the copyright proprietor may have such damages as well as the profits which the infringer shall have made is substantially the same provision found in section 4921 of the Revised Statutes relating to remedies for the infringement of patents. The courts have usually construed that to mean that the owner of the patent might have one or the other, whichever was the greater. As such a provision was found both in the trademark and patent \n\n[309 \nU.S. 390, 401]\n\u00a0\n laws, the committee felt that it might be properly included in the copyright laws'.\n\n We shall presently consider the doctrine which has been established upon equitable principles with respect to the apportionment of profits in cases of patent infringement. We now observe that there is nothing in the Copyright Act which precludes the application of a similar doctrine based upon the same equitable principles in cases of copyright infringement.\n Nor do the decisions of this Court preclude that course. Petitioners invoke the cases of Callaghan v. Myers, \n128 \nU.S. 617\n, 9 S.Ct. 177, and Belford, Clarke & Co. v. Scribner, \n144 \nU.S. 488\n, 12 S.Ct. 734, 740. In the Callaghan case, the copyright of a reporter of judicial decisions was sustained with respect to the portions of the books of which he was the author, although he had no exclusive right in the judicial opinions. On an accounting for the profits made by an infringer, the Court allowed the deduction from the selling price of the actual and legitimate manufacturing cost. With reference to the published matter to which the copyright did not extend, the Court found it impossible to separate the profits on that from the profits on the other. And in view of that impossibility, the defendant, being responsible for the blending of the lawful with the unlawful, had to abide the consequences, as in the case of one who has wrongfully produced a confusion of goods. A similar impossibility was encountered in Belford, Clarke & Co. v. Scribner, supra, a case of a copyright of a book containing recipes for the household. The infringing books were largely compilations of these recipes, 'the matter and language' being 'the same as the complainant's in every substantial sense', but so distributed through the defendants' books that it was 'almost impossible to separate the one from the other'. The Court ruled that when the copyrighted portions are so intermingled with the rest of the piratical work 'that they cannot well be distinguished from it', \n\n[309 \nU.S. 390, 402]\n\u00a0\n the entire profits realized by the defendants will be given to the plaintiff.\n We agree with the court below that these cases do not decide that no apportionment of profits can be had where it is clear that all the profits are not due to the use of the copyrighted material, and the evidence is sufficient to provide a fair basis of division so as to give to the copyright proprietor all the profits that can be deemed to have resulted from the use of what belonged to him. Both the Copyright Act and our decisions leave the matter to the appropriate exercise of the equity jurisdiction upon an accounting to determine the profits 'which the infringer shall have made from such infringement'.\n Second.-The analogy found in cases of patent infringement is persuasive. There are many cases in which the plaintiff's patent covers only a part of a machine and creates only a part of the profits. The patented invention may have been used in combination with additions or valuable improvements made by the infringer and each may have contributed to the profits. In Elizabeth v. American Nicholson Pavement Company, \n97 \nU.S. 126\n, 142, cited in the Callaghan and Belford cases, supra, it had been recognized that if a separation of distinct profit derived from such additions or improvements was shown, an apportionment might be had. See Garretson v. Clark, \n111 \nU.S. 120, 121\n, 4 S.Ct. 291. The subject was elaborately discussed in the case of Westinghouse Electric & Mfg. Company v. Wagner Electric & Mfg. Company, \n225 \nU.S. 604\n, 32 S.Ct. 691, 694, 41 L.R.A.,N.S., 653, where it was distinctly ruled that 'if plaintiff's patent only created a part of the profits, he is only entitled to recover that part of the net gains'. There, the Court was concerned with the question of burden of proof. It was said that the plaintiff suing for profits was under the burden of showing that they had been made. The defendant had submitted evidence tending to show that it had added non-infringing and valuable \n\n[309 \nU.S. 390, 403]\n\u00a0\n improvements which had contributed to the making of profits; and the plaintiff in reply had insisted that these additions had made no such contribution. But assuming, as had been found, that the additions were non- infringing and valuable improvements, and a prima facie case of contribution to profits thus appearing, the burden of apportionment would rest upon the plaintiff. But in that relation it had still to be considered that the act of the defendant had made it 'not merely difficult but impossible to carry the burden of apportionment' and in such case, as the 'inseparable profit must be given to the patentee or infringer', the law placed the loss on the wrongdoer.\n The question of burden of proof does not arise in the instant case, as here the defendants voluntarily assumed that burden and the court below has held that it has been sustained. What is apposite, however, is the ruling in the Westinghouse case as to apportionment and the sort of evidence admissible upon that question. The Court pointed to the difficulties of working out an account of profits and thought that the problem was analogous to that presented where it is necessary to separate interstate from intrastate earnings and expenses in order to determine whether an intrastate rate is confiscatory. The Court observed that 'while recognizing the impossibility of reaching a conclusion that is mathematically exact', there has been received, in addition to other relevant evidence, 'the testimony of experts as to the relative costs of doing a local and through business'. Chicago, M. & St. P.R. Co. v. Tompkins, \n176 \nU.S. 167, 178\n, 20 S.Ct. 336, 340. The Court thought that 'What is permissible in an effort to separate costs may also be done in a patent case where it is necessary to separate profits'.\n The principle as to apportionment of profits was clearly stated in the case of Dowagiac Mfg. Company v. Minnesota Moline Plow Company, 235 \n\n[309 \nU.S. 390, 404]\n\u00a0\n U.S. 641, 35 S.Ct. 221,-a case which received great consideration. The Court there said:\n'We think the evidence, although showing that the invention was meritorious and materially contributed to the value of the infringing drills as marketable machines, made it clear that their value was not entirely attributable to the invention, but was due in a substantial degree to the unpatented parts or features. The masters and the courts below so found, and we should hesitate to disturb their concurring conclusions upon this question of fact, even had the evidence been less clear than it was.\n\n'In so far as the profits from the infringing sales were attributable to the patented improvements they belonged to the plaintiff, and in so far as they were due to other parts or features they belonged to the defendants. But as the drills were sold in completed and operative form, the profits resulting from the several parts were necessarily commingled. It was essential, therefore, that they be separated or apportioned between what was covered by the patent and what was not covered by it; for, as was said in Westinghouse Electric & Mfg. Co. v. Wagner Electric & Mfg. Co., supra (\n225 \nU.S. 615\n, 32 S.Ct. 694, 41 L.R.A.,N.S., 653): 'In such case, if plaintiff's patent only created a part of the profits, he is only entitled to recover that part of the net gains.\" Id., \n235 \nU.S. 646\n, 35 S.Ct. 223.\n\n In the Dowagiac case, we again referred to the difficulty of making an exact apportionment and again observed that mathematical exactness was not possible. What was required was only 'reasonable approximation' which usually may be attained 'through the testimony of experts and persons informed by observation and experience'. Testimony of this character was said to be 'generally helpful and at times indispensable in the solution of such problems'. The result to be accomplished 'is a rational separation of the net profits so that neither party may have what rightfully belongs to the other'. Id., 235 U.S. at page 647, 35 S.Ct. at page 223. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 390, 405]\n\u00a0\n We see no reason why these principles should not be applied in copyright cases. Petitioners cite our decision in the trademark case of Hamilton-Brown Shoe Company v. Wolf Brothers, \n240 \nU.S. 251\n, 36 S.Ct. 269, but the Court there, recognizing the rulings in the Westinghouse and Dowagiac cases, found on the facts that an apportionment of profits was 'inherently impossible'. The burden cast upon the defendant had not been sustained.\n In 1922, some years after the Dowagiac decision, and in harmony with it, Congress amended Section 70 of the patent law4 so as to provide expressly that if 'damages or profits are not susceptible of calculation and determination with reasonable certainty, the court may, on evidence tending to establish the same, in its discretion, receive opinion or expert testimony, which is hereby declared to be competent and admissible, subject to the general rules of evidence applicable to this character of testimony'. The amendment, so far as it relates to the reception of expert testimony, recognized and cannot be deemed to enlarge the rules already applied in courts of equity, and the fact that the copyright law was not similarly amended cannot be considered to detract from the jurisdiction of the Court to receive similar evidence in copyright cases whenever it is found to be competent.\n Petitioners stress the point that respondents have been found guilty of deliberate plagiarism, but we perceive no ground for saying that in awarding profits to the copyright proprietor as a means of compensation, the court may make an award of profits which have been shown not to be due to the infringement. That would be not to do equity but to inflict an unauthorized penalty. To call the infringer a trustee ex maleficio merely indicates 'a mode of approach and an imperfect analogy by which the wrongdoer will be made to hand over the \n\n[309 \nU.S. 390, 406]\n\u00a0\n proceeds of his wrong'. Larson Company v. Wm. Wrigley, Jr., Company, \n277 \nU.S. 97, 99\n, 100 S., 48 S.Ct. 449. He is in the position of one who has confused his own gains with those which belong to another. Westinghouse Electric & Mfg. Company v. Wagner Electric & Mfg. Company, supra, 225 U.S. at page 618, 32 S.Ct. at page 695, 41 L.R.A., N.S., 653. He 'must yield the gains begotten of his wrong'. Duplate Corporation v. Triplex Safety Glass Company, \n298 \nU.S. 448, 457\n, 56 S.Ct. 792, 796. Where there is a commingling of gains, he must abide the consequences, unless he can make a separation of the profits so as to assure to the injured party all that justly belongs to him. When such an apportionment has been fairly made, the copyright proprietor receives all the profits which have been gained through the use of the infringing material and that is all that the statute authorizes and equity sanctions.\n Both courts below have held in this case that but a small part of the profits were due to the infringement, and, accepting that fact and the principle that an apportionment may be had if the evidence justifies it, we pass to the consideration of the basis of the actual apportionment which has been allowed.\n Third.-The controlling fact in the determination of the apportionment was that the profits had been derived, not from the mere performance of a copyrighted play, but from the exhibition of a motion picture which had its distinctive profit-making features, apart from the use of any infringing material, by reason of the expert and creative operations involved in its production and direction. In that aspect the case has a certain resemblance to that of a patent infringement, where the infringer has created profits by the addition of non-infringing and valuable improvements. And, in this instance, it plainly appeared that what respondents had contributed accounted for by far the larger part of their gains.\n Respondents had stressed the fact that, although the negotiations had not ripened into a purchase, the price which had been set for the motion picture rights in 'Dis- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 390, 407]\n\u00a0\n honored Lady\" had been but $30,000. And respondents' witnesses cited numerous instances where the value, according to sales, of motion picture rights had been put at relatively small sums. But the court below rejected as a criterion the price put upon the motion picture rights, as a bargain had not been concluded and the inferences were too doubtful. The court also ruled that respondents could not count the effect of 'their standing and reputation in the industry'. The court permitted respondents to be credited 'only with such factors as they bought and paid for; the actors, the scenery, the producers, the directors and the general overhead'.\n The testimony showed quite clearly that in the creation of profits from the exhibition of a motion picture, the talent and popularity of the 'motion picture stars' generally constitutes the main drawing power of the picture, and that this is especially true where the title of the picture is not identified with any well-known play or novel. Here, it appeared that the picture did not bear the title of the copyrighted play and that it was not presented or advertised as having any connection whatever with the play. It was also shown that the picture had been 'sold', that is, licensed to almost all the exhibitors as identified simply with the name of a popular motion picture actress before even the title 'Letty Lynton' was used. In addition to the drawing power of the 'motion picture stars', other factors in creating the profits were found in the artistic conceptions and in the expert supervision and direction of the various processes which made possible the composite result with its attractiveness to the public.\n Upon these various considerations, with elaboration of detail, respondents' expert witnesses gave their views as to the extent to which the use of the copyrighted material had contributed to the profits in question. The underlying facts as to the factors in successful production and ex- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 390, 408]\n\u00a0\n hibition of motion pictures were abundantly proved, but, as the court below recognized, the ultimate estimates of the expert witnesses were only the expression '=of their very decided opinions'. These witnesses were in complete agreement that the portion of the profits attributable to the use of the copyrighted play in the circumstances here disclosed was very small. Their estimates given in percentages of receipts ran from five to twelve per cent; the estimate apparently most favored was ten per cent as the limit. One finally expressed the view that the play contributed nothing. There was no rebuttal. But the court below was not willing to accept the experts' testimony 'at its face value'. The court felt that is must make an award 'which by no possibility shall be too small'. Desiring to give petitioners the benefit of every doubt, the court allowed for the contribution of the play twenty per cent. of the net profits.\n Petitioners are not in a position to complain that the amount thus allowed by the court was greater than the expert evidence warranted. Nor is there any basis for attack, and we do not understand that any attack is made, upon the qualifications of the experts. By virtue of an extensive experience, they had an intimate knowledge of all pertinent facts relating to the production and exhibition of motion pictures. Nor can we say that the testimony afforded no basis for a finding. What we said in the Dowagiac case is equally true here,-that what is required is not mathematical exactness but only a reasonable approximation. That, after all, is a matter of judgment and the testimony of those who are informed by observation and experience may be not only helpful but, as we have said, may be indispensable. Equity is concerned with making a fair apportionment so that neither party will have what justly belongs to the other. Confronted with the manifest injustice of giving to petitioners all the profits made by the motion picture, the court in making \n\n[309 \nU.S. 390, 409]\n\u00a0\n an apportionment was entitled to avail itself of the experience of those best qualified to form a judgment in the particular field of inquiry and come to its conclusion aided by their testimony. We see no greater difficulty in the admission and use of expert testimony in such a case than in the countless cases involving values of property rights in which such testimony often forms the sole basis for decision.\n Petitioners also complain of deductions allowed in the computation of the net profits. These contentions involve questions of fact which have been determined below upon the evidence and we find no ground for disturbing the court's conclusions.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS took no part in the decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of March 4, 1909, sec. 25, 35 Stat. 1081, as amended by Act of August 24, 1912, 37 Stat. 489. 17 U.S.C.  25(b), 17 U.S.C.A.  25(b). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Act of July 8, 1870, sec. 55, 16 Stat. 198, 206, R.S.  4921, 35 U.

HIGHWAY DIST.(1940)\nNo. 267\nArgued: Decided: December 9, 1940\n\n\n\n\n[311 \nU.S. 180, 181]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Paul S. Marrin and Max Thelen, both of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioners.\n\n\n\n[311 \nU.S. 180, 183]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Archibald B. Tinning, of Martinez, Cal., and Theodore P. Wittschen, of Oakland, Cal., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[311 \nU.S. 180, 184]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Six Companies of California, a contractor, brought this suit against respondent, Joint Highway District No. 13, to recover the reasonable value of materials and labor furnished under a contract. The contractor had undertaken to rescind for alleged breach by respondent and had stopped work. Respondent answered, alleging wrongful abandonment of the contract and by cross-complaint sought damages against the contractor and its sureties.\n There was a clause in the contract for liquidated damages in the amount of $500 a day in case of delay in completion. \n1\n The District Court found against the con- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 180, 185]\n\u00a0\n tractor and its sureties and on the cross-complaint awarded damages which included $142,000 as liquidated damages for delay. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment. 9 Cir., 110 F.2d 620.\n Petitioners contended that under the law of California the clause providing for liquidated damages did not apply to delay which occurred after the abandonment of the work by the contractor. This contention was overruled. The Circuit Court of Appeals expressly recognized that its decision in that respect was contrary to the decision of the District Court of Appeal in California in the case of Sinnott v. Schumacher, 45 Cal. App. 46, 187 P. 105. But the Circuit Court of Appeals thought that decision wrong and refused to follow it. We granted certiorari limited to the question whether there was error in that ruling. October 14, 1940, \n311 \nU.S. 631\n, 61 S.Ct. 36, 85 L.Ed. --.\n In Sinnott v. Schumacher, supra, the suit was brought to recover the value of labor and materials furnished under a building contract. After part performance the contractor gave notice of rescission and abandoned work because of failure to receive the first installment of the agreed payment. Defendants denied that the installment was due and filed a cross- complaint against the contractor and his surety asking damages because of the abandonment of the work. The trial court found against the plaintiff on his complaint and in favor of the defendants on their cross-complaint, and entered judgment for damages. The District Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment. The Supreme Court of the State denied a petition for hearing in that court.\n On the appeal to the District Court of Appeal, the plaintiff- appellant contended that the trial court erred as to the amount of the damages awarded, basing his contention upon the clause in the contract which provided for liquidated damages in a stipulated amount per day \n\n[311 \nU.S. 180, 186]\n\u00a0\n in case of delay in completion. \n2\n The District Court of Appeal held that the clause had no application to a case where the contract had been abandoned without sufficient cause. The court said (45 Cal.App. 46, 187 P. 108): 'As to the appellants' contention that the court was in error in its finding and conclusion as to the amount of damages sustained by the defendants and cross-complainants by reason of the plaintiff's unjustified abandonment of work upon said building, and his failure, neglect, and refusal to complete the same it may be stated that this contention is based upon the clause in the contract which relates to the matter of delay in the time of completion of said building and which purports to fix a penalty of \n\n[311 \nU.S. 180, 187]\n\u00a0\n $50 per day for such delay; but this provision of the contract has no application to a condition wherein the contractor is shown to have abandoned his contract without sufficient cause, in which case the right of the defendants to damages as a result of the plaintiff's breach of said contract could not be affected or limited by said provision of the contract for a penalty for delay in the completion of the structure beyond the stipulated time for such completion.' \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Respondent urges that what was said by the District Court of Appeal in the Sinnott case with respect to the liquidated damage clause was a mere dictum. We do not so regard it. This part of the opinion of the court was its answer to the appellants' insistence that the judgment on appeal was erroneous because the liquidated damage clause had been disregarded and damages had been awarded in excess of the amount for which the contract provided. What the court said as to this was a statement of the ground of its decision. It was a statement of the law of California as applied to the facts before the court. It is said that there is a difference between the two cases. That difference appears to be that in the instant case the owner is seeking to apply the liquidated damage clause in order to recover from the contractor, while in the Sinnott case the contractor was seeking to limit the damage recoverable against him to the amount agreed upon. But, so far as the question concerns the applicability of the liquidated damage clause, the difference would not seem to be material, as by the terms of the clause in each case it appears to be intended to bind both parties when applicable. The ruling as to the law of California as \n\n[311 \nU.S. 180, 188]\n\u00a0\n applied by the state court was that the stipulation in the contract as to the amount of damages in case of delay in completion was not applicable ( 110 F.2d 626) to delay after the contractor had abandoned the work. As the Circuit Court of Appeals said, that decision 'is adverse to ours'.\n The decision in the Sinnott case was made in 1919. We have not been referred to any decision of the Supreme Court of California to the contrary. We thus have an announcement of the state law by an intermediate appellate court in California in a ruling which apparently has not been disapproved, and there is no convincing evidence that the law of the State is otherwise. We have fully discussed the principle involved in the cases of West v. American Telephone and Telegraph Co., \n311 \nU.S. 223\n, 61 S.Ct. 179, and Fidelity Union Trust Co. v. Field, \n311 \nU.S. 169\n, 61 S.Ct. 176, decided this day, and further amplification is unnecessary. See, also, Rindge Co. v. Los Angeles County, \n262 \nU.S. 700, 708\n, 43 S.Ct. 689, 693; Tipton v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe R. Co., \n298 \nU.S. 141, 151\n, 56 S.Ct. 715, 718, 104 A.L.R. 831. The Circuit Court of Appeals should have followed the decision of the state court in Sinnott v. Schumacher with respect to the inapplicability of the liquidated damage clause in the event of the abandonment of work under the contract, and its judgment to the contrary is reversed. The cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] That clause provided:\n'(d) Damages for Delay.-The Parties hereto expressly stipulate and agree that time is the essence of this contract. In case the work is not completed within the time specified in the contract or within such extensions of the contract time as may be allowed as herein provided, it is distinctly understood and agreed that the contractor shall pay the District as agreed and liquidated damages and not as a penalty five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each and every working day which may elapse between the limiting date as herein provided and the date of actual completion of the work, said sum being specifically agreed upon as a measure of the damage, to the District by reason of delay in the completion of the work; it being expressly stipulated and agreed that it would be impracticable to estimate and ascertain the actual damages sustained by the District under such circumstances, and the Contractor agrees and consents that the amount of such liquidated damages so fixed, shall be deducted and retained by the District from any money then due, or thereafter to become due, the Contractor'. \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The clause for liquidated damages in the contract in the Sinnott case was as follows:\n'Should the Contractor fail to complete this contract and the work provided for within the time set for completion as aforesaid, due allowance being made for the contingencies provided for herein, he shall then become liable to the Owner for all loss and damages which the Owner may suffer on account thereof, in the sum of Ten Dollars per day, which the Contractor hereby agrees to deduct from his contract price, for each day that the work shall remain unfinished beyond such time for completion, and the Owner agrees to pay to the Contractor a bonus of Ten Dollars ($10) for each day that the work may be completed before the time aforesaid for the completion.\n\n'The agreement in this paragraph made for damages is made as herein set forth for the reason that the actual damage which will be sustained by the Owner by reason of the Contractor's breach of the covenant to complete this contract within the time stated is from the nature of the case impracticable and extremely difficult to fix; and one of the considerations moving the Owner to enter into this contract with the Contractor is the agreement of the Contractor to complete his said contract within the time herein stated and the liquidated damages herein above stated for his failure to do so'.\n\n The plaintiff's contention under this clause was that the delay in completion was not more than five days the damage for which under the contract would amount to $50. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Compare Bacigalupi v.

STATE OF TEXAS(1940)\nNo. 33\nArgued: November 14, 1940Decided: November 25, 1940\n\n\n\n Mandate Conformed to Jan. 8, 1941\n\n\n See 147 S.W.2d 1118.\n Messrs. Sam W. Davis, William A. Vinson, and Harry W. Freeman, all of Houston, Tex., for petitioner.\n Mr. George W. Barcus, of Austin, Tex., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In Harris County, Texas, where petitioner, a negro, was indicted and convicted of rape, negroes constitute \n\n[311 \nU.S. 128, 129]\n\u00a0\n over 20 per cent of the population, and almost 10 per cent of the poll-tax payers; a minimum of from three to six thousand of them measure up to the qualifications prescribed by Texas statutes for grand jury service. The court clerk, called as a state witness and testifying from court records covering the years 1931 through 1938, showed that only 5 of the 384 grand jurors who served during that period were negroes; that of 512 persons summoned for grand jury duty, only 18 were negroes; that of these 18 the names of 13 appeared as the last name on the 16 man jury list, the custom being to select the 12 man grand jury in the order that the names appeared on the list; that of the 5 negroes summoned for grand jury service who were not given the number 16, 4 were given numbers between 13 and 16, and 1 was number 6; that the result of this numbering was that of the 18 negroes summoned, only 5 ever served, whereas 379 of the 494 white men summoned actually served; that of 32 grand juries empanelled, only 5 had negro members, while 27 had none; that of these 5, the same individual served 3 times, so that only 3 individual negroes served at all; that there had been no negroes on any of the grand juries in 1938, the year petitioner was indicted; that there had been none on any of the grand juries in 1937; that the service of negroes by years had been: 1931, 1; 1932, 2; 1933, 1; 1934, 1; 1935, none; 1936, 1; 1937, none; 1938, none.\n It is petitioner's contention that his conviction was based on an indictment obtained in violation of the provision of the Fourteenth Amendment that 'No state Articles 333-350, Vernon's Ann.C.C.P. jurisdiction the equal protection of the three grand jury commissioners are appointed; was denied him rests on a charge that negroes were in 1938 and long prior thereto intentionally and systematically excluded from grand jury service solely on account of their race and color. That a conviction based upon an indictment returned by a jury so \n\n[311 \nU.S. 128, 130]\n\u00a0\n selected is a denial of equal protection is well settled,1 and is not challenged by the state. But both the from different parts of the county; they of Appeals were of opinion that the evidence failed to support the charge of racial discrimination. For that reason the Appellate Court approved the trial court's action in denying petitioner's timely motion to quash the indictment. 2 But the question decided rested upon a charge of denial of equal protection, a basic right protected by the Federal Constitution. And it is therefore our responsibility to appraise the evidence as it relates to this constitutional right. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n It is part of the established tradition in the use of juries as instruments of public justice that the jury be a body truly representative of the community. For racial discrimination to result in the exclusion from jury service of otherwise qualified groups not only violates our Constitution and the laws enacted under it4 but is at war with our basic concepts of a democratic society and a representative government. We must consider this record in the light of these important principles. The fact that the written words of a state's laws hold out a promise that no such discrimination will be practiced is not enough. The Fourteenth Amendment requires that equal protection to all must be given-not merely promised.\n Here, the Texas statutory scheme is not in itself unfair; it is capable of being carried out with no racial dis- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 128, 131]\n\u00a0\n crimination whatsoever. \n5\n But by reason of the wide discretion permissible in the various steps of the plan, it is equally capable of being applied in such a manner as practically to proscribe any group thought by the law's administrators to be undesirable. And from the record before us the conclusion is inescapable that it is the latter application that has prevailed in Harris County. Chance and accident alone could hardly have brought about the listing for grand jury service of so few negroes from among the thousands shown by the undisputed evidence to possess the legal qualifications for jury service. Nor could chance and accident have been responsible for the combination of circumstances under which a negro's name, when listed at all, almost invariably appeared as number 16, and under which number 16 was never called for service unless it proved impossible to obtain the required jurors from the first 15 names on the list.\n The state argues that the testimony of the commissioners themselves shows that there was no arbitrary or systematic exclusion. And it is true that two of the three commissioners who drew the September, 1938, panel testified to that effect. Both of them admitted that they did not select any negroes, although the subject was discussed, but both categorically denied that they intentionally, arbitrarily or systematically discriminated against negro jurors as such. One said that their failure \n\n[311 \nU.S. 128, 132]\n\u00a0\n to select negroes was because they did not know the names of any who were qualified and the other said the he was not personally acquainted with any member of the negro race. This is, at best, the testimony of two individuals who participated in drawing 1 out of the 32 jury panels discussed in the record. But even if their testimony were given the greatest possible effect, and their situation considered typical of that of the 94 commissioners who did not testify, we would still feel compelled to reverse the decision below. What the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits is racial discrimination in the selection of grand juries. Where jury commissioners limit those from whom grand juries are selected to their own personal acquaintance, discrimination can arise from commissioners who know no negroes as well as from commissioners who know but eliminate them. If there has been discrimination, whether accomplished ingeniously or ingenuously, the conviction cannot stand.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Pierre v.

Orr, of San Francisco, Cal., for respondent. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 281, 282]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals declared respondent's reissue patent No. 20,024, for a nut treating apparatus, valid and infringed by petitioner's use of the accused machine, and rejected the defense of intervening rights. The record requires us to consider what effect an enlarged inclusive reissue claim has upon the use of a machine manufactured and operated after grant of the original patent without infringing it, but which does come within the enlargement.\n Kohler's patent-No. 1,958,409-with four narrow claims, issued May 15, 1934\n\n\n Petitioner procured and began to use the machine here accused about April 1, 1935. It first obtained actual knowledge of the original patent October 8, 1935 when notice of infringement was received. Nothing shows earlier knowledge by the manufacturer who began to make and sell like machines not later than August 1934.\n By suit filed in the District Court, October 19, 1935, respondent charged petitioner with infringing the original patent, and asked appropriate relief. Infringement was denied by answer, November 22, 1935.\n January 15, 1936 respondent applied for and on June 30, 1936 obtained a reissue patent-No. 20,024-with seventeen claims. The first four were identical with the original ones; thirteen of broader scope cover petitioner's machine. Respondent was moved to obtain the reissue by petitioner's use of the accused machine.\n January 26, 1937 respondent began another proceeding charging infringement of the enlarged claims. Petitioner's answer relied upon intervening rights acquired through public use without violating the original patent; also, invalidity of the reissue because of laches. The two \n\n[310 \nU.S. 281, 283]\n\u00a0\n suits were consolidated; claims 1 to 4 were not relied on. A single decree went for petitioner. Both bills were dismissed.\n Infringement of respondent's design patent No. 89,347-February 28, 1933-was alleged, but both courts declared it not infringed. No point in respect of it is before us.\n The District Court held 'That with respect to Kohler Reissue Letters Patent No. 20,024 in suit, this defendant and those in privity with it, including the manufacturer of the machine in question, acquired intervening rights which in equity plaintiff may not now disturb.' The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and directed a remand. 9 Cir., 107 F.2d 318.\n The cause is here by certiorari. Petitioner asserts the reissue patent is void because of laches; also that by reason of acquired intervening rights, use of the accused machine may continue.\n The provision concerning reissues in the present Patent Act, Section 4916 Revised Statutes, as amended by Act May 24, 1928, c. 730, 45 Stat. 732, U.S.C.A. Title 35, sec. 64, is copied in the margin. \n1\n It derives through the Acts July 3, \n\n[310 \nU.S. 281, 284]\n\u00a0\n 1832, c. 162, sec. 3, 4 Stat. 559; July 4, 1836, c. 357, sec. 13, 5 Stat. 117, 122; March 3, 1837, c. 45, sec. 5, 5 Stat. 191, 192; July 8, 1870, c. 230, sec. 53, 16 Stat. 198, 205.\n The reissue provision, Act 1832, was supplanted without change presently important by the corresponding one in the 1836 Act. This was substantially reenacted in 1870. Modifications by the 1928 Act are not important here. Stimpson v. West Chester Railroad Co., 1846, 4 How. 380, 402; Parker & Whipple Co. v. Yale Clock Co., 1887, \n123 \nU.S. 87, 96\n, 8 S.Ct. 38, 43; Walker on Patents, Deller's Edition ( 1937), Vol. 2, p. 1342. Robinson on Patents (1890) Vol. 2, sec. 653 et seq.\n These provisions have often been before the courts and there are sharply differing views concerning them. Some of the pertinent cases are noted below. 2 \n\n[310 \nU.S. 281, 285]\n\u00a0\n The Circuit Court of Appeals after holding the enlarged reissue claims valid and infringed further declared 'In the instant case there was admittedly no knowledge of or reliance on the scope of plaintiff's patent, and no facts creating an estoppel. Furthermore, defendant has not shown a two-years user of the infringing patent. The defense of intervening rights is denied.'\n For present purposes we assume, without deciding, correctness of the conclusion that the reissue patent was valid and infringed, and upon that assumption, we come to consider the effect of the enlarged claims upon petitioner's machine, lawfully manufactured and operated prior to their inception. There is nothing to show dishonesty, bad faith, or deceptive intention upon petitioner's part.\n Counsel for respondent insist the denial of intervening rights finds adequate support in Stimpson v. West Chester Railroad Co., supra; Battin v. Taggert, supra; White v. Dunbar, supra; Topliff v. Topliff, supra; Abercrombie & Fitch Co. v. Baldwin, supra. The first two are in point; but when considered in connection with later opinions are not decisive of the present issue. The other cases relied upon are not especially helpful. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 281, 286]\n\u00a0\n The Patent Act of 1832 was a response to Grant et al. v. Raymond, Feb. 23, 1832, 6 Pet. 218, 242, 243, 244. The opinion there (Chief Justice Marshall) affirmed the power of the Secretary to grant an application dated April 20, 1825 for reissue of a patent dated August 11, 1821 although not expressly authorized so to do, upon the ground that this was necessary in order to effect the purposes of the Patent Act by securing to inventors full benefit of their discoveries through 'faithful execution of the solemn promise made by the United States.' The court said-\n'An objection much relied on is, that after the invention has been brought into general use, those skilled in the art or science with which it is connected, perceiving the variance between the specification and the machine, and availing themselves of it, may have constructed, sold and used the machine without infringing the legal rights of the patentee, or incurring the penalties of the law. The new patent would retroact on them, and expose them to penalties to which they were not liable when the act was committed.'\n\n'This objection is more formidable in appearance than in reality. It is not probable that the defect in the specification can be so apparent as to be perceived by any but those who examine it for the purpose of pirating the invention. They are not entitled to much favor. But the answer to the objection is that this defense is not made in this case; and the opinion of the Circuit Court does not go so far as to say that such a defense would not be successful. That question is not before the court, and is not involved in the opinion we are considering. The defense when true in fact may be sufficient in law, notwithstanding the validity of the new patent.'\n\n Under the two year rule of Miller v. Bridgeport Brass Co., 1881, supra, note 2, a reissue patent granted in circumstances \n\n[310 \nU.S. 281, 287]\n\u00a0\n like those disclosed by the report of Grant's case, now would be declared invalid.\n Stimpson v. West Chester Railroad Co., 1846, supra, note 2, involved infringement of a reissue, granted in 1835, of an original patent dated in 1831. The trial judge charged the jury 'It clearly appears that the defendants constructed their railroad with the plaintiff's curves in 1834, one year or more before the plaintiff's application for his renewed patent; consequently, they may continue its use without liability to the plaintiff.' (4 How. 402.)\n This was declared in conflict with the reissue provision Act of 1832 and the corresponding one in the 1836 Act. The two are declared substantially alike. The Court said 'It is plain that no prior use of the defective patent can authorize the use of the invention after the emanation of the renewed patent under the above section. To give to the patentee the fruits of his invention was the object of the provision; and this object would be defeated, if a right could be founded on a use subsequent to the original patent and prior to the renewed one. ... Now any person using an invention protected by a renewed patent subsequently to the date of this act is guilty of an infringement, however long he may have used the same after the date of the defective and surrendered patent.'\n Battin v. Taggert, 1854, supra, note 2, reaffirmed Stimpson v. West Chester R. Co., and disapproved the following instruction to the jury 'That a description, by the applicant, for a patent of a machine, or a part of a machine, in his specification, unaccompanied by notice that he has rights in it as inventor, or that he desires to secure title to it as a patentee, is a dedication of it to the public. ... That such a dedication cannot be revoked, after the machine has passed into public use, either by surrender and reissue, or otherwise.' (17 How. 83.) \n\n[310 \nU.S. 281, 288]\n\u00a0\n The Court said 'Whether the defect be in the specifications or in the claim, under the 13th section (Act 1836) above cited, the patentee may surrender his patent, and, by an amended specification or claim, cure the defect. The reissued patent must be for the same invention, substantially, though it be described in terms more precise and accurate than in the first patent. Under such circumstances, a new and different invention cannot be claimed. But where the specification or claim is made so vaguely as to be inoperative and invalid, yet an amendment may give to it validity, and protect the rights of the patentee against all subsequent infringements.\n'So strongly was this remedy of the patentee recommended, by a sense of justice and of policy, that this court, in the case of Grant v. Raymond, 6 Pet. 218 (8 L.Ed. 376), sustained a reissued and corrected patent, before any legislative provision was made on the subject. ...\n\n'How much stronger is a case under the statute, which secures the rights of the patentee by a surrender, and declares the effect of the reissued and corrected patent? By the defects provided for in the statute, nothing passes to the public from the specifications or claims, within the scope of the patentee's invention. And this may be ascertained by the language he uses.'\n\n Miller v. Bridgeport Brass Co., 1881, supra, note 2, departing from th view expressed in Battin v. Taggert concerning omissions in claims, declared-\n'But it must be remembered that the claim of a specific device or combination, and an omission to claim other devices or combinations apparent on the face of the patent, are, in law, a dedication to the public of that which is not claimed. It is a declaration that that which is not claimed is either not the patentee's invention, or, if his, he dedicates it to the public. This legal effect of the patent cannot be revoked unless the patentee sur- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 281, 289]\n\u00a0\n renders it and proves that the specification was framed by real inadvertence, accident, or mistake, without any fraudulent or deceptive intention on his part; and this should be done with all due diligence and speed. Any unnecessary laches or delay in a matter thus apparent on the record affects the right to alter or reissue the patent for such cause. If two years' public enjoyment of an invention with the consent and allowance of the inventor is evidence of abandonment, and a bar to an application for a patent, a public disclaimer in the patent itself should be construed equally favorable to the public. Nothing but a clear mistake, or inadvertence, and a speedy application for its correction, is admissible when it is sought merely to enlarge the claim.\n\n'We think it clear that it was not the special purpose of the legislation on this subject to authorize the surrender of patents for the purpose of reissuing them with broader and more comprehensive claims, although, under the general terms of the law, such a reissue may be made where it clearly appears that an actual mistake has inadvertently been made. But by a curious misapplication of the law it has come to be principally resorted to for the purpose of enlarging and expanding patent claims. And the evils which have grown from the practice have assumed large proportions. Patents have been so expanded and idealized, years after their first issue, that hundreds and thousands of mechanics and manufacturers, who had just reason to suppose that the field of action was open, have been obliged to discontinue their employments, or to pay an enormous tax for continuing them.' (\n104 \nU.S. 352\n.)\n\n Mahn v. Harwood, 1884, supra, note 2, reaffirms Miller v. Bridgeport Brass Company, and declares (\n112 \nU.S. 354\n, 5 S.Ct. 178)-\n'The public is notified and informed, by the most solemn act on the part of the patentee, that his claim to invention is for such and such an element or combina- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 281, 290]\n\u00a0\n tion, and for nothing more. Of course, what is not claimed is public property. The presumption is, and such is generally the fact, that what is not claimed was not invented by the patentee, but was known and used before he made his invention. But, whether so or not, his own act has made it public property, if it was not so before. The patent itself, as soon as it is issued, is the evidence of this. The public has the undoubted right to use, and it is to be presumed does use, what is not specifically claimed in the patent. Every day that passes after the issue of the patent adds to the strength of this right, and increases the barrier against subsequent expansion of the claim by reissue under a pretense of inadvertence and mistake. ...\n\n'The truth is (as was shown in Miller v. Bridgeport Brass Company) that this class of cases, namely, reissues for the purpose of enlarging and expanding the claim of a patent, was not comprised within the literal terms of the law which created the power to reissue patents. But since the purpose of the statute undoubtedly was to provide that kind of relief which courts of equity have always given in cases of clear accident and mistake in the drawing up of written instruments, it may fairly be inferred that a mistake in a patent whereby the claim is made too narrow, is within the equity if not within the words of the statute. Yet no court of equity, considering all the interests involved, would ever grant relief in such a case without due diligence and promptness on the part of the patentee in seeking to have the error corrected. It is just one of those cases in which laches and unnecessary delay would be held to be a bar to such relief. And in extending the equity of the statute so as to embrace the case, the courts should not overlook or disregard the conditions on which alone courts of equity would take any action, and also on which alone the \n\n[310 \nU.S. 281, 291]\n\u00a0\n commissioner of patents has any power to grant a reissue.'\n\n See Clements v. Odorless Excavating Apparatus Co., 1884, \n109 \nU.S. 641, 649\n, 650 S., 3 S.Ct. 525, 530, 531; Turner & Seymour Co. v. Dover Stamp'g Co., 1884, \n111 \nU.S. 319, 326\n, 327 S., 4 S.Ct. 401, 404, 405; Coon v. Wilson, 1885, \n113 \nU.S. 268, 277\n, 5 S.Ct. 537, 541.\n Topliff v. Topliff, 1892, supra, note 2, recognizes that a valid reissue patent with enlarged claims may be granted, when the original is inoperative, under condition 'Second. That due diligence must be exercised in discovering the mistake in the original patent, and that, if it be sought for the purpose of enlarging the claim, the lapse of two years will ordinarily, though not always, be treated as evidence of an abandonment of the new matter to the public to the same extent that a failure by the inventor to apply for a patent within two years from the public use or sale of his invention is regarded by the statute as conclusive evidence of an abandonment of the patent to the public.' (\n145 \nU.S. 156\n, 12 S.Ct. 831.)\n In Dunham v. Dennison Manufacturing Co., 1894, supra, note 2, infringement was alleged of a reissue, dated June 10, 1884, of an original patent issued May 8, 1883, for 'a new and improved combined tag and envelope.' This Court said (\n154 \nU.S. 103\n, 14 S.Ct. 989) 'The patent of May 8, 1883, was expressly and distinctly, both in the specification and in the claims, limited to an envelope with an opening at one end; with a flap, attached to the envelope at that end, of sufficient size to cover the whole of that side of the envelope in which the opening was .... The patentee thus gave the public to understand that an envelope, the flap of which did not cover its whole length, would not come within his patent, and might rightfully be made by any one. After the defendant had made envelopes with a short flap, of \n\n[310 \nU.S. 281, 292]\n\u00a0\n semicircular shape and covering little more than the opening of the envelope (which, it is admitted, did not infringe the plaintiff's patent, as originally issued), the plaintiff obtained a reissue, enlarging the claims, and altering the specification throughout, so as to include an envelope with a flap of any size or shape, and to make the invention consist, not, as in the leading words of the description in the original patent, of 'an envelope with an end flap covering its side,' but in 'a tag provided with means for attaching it to the merchandise, and with an envelope or pocket to receive a bill or invoice of the merchandise.' The words of the description in the original patent were neither technical nor complicated, but they were of the simplest kind, and their meaning and scope could not have been misunderstood by any one who read them with the slightest attention, least of all, by the patentee. To uphold such a reisue under such circumstances would be to grant a new and distinct privilege to the patentee, at the expense of innocent parties, and would be inconsistent with the whole course of recent decisions in this court.'\n Abercrombie & Fitch Co. v. Baldwin, 1917, supra, note 2, declared a reissue claim was not an enlargement and held the defendant guilty of violating the patent as originally written.\n In Keller v. Adams-Campbell Co., 1924, supra, note 2, certiorari was dismissed. The Chief Justice pointed out that the question of intervening rights while not free from difficulties, was not before the Court. It decided nothing presently important.\n The opinions reviewed above will suffice to indicate the progressive efforts of the court to meet problems incident to our rapidly expanding patent system. From a small State Department bureau in 1836, the Patent Office has expanded until in 1939 over 40,000 patents were granted-in 1838, 515 were granted. Although of immense impor- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 281, 293]\n\u00a0\n tance, the system has become exceedingly complex. Questions relative to reissued patents have long been vexatious to those immediately concerned with administration of the patent laws.\n Miller v. Bridgeport Brass Company, supra, pointed out that 'the evils which have grown from the practice (reissues) have assumed large proportions. Patents have been so expanded and idealized, years after their first issue, that hundreds and thousands of mechanics and manufacturers, who had just reason to suppose that the field of action was open, have been obliged to discontinue their employments, or to pay an enormous tax for continuing them.'\n It is now accepted doctrine that 'the claim of a specific device or combination, and an omission to claim other devices or combinations apparent on the face of the patent, are, in law, a dedication to the public of that which is not claimed.' 'This legal effect of the patent cannot be revoked unless the patentee surrenders it and proves that the specification was framed by real inadvertence, accident, or mistake, ....' Also, that a reissue with enlarged claims, not applied for within the two years after the original, is void in the absence of extraordinary exculpating circumstances.\n In the case under consideration the patentee might have inclued in the application for the original patent, claims broad enough to embrace petitioner's accused machine, but did not. This 'gave the public to understand' that whatever was not claimed 'did not come within his patent and might rightfully be made by anyone'. The enlarged claims were presented with knowledge of the accused machine and definite purpose to include it.\n Recapture within two years of what a patentee dedicates to the public through omission is permissible under specified conditions, but not, we think, 'at the expense of \n\n[310 \nU.S. 281, 294]\n\u00a0\n innocent parties.' Otherwise, the door is open for gross injustice to alert inventors and baffling uncertainty will hinder orderly development of useful arts.\n The District Court properly ruled that petitioner had 'acquired intervening rights which in equity plaintiff (respondent here) might not now disturb.'\n In Ashland Fire Brick Co. v. General Refractories Co., 6 Cir., 1928, 27 F.2d 744, 745, 746, the matter of 'Intervening Rights' was lucidly discussed. The opinion states the case thus 'This is the usual suit for infringement, based upon reissue patent No. 15,889, August 12, 1924, to Tackett, for a brick machine. The defense chiefly relied upon in the court below and here is that, between the date of the original issue and the application for the broadened reissue, the defendant had built and begun to operate its machines in a form which was not covered by the original patent, even though it were by the reissue, and that the defendants had thus acquired such a right, intervening with reference to the original and reissue, as to make it inequitable to enforce against it the later and broader monopoly'.\n And he concluded 'Because the claims of the original patent were limited as to the form of conveyor, and because after the issue of the original patent and with knowledge of it and expressly appreciating its limited character, indeed, being governed therein by the advice of patent counsel, the defendant built a noninfringing brick machine, and still before the reissue application another one, at a substantial expense, and put them into commercial use on a large scale by extensively selling their product, and thus made them substantially material to its manufacturing business, the defendant thereby acquired at least a right \n\n[310 \nU.S. 281, 295]\n\u00a0\n to continue to use these two machines as if it held a license therefor under the reissued patent.'\n We think this conclusion was right and appropriate in the circumstance presented.\n In the instant case the accused machine went into operation when the owner had no actual knowledge of the original patent; but that circumstance we think ought not to defeat the defense based upon intervening rights. All patents must 'be recorded, together with the specifications, in the Patent Office in books to be kept for that purpose.' U.S.C.A. Title 35, sec. 39. Constructive notice of their existence goes thus to all the world. Boyden v. Burke, 1852, 14 How. 575, 582; Wine Ry. Appliance Co. v. Enterprise prise Ry. Equipment Co., 1936, \n297 \nU.S. 387, 393\n, 56 S.Ct. 528, 529, Walker on Patents, Deller's edition (1937) Vol. 3, p. 2176. In consequence the owner of the machine here accused operated it with implied knowledge of the original patent and may justly claim whatever privileges would follow actual knowledge.\n Grant et al. v. Raymond, supra, speaks disparagingly of one who having obtained knowledge of an invention from a patent thereafter appropriates what might have been claimed but was not. In the different conditions of today that observation would not be appropriate. We cannot conclude that one so circumstanced occupies a position superior toan honest inventor or user who has acted with implied but no actual knowledge of a recorded patent. 'The purpose of the statute undoubtedly was to provide that kind of relief which courts of equity have always given in cases of clear accident and mistake in the drawing up of written instruments,' and these courts are always tender of rights claimed by innocent parties. 'A sense of justice and of policy' shelters them.\n The possibility of defeating a charge of infringement by establishing intervening rights is adumbrated in Grant \n\n[310 \nU.S. 281, 296]\n\u00a0\n v. Raymond, supra, 'The defense when true in fact may be sufficient in law, notwithstanding the validity of the new patent.'\n The challenged judgment must be reversed with a remand to the Circuit Court of Appeals for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Whenever any patent is wholly or partly inoperative or invalid, by reason of a defective or insufficient specification, or by reason of the patentee claiming as his own invention or discovery more than he had a right to claim as new, if the error has arisen by inadvertence, accident, or mistake, and without any fraudulent or deceptive intention, the commissioner shall, on the surrender of such patent and the payment of the duty required by law, cause a patent for the same invention, and in accordance with the corrected specification, to be reissued to the patentee or to his assigns or legal representatives, for the unexpired part of the term of the original patent. Such surrender shall take effect upon the issue of the reissued patent, but in so far as the claims of the original and reissued patents are identical, such surrender shall not affect any action then pending nor abate any cause of action then existing, an the reissued patent to the extent that its claims are identical with the original patent shall constitute a continuation thereof and have effect continuously from the date of the original patent. The commissioner may, in his discretion, cause several patents to be issued for distinct and separate parts of the thing patented, upon demand of the applicant, and upon payment of the required fee for a reissue for each of such reissued letters patent. The specifications and claims in every such case shall be subject to revision and restriction in the same manner as original applications are. Every patent so reissued, together with the corrected specifications, shall have the same effect and operation in law, on the trial of all actions for causes thereafter arising, as if the same had been originally filed in such corrected form; but no new matter shall be introduced into the specification, nor in case of a machine patent shall the model or drawings be amended, except each by the other; but when there is neither model nor drawing, amendments may be made upon proof satisfactory to the commissioner that such new matter or amendment was a part of the original invention, and was omitted from the specification by inadvertence, accident, or mistake, as aforesaid.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Stimpson v.

His widow was awarded compensation by the deputy commissioner under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act. \n1\n The deputy commissioner found that decedent was performing services on the vessel as a laborer and fell from the vessel into the water. The employer and its surety brought suit in the District Court to restrain the enforcement of the award, contending that decedent was employed as a member of the crew and hence that compensation was not payable. The District Court granted a trial de novo and finding that the decedent was a member of the crew vacated the award.\n The Court of Appeals found that the evidence before the District Court was similar to that heard by the deputy commissioner; that the facts were not in dispute; that the District Court in reviewing the finding of the deputy commissioner was precluded from weighing the evidence, being required to examine the record and ascertain whether there was any evidence to support the commissioner's finding. Holding that there was such evidence, the Court of Appeals reversed the decree of the District Court and directed the dismissal of the bill of complaint. 7 Cir., 104 F. 2d 522. Because of an alleged conflict with a decision of the Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit in the case of Maryland Casualty Co. v. Lawson, 94 F.2d 190, we granted certiorari. \n308 \nU.S. 532\n, 60 S.Ct. 107, 84 L.Ed. --, October 9, 1939\n\n\n\n\n[309 \nU.S. 251, 254]\n\u00a0\n The statute provides specifically in Section 3 as to 'Coverage', that no compensation shall be payable in respect of the disability or death of a 'master or member of a crew of any vessel'.2 And these persons were excluded from the definition of the term employee. Sec. 2(3).3\n It appears that the vessel was a lighter of 312 net tons used for fueling steamboats and other marine equipment. It was licensed to operate in the Calumet River and Harbor and in the Indiana River and Harbor. The Court of Appeals thus summarized its operations (104 F.2d 524): 'It supplied coal to other vessels on their order, each operation consuming only a couple of hours. It had no sleeping or eating quarters. Its certificate of inspection required that 'Included in the entire crew hereinafter specified and designated there must be 1 licensed master and pilot, 1 licensed chief engineer, 3 seamen, 1 fireman.' If deceased were counted as a member of the crew, the full complement of the ship was present. Otherwise not'. The captain testified before the deputy commissioner that he had five men on the boat with him, one \n\n[309 \nU.S. 251, 255]\n\u00a0\n engineer, fireman and three 'deckhands', the decedent being one of the latter. The Court of Appeals described his chief task as 'facilitating the flow of coal from his boat to the vessel being fueled-removing obstructions to the flow with a stick. He performed such additional tasks as throwing the ship's rope in releasing or making the boat fast. He performed no navigation duties. He occasionally did some cleaning of the boat. He did no work while the boat was en route from dock to the vessel to be fueled.' The Court of Appeals thought it significant that his only duty relating to navigation was the incidental task of throwing the ship's line; that his primary duty was to free the coal if it stuck in the hopper while being discharged into the fueled vessel while both boats were at rest; that he had no duties while the boat was in motion; that he was paid an hourly wage; that he had no 'articles'; that he slept at home and boarded off ship; that he was called very early in the morning each day as he was wanted; that while he had worked only three weeks, and it might have been possible that he would have been retained for years to come, his employment was somewhat akin to temporary employment.\n In Nogueira v. New York, New Haven & Hartford R. Co., \n281 \nU.S. 128\n, 50 S.Ct. 303, we had occasion to consider the purpose and scope of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act. Its general scheme was to provide compensation to employees engaged in maritime employment, except as stated, for disability or death resulting from injury occurring upon the navigable waters of the United States where recovery through workmen's compensation proceedings might not validly be provided by state law. We had held that one engaged as a stevedore in loading a ship lying in port in navigable waters was performing a maritime service and that the rights and liabilities of the parties were matters within the admiralty jurisdiction. Atlantic Transport Co. of West Virginia v. Imbrovek, \n234 \nU.S. 52\n, 34 S.Ct. 733, 51 L.R.A.,N.S., 1157. But \n\n[309 \nU.S. 251, 256]\n\u00a0\n the Court had also held that in the case of a longshoreman who was injured on the land, although engaged in unloading a vessel, the local law governed and hence the workmen's compensation law of the state applied. State Industrial Commission v. Nordenholt Corporation, \n259 \nU.S. 263\n, 42 S. Ct. 473, 25 A.L.R. 1013. The distinction had thus been maintained between injuries on land and those suffered by persons engaged in maritime employment on a vessel in navigable waters. As to the latter, no doubt was entertained of the power of Congress to modify the admiralty law and to provide for the payment by employers of compensation. \n4\n And in thus providing Congress had constitutional authority to define the classes of such employees who should receive compensation and to exclude those described in Section 3. Nogueira v. New York, N.H. & H.R. Co., supra.\n The legislative history of the exception now before us throws light upon the intention of Congress. For those employees who are entitled to compensation, the remedy under the Act is exclusive. Section 5.5 This made inapplicable to such employees the provision of Section 33 of the Merchant Marine Act (called the Jones Act) which carried to 'seamen' at their election the benefit of the provisions of the Federal Employers' Liability Act. \n6\n The bill, which became the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, was at one stage amended so as to include a master and members of a crew of a vessel owned by a \n\n[309 \nU.S. 251, 257]\n\u00a0\n citizen of the United States. \n7\n They preferred, however, to remain outside the compensation provisions and thus to retain the advantages of their election under the Jones Act, and the bill was changed accordingly so as to exempt 'seamen'. Then, in its final passage, the words 'a master or member of a crew' were substituted for 'seamen'.8 We think that this substitution has an important significance here. For we had held that longshoremen engaged on a vessel at a dock in navigable waters, in the work of loading or unloading, were 'seamen'. International Stevedoring Company v. Haverty, \n272 \nU.S. 50\n, 47 S.Ct. 19; Northern Coal & Dock Co. v. Strand, \n278 \nU.S. 142\n, 49 S.Ct. 88. And, also, that such seamen if injured on a vessel in navigable waters, unlike one injured on land, could not have the benefit of a state workmen's compensation act. Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, \n244 \nU.S. 205\n, 37 S.Ct. 524, L.R.A. 1918C, 451, Ann.Cas.1917E, 900. We think it is clear that Congress in finally adopting the phrase 'a master or member of a crew' in making its exception, intended to leave entitled to compensation all those various sorts of longshoremen and harbor workers who were performing labor on a vessel9 and to whom state compensation statutes were inapplicable. The question is whether the decedent in this instance fell within that class.\n So far as the decision that this employee, who was at work on this vessel in navigable waters when he sustained his injuries, was or was not 'a member of a crew' turns on questions of fact, the authority to determine such questions has been confided by Congress to the deputy com- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 251, 258]\n\u00a0\n missioner. \n10\n Hence the Court of Appeals correctly ruled that his finding, if there was evidence to support it, was conclusive and that it was the duty of the District Court to ascertain whether it was so supported and, if so, to give it effect without attempting a retrial. We have so held with respect to the conclusiveness of the finding of the deputy commissioner that an injury to an employee arose 'out of and in the course of the employment', Voehl v. Indemnity Insurance Co., \n288 \nU.S. 162, 166\n, 53 S.Ct. 380, 381, 87 A.L.R. 245, as to the finding of the dependency of a claimant for compensation, L'Hote v. Crowell, \n286 \nU.S. 528\n, 52 S.Ct. 499, The Admiral Peoples, \n295 \nU.S. 649, 653\n, 654 S., 55 S.Ct. 885, 887, and as to the finding that the employee had committed suicide and hence that compensation was not payable, Del Vecchio v. Bowers, \n296 \nU.S. 280, 287\n, 56 S.Ct. 190, 193. In the Del Vecchio case the question was with respect to the application of the exception made by paragraph (b) of Section 3 with respect to 'Coverage', and we see no reason for a different view as to the application of paragraph (a)(1) of the same section.\n Petitioners urge that the question whether the decedent was a member of a 'crew' was a question of law. That is, that upon the undisputed facts the decedent must be held as a matter of law to have been a member of a 'crew' as distinguished from a longshoreman or laborer at work upon the vessel. We are unable so to conclude.\n The word 'crew' does not have an absolutely unvarying legal significance. As Mr. Justice Story said in United States v. Winn, 3 Sumn. 209,11 the general sense of the word crew is 'equivalent to ship's company' which would embrace all the officers as well as the common seamen. But it was observed that the laws upon \n\n[309 \nU.S. 251, 259]\n\u00a0\n maritime subjects sometimes used the word crew in that general sense and 'sometimes in other senses, more limited and restrained'. 'It is sometimes used to comprehend all persons composing the ship's company, including the master; sometimes to comprehend the officers and common seamen, excluding the master; and sometimes to comprehend the common seamen only, excluding the master and officers'. It was therefore deemed necessary to consider the context of the particular use of the term and the object to be accomplished by the enactment under consideration. In The Bound Brook, D.C ., 146 F. 160, 164, it was said that 'When the 'crew' of a vessel is referred to, those persons are naturally and primarily meant who are on board her aiding in her navigation, without reference to the nature of the arrangement under which they are on board'. Judge Hough in The Buena Ventura, D.C., 243 F. 797, 799, thought that statement was a fair summary, and in his view one who served the ship 'in her navigation' was a member of the 'crew'. Id., 243 F. page 800. See, also, Seneca Washed Gravel Corp. v. McManigal, 2 Cir., 65 F.2d 779. Recently, in considering the application of the Jones Act to 'any seaman', we adverted to the 'range of variation' in the use of the word 'crew', and it was again emphasized that what concerned us in that case, which had relation to the status of a 'master', was 'not the scope of the class of seamen at other times and in other contexts'. We said that our concern there was 'to define the meaning for the purpose of a particular statute which must be read in the light of the mischief to be corrected and the end to be attained'. Warner v. Goltra, \n293 \nU.S. 155, 158\n, 55 S.Ct. 46, 47, 48.\n That is our concern here in construing this particular statute-the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act-with appropriate regard to its distinctive aim. We find little aid in considering the use of the term \n\n[309 \nU.S. 251, 260]\n\u00a0\n 'crew' in other statutes having other purposes. This Act, as we have seen, was to provide compensation for a class of employees at work on a vessel in navigable waters who, although they might be classed as seamen ( International Stevedoring Company v. Haverty, supra), were still regarded as distinct from members of a 'crew'. They were persons serving on vessels, to be sure, but their service was that of laborers, of the sort performed by longshoremen and harbor workers and thus distinguished from those employees on the vessel who are naturally and primarily on board to aid in her navigation. See De Wald v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 4 Cir., 71 F.2d 810; Diomede v. Lowe, 2 Cir., 87 F.2d 296; Moore Dry Dock Co. v. Pillsbury, 9 Cir., 100 F.2d 245.\n Regarding the word 'crew' in this statute as referring to the latter class, we think there was evidence to support the finding of the deputy commissioner. The fact that the certificate of inspection called for three 'deckhands' and that the captain included the decedent to make up that complement is not controlling. The question concerns his actual duties. These duties, as the Court of Appeals said, did not pertain to navigation, aside from the incidental task of throwing the ship's rope or making the boat fast, a service of the sort which could readily be performed or aided by a harbor worker. What the court considered as supporting the finding of the deputy commissioner was that the primary duty of the decedent was to facilitate the flow of coal to the vessel being fueled, that he had no duties while the boat was in motion, that he slept at home and boarded off ship and was called each day as he was wanted, and was paid an hourly wage. Workers of that sort on harbor craft may appropriately be regarded as 'in the position of longshoremen or other casual workers on the water'. Scheffler v. Moran Towing & Transportation Co., 2 Cir., 68 F.2d 11, 12. Even if it could be said that the evidence permitted conflicting inferences, we think that \n\n[309 \nU.S. 251, 261]\n\u00a0\n there was enough to sustain the deputy commissioner's ruling.\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice MURPHY took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 44 Stat. 1424; 33 U.S.C. and U.S.C.Supp. IV, sec. 901 et seq., 33 U.

STATE OF TENN.(1940)\n\nArgued: Decided: June 3, 1940\n\n\n\n Mr. D. Fred Taylor, Jr., of Osceola, Ark., for complainant.\n Messrs. Nat Tipton, of Nashville, Tenn., and C. M. Buck, of Blytheville, Ark., for defendant. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 563, 564]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The State of Arkansas brought this suit against the State of Tennessee seeking a decree determining the true boundary between the States at certain points and confirming the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the State of Arkansas over the described territory.\n The bill of complaint set forth two counts. The first count presented the contentions of Arkansas as to the boundary in relation to an area known as 'Needham's Island', later as 'Cutoff Island' or 'Moss Island', and to a contiguous formation known as 'Blue Grass Towhead'. This is the only area which remains in controversy, as the parties have agreed by stipulation upon the boundary line to be fixed in relation to the land described in the second count.\n Tennessee answered, contesting the claims of Arkansas and asserting by cross-bill its jurisdiction and sovereignty over the territory in question.\n The issues were referred to Monte M. Lemann as Special Master. \n301 \nU.S. 666\n, 57 S.Ct. 920. The Master has filed a careful and comprehensive report recommending a decree in favor of Tennessee as to the area described in count one, and in accordance with the stipulation as to that described in count two. The case has been heard upon that report and the exceptions filed by Arkansas.\n The Master set forth the following facts as agreed upon by the parties:\n'Prior to 1821, the land in controversy in this suit was on the west bank of the Mississippi River and the main channel of the river flowed to the east thereof. At the location involved in this suit, the river at that time flowed around a twelve mile bend caused by the extension of a peninsula into the river from the western shore. In 1821 an avulsion took place in the course of the river \n\n[310 \nU.S. 563, 565]\n\u00a0\n occasioned by the waters cutting across the neck of this peninsula at a point where it had become only half a mile wide due to caving of the river banks. At the present time the main channel of the Mississippi River flows to the west of the lands in controversy and has so flowed for many years prior to the present. The original channel of the river is now, and has for many years been, filled up so that the island originally created by the avulsion is now, and has for many years been, physically connected to, and a part of, the eastern shore of the river'.\n\n After a review of the evidence upon points in dispute, the Master made a summary of his findings and conclusions as follows:\n'(1) The Territory of Arkansas was organized by Act of March 2, 1819, 3 Stat. 493, being carved out of the Territory of Missouri, which was a part of the Louisiana Purchase, and the eastern boundary of the Territory was the middle of the main channel of the Mississippi River.\n\n'(2) In 1819 the lands in controversy were on the west side of the main channel of the river and were part of the Territory of Arkansas.\n\n'(3) The avulsion at Needham's Cutoff occurred in 1821\n\n\n\n'(4) The main channel of the river flowed through the cutoff prior to 1836.\n\n'(5) Arkansas was admitted into the Union on June 15, 1836, 5 Stat. 50, and its eastern boundary was fixed at the middle of the main channel of the Mississippi River.\n\n'(6) On June 15, 1836, when Arkansas was admitted into the Union, the lands in controversy were on the east side of the main channel of the Mississippi River.\n\n'(7) The avulsion did not change the boundary line theretofore existing between Tennessee and the Territory of Arkansas. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 563, 566]\n\u00a0\n '(8) The Act of Congress of June 15, 1836, admitting Arkansas into the Union, did not have the effect of excluding from the boundaries of the State of Arkansas lands which immediately prior to the adoption of the Act were within the Territory of Arkansas.\n\n'(9) Tennessee was admitted into the Union on June 1, 1796, 1 Stat. 491, c. 47. Its western boundary was the middle of the main channel of the Mississippi River. The lands in controversy were in 1796 on the west of the main channel of the river.\n\n'(10) The Act of June 15, 1836, 5 Stat. 50, admitting Arkansas into the Union, did not have the effect of enlarging the boundaries of Tennessee.\n\n'(11) From 1826 to the date of the filing of this suit, Tennessee has continuously exercised dominion and jurisdiction over the lands in controversy.\n\n'(12) Arkandas has acquiesced in Tennessee's exercise of dominion and jurisdiction.\n\n'(13) The lands described in Count One of the complaint are now within the boundaries of Tennessee as a result of prescription. Bluegrass Towhead, which has been formed by gradual processes and is attached to Moss Island, is likewise now within the boundaries of Tennessee'.\n\n The exceptions of Arkansas to the Master's report present for the most part questions of law. Arkansas contends that its true eastern boundary at the place in controversy was determined by the rule of the thalweg, being the middle of the main channel of navigation of the Mississippi River as it existed when the Treaty of Peace between the United States and Great Britain was concluded in 1783, subject to such subsequent changes as occurred through natural and gradual processes. Arkansas v. Tennessee, \n246 \nU.S. 158\n, 38 S.Ct. 301, L.R.A. 1918D, 258; Arkansas v. Mississippi, \n250 \nU.S. 39\n, 39 S.Ct. 422; Arkansas v. Mississippi, \n252 \nU.S. 344\n, 40 S.Ct. 333. The Master supports that contention with respect to the \n\n[310 \nU.S. 563, 567]\n\u00a0\n original boundary of the Territory of Arkansas, and also the contention that the avulsion of 1821 did not change the boundary line theretofore existing between Tennessee and the Territory of Arkansas; and, further, the Master holds that the Act of 1836 admitting Arkansas into the Union did not operate to exclude from its boundaries the lands which immediately before were within the Territory of Arkansas or to enlarge the boundaries of Tennessee.\n Despite these conclusions, the Master is of the opinion that the area in question should now be deemed to be within the boundaries of Tennessee by virtue of prescription and the acquiescence on the part of Arkansas in the exercise by Tennessee of dominion and jurisdiction over that area. Upon that question of fact, the Master found that Tennessee had continuously exercised that dominion and jurisdiction from the year 1826 to the time of the bringing of the present suit. In support of this finding, the Master thus summarized the evidence:\n'The contemporary evidence shows that as early as 1823 entries of the land were being made under the authority of Tennessee and surveys were made under authority of Tennessee as early as 1824. Witnesses sixty-five, seventy-eight and eighty-four years old testified before me that the inhabitants of the island always voted in Tennessee elections; were taxed by Tennessee, married by Tennessee Justices of the Peace, required to do road work under Tennessee authority, educated upon the island in a school operated by Tennessee. The records of Dyer County, Tennessee, showed that assessments on the lands in controversy for local taxes were made by Tennessee authorities and land taxes paid to Tennessee as far back a 1870, prior to which records are missing. Tennessee Exhibit 42 shows a tax sale by a Tennessee sheriff in 1848 covering lands on the island. The bill of exceptions in the case of Moss v. Gibbs, shows testimony \n\n[310 \nU.S. 563, 568]\n\u00a0\n in that case that as far back as 1826 Tennessee assessed the lands on the cutoff island, collected the taxes on them and served process there. The opinion of the Supreme Court of Tennessee in Moss v. Gibbs (1872) 10 Heisk. 283, 57 Tenn. 283, recites these facts as proven therein'.\n\n The Master added that if he was mistaken in thinking it proper to consider the depositions and opinion in Moss v. Gibbs, supra, as affording evidence in this case, 'the testimony taken before me and the other documentary evidence, consisting of certified copies of entries, surveys and patents, is, in my judgment, sufficient to prove Tennessee's long and uninterrupted exercise of dominion and jurisdiction over the lands in controversy'.\n The Master was equally explicit in finding that the record showed the acquiescence of Arkansas in this assertion of dominion by Tennessee. On this point his report states:\n'There is no showing that Arkansas ever asserted any claim to the land in controversy prior to the institution of this suit. The lands were never surveyed or granted by Arkansas. In 1848 the United States Surveyor of Public Lands in Arkansas wrote to the General Land Office in Washington that he had been called upon to survey the lands on the cutoff island. He received a reply authorizing him to proceed with the survey of the island 'more especially if it is not claimed by the State of Tennessee'. But no survey was ever made. On October 10th, 1935, application was filed with the Commissioner of State Lands of Arkansas for the purchase of Blue Grass Towhead, but no action was taken thereon. The opinion of the Supreme Court of Tennessee in Moss v. Gibbs, 10 Heisk. 283, 57 Tenn. 283, was published in the year 1872 and made the claims of Tennessee a matter of public notoriety'.\n\n There was slight, if any, controversy as to the facts upon the hearing at this bar. The findings of the Master \n\n[310 \nU.S. 563, 569]\n\u00a0\n with respect to the exercise of dominion and jurisdiction by Tennessee and as to the acquiescence therein of Arkansas are fully supported by the record, and we must determine the cause upon that basis.\n The contentions of Arkansas in opposition to the application of the principle of prescription and acquiescence in determining the boundary between States cannot be sustained. That principle has had repeated recognition by this Court. In Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 4 How. 591, 639, the Court said: 'No human transactions are unaffected by time. Its influence is seen on all things subject to change. And this is peculiarly the case in regard to matters which rest in memory, and which consequently fade with the lapse of time, and fall with the lives of individuals. For the security of rights, whether of states or individuals, long possession under a claim of title is protected. And there is no controversy in which this great principle may be involved with greater justice and propriety than in a case of disputed boundary'. Applying this principle in Indiana v. Kentucky, \n136 \nU.S. 479, 510\n, 10 S.Ct. 1051, 1054, to the long acquiescence in the exercise by Kentucky of dominion and jurisdiction over the land there in controversy, the Court said: 'It is a principle of public law, universally recognized, that long acquiescence in the possession of territory, and in the exercise of dominion and sovereignty over it, is conclusive of the nation's title and rightful authority'. Again, in Louisiana v. Mississippi, \n202 \nU.S. 1, 53\n, 26 S.Ct. 408, 423, 571, the Court observed: 'The question is one of boundary, and this court has many times held that, as between the states of the Union, long acquiescence in the assertion of a particular boundary and the exercise of dominion and sovereignty over the territory within it should be accepted as conclusive, whatever the international rule might be in respect of the acquisition by prescription of large tracts of country claimed by both'. See, also, Virginia v. Tennessee, \n148 \nU.S. 503\n, \n\n[310 \nU.S. 563, 570]\n\u00a0\n 523, 13 S.Ct. 728, 736; Maryland v. West Virginia, \n217 \nU.S. 1\n, 41-44, 30 S.Ct. 268, 277-279; Vermont v. New Hampshire, \n289 \nU.S. 593, 613\n, 53 S.Ct. 708, 715.\n In Michigan v. Wisconsin, \n270 \nU.S. 295, 308\n, 46 S.Ct. 290, 294, the Court thus referred to the recognition of this principle in international law, saying: 'That rights of the character here claimed may be acquired on the one hand, and lost on the other, by open, long- continued, and uninterrupted possession of territory, is a doctrine not confined to individuals, but applicable to sovereign nations as well, Direct United States Cable Co. v. Anglo-American Telegraph Co. (1877) L.R. 2 A.C. 394, 421; Wheaton, International Law (5th Eng.Ed.) 268, 269; 1 Moore, International Law Digest, 294 et seq.; amd, a fortiori, to the quasi sovereign states of the Union'. Prescription in international law, says Oppenheim, may be defined as 'the acquisition of sovereignty over a territory through continuous and undisturbed exercise of sovereignty over it during such a period as is necessary to create under the influence of historical development the general conviction that the present condition of things is in conformity with international order'. And thus he finds that prescription in international law 'has the same rational basis as prescription in municipal law-namely, the creation of stability of order'. Oppenheim, International Law, 5th Ed., pp. 455, 456. See, also, Hall, International Law, 8th Ed., pp. 143, 144; Hyde, International Law, Sec. 116.\n This principle of prescription and acquiescence, when there is a sufficient basis of fact for its application, so essential to the 'stability of order' as between the States of the Union, is in no way disregarded or impaired by our decisions in Arkansas v. Tennessee, supra, and Arkansas v. Mississippi, supra, upon which counsel for Arkansas rely. In those cases the evidence fell short of the proof of long acquiescence which was necessary to warrant the application of the principle and there was no such show- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 563, 571]\n\u00a0\n ing of acts of dominion and jurisdiction as are shown on the part of Tennessee in the instant case.\n On behalf of Arkansas it is argued that the rule of the thalweg is of such dominating character that it meets and overthrows the defense of prescription and acquiescence. That position is untenable. The rule of the thalweg rests upon equitable considerations and is intended to safeguard to each State equality of access and right of navigation in the stream. Iowa v. Illinois, \n147 \nU.S. 1, 7\n, 8 S., 13 S.Ct. 239, 241; Minnesota v. Wisconsin, \n252 \nU.S. 273, 281\n, 282 S., 40 S.Ct. 313, 318, 319; Wisconsin v. Michigan, \n295 \nU.S. 455, 461\n, 55 S.Ct. 786, 788; New Jersey v. Delaware, \n291 \nU.S. 361, 380\n, 54 S.Ct. 407, 413. The rule yields to the doctrine that a boundary is unaltered by an avulsion and in such case, in the absence of prescription, the boundary no longer follows the thalweg but remains at the original line although now on dry land because the old channel has filled up. Nebraska v. Iowa, \n143 \nU.S. 359, 367\n, 12 S.Ct. 396, 398; Missouri v. Nebraska, \n196 \nU.S. 23, 36\n, 25 S.Ct. 155, 157; Arkansas v. Tennessee, supra, 246 U.S. pages 173, 174, 38 S.Ct. 304, 305, L.R.A.1918D, 258. And, in turn, the doctrine as to the effect of an avulsion may become inapplicable when it is established that there has been acquiescence in a long-continued and uninterrupted assertion of dominion and jurisdiction over a given area. Here that fact has been established and the original rule of the thalweg no longer applies.\n The contention is also pressed that the defense of prescription is unavailable upon the ground that the title to the land in controversy is in the United States; that the land is still unsurveyed land of the United States; and, hence, that the defense of adverse possession could not be good against Arkansas as she did not have title. But the question in this suit is not one of title to particular land but of boundaries and of political jurisdiction as between Arkansas and Tennessee. Tennessee is making no claim against the United States. No title of the \n\n[310 \nU.S. 563, 572]\n\u00a0\n United States to lands within the boundaries of either State is here in question or is here determined. The ruling of the Master in overruling this contention is sustained.\n A special point is urged as to the area known as 'Blue Grass Towhead'. As to this area, the Master found:\n'Bule Grass Towhead is a formation adjoining Moss Island (the cutoff island) on the west thereof, which has been formed since the year 1916 by the gradual processes of the river and is now attached physically to the eastern shore of the river. In-so-far as this formation is in controversy in the present litigation, I am of the opinion that it also is subject to the jurisdiction of Tennessee, as it was formed by gradual processes and is attached to Moss Island; see Arkansas v. Tennessee, \n246 \nU.S. 158, 173\n, 38 S.Ct. 301, 304, L.R.A.1918D, 258'.\n\n It seems clear that as Moss Island by prescription and acquiescence must be deemed to be part of the territory subject to the jurisdiction of Tennessee, this addition by gradual processes should be treated as part of Moss Island and as subject to the same jurisdiction.\n The exceptions of Arkansas to the Master's report are overruled and the report is in all respects confirmed. Decree will be entered accordingly providing:\n\n\n (1)\n That the claims of Arkansas to the lands described in count one be rejected and the claims of Tennessee thereto be maintained, and that the boundary line between the States at the point to which count one refers be fixed at the middle of the main channel of navigation in the Mississippi River as it existed at the date of the filing of the bill of complaint herein.\n\n\n (2)\n That the boundary between Arkansas and Tennessee at the point described in count two of the bill of complaint be fixed in accordance with the stipulation entered into by the parties, and that a commissioner be appointed to mark the boundary line as set out in the stipulation by placing three suitable markers along the \n\n[310 \nU.S. 563, 573]\n\u00a0\n line and a fourth one on sufficiently high ground to be used in locating the other three in the event that they should be covered by water, moved or destroyed.\n\n\n (3)\n That costs be equally divided between the States.\n Decree may be settled on notice.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","113":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF MINNESOTA EX REL. PEARSON v. PROBATE COURT OF RAMSEY(1940)\nNo. 394\nArgued: Decided: February 26, 1940\n\n\n\n - \n\n[309 \nU.S. 270, 271]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Joseph F. Cowern, of St. Paul, Minn., for appellant.\n Messrs. Chester S. Wilson and Kent C. van den Berg, both of St. Paul, Minn., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant, Charles Edwin Pearson, petitioned the Supreme Court of Minnesota for a writ of prohibition commanding the Probate Court of Ramsey County, and its Judge, to desist from proceeding against him as a 'psychopathic personality' under Chapter 369 of the Laws of Minnesota of 1939. A proceeding under the statute had been brought in the Probate Court for the \n\n[309 \nU.S. 270, 272]\n\u00a0\n commitment of appellant and an order for his production and examination had been issued.\n Appellant contended that the statute violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution, U.S.C.A. After hearing upon an alternative writ, the Supreme Court overruled these contentions and quashed the writ. 205 Minn. 545, 287 N.W. 297. The case comes here on appeal. Jud.Code Sec. 237(a), 28 U.S.C.  344(a), 28 U.S.C.A.  344(a).\n The statute, in Section, 1, defines the term 'psychopathic personality' as meaning 'the existence in any person of such conditions of emotional instability, or impulsiveness of behavior, or lack of customary standards of good judgment, or failure to appreciate the consequences of his acts, or a combination of any such conditions, as to render such person irresponsible for his conduct with respect to sexual matters and thereby dangerous to other persons'.\n Section 2 provides that, except as otherwise therein or thereafter provided, the laws relating to insane persons, or those alleged to be insane, shall apply with like force to persons having, or alleged to have, a psychopathic personality. There is a proviso that before proceedings are instituted the facts shall first be submitted to the county attorney who if he is satisfied that good cause exists shall prepare a petition to be executed by a person having knowledge of the facts and shall file it with the judge of the probate court of the county in which the 'patient' has his 'settlement or is present'. The probate judge shall set the matter down for hearing and for examination of the 'patient'. The judge may exclude the general public from attendance. The 'patient' may be represented by counsel and the court may appoint counsel for him if he is financially unable to obtain such assistance. The 'patient' is entitled to compulsory process for the attendance of witnesses in his behalf. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 270, 273]\n\u00a0\n The court must appoint two duly licensed doctors of medicine to assist in the examination. The proceedings are to be reduced to writing and made parts of the court's records. From a finding of the existence of psychopathic personality, the 'patient' may appeal to the district court.\n After setting forth the general principles which governed its determination, the state court construed the statute in these words (205 Minn. 545, 287 N.W. 297, 302): 'Applying these principles to the case before us, it can reasonably be said that the language of Section 1 of the act is intended to include those persons who, by a habitual course of misconduct in sexual matters, have evidenced an utter lack of power to control their sexual impulses and who, as a result, are likely to attack or otherwise inflict injury, loss, pain or other evil on the objects of their uncontrolled and uncontrollable desire. It would not be reasonable to apply the provisions of the statute to every person guilty of sexual misconduct nor even to persons having strong sexual propensities. Such a definition would not only make the act impracticable of enforcement and, perhaps, unconstitutional in its application, but would also be an unwarranted departure from the accepted meaning of the words defined'.\n This construction is binding upon us. Any contention that the construction is contrary to the terms of the Act is unavailing here. For the purpose of deciding the constitutional questions appellant raises we must take the statute as though it read precisely as the highest court of the State has interpreted it. Supreme Lodge Knights of Pythias v. Meyer, \n265 \nU.S. 30, 32\n, 44 S.Ct. 432; Guaranty Trust Company v. Blodgett, \n287 \nU.S. 509, 513\n, 53 S.Ct. 244, 245; Hicklin v. Coney, \n290 \nU.S. 169, 172\n, 54 S.Ct. 142, 144; Georgia Railway & Electric Co. v. Decatur, \n295 \nU.S. 165, 170\n, 55 S.Ct. 701, 703. Moreover, as it was the manifest purpose of the court to determine definitely the meaning of the Act, we accept the view presented by the Attorney General of \n\n[309 \nU.S. 270, 274]\n\u00a0\n the State at this bar, that the court used the word 'include' as defining the entire class of persons to whom the statute applies and not as describing merely a portion of a larger class. In advance of a decision by the statute court applying the statute to persons outside that definition, we should not adopt a construction of the provision which might render it of doubtful validity. Stephenson v. Binford, \n287 \nU.S. 251, 277\n, 53 S.Ct. 181, 189, 87 A.L.R. 721.\n This construction of the statute destroys the contention that it is too vague and indefinite to constitute valid legislation. There must be proof of a 'habitual course of misconduct in sexual matters' on the part of the persons against whom a proceeding under the statute is directed, which has shown 'an utter lack of power to control their sexual impulses', and hence that they 'are likely to attack or otherwise inflict injury, loss, pain or other evil on the objects of their uncontrolled and uncontrollable desire'. These underlying conditions, calling for evidence of past conduct pointing to probable consequences, are as susceptible of proof as many of the criteria constantly applied in prosecutions for crime. Nash v. United States, \n229 \nU.S. 373, 377\n, 33 S.Ct. 780, 781; Fox v. Washington, \n236 \nU.S. 273, 277\n, 278 S., 35 S.Ct. 383, 384; Omaechevarria v. Idaho, \n246 \nU.S. 343, 348\n, 38 S.Ct. 323, 325; United States v. Wurzbach, \n280 \nU.S. 396, 399\n, 50 S.Ct. 167, 168. Appellant's criticisms are drawn from his interpretation of the statute and find no warrant in the statute as the state court has construed it.\n Equally unavailing is the contention that the statute denies appellant the equal protection of the laws. The argument proceeds on the view that the statute has selected a group which is a part of a larger class. The question, however, is whether the legislature could constitutionally make a class of the group it did select. That is, whether there is any rational basis for such a selection. We see no reason for doubt upon this point. Whether the legislature could have gone farther is not \n\n[309 \nU.S. 270, 275]\n\u00a0\n the question. The class it did select is identified by the state court in terms which clearly show that the persons within that class constitute a dangerous element in the community which the legislature in its discretion could put under appropriate control. As we have often said, the legislature is free to recognize degrees of harm, and it may confine its restrictions to those classes of cases where the need is deemed to be clearest. If the law 'presumably hits the evil where it is most felt, it is not to be overthrown because there are other instances to which it might have been applied.' Miller v. Wilson, \n236 \nU.S. 373, 384\n, 35 S.Ct. 342, 344, 345, L.R.A.1915F, 829; Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., \n220 \nU.S. 61, 78\n, 79 S., 31 S.Ct. 337, Ann.Cas. 1912C, 160; Semler v. Dental Examiners, \n294 \nU.S. 608, 610\n, 611 S., 55 S.Ct. 570, 571; West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, \n300 \nU.S. 379, 400\n, 57 S.Ct. 578, 585, 108 A.L.R. 1330\n\n\n There remains the question whether, apart from definition and classification, the procedure authorized by the statute adequately safeguards the fundamental rights embraced in the conception of due process. In this relation it is important to note that appellant has challenged the proceeding in limine by seeking to prevent the probate judge from entertaining it. To support such a challenge, the statute in its procedural aspect must be found to be invalid on its face and not by reason of some particular application inconsistent with due process. In that light the argument on this branch of the case also fails.\n As we have seen, the facts must first be submitted to the county attorney who must be satisfied that good cause exists. He then draws a petition which must be 'executed by a person having knowledge of the facts'. The probate judge must set the matter for hearing and for examination of the person proceeded against. Provision is made for his representation by counsel and for compelling the production of witnesses in his behalf. The court must appoint two licensed doctors of medicine to assist in the \n\n[309 \nU.S. 270, 276]\n\u00a0\n examination. The argument that these doctors may not be sufficiently expert in this type of cases merely invites conjecture. There is no reason to doubt that qualified medical men are usually available. Laws as to proceedings where persons are alleged to be insane are made applicable. Appellant says that the patient cannot be released on bail. The State contests this, insisting that he may be so released pending hearing or on appeal, pointing to Mason's Minnesota Statutes, 1938 Supplement, Section 8992-178. Appellant contends that if the court finds the patient to be within the statute, he must be committed 'for the rest of his life to an asylum for the dangerously insane.' Mason's Minn.Stat., 1938 Supp., Sec. 8992-176. The State also contests this conclusion, maintaining that the commitment is without term and subject to the right of the patient, or any one interested in him, to petition the committing court for release at any time. Mason's Minn.Stat., 1938 Supp., Sec. 8992-143; Laws of 1935, Chap. 72, Sec. 143, as amended by Laws of 1939, Chap. 270, Sec. 8. The statute of the a right if appeal from the finding of the probate judge upon compliance with certain specified provisions of the Minnesota laws. Appellant contends that this excludes other provisions of laws relating to appeals in insanity cases. Again, appellant's position is contested by the State upon the ground that there is no express limitation or exclusion in the language of the statute and that other provisions governing appellate procedure apply. These various procedural questions and others suggested by appellant, do not appear to have been passed upon by the state court.\n We fully recognize the danger of a deprivation of due process in proceedings dealing with persons charged with insanity or, as here, with a psychopathic personality as defined in the statute, and the special importance of maintaining the basic interests of liberty in a class of \n\n[309 \nU.S. 270, 277]\n\u00a0\n cases where the law though 'fair on its face and impartial in appearance' may be open to serious abuses in administration and courts may be imposed upon if the substantial rights of the persons charged are not adequately safeguarded at every stage of the proceedings. But we have no occasion to consider such abuses here, for none have occurred. The applicable statutes are not patently defective in any vital respect and we should not assume, in advance of a decision by the state court, that they should be construed so as to deprive appellant of the due process to which he is entitled under the Federal Constitution. Plymouth Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n232 \nU.S. 531, 546\n, 34 S.Ct. 359, 363; Utah Power & Light Co. v. Pfost, \n286 \nU.S. 165, 186\n, 187 S., 52 S.Ct. 548, 554; Stephenson v. Binford, supra. On the contrary, we must assume that the Minnesota courts will protect appellant in every constitutional right he possesses. His procedural objections are premature.\n The judgment is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","114":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF WISCONSIN v. J.C.

The statute is quoted in \n\n[311 \nU.S. 435, 440]\n\u00a0\n the margin. \n1\n When this question originally came before the Supreme Court of Wisconsin it found no constitu- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 435, 441]\n\u00a0\n tional infirmity in such an exaction. State ex rel. Froedtert G. & M. Co. v. Tax Commission, 221 Wis. 225, 265 N.W. 672, 267 N.W. 52. But deeming itself constrained by its reading of this Court's decision in Connecticut General Co. v. Johnson, \n303 \nU.S. 77\n, 58 S.Ct. 436, the Wisconsin Supreme Court in the present case found that the statute ran afoul the Due Process Clause insofar as it covered locally licensed foreign corporations. 233 Wis. 286, 289 N.W. 677, 126 A.L.R. 1333. Inasmuch as important issues affecting the exertion of the taxing power of the states are involved, we brought this and its companion cases here. \n310 \nU.S. 618\n, 60 S.Ct. 1076; State of Wisconsin v. Minnesota Mining & Mfg. Co., \n310 \nU.S. 619\n, 60 S.Ct. 1077.\n For many years, corporations chartered by other states but permitted to carry on business in Wisconsin have been subject to a general corporate income tax act on earnings attributable to their Wisconsin activities. The state has, of course, power to impose such a tax. United States Glue Co. v. Oak Creek, \n247 \nU.S. 321\n, 38 S.Ct. 499, Ann.Cas.1918E, 748; Underwood Typewriter Co. v. Chamberlain, \n254 \nU.S. 113\n, 41 S.Ct. 45. 'For the privilege of declaring and receiving dividends, out of income derived from property located and business transacted in' Wisconsin, an exaction 'equal to two and one-half per centum of the amount of such dividends declared and paid by all corporations (foreign and local)' is the additional tax now before us. In the enforcement of this measure against foreign corporations the amount of in- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 435, 442]\n\u00a0\n come attributable to Wisconsin is calculated according to the same formula as that employed in assessing the general corporate income tax paid by such foreign corporations. The practical operation of this legislation is to impose an additional tax on corporate earnings within Wisconsin but to postpone the liability for this tax until earnings are paid out in dividends. In a word, by its general income tax Wisconsin taxes corporate income that is taken in; by the Privilege Dividend Tax of 1935 Wisconsin superimposed upon this income tax a tax on corporate income that is paid out.\n As pressures for new revenues become more and more insistent, ways and means of meeting them present to a state not only the baffling task of tapping fresh sources of revenue but of doing so with due regard to a state's existing taxing system. The tax now assailed gains nourishing significance when placed in the context of the Wisconsin taxing system of which it became a part. Wisconsin relied heavily upon taxation of incomes and largely looked to this source to meet the increasing demands of the depression years. But a special Wisconsin feature was exemption of dividends from personal taxation. See Welch v. Henry, \n305 \nU.S. 134, 142\n, 143 S., 59 S.Ct. 121, 123, 124, 118 A.L.R. 1142. This exemption persisted while regular and surtax rates against personal incomes were raised. Attempts at relief from the unfairness charged against this exemption of dividends, particularly advantageous to the higher brackets, were steadily pressed before the Wisconsin Legislature. To relieve local earnings of foreign corporations from a dividend tax would have had a depressive effect on wholly local enterprises. The Privilege Dividend Tax was devised to reduce at least in part the state's revenue losses due to dividend exemptions, and also to equalize the burdens on all Wisconsin earnings, regardless of the formal home of the corporation.\n Had Wisconsin, as part of its price for the privileges it afforded foreign corporations within its borders, ex- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 435, 443]\n\u00a0\n plicitly provided for a supplementary tax on the Wisconsin earnings of such corporations, but postponed liability for the tax until such earnings were to be paid out in dividends, the power of Wisconsin to do so would hardly be questioned. Compare Continental Assurance Co. v. Tennessee, \n311 \nU.S. 5\n, 61 S.Ct. 1, decided Oct. 21, 1940. But because the legislative language ran 'For the privilege of declaring and receiving dividends, out of income derived from property located and business transacted in this stae' the court below raised the barrier of the Fourteenth Amendment. Respondent is a Delaware corporation having its principal offices in New York; its meetings are held in the latter state where the dividends are voted and the dividend checks are drawn on New York bank accounts. Since the process for declaring dividends and the details attending their distribution among the stockholders transpired outside Wisconsin, although the exaction was opportioned to the earnings derived from Wisconsin, the state court concluded that the tax was an attempt by Wisconsin to levy an exaction on transactions beyond Wisconsin's borders.\n The case thus reduces itself to the inquiry whether Wisconsin has transgressed its taxing power because its supreme court has described the practical result of the exertion of that power by one legal formula rather than another-has labeled it a tax on the privilege of declaring dividends rather than a supplementary income tax.\n A tax is an exaction. Ascertainment of the scope of the exaction-what is included in it-is for the state court. But the descriptive pigeon-hole into which a state court puts a tax is of no moment in determining the constitutional significance of the exaction. 'In whatever language a statute may be framed, its purpose must be determined by its natural and reasonable effect.' Henderson v. Mayor of New York, \n92 \nU.S. 259\n, 268. Such has been the repeated import of the cases which only recently were well summarized by the guiding for- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 435, 444]\n\u00a0\n mulation for adjudicating a tax measure, that 'in passing on its constitutionality we are concerned only with its practical operation, not its definition or the precise form of descriptive words which may be applied to it.' Lawrence v. State Tax Commission, \n286 \nU.S. 276, 280\n, 52 S. Ct. 556, 557, 87 A.L.R. 374.\n The Constitution is not a formulary. It does not demand of states strict observance of rigid categories nor precision of technical phrasing in their exercise of the most basic power of government, that of taxation. For constitutional purposes the decisive issue turns on the operating incidence of a challenged tax. A state is free to pursue its own fiscal policies, unembarrassed by the Constitution, if by the practical operation of a tax the state has exerted its power in relation to opportunities which it has given, to protection which it has afforded, to benefits which it has conferred by the fact of being an orderly, civilized society.\n Constitutional provisions are often so glossed over with commentary that imperceptibly we tend to construe the commentary rather than the text. We cannot, however, be too often reminded that the limits on the otherwise autonomous powers of the states are those in the Constitution and not verbal weapons imported into it. 'Taxable event', 'jurisdiction to tax', 'business situs', 'extraterritoriality', are all compendious ways of implying the impotence of state power because state power has nothing on which to operate. These tags are not instruments of adjudication but statements of result in applying the sole constitutional test for a case like the present one. That test is whether property was taken without due process of law, or, if paraphrase we must, whether the taxing power exerted by the state bears fiscal relation to protection, opportunities and benefits given by the state. The simple but controlling question is whether the state has given anything for which it can ask return. The substantial privilege of carrying on \n\n[311 \nU.S. 435, 445]\n\u00a0\n business in Wisconsin, which has here been given, clearly supports the tax, and the state has not given the less merely because it has conditioned the demand of the exaction upon happenings outside its own borders. The fact that a tax is contingent upon events brought to pass without a state does not destroy the nexus between such a tax and transactions within a state for which the tax is an exaction.

State Tax Commission, supra, 286 U.S. page 280, 52 S.Ct. page 557, 87 A.L.R. 374. Ambiguous intimations of general phrases in opinions torn from the significance of concrete circumstances, or even occasional deviations over a long course of years, not unnatural in view of the confusing complexities of tax problems, do not alter the limited nature of the function of this Court when state taxes come before it. At best, the responsibility for devising just and productive sources of revenue challenges the wit of legislators. Nothing can be less helpful than for courts to go beyond the extremely limited restrictions that the Constitution places upon the states and to inject themselves in a merely negative way into the delicate processes of fiscal policy-making. We must be on guard against imprisoning the taxing power of the states within formulas that are not compelled by the Constitution but merely represent judicial generalizations exceeding the concrete circumstances which they profess to summarize.\n Nor does Connecticut General Co. v. Johnson, supra, present a barrier against what Wisconsin has done. Its \n\n[311 \nU.S. 435, 446]\n\u00a0\n presuppositions recognize the scope of the state taxing power we have outlined. \n303 \nU.S. 77, 80\n, 82 S., 58 S.Ct. 436, 438, 439. In the precise circumstances presented by the record it was found that the tax neither in its measure nor in its incidence was related to California transactions. Here, on the contrary, the incidence of the tax as well as its measure is tied to the earnings which the State of Wisconsin has made possible, insofar as government is the prerequisite for the fruits of civilization for which, as Mr. Justice Holmes was fond of saying, we pay taxes. See, for instance, his dissent in Compan ia General de Tabacos v. Collector, supra, 275 U.S. page 100, 48 S.Ct. page 105.\n Because the Wisconsin Supreme Court found the statute to be invalid as to foreign corporations in the position of the respondent it had no occasion to pass on certain claims relating to the application of the statute to the specific dividends here involved. We therefore remand the case for the determination of such questions as are open in the light of this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS.\n I assume that the principle still holds good that a state, a member of the sisterhood of states in the Republic, cannot extend her sovereignty by legislation so as to prohibit, to regulate, or to tax property or transactions of citizens of other sovereign states lying outside her boundaries and regulated by the law of the state of domicile or residence. I assume also that, where a state has, by law, fixed the conditions upon which a corporate citizen of another state may enter to transact business, she may not thereafter extend her sovereignty to matters not within her competence, in the guise of annexing other and further conditions of burdens upon the transaction \n\n[311 \nU.S. 435, 447]\n\u00a0\n of the corporation's business within her borders. Those activities which have a real and substantial relation to the business transacted by the citizen of another state within her confines are, of course, subject to regulation and to taxation. It would be mere affectation to cite the adjudications of this court which are founded upon these propositions. I have thought that these principles were of the very warp and woof of the constitutional system which binds the states together in a federal union. Attempted transgressions of these limits of state sovereignty have time and again run afoul of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The respondent admittedly receives income in Wisconsin. No one questions the power of Wisconsin to lay a tax upon the receipt of that income. It has done so. It is said that the challenged exaction is merely an additional income tax,-this, notwithstanding that the tax is not called an income tax, has been held by the highest court of Wisconsin not to be an income tax but an excise upon a privilege,-in the view that in testing the constitutionality of an exaction this court examines for itself the nature and incidence of the tax and disregards mere names and descriptive epithets. With that principle I have no quarrel, but I think the opinion of the court demonstrates that the tax here in question is, and can be, sustained only by a disregard of it. Let me illustrate my meaning. Assuming that, by statute, an ad valorem tax on property is prohibited and an income tax permitted. The terms used in the statute necessarily have a conventional connotation. One cannot intelligently discuss things or actions except by using the names commonly employed to describe them. Concepts of ad valorem taxation on property and taxation of income are clear and easily discriminable. What would be \n\n[311 \nU.S. 435, 448]\n\u00a0\n said of a decision construing such a statutory provision so as to hold a tax of so many cents on the dollar upon property an income tax because, forsooth, all the property assessed has been received as the fruits of labor, of industry, or of capital, upon the theory that, as the property had come into existence at some remote date as income, the tax was an income tax? I think that is precisely what has been done in this case.\n The facts are not in dispute. The respondent receives income in many states. That income is forwarded to its home office after bearing whatever tax is laid upon its receipt in the state of receipt. Thereupon the funds so forwarded become a portion of the general mass of the respondent's property, held and administered at its general office. The funds may be employed in the extension of its business; they may be held as insurance against future business losses or they may be distributed to its stockholders in dividends. Their management and their disbursement have no relation to the original receipt of income save only the fact that, like most property, they are built up as the fruits of income. Their use and their disbursement does not depend on any law of Wisconsin and cannot be controlled by any such law. The act of disbursing them, whether in payment of corporate obligations or as dividends, is one wholly beyond the reach of Wisconsin's sovereign power, one which it cannot effectively command, or prohibit or condition. That distribution cannot be the subject of an excise tax by the State of Wisconsin. So much the state admits.\n Under the challenged statute, a presumption is created which is shown in the case of the assessment against the respondent for the years in question to be contrary to the fact,-namely, that an arbitrarily assumed proportion of the dividend is paid out of the respondent's earnings in Wisconsin for the year immediately preceding the payment of such dividend. By the very terms of the Act, \n\n[311 \nU.S. 435, 449]\n\u00a0\n the tax is laid not on the corporation but on the stockholder receiving the dividend and, by confession, thousands of such stockholders are not residents of Wisconsin. The corporation is the mere collector of the tax and the penalty for failure to collect it is that the corporation must pay it. If the exaction is an income tax in any sense it is such upon the stockholder and is obviously bad. It cannot, except by a perversion of the term and the affixing of an arbitrary label, be denominated a tax upon the income of the respondent.\n The explanation of the reason and purpose for imposing the tax, disclosed in the opinion of the court, serves to condemn it. If Wisconsin found that dividend income of stockholders of domestic corporations escaped taxation, and should bear it, an effective way to reach the dividend receipts of the stockholders of such corporations was to place a tax upon the receipt of dividends by them. But such a levy upon the stockholders of a foreign corporation, not resident within Wisconsin, obviously was impossible although that is exactly what was attempted by the statute in question. We are now told that this is not a fair exposition of the law but that, on the contrary, and in the teeth of the known facts, what Wisconsin did was to lay a supplementary income tax upon foreign corporations. This is simply to take the name of a well understood concept and assign that name as a label to something which in ordinary understanding never fell within such concept. By this process any exaction can be tortured into something else and then justified under an assumed name.\n The respondent owns property in various states of the Union. It is reasonable to suppose that much of that property has been purchased out of corporate surplus, that is, out of past earnings. An ad valorem tax by Wisconsin on property so acquired could be quite as easily justified under the label of an income tax because \n\n[311 \nU.S. 435, 450]\n\u00a0\n the property represented income once received, as the present tax, on the declaration and receipt of dividends out of earned surplus.\n Upon the facts, the tax is levied on what lies outside the sovereignty of Wisconsin. Its attempted collection is a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and should be stricken down.\n The Supreme Court of Wisconsin could not have decided otherwise in the light of a recent expression of this court on the subject. In reaching its decision it professedly followed and applied Connecticut General Life Insurance Co. v. Johnson, \n303 \nU.S. 77\n, 58 S.Ct. 436. There a Connecticut life insurance company did business in California under license from that state. It entered into contracts with other insurance companies, also licensed to do business in California, reinsuring them against loss on policies written by them in California on the lives of California residents. The contracts were made in Connecticut, premiums were paid there, and the losses, if any, were there payable. California imposed a tax upon the privilege of the company to do business within California. The tax was measured by the gross premiums received. California officials attempted to collect the tax on the premiums received by the Connecticut corporation under the reinsurance contracts in question. The Supreme Court of California, 8 Cal.2d 624, 67 P.2d 675, sustained the tax. In that case, as in this, the highest state court described and defined the tax. There the tax was denominated \"a franchise tax exacted for the privilege of doing business' in the state.' (\n303 \nU.S. 77\n, 58 S.Ct. 437.) Here, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin has denominated the exaction as a privilege or excise tax imposed upon the transfer of property. By the very process the court now professes to employ of disregarding the name given to the tax by the state court, this court, in the Connecticut General Life Insurance Co. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 435, 451]\n\u00a0\n case, reached the conclusion that the State of California could not impose the tax on the activities of the Connecticut company which were not within its jurisdiction. Citing many decisions of this court, it was there said:\n'But the limits of the state's legislative jurisdiction to tax, prescribed by the Fourteenth Amendment, are to be ascertained by reference to the incidence of the tax upon its objects rather than the ultimate thrust of the economic benefits and burdens of transactions within the state.'\n\n The very argument now invoked in support of the present decision was repudiated by the court in the Connecticut case in these words:\n'It is said that the state could have lawfully accomplished its purpose if the statute had further stipulated that the deduction should be allowed only in those cases where the reinsurance is effected in the state or the reinsurance premiums paid there. But as the state has placed no such limitation on the allowance of deductions, the end sought can be attained only if the receipt by appellant of the reinsurance premiums paid in Connecticut upon the Connecticut policies is within the reach of California's taxing power. Appellee argues that it is, because the reinsurance transactions are so related to business carried on by appellant in California as to be a part of it and properly included in the measure of the tax; and because, in any case, no injustice is done to appellant since the effect of the statute as construed is to redistribute the tax, which the state might have exacted from the original insurers but did not, by assessing it upon appellant to the extent to which it has received the benefit of the allowed deductions.'\n\n In describing the incidence of the void tax this court said, as it might with equal accuracy be said of the instant tax: \n\n[311 \nU.S. 435, 452]\n\u00a0\n 'Apart from the facts that appellant was privileged to do business in California, and that the risks reinsured were originally insured against in that state by companies also authorized to do business there, California had no relationship to appellant or to the reinsurance contracts. No act in the course of their formation, performance, or discharge, took place there. The performance of those acts was not dependent upon any privilege or authority granted by it, and California laws afforded to them to protection.'\n And finally the court concluded:\n'All that appellant did in effecting the reinsurance was done without the state and for its transaction no privilege or license by California was needful. The tax cannot be sustained either as laid on property, business done, or transactions carried on within the state, or as a tax on a privilege granted by the state.'\n\n I think that the judgment below should be affirmed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice REED concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 3, Chapter 505, Laws of Wisconsin, 1935, as amended by Chapter 552, Laws of Wisconsin, 1935:\n'Section 3.

That date was fixed as affording adequate time, upon a liberal estimate, for the completion of the entire system designed for sewage treatment, together with controlling works to prevent reversals of the Chicago River in times of storm.\n The State of Illinois now seeks a temporary modification of the decree so as to permit an increase of the diversion to not more than 5,000 cubic feet per second, in addition to domestic pumpage, until December 31, 1942. The State submits its petition, not on behalf of the City of Chicago or the Sanitary District, but at the instance of certain communities bordering on the Illinois Waterway, including Lockport and Joliet. The grounds for the application are that the system for sewage treatment has not yet been completed and will not be completed until the end of the year 1942, and that, in consequence, \n\n[309 \nU.S. 569, 571]\n\u00a0\n through the introduction of untreated sewage into the stream, an 'obnoxious, noisome, filthy, unsanitary and dangerous condition to public health' exists along the Sanitary District Canal and the Illinois Waterway.\n The State of Illinois has failed to show that it has provided all possible means at its command for the completion of the sewage treatment system as required by the decree as specifically enlarged in 1933 (\n289 \nU.S. 395, 710\n, 53 S.Ct. 671, 1465). No adequate excuse has been presented for the delay.

This matter had been considered by the Court in framing its \n\n[309 \nU.S. 572, 574]\n\u00a0\n decree (298 U.S. pages 581, 582, 56 S.Ct. page 916) and the motion was denied. Leave was granted to Wyoming to file its petition and Colorado was directed to show cause accordingly.\n Two returns have been filed on behalf of Colorado, one by the Governor of the State setting forth his executive order directing the withdrawal of the appearance of the Attorney General and appointing special counsel to represent the State, and another return by the Attorney General who challenges the authority of the Governor to supersede him. In the view we take of the material matters presented, we find no such differences between the two returns as to require us to determine the question of authority.\n Wyoming charges that from May 1, 1939, to June 18, 1939, Colorado diverted from the Laramie river 39,865.43 acre feet, that is, somewhat in excess of the total of 39,750 acre feet allocated to Colorado by our decree; that thereupon, and on June 19, 1939, Colorado closed the headgates of the various ditches involved; that on June 22, 1939, in violation of the decree, Colorado opened the headgates and permitted the diversion between June 22, 1939, and July 11, 1939, of 12,673 acre feet in excess of the 39,750 acre feet allowed; and that in particular, with respect to meadowland ditches, Colorado permitted the diversion between May 1, 1939, and July 11, 1939, of 24,775 acre feet above the 4250 acre feet (measured at the headgates) specifically allowed for the meadowland appropriations. 298 U.S. page 586, 56 S.Ct. page 918.\n In defense, Colorado contends that the meadowland diversions in excess of 4250 acre feet were in accordance with Colorado law and were not inconsistent with the decree of this Court until a diversion by Colorado from the Laramie river for all purposes reached the allocated total of 39, 750; that the diversion of an amount greater than that total during the period above specified was with \n\n[309 \nU.S. 572, 575]\n\u00a0\n the acquiescence of Wyoming; and that Wyoming has not been injured.\n Colorado pledges that hereafter its officials will administer the flow of the Laramie river in that State in accordance with Colorado laws and adjudication decrees until a total amount of 39,750 acre feet, measured at the headgates, has been diverted, and, when that total has been reached in any year, Colorado can and will close the headgates and keep them closed during the remainder of the irrigation season.\n In support of the contention that the diversion of more than 4250 acre feet for the meadowland appropriations should not be regarded as a violation of our decree, if the aggregate diversions in Colorado do not exceed the total allowed, Colorado presents a declaratory judgment of the District Court of that State for the County of Laramie, entered February 2, 1939, in the suit of Adelrick Benziger v. Water Supply & Storage Company et al. That suit was brought on behalf of the meadowland appropriators in Colorado, and the defendants were the other appropriators in that State whose respective appropriations had been the subject of consideration in the suit in this Court. Our rulings were examined by the state court which concluded that they were intended to, and did, determine only the relative rights to the two States to divert the waters of the Laramie river and its tributaries and that it was not our purpose to withdraw the appropriations and water claims in Colorado from the operation of its local laws or to restrict the utilization of the waters in any way 'not affecting the rights of the State of Wyoming and her water claimants'. Accordingly the state court held that the fixing in our decree of the meadowland appropriations was intended only to bear upon the relative rights of the States and was not intended to be an adjudication of the relative rights of the decreed appropriations in Colorado; hence, that so \n\n[309 \nU.S. 572, 576]\n\u00a0\n long as the aggregate of the water diverted in Colorado does not exceed the total of 39,750 acre feet accredited to the Colorado appropriations, as stated, they are subject to the laws of Colorado. In that view the Court adjudged that the meadowland appropriators and the defendant appropriators were entitled to divert according to their respective priorities until they reached the amount of 39,750 acre feet, and that when that amount had been diverted 'all headgates are to be closed for the balance of the season'.\n A review of our decisions confirms the construction thus placed upon them. Suit was brought in 1911 to prevent a proposed diversion in Colorado of the waters of the Laramie river, an interstate stream. Voluminous evidence was taken, the case was thrice argued, and a final decision was rendered in 1922. \n259 \nU.S. 419\n, 42 S.Ct. 552. After an elaborate consideration of the physical features of the region and the principles applicable to a determination of the rights of the respective States, the Court concluded that as both States had adopted the doctrine of appropriation, it was equitable to apply that doctrine and to determine their respective rights according to the rule of priority. The Court examined the evidence with respect to the flow of the stream, its variations, and other relevant matters, and found that the available supply-288,000 acre feet-was not sufficient to satisfy the Wyoming appropriations and also the proposed Colorado appropriation. The Court found that there were some existing Colorado appropriations entitled to precedence over many of those in Wyoming. These included 18,000 acre feet for what was known as the Skyline Ditch and 4250 acre feet for meadowland appropriators. These were not to be deducted, as the 288,000 acre feet was the available supply after they were satisfied. The proposed Colorado appropriation which was in controversy in the suit was that known as the Laramie-Poudre Tunnel di- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 572, 577]\n\u00a0\n version, a part of an irrigation project known as the Laramie-Poudre project. The evidence showed that the Wyoming appropriations having priorities senior to the one in Colorado, and which were dependent on the available supply above specified, required 272,500 acre feet. Deducting that from the available 288,000 acre feet there remained 15,500 acre feet which were subject to the proposed appropriation in Colorado. Accordingly a decree was entered enjoining the defendants from diverting more than 15, 500 acre feet annually from the Laramie river through the Laramie-Poudre project. The decree provided that it should not prejudice the right of Colorado, or of anyone recognized by her as entitled thereto, to continue to divert 18,000 acre feet through the Skyline Ditch and 4250 acre feet through the meadowland appropriations. 259 U.S. pages 496, 497, 42 S.Ct. page 594. Soon after, this decree was modified so as not to prejudice a diversion by Colorado for the Wilson Supply Ditch (\n260 \nU.S. 1\n, 43 S.Ct. 2), a diversion which amounted to 2000 acre feet. 298 U.S. page 580, 56 S.Ct. page 915. In this way the total allowed to Colorado amounted to 39,750 acre feet.\n In 1931, Wyoming brought another suit in this Court, alleging that Colorado was permitting excessive diversions and seeking the protection and quieting of Wyoming's rights under the former decree. Wyoming asked provision for accurately measuring and recording the quantities of water diverted and also an injunction restraining excessive diversions, if it were held that the former decree related only to the diversion by the Laramie-Poudre Tunnel appropriation. Motion to dismiss the bill was denied. We held that the former decree should be taken as determining the relative rights of the two States, including their respective citizens, to divert and use the waters of the Laramie and its tributaries; that the limited injunction did not warrant an inference that it marked 'the limits of what was intended to be decided', but that the \n\n[309 \nU.S. 572, 578]\n\u00a0\n decree did define the quantity of water which Colorado and her appropriators might divert 'from the interstate stream and its tributaries and thus withhold from Wyoming and her appropriators'. \n286 \nU.S. 494\n, 506- 508, 52 S.Ct. 621, 625, 626.\n Final hearing was had and the case was decided in 1936. \n298 \nU.S. 573\n, 56 S.Ct. 912. Wyoming contended that while the decree fixed the amount of the diversions under the meadowland appropriations in Colorado at 4250 acre feet, the actual diversions had ranged from 36,000 to 62,000 acre feet. Colorado answered that the greater part of this water was returned to the stream through surface drainage and percolation and that the part actually consumed did not exceed the amount which the decree allowed. The Court said that the amount of 4250 acre feet had been fixed as the measure of the meadowland appropriations because it was deemed sufficient for that purpose 'when the water is rightly and not wastefully applied'. The Court referred to the wasteful process that had been used. It was said that when water is so applied a considerable portion ultimately finds its way back into the stream, but that it was also true 'that a material percentage of the water is lost by evaporation and other natural processes, and that there is no way of determining with even approximate certainty how much of the water returns to the stream'. The Court then held that the decree referred to the water taken from the stream 'at the point of diversion, and not to the variable and uncertain part of it that is consumptively used'. As it was plainly shown that diversions were being made under the meadowland appropriations in quantities largely in excess of the amount fixed in the decree, an injunction issued forbidding further departures from the decree in that regard. Id., 298 U.S. pages 581, 582, 56 S.Ct. page 916.\n With respect to the request for an order permitting Wyoming to install measuring devices for the purpose of \n\n[309 \nU.S. 572, 579]\n\u00a0\n determining the amount of water diverted in Colorado, the Court recognized that the problem of measuring and recording the diversions was a difficult one and the hope was expressed that the two States by cooperative efforts would find a satisfactory solution. Leave was granted to Wyoming to make a later application if the States were unable to agree. Id., 298 U.S. pages 585, 586, 56 S.Ct. pages 917, 918. It seems that measuring devices have been installed.\n While an injunction was thus granted with respect to diversions for the meadowland appropriations in excess of 4250 acre feet, this was manifestly upon the assumption that Colorado was otherwise using the total amount of water allocated to that State. That it was not intended to restrict Colorado in determining the use of the water of the river, according to Colorado laws and adjudications, provided the diversions did not exceed the aggregate amount of 39,750 acre feet to which Colorado was entitled, is clear from the ruling upon another branch of the case. It appeared that the diversion for the Skyline Ditch had been above the amount allowed therefor, but that other diversions were less, so that, eliminating the excessive meadowland diversions, the aggregate allowance to the State would not be exceeded. Hence the Court found that it must consider Colorado's contention 'that, consistently with the decree, she lawfully may permit diversions under any of the recognized appropriations in excess of its accredited quantity, so long as the total diversions under all do not exceed the aggregate of the quantities accredited to them severally'. Id., 298 U.S. page 583, 56 S.Ct. page 917.\n The Court noted that in both Colorado and Wyoming water rights were transferable and that the use of the water may be changed from the irrigation of one tract to the irrigation of another, if the change does not injure other appropriators; that these rules were but incidental to the doctrine of appropriation, prevailing in both \n\n[309 \nU.S. 572, 580]\n\u00a0\n States, upon which the decree had been based. The Court observed that it was not its purpose 'to withdraw water claims dealt with therein from the operation of local laws relating to their transfer or to restrict their utilization in ways not affecting the rights of one state and her claimants as against the other state and her claimants'. It was found that the diversions through the transmountain ditches had been made with the consent of the owners of the water rights and with the full sanction of Colorado, and hence the situation was not different from what it would have been if the owners of other claims had formally transferred parts of their water rights to the Skyline owners. The Court said: 'But the Skyline owners are now permitted by the owners of the other claims and by Colorado to take and use part of the waters included in those claims. Wyoming and her claimants are in no way injured by this. No departure from the decree is involved. The thing which the decree recognizes and confirms is 'the right of the State of Colorado, or of any one recognized by her as duly entitled thereto, ... to divert and take' the water included in the designated appropriations'. The Court concluded that in the circumstances shown the Skyline Ditch diversions did not constitute an infraction of the decree. Id., 298 U.S. pages 584, 585, 56 S.Ct. page 917, 918.\n It is plain that the principle of this ruling, as applied to the transmountain appropriations which diverted the water of the Laramie river to another watershed, would certainly also apply to the meadowland appropriations within the same watershed, where part of the water diverted may find its way back to the stream. The limitation of the meadowland appropriations to 4250 acre feet was to keep the diversions in Colorado within the amount allowed to that State, not to prevent the distribution of the water thus allowed, according to Colorado \n\n[309 \nU.S. 572, 581]\n\u00a0\n laws, where there was no infraction of the rights of Wyoming and her water claimants.\n We conclude that the decree is not violated in any substantial sense so long as Colorado does not divert from the Laramie river and its tributaries more than 39,750 acre feet per annum.\n In 1939, however, Colorado diverted more than that total amount. Apparently no question had been raised by Wyoming, as to the diversions in 1937 and 1938. It is undisputed that when the diversions in 1939 reached 39,865.43 acre feet on June 19th, Colorado closed the headgates of the various appropriations within that State. But Wyoming alleges that Colorado wrongfully permitted the headgates to be reopened on June 22d and to remain open until July 11th, thus permitting the diversion of 12,673 acre feet in excess of the aggregate amount allowed to Colorado, despite Wyoming's protest. That there was this excessive diversion is not controverted.\n Colorado insists that Wyoming has not been injured. But such a defense is not admissible. After great consideration, this Court fixed the amount of water from the Laramie river and its tributaries to which Colorado was entitled. Colorado is bound by the decree not to permit a greater withdrawal and, if she does so, she violates the decree and is not entitled to raise any question as to injury to Wyoming when the latter insists upon her adjudicated rights. If nothing further were shown, it would be our duty to grant the petition of Wyoming and to adjudge Colorado in contempt for her violation of the decree.\n But Colorado insists that the diversion of more than the allocated total during the season of 1939 was with Wyoming's acquiescence. That is the sole available defense. To support it, Colorado has presented affidavits showing communications between an association of \n\n[309 \nU.S. 572, 582]\n\u00a0\n meadowland appropriators and the special hydrographer of Wyoming and also stating that at a conference in the office of the Governor of Colorado on July 1, 1939, the officers of Wyoming said that they had no objection to continued diversions being made through the meadowland ditches for the reason that a great portion of the water so diverted returned to the Laramie river to be used downstream by Wyoming appropriators. Wyoming presents affidavits to the contrary, setting forth her demands. It is unnecessary to review in detail the points in controversy. In the light of all the circumstances, we think it sufficiently appears that there was a period of uncertainty and room for misunderstanding which may be considered in extenuation. In the future there will be no ground for any possible misapprehension based upon views of the effect of the meadowland diversions or otherwise with respect to the duty of Colorado to keep her total diversions from the Laramie river and its tributaries within the limit fixed by the decree.\n For the reasons stated, the petition of Wyoming is denied, the costs to be equally divided. It is so ordered.\n Petition denied. \n\n\n\n","118":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATES OF WISCONSIN, MINNESOTA, OHIO AND PENNSYLVANIA v.

NEW YORK LIFE INS. CO.(1940)\nNo. 74\nArgued: November 13, 1940Decided: December 23, 1940\n\n\n\n Rehearing Denied Feb. 3, 1941\n\n\n See \n312 \nU.S. 713\n, 61 S.Ct. 609, 85 L.Ed. --. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 464, 465]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Kendall B. Randolph, of St. Joseph, Mo., for petitioner.\n Mr. William H. Becker, of Columbia, Mo., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent insurance company brought this suit in the federal district court for a declaratory judgment that it was no longer obligated to make disability payments to petitioner or to waive payment of premiums under the total disability clauses of insurance policies issued to petitioner prior to 1931. The question is whether the Circuit Court of Appeals should have followed two decisions of the Kansas City Court of Appeals in earlier suits between the same parties.\n In June, 1931, petitioner fell and seriously injured his left ankle. The injury is permanent. For about two \n\n[311 \nU.S. 464, 466]\n\u00a0\n years after the injury, respondent paid petitioner the total disability benefits and waived premiums. In October, 1933, it notified him that it intended to cease benefit payments and waiver of premiums because it no longer considered him totally disabled.\n In April, 1934, petitioner brought suit in a Missouri state court for the disability payments allegedly due and unpaid at that time. From a verdict and judgment for respondent he appealed to the Kansas City Court of Appeals, an intermediate state appellate court. That court held that petitioner's evidence was sufficient to take the case to the jury and that the trial judge erred in giving certain instructions. It reversed and remanded the case for a new trial. 90 S.W.2d 784. Respondent thereupon sought a writ of certiorari from the Missouri Supreme Court but was unsuccessful. In consequence, the action is still pending but has not yet been retried.\n In June, 1936, after remand of the first case, petitioner instituted two more actions, also in Missouri state courts, to recover disability benefits which allegedly had accrued since commencement of the first suit. One action was tried and this time petitioner secured verdict and judgment from which respondent appealed. The Kansas City Court of Appeals again reversed because of error in the instructions, although it held that petitioner's evidence presented a case for the jury. It remanded the action for a new trial. 232 Mo.App. 1048, 114 S.W.2d 167. Both of these actions also are pending trial.\n At this juncture respondent, a New York corporation, started the present suit against petitioner, a resident of Missouri, in the District Court for the Western District of Missouri. It sought a declaratory judgment that petitioner was not totally disabled within the meaning of the disability clause, and hence, that respondent was not liable for disability payments or waiver of premiums from June, 1936, until the date of suit. To prove its case re- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 464, 467]\n\u00a0\n spondent introduced the transcript of testimony taken in the second of the earlier suits. Petitioner supplemented the transcript by a statement of respondent against interest, a personal deposition, and the testimony of another doctor. The trial, without a jury, resulted in a judgment for petitioner, the district judge finding that petitioner was totally disabled within the meaning of the policies. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, however, holding that the evidence established that petitioner was not totally disabled. It remanded with directions to enter a declaratory judgment as prayed by respondent. 8 Cir., 109 F.2d 874. We granted certiorari on October 14, 1940, \n311 \nU.S. 628\n, 61 S.Ct. 8, 85 L.Ed . --.\n We are of opinion that the Circuit Court of Appeals erred in failing to follow the two decisions of the Kansas City Court of Appeals in earlier suits between the same parties involving the same issues of law and fact.\n We have recently held that in cases where jurisdiction rests on diversity of citizenship, federal courts, under the doctrine of Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n, 58 S.Ct. 817, 114 A. L.R. 1487, must follow the decisions of intermediate state courts in the absence of convincing evidence that the highest court of the state would decide differently. West v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., \n311 \nU.S. 223\n, 61 S.Ct. 179; Fidelity Union Trust Co. et al. v. Field, \n311 \nU.S. 169\n, 61 S.Ct. 176; Six Companies of California et al. v. Joint Highway District, \n311 \nU.S. 180\n, 61 S.Ct. 186. In particular this is true where the intermediate state court has determined the precise question in issue in an earlier suit between the same parties, and the highest court of the state has refused review. West v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., supra.\n Twice the Kansas City Court of Appeals has had before it appeals involving the same parties, insurance contracts, and facts as are involved here. Stoner v. New York Life Ins. Co., 90 S.W.2d 784; Stoner v. New York Life Ins. Co., 232 Mo.App. 1048, 114 S.W.2d 167. Each time respondent argued that petitioner's evidence failed to \n\n[311 \nU.S. 464, 468]\n\u00a0\n present a submissible case. 90 S.W.2d 784, 790; 232 Mo.App. 1048, 114 S.W. 2d 167, 168. Each time the Kansas City Court of Appeals expressly stated that the evidence as to total disability presented a question for the jury. 90 S.W.2d 784, 794, 797; 232 Mo.App. 1048, 114 S.W.2d 167, 169. Moreover, in approving or disapproving certain instructions it marked out the limits of the test the jury was to employ in determining the existence or non- existence of total disability within the meaning of the policies.\n It is apparent, then, that the question of total disability, on the evidence before the court in those two cases, is a question for the jury under instructions embodying the test the Kansas City Court of Appeals approved. Under the rule of the West, Six Companies, and Field cases, supra, it was error for the Circuit Court of Appeals to hold, in effect, that the evidence would not support the finding of the trial judge that there was total disability, unless convincing evidence indicated that the Missouri Supreme Court would decide differently.\n The present case is not different merely because there are now in the record a statement against interest, a deposition of petitioner, and the testimony of a doctor which were not in the record in the earlier cases. The three items of evidence were introduced by petitioner and, if anything, weaken respondent's case. Moreover, apart from these three items, the evidence in the present case consists of the transcript the Kansas City Court of Appeals had before it when it wrote the opinion in the second appeal (232 Mo.App. 1048, 114 S.W.2d 167).\n Nor is there any indication that either the Kansas City Court of Appeals or the Missouri Supreme Court would decide this case differently. Certainly there is nothing to suggest that the Kansas City Court of Appeals now would conclude that the evidence is insufficient after it has held that the same evidence presented a question for the jury. And while the concept of total disability is \n\n[311 \nU.S. 464, 469]\n\u00a0\n inseparable from the facts to which it is applied, Heald v. Aetna Life Insurance Co., 340 Mo. 1143, 104 S.W.2d 379, indicates that the Missouri Supreme Court likewise would conclude that a finding to total disability here is supported by the evidence. See also Foglesong v. Modern Brotherhood, 121 Mo.App. 548, 97 S.W. 240; James v. United States Casualty Co., 113 Mo.App. 622, 88 S.W. 125; Bellows v. Travelers' Insurance Co., Mo. Sup., 203 S.W. 978, which were approved in the Heald case.\n Furthermore, the test for determining total disability approved in the Heald case was employed in the first and followed in the second of the appeals to which we have referred. 90 S.W.2d 784, 793, 795; 232 Mo.App. 1048, 114 S.W.2d 167, 171, 172. It has been employed consistently since the Heald case was decided. Eden v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., Mo.App., 138 S.W.2d 745; Comfort v. Travelers Insurance Co., Mo.App., 131 S.W.2d 734; Rogers v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., Mo.App., 122 S.W.2d 5; Wright v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., Mo.App., 115 S.W.2d 102. The same test was used by the district judge in the present suit. He applied it to the evidence which the Kansas City Court of Appeals twice has said presented a question for the jury; and, since the case was tried to the court, he determined that the evidence established total disability. We think it is immaterial that in the earlier suits the burden was on petitioner to prove total disability while here the courts below assumed the burden is on respondent to show that total disability no longer exists.\n We conclude that it was error to direct the entry of a declaratory judgment for respondent. It was proper, however, to deny petitioner's motion to dismiss for want of the necessary amount in controversy since a judgment in favor of respondent would determine petitioner's claim to both benefit payments and waiver of premiums. The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and that of the District Court is affirmed. It is so ordered.\n Judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and that of the District Court affirmed. \n\n\n\n","120":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSUNSHINE ANTHRACITE COAL CO. v.

Jackson, Atty. Gen., for appellee.\n\n\n[310 \nU.S. 381, 387]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The labor provisions of the Bituminous Coal Conservation Act of 1935 ( 49 Stat. 991) were held unconstitutional by this Court in Carter v. Carter Coal Co., \n298 \nU.S. 238\n, 56 S.Ct. 855. The Bituminous Coal Act of 1937 (50 Stat. 72, 15 U.S.C.A.  828-851) was thereupon enacted. It eliminated those provisions of the earlier Act and made other substantive and structural changes. \n1\n The basic problem here involved is the constitutionality of the 1937 Act.\n That Act provides for the regulation of the sale and distribution of bituminous coal by the National Bituminous Coal Commission2 with the cooperation of the bi- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 381, 388]\n\u00a0\n tuminous coal industry. Its aim is the stabilization of the industry primarily through price-fixing and the elimination of unfair competition. It is provided in  4 (15 U.S.C.A.  831) that the coal producers, accepting membership, shall be organized under the Bituminous Coal Code. Some twenty district boards of code members are provided for, which are to operate as an aid to the Commission but subject to its pervasive surveillance and authority. The statute specifies in detail the methods of their organization and operation, the scope of their functions, and the jurisdiction of the Commission over them. The Commission is empowered to fix minimum prices for code members in accordance with stated standards. Under  4, II(a), 15 U.S.C.A.  833(a), each board shall 'on its own motion or when directed by the Commission' propose minimum prices pursuant to prescribed statutory standards. These may be approved, disapproved, or modified by the Commission as the basis for the coordination of minimum prices. Somewhat comparable machinery is provided for such co-ordination of minimum prices 'in common consuming market areas upon a fair competitive basis',  4, II(b), 15 U.S.C.A.  833(b), and for establishment of rules and regulations incidental to the sale and distribution of coal by code members.  4, II(a). The Commission is also given power by  4, II(c), 15 U.S.C.A.  833(c), to establish maximum prices for code members pursuant to standards prescribed therein. The sale, delivery, or offer for sale of coal below the minimum or above the maximum prices established by the Commission is made a violation of the code.  4, II(e), 15 U.S.C.A.  833(e). So are numerous practices, specified in  4, II(i), 15 U.S.C.A.  833(i), as unfair methods of competition. And contracts for the sale of coal at prices below the prescribed minimum or above the maximum are invalid and unenforceable.  4, II(e). The Commission may, after hearing, revoke the code membership of any coal producer for willful violation of the code or of any regulation made thereunder.  5(b), 15 U.S.C.A.  835(b). \n\n[310 \nU.S. 381, 389]\n\u00a0\n Sec. 3(a), 15 U.S.C.A.  830(a), imposes an excise tax of 1 cent per ton of two thousand pounds upon the sale or other disposition by the producer of bituminous coal produced in the United States. \n3\n Sec. 3(b), 15 U.S.C.A.  830(b), imposes an additional 19 1\/2% tax (based on sale price or in certain cases on fair market value) on sales of bituminous coal by producers 'which would be subject to the application of the conditions and provisions of the code provided for in section 4 (sections 831-833), or of the provisions of section 4-A (834)'.4 Producers who are members of the code are exempt from that tax. As we shall see, the interpretation of  3( b) is a subject of controversy. But if, as the government contends, the 19 1\/2% tax is applicable to sales by non-members, there are strong inducements for joining the code.\n Machinery is provided in  4-A for obtaining exemptions. A producer who believes that any commerce in coal is not, or may not be made, subject to the provisions of  4 may file an application for exemption with the Commission. Subject to qualifications not material here, the filing of such application 'in good faith' exempts the applicant from any 'obligation, duty or liability' imposed by  4 pending action by the Commission on the application. The Commission shall grant the application or, \n\n[310 \nU.S. 381, 390]\n\u00a0\n after notice and opportunity for hearing, shall deny or otherwise dispose of it. An applicant aggrieved by such denial or other disposition may obtain a review of the order in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia or in the Court of Appeals in the circuit where he resides or has his principal place of business.  6(b), 15 U.S.C.A.  836(b). The findings of the Commission as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, are conclusive.\n Appellant is lessee of coal lands in Arkansas and is engaged in the business of mining and shipping coal. It has not subscribed to or accepted the provisions of the Bituminous Coal Code provided for in  4 of the Act. In August 1937 it filed an application for exemption on the grounds that its coal was not bituminous coal as defined in  17(b) of the Act, 15 U.S. C.A.  847(b). 5 The Commission held a public hearing on that application in October 1937. 6 Appellant appeared, introduced evidence, and was heard on oral argument before the Commission. \n7\n In August 1938 the Commission handed down an opinion with findings of fact and conclusions of law and entered an order denying appellant's application for exemption on the grounds that its coal was bituminous within the meaning \n\n[310 \nU.S. 381, 391]\n\u00a0\n of  17(b). Appellant obtained a review of this order in the Circuit Court of Appeals. That court held that the Commission had jurisdiction to determine the status of coal claimed to be exempt and that the Commission's decision was based on substantial evidence. It accordingly affirmed the order. Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. National Bituminous Coal Commission, 105 F.2d 559. We denied certiorari. \n308 \nU.S. 604\n, 60 S.Ct. 142, 84 L.Ed. --.\n In May 1938, while the above proceeding was pending before the Commission, appellee demanded that appellant pay the taxes, penalties and interest accruing under  3(b) of the Act for the period ending February 1938; and filed a notice of tax lien against appellant's property. Thereupon appellant filed its complaint in this suit to enjoin the collection of the tax. A three-judge court was convened, which issued a temporary injunction. Apparently no further action was taken in this case until after the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals in Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. National Bituminous Coal Commission, supra, when appellee filed a supplemental answer stating that the decision in that case was res judicata as to the status of appellant's coal under the Act and that the district court had no jurisdiction over that subject matter. The court below denied appellant's motion to strike that portion of the answer. 31 F.Supp. 125. The case was tried. The court held the Act to be constitutional and dismissed the bill on the merits. \n8\n The case is here on appeal (50 Stat. 752; 28 U.S.C.A.  380a).\n I. Appellant argues that it is not subject to the 19 1\/2% tax imposed by  3(b) because that section does not ap- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 381, 392]\n\u00a0\n ply to producers who are not members of the code. Its argument rests on the construction of s 3(b) and  4. As we have seen, the former places the 19 1\/2% tax on the sale or other disposition of coal 'which would be subject to the application of the conditions and provisions of the code provided for in section 4 (sections 831-833), or of the provisions of section 4-A (834).' Sec. 4 provides that the 'provisions of such code shall apply only to such code members.' Appellant therefore contends that the tax is not applicable to its coal, since the coal produced by a non- code producer such as appellant is not subject to the provisions of the code.\n But if the 19 1\/2% tax is not applicable to non-code members, it is not applicable to anyone since  3(b) exempts code members from that tax. That construction would read the 19 1\/2% tax out of the Act. The essential sanction of the Act would then disappear and its effectiveness would be seriously impaired. That alternative will not be taken where a construction is possible which will preserve the vitality of the Act and the utility of the language in question. See Armstrong Paint & Varnish Works v. Nu-Enamel Corp., \n305 \nU.S. 315, 333\n, 59 S.Ct. 191, 200, and cases cited. Only a highly strained construction of  3(b) would lead to the conclusion that non-code members are exempt from the 19 1\/2% tax. It seems that Congress made a deliberate choice of words when it said that the tax applied to the sale or other disposition of coal which 'would be' subject to  4 and  4-A. Sec. 4 is made expressly applicable 'only to matters and transactions in or directly affecting interstate commerce in bituminous coal.' Hence it seems plain that the tax was intended to apply only to those sales by noncode members which 'would be' subject to regulation under  4. Appellant's coal plainly falls in that class since practically its entire output is sold to purchasers outside the state of Arkansas. To sustain appellant's position we would not only have to substitute 'is' for 'would be'; we would have to override the express Congressional \n\n[310 \nU.S. 381, 393]\n\u00a0\n plan to make the 19 1\/2% tax 'in aid of the regulation of interstate commerce' in bituminous coal. \n9\n That would be not only to rewrite  3(b) but to remake the whole statutory scheme. Obviously such a task is not for the courts.\n II. Appellant challenges the constitutionality of the Act on the grounds that the 19 1\/2% tax is not a tax but a penalty, that Congress lacks the power to fix minimum prices for bituminous coal sold in interstate commerce, that there has been an invalid delegation of legislative and judicial power, and that the division of bituminous coal into code and non-code classes is improper.\n Clearly this tax is not designed merely for revenue purposes. In purpose and effect it is primarily a sanction to enforce the regulatory provisions of the Act. But that does not mean that the statute is invalid and the tax unenforceable. Congress may impose penalties in aid of the exercise of any of its enumerated powers. The power of taxation, granted to Congress by the Constitution, may be utilized as a sanction for the exercise of another power which is granted it. Head Money Cases, \n112 \nU.S. 580, 596\n, 5 S.Ct. 247, 252. And see Sonzinsky v. United States, \n300 \nU.S. 506\n, 57 S.Ct. 554. It is so utilized here.\n The regulatory provisions are clearly within the power of Congress under the commerce clause of the Constitution (article 1,  8, cl. 3). These provisions are applicable only to sales or transactions in, or directly or intimately affecting, interstate commerce. The fixing of prices, the proscription of unfair trade practices, the establishment of marketing rules respecting such sales of bituminous coal constitute regulations within the competence of Congress under the commerce clause. As stated by Mr. Justice Cardozo in \n\n[310 \nU.S. 381, 394]\n\u00a0\n his dissent in Carter v. Carter Coal Co., supra, 298 U.S. at page 326, 56 S.Ct. at page 879, 'To regulate the price for such transactions is to regulate commerce itself, and not alone its antecedent conditions or its ultimate consequences.' See Tagg Bros. & Moorhead v. United States, \n280 \nU.S. 420\n, 50 S.Ct. 220. What is true of prices is true of the attachment of other conditions to the flow of a commodity in interstate channels. Mulford v. Smith, \n307 \nU.S. 38\n, 59 S.Ct. 648, and cases cited. Since this power when it exists is complete in itself, Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 196, there can be no question but that the provisions of this Act are an exertion of the paramount federal power over interstate commerce. See United States v. Rock Royal Co-operative, Inc., \n207 \nU.S. 533\n, 59 S.Ct. 993\n\n\n Nor does the Act violate the Fifth Amendment. Price control is one of the means available to the states (Nebbia v. New York, \n291 \nU.S. 502\n, 54 S. Ct. 505, 89 A.L.R. 1469) and to the Congress (United States v. Rock Royal Cooperative, Inc., supra) in their respective domains ( Baldwin v. G.A.F. Seelig, Inc., \n294 \nU.S. 511\n, 55 S.Ct. 497, 101 A.L.R. 55) for the protection and promotion of the welfare of the economy. But appellant claims that this Act is not an appropriate exercise of the Congressional power. It urges that the nature and use of bituminous coal in nowise endanger the health and morals of the populace; that no question of conservation is involved; that the ills of the industry are attributable to overproduction; that the increase of prices will cause a further loss of markets and add to the afflictions which beset the industry; and that the consuming public will be deprived of the wholesome restriction of the anti-trust laws. Those matters, however, relate to questions of policy, to the wisdom of the legislation, and to the appropriateness of the remedy chosen-matters which are not our concern. If we endeavored to appraise them we would be trespassing on the legislative domain. And if we undertook to narrow the scope of federal intervention in this field, as suggested by appellant, we would be blind to at least \n\n[310 \nU.S. 381, 395]\n\u00a0\n thirty years of history. For a generation there have been various manifestations of incessant demand for federal intervention in the coal industry. \n10\n The investigations preceding the 1935 and 1937 Acts are replete with an exposition of the conditions which have beset that industry. \n11\n Official12 and private13 records give eloquent testimony to the statement of Mr. Justice Cardozo in the Carter case (298 U.S. at page 330, 56 S.Ct. at page 881) that free competition had been 'degraded into anarchy' in the bituminous coal industry. Overproduction and savage, competitive warfare wasted the industry. Labor and capital alike were the victims. Financial distress among operators and acute poverty among miners prevailed even during periods of general prosperity. This history of the bituminous coal industry is written in blood as well as in ink.\n It was the judgment of Congress that price-fixing and the elimination of unfair competitive practices were appropriate methods for prevention of the financial ruin, low wages, poor working conditions, strikes, and disruption of the channels of trade which followed in the wake of the demoralized price structures in this industry. If the strategic character of this industry in our economy and the chaotic conditions which have prevailed in it do not justify legislation, it is difficult to imagine what would. To invalidate this Act we would have to deny \n\n[310 \nU.S. 381, 396]\n\u00a0\n the existence of power on the part of Congress under the commerce clause to deal directly and specifically with those forces which in its judgment should not be permitted to dislocate an important segment of our economy and to disrupt and burden interstate channels of trade. That step could not be taken without plain disregard of the Constitution. There are limits on the powers of the states to act as respects these interstate industries. Baldwin v. G.A.F. Seelig, Inc., supra. If the industry acting on its own had endeavored to stabilize the markets through price-fixing agreements, it would have run afoul of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C.A.  1 et seq.). United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., Inc., \n310 \nU.S. 150\n, 60 S.Ct. 811, 84 L.Ed. --. But that does not mean that there is a no man's land between the state and federal domains. Certainly what Congress has forbidden by the Sherman Act it can modify. It may do so, by placing the machinery of price-fixing in the hands of public agencies. It may single out for separate treatment, as it has done on various occasions,14 a particular industry and thereby remove the penalties of the Sherman Act as respects it. Congress under the commerce clause is not impotent to deal with what it may consider to be dire consequences of laissez-faire. It is not powerless to take steps in mitigation of what in its judgment are abuses of cut-throat competition. And it is not limited in its choice between unrestrained self-regulation on the one hand and rigid prohibitions on the other. The commerce clause empowers it to undertake stabilization of an interstate industry through a process of price-fixing which safeguards the public interest by placing price control in the hands of its administrative representative. United States v. Rock Royal Co-operative, Inc., supra. That was the choice which Congress made here. There is nothing \n\n[310 \nU.S. 381, 397]\n\u00a0\n in the Carter case which stands in the way. The majority of the Court in that case did not pass on the price-fixing features of the earlier Act. The Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Cardozo in separate minority opinions expressed the view that the pricefixing features of the earlier Act were constitutional. We rest on their conclusions for sustaining the present Act.\n Nor does the Act contain an invalid delegation of legislative power. Under  4, II(c) the Commission may fix maximum prices when in the public interest it deems it necessary in order to protect the consumer against unreasonably high prices. These maximum prices must be fixed at a uniform increase above minimum prices so that in the aggregate they will yield a reasonable return above the weighted average total cost of the district. And no maximum price shall be established for any mine which will not yield a fair return on the fair value of the property. The minimum prices to be fixed must conform to the following standards: the weighted average cost for each minimum price area must be computed, the elements of cost being defined; a classification of the various sizes and grades of coal shall be made which reflects as nearly as possible the relative market value of the various kinds, qualities, and sizes of coal, which is just and equitable as between producers within the district and which has due regard to the interests of the consuming public; and coordinated minimum prices shall be established for such coal (a) which reflect as nearly as possible the relative market values at points of delivery taking into account specifically enumerated factors, (b) which preserve as nearly as may be existing fair competitive opportunities, (c) which are just and equitable as between the districts, and (d) which, consistently with the process of coordination, yield a return to each area approximating its weighted average cost per ton. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 381, 398]\n\u00a0\n The problem of fixing reasonable prices for bituminous coal cannot be differentiated legally from the task of fixing rates under the Interstate Commerce Act (41 Stat. 484, 49 U.S.C.A.  15) and the Packers and Stockyards Act (42 Stat. 166, 7 U.S.C.A.  211). The latter provide the standard of 'just and reasonable' to guide the administrative body in the rate-making process. The validity of that standard (Tagg Bros. & Moorhead v. United States, supra), the appropriateness of the criterion of the 'public interest' in various contexts (New York Central Securities Corp. v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 12, 24\n, 53 S.Ct. 45, 48; United States v. Chemical Foundation, Inc., \n272 \nU.S. 1\n, 47 S.Ct. 1; Avent v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 127\n, 45 S.Ct. 34), the legality of the standard of 'unreasonable obstruction' to navigation ( Union Bridge Co. v. United States, \n204 \nU.S. 364\n, 27 S.Ct. 367) all make it clear that there is a valid delegation of authority in this case. The standards which Congress has provided here far exceed in specificity others which have been sustained. Certainly in the hands of experts the criteria which Congress has supplied are wholly adequate for carrying out the general policy and purpose of the Act. To require more would be to insist on a degree of exactitude which not only lacks legal necessity but which does not comport with the requirements of the administrative process. Delegation by Congress has long been recognized as necessary in order that the exertion of legislative power does not become a futility. Currin v. Wallace, \n306 \nU.S. 1, 15\n, 59 S.Ct. 379, 386, and cases cited. But the effectiveness of both the legislative and administrative processes would become endangered if Congress were under the constitutional compulsion of filling in the details beyond the liberal prescription here. Then the burdens of minutiae would be apt to clog the administration of the law and deprive the agency of that flexibility and dispatch which are its salient virtues. For these reasons we hold that the standards with which Congress has supplied the Commission are \n\n[310 \nU.S. 381, 399]\n\u00a0\n plainly valid. United States v. Rock Royal Co-operative, Inc., supra.\n Nor has Congress delegated its legislative authority to the industry. The members of the code function subordinately to the Commission. It, not the code authorities, determines the prices. And it has authority and surveillance over the activities of these authorities. Since law-making is not entrusted to the industry, this statutory scheme is unquestionably valid. Currin v. Wallace, supra, and cases cited.\n But appellant maintains that the delegation of authority to the Commission to determine what coal is subject to the Act is unlawful because of uncertainty in the statutory definition of bituminous coal. Sec. 17(b) defines the term 'bituminous coal' as follows:\n'The term 'bituminous coal' includes all bituminous, semibituminous, and subbituminous coal and shall exclude lignite, which is defined as a lignitic coal having calorific value in British thermal units of less than seven thousand six hundred per pound and having a natural moisture content in place in the mine of 30 per centum or more.'\n\n As in the case of the term 'interurban' electric railway in the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C.A.  151 et seq. (Shields v. Utah Idaho Central Railroad Co., \n305 \nU.S. 177\n, 59 S.Ct. 160) we think the definition of bituminous coal is wholly adequate as a standard for administrative action. The fact that it is not a chemist's or an engineer's definition is not fatal. The definition is not devoid of meaning. We are unable to say that it cannot be applied so as to delineate the areas in which Congress intended to make this system of control effective. The fact that many instances may occur where its application may be difficult is merely to emphasize the nature of the administrative problem and the reason for the grant of latitude by the Congress. The difficulty or impossibility of drawing a statutory line is one of the reasons for sup- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 381, 400]\n\u00a0\n plying merely a statutory guide. Cf. Piedmont & Northern Railway Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n286 \nU.S. 299, 312\n, 52 S.Ct. 541, 545. That guide is sufficiently precise for an intelligent determination of the ultimate questions of fact by experts.\n Nor is there an invalid delegation of judicial power. To hold that there was would be to turn back the clock on at least a half century of administrative law. The question of whether or not appellant should be subjected to the regulatory provisions of the Bituminous Coal Act was one which the Congress could decide in the exercise of its powers under the commerce clause. In lieu of making that decision itself, it could bring to its aid the services of an administrative agency. And it could delegate to that agency the determination of the question of fact whether a particular coal producer fell within the Act. Shields v. Utah Idaho Central Railroad Co., supra, 305 U.S. at page 180, 59 S.Ct. at page 162. The fact that such determination involved an interpretation of the term 'bituminous coal' is of no more significance here than was the fact that in the Shields case a decision by the Interstate Commerce Commission of what constituted an 'interurban' electric railway was necessary for the ultimate finding as to the applicability of the Railway Labor Act to carriers. That problem involves no more than the adequacy of the standard governing the exercise of the delegated authority. Furthermore, on this phase of the case, appellant has received all the judicial review to which it is entitled. As we have seen, it obtained a review under  6(b), 15 U.S. C.A.  836(b), of the Commission's denial of its application for exemption. The functions of the courts cease when it is ascertained that the findings of the Commission meet the statutory test. Rochester Telephone Corp. v. United States, \n307 \nU.S. 125, 146\n, 59 S.Ct. 754, 764.\n Appellant contends that the statutory classification of coal into code and non-code classes and the application \n\n[310 \nU.S. 381, 401]\n\u00a0\n of the 19 1\/2% tax to the latter are improper under the Fifth Amendment. Its objection is not premised on lack of due process. Nor could it be in view of the elaborate machinery and procedure for the Act's enforcement which the Congress has provided. Rather appellant's objection is founded on its claim of discrimination. But the Fifth Amendment, unlike the Fourteenth, has no equal protection clause. Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, \n301 \nU.S. 548, 584\n, 57 S.Ct. 883, 889, 109 A.L.R. 1293, and cases cited. And there is 'no requirement of uniformity in connection with the commerce power.' Currin v. Wallace, supra, 306 U.S. at page 14, 59 S. Ct. at page 386. The lack of similarity in treatment of the two classes of coal is an integral and essential feature of this Act. As we have said, it is through that device that Congress sought to obtain an effective sanction for the Act's enforcement. Coercion is the very essence of any penalty exacted for failure of submission. 'It is of the essence of the plenary power conferred' by the commerce clause 'that Congress may exercise its discretion in the use of the power.' Currin v. Wallace, supra, 306 U.S. at page 14, 59 S.Ct. at page 386. A part of that discretion is the selection of the sanction for the law's enforcement. Discrimination constitutionally may be the price of non-compliance. 'Inquiry into the hidden motives which may move Congress to exercise a power constitutionally conferred upon it is beyond the competency of courts.' Sonzinsky v. United States, supra, 300 U.S. at pages 513, 514, 57 S.Ct. at pages 555, 556. And see Mulford v. Smith, supra, 307 U.S. at page 48, 59 S.Ct. at page 652.\n III. Appellant contends here, as it did below, that Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. National Bituminous Coal Commission supra, is not determinative of the present issues since that case did not involve the assessment of taxes and since the Commission had no authority to determine the status of appellant's coal.\n These contentions are untenable. In the first place, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue is merely the agency to collect taxes levied under the Act; he is not the \n\n[310 \nU.S. 381, 402]\n\u00a0\n administrative agent whom Congress has designated to determine what coal is exempt from the 19 1\/2% tax. That function is entrusted to the Commission. By the terms of  4-A it is the Commission which determines whether an application for exemption should be granted or denied. By the provisions of  3(b) it is the Commission which certifies to the Commissioner those who are code members and consequently exempt from the 19 1\/2% tax. Hence the Commission determines the scope of the provisions of the Act and their applicability to various producers. The Commissioner is given no administrative functions whatsoever except tax collection. In the second place, the underlying issue in each of these two suits is the same. In Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. National Bituminous Coal Commission, supra, the question was whether or not appellant's coal was 'bituminous' within the meaning of  17(b). When that issue was decided adversely to appellant, liability for the 19 1\/2% tax followed unless appellant joined the code, in which event it would be entitled to a certificate from the Commission evidencing its tax exemption. In the present suit, appellant is seeking to raise the identical issue, since its purpose is to enjoin collection of the self-same tax.\n The result is clear. Where the issues in separate suits are the same, the fact that the parties are not precisely identical is not necessarily fatal. As stated in Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway Co. v. Schendel, \n270 \nU.S. 611, 620\n, 46 S.Ct. 420, 423, 424, 53 A.L.R. 1265, 'Identity of parties is not a mere matter of form, but of substance. Parties nominally the same may be, in legal effect, different ... and parties nominally different may be, in legal effect, the same.' A judgment is res judicata in a second action upon the same claim between the same parties or those in privity with them. Cromwell v. County of Sac, \n94 \nU.S. 351\n. There is privity between officers of the same government so that a judg- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 381, 403]\n\u00a0\n ment in a suit between a party and a representative of the United States is res judicata in relitigation of the same issue between that party and another officer of the government. See Tait v. Western Maryland Railway Co ., \n289 \nU.S. 620\n, 53 S.Ct. 706. The crucial point is whether or not in the earlier litigation the representative of the United States had authority to represent its interests in a final adjudication of the issue in controversy. Cf. Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Co., \n200 \nU.S. 273\n, 284-289, 26 S.Ct. 252, 256-258. Cases holding that a judgment in a suit against a collector for unlawful exaction is not a bar to a subsequent suit by or against the Commissioner or the United States (Sage v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 33\n, 39 S.Ct. 415; Bankers' Pocahontas Coal Co. v. Burnet, \n287 \nU.S. 308\n, 53 S.Ct. 150) are not in point, since the suit against the collector is 'personal and its incidents, such as the nature of the defenses open and the allowance of interest, are different.' Sage v. United States, supra, 250 U.S. at page 37, 39 S.Ct. at page 416. But here the authority of the Commission is clear. There can be no question that it was authorized to make the determination of the status of appellant's coal under the Act. It represented the United States in that determination and the delegation of that power to the Commission was valid, as we have said. That suit therefore bound the United States, as well as the appellant. Where a suit binds the United States, it binds its subordinate officials. Tait v. Western Maryland Railway Co., supra. The suggestion that the doctrine of res judicata does not apply unless the court rendering the judgment had jurisdicton of the cause is sufficiently answered by Stoll v. Gottlieb, \n305 \nU.S. 165\n, 59 S.Ct. 134, and Treinies v. Sunshine Mining Co., \n308 \nU.S. 66\n, 60 S.Ct. 44. As held in those cases, in general the principles of res judicata apply to questions of jurisdiction as well as to other matters-whether it be jurisdiction of the subject matter or of the parties. Accordingly the lower court correctly held that it had no jurisdiction to determine \n\n[310 \nU.S. 381, 404]\n\u00a0\n whether appellant's coal was 'bituminous' as defined in the Act. Furthermore where, as here, Congress has created a special administrative procedure for the determination of the status of persons or companies under a regulatory act and has prescribed a procedure which meets all requirements of due process, that remedy is exclusive. See Anniston Manufacturing Co. v. Davis. \n301 \nU.S. 337\n, 57 S.Ct. 816.\n The decree below subjected appellant to payment of taxes accrued or assessed against it under  3(b) after December 4, 1939. To relieve against payment of taxes until final termination of the litigation would be to put a premium on dilatory tactics in a situation where under the authority of Currin v. Wallace, Mulford v. Smith, and United States v. Rock Royal Co-operative, Inc., supra, the subject of the Act was clearly one over which the jurisdiction of Congress was complete.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS is of opinion that the Act under review is beyond any power granted to Congress and that the judgment below should be reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] H. Report No. 294, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 2-3. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Though we refer throughout to the Commission, it should be noted that its functions have been administered since July 1, 1939, by the Bituminous Coal Division of the Department of the Interior.

In May 1938 a proposed report of the Commission was issued giving appellant 30 days to file exceptions and briefs and in that event to apply for oral argument. Appellant filed exceptions and asked for oral argument. Notice of oral argument was issued and oral argument was had. Thereafter the Commission issued its order denying the application. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] It granted, however, a permanent injunction against collection of taxes prior to December 4, 1939 the date on which this Court denied a petition for rehearing on the petition for certiorari.

Taft, both of New York City, for petitioners.\n Mr. Thomas E. Harris, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioners, husband and wife, filed joint income-tax returns for the years 1934 and 1935. In computing their aggregate net income under Section 51(b) of the Revenue Act of 1934,1 they made deductions of their combined charitable contributions. \n2\n The Commissioner ruled that the deductions on account of the wife's charitable contributions should be reduced to 15 per cent of her separate net income and deficiences were determined accordingly. The Board of Tax Appeals sustained the Commissioner (40 B.T.A. 229) and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 2 Cir., 111 F.2d 145.\n Because the question is cognate to that presented in the cases of Helvering v. Janney (Gaines v. Helvering), \n311 \nU.S. 189\n, 61 S.Ct. 241, decided this day, we granted certiorari. October 14, 1940. \n311 \nU.S. 628\n, 61 S.Ct. 24, 85 L.Ed. --.\n The provision for joint returns in Section 51(b) of the Revenue Act of 1934 was in substantially the same form as the \n\n[311 \nU.S. 195, 197]\n\u00a0\n corresponding provision in the prior revenue acts from 1921. The import of that provision is that in making a joint return the husband and wife should report their aggregate gross income and could combine their deductions in reporting their aggregate net income upon which the tax was to be computed. That was the construction placed upon the original provision for joint returns, in the Revenue Act of 1918, 40 Stat. 1074, by the Solicitor of Internal Revenue. He said in his ruling: 'If a single joint return is filed it is treated as the return of a taxable unit and the net income disclosed by the return is subject to both normal and surtax as though the return were that of a single individual. In cases, therefore, in which the husband or wife has allowable deductions in excess of his or her gross income, such excess may, if joint return is filed, by deducted from the net income of the other for the purpose of computing both the normal and surtax'.3 We think that this was the intention of Congress in enacting the Act of 19214 and the later acts containing the same provision for joint returns. We think that it was also the fair import of the Treasury Regulations under the Act of 1921 and of subsequent regulations prior to 1934.5\n Respondent places emphasis on the phrasing of Article 401 of Regulations 62 under the Act of 1921, that 'in a single joint return, the tax is computed on the aggregate income and all deductions and credits to which either is entitled shall be taken from such aggregate income'. The argument stresses the words 'to which either is entitled' and it is urged that each spouse is entitled only \n\n[311 \nU.S. 195, 198]\n\u00a0\n to deduct 15 per cent of his or her separate net income. But we think that this is an inadmissible construction of the statute and is not a necessary construction of the regulation. Such a construction is inconsistent with the premise of the Solicitor's opinion, above mentioned, that a joint return 'is treated as the return of a taxable unit' and the tax is to be laid as though the return were that 'of a single individual'. The more specific language of the provision in the Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 250, which for the present purpose is the same as that in the Act of 1934, affords a stronger basis for this conclusion. It provides specifically for the inclusion of the income of each spouse 'in a single joint return' and in that case that 'the tax shall be computed on the aggregate income'. The principle that the joint return is to be treated as the return of a 'taxable unit' and as though it were made by a 'single individual' would be violated if in making a joint return each spouse were compelled to calculate his or her charitable contributions as if he or she were making a separate return. The principle of a joint return permitted aggregation of income and deductions and thus overrode the limitations incident to separate returns. We find no indication in Article 401 of Regulation 62 under the Act of 1921 of any intention to depart from the Solicitor's view as to the purport of the statute.\n In 1935, by Article 23(o)-1 of Treasury Regulations 86, the Department sought to require a husband and wife, whether they make 'a joint return or separate returns', to base their deduction for charitable contributions on the separate net income of the spouse making them. We are of the opinion that under the Revenue Act of 1934, taken with the meaning we think it had when enacted, petitioners were entitled to the combined deductions they claimed, and that the departmental regu- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 195, 199]\n\u00a0\n lation to the contrary was ineffective to deprive them of that right.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed.\n Judgment reversed.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 48 Stat. 697, 26 U.S.C.A.

MAGNOLIA PETROLEUM CO.(1940)\nNo. 481\nArgued: February 28, 1940Decided: March 25, 1940\n\n\n\n\n[309 \nU.S. 478, 479]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Thomas T. Railey, of St. Louis, Mo., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Craig Van Meter, of Mattoon, Ill., and Thomas H. Cobbs, of St. Louis, Mo., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A rich oil field was discovered in Illinois in 1938. Thereupon, this dispute arose between a trustee of a railroad in reorganization under Sec. 77 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.  205, 11 U.S.C.A.  205, and other claimants as to the legal right to drill for and capture fugitive oil under the railroad's right of way traversing the newly discovered field. The trustee asserts fee-simple ownership of the right of way lands with consequent right to reduce the underlying oil to possession. Respondents deny the trustee's alleged title or that he has any interest in the land beyond a mere easement-a limited right to use the surface for railroad purposes only. They allege that ownership of the fee is in others, from whom they have obtained oil leases. This determinative question of fee- simple ownership can be decided only by interpretation, under Illinois law, of instruments granting the railroad its right of way.\n The questions here are whether the bankruptcy court has summary jurisdiction to adjudicate ownership of the right of way lands, and whether that court abused its discretion in ordering the fugitive oil captured and its proceeds impounded pending adjudication of the ownership.\n Petitioner is trustee of the Missouri-Illinois Railroad Co., a subsidiary of the Missouri-Pacific Railroad Co., in process of reorganization in the same proceeding with the parent company in the United States District Court \n\n[309 \nU.S. 478, 480]\n\u00a0\n for the Eastern District of Missouri. The trustee petitioned the bankruptcy court '... for determination of title and for advice and directions respecting certain proposed oil operations on right-of-way near Salem, Illinois.' And his petition alleged that the right of way lands had been 'fenced and used by Trustee and his predecessors in interest without interruption, and with actual visible and exclusive possession acquired under claim of title inconsistent with the claims of title of any other owner for at least twenty years prior to institution of these proceedings'; that by reason of this adverse possession and various conveyances and decrees of record, the trustee had title to the lands and a right to the oil thereunder; that numerous wells had been dug in close proximity to the right of way and without prompt action to remove the oil under the right of way it would be drained into wells on adjacent lands and its value forever lost to the stockholders and creditors of the railroad. The prayer sought notice to claimants of rights to the oil to appear and show cause why they should not be 'estopped and enjoined from asserting any further title in and to the lands ... upon which said right-of-way is located or to the mineral, oil or gas deposits in and under ... (the) right-of-way or extracted therefrom'; and that, pending 'determination of adverse claims to title', the trustee be authorized to have wells drilled, oil captured and sold, and the proceeds, less cost of production, impounded and held for the account of the rightful owner as might be thereafter determined by the bankruptcy court.\n Although they admitted that the railroad 'had been in possession of the ... premises' using them for right of way and tracks, respondents denied both that the trustee owned the fee and that the railroad had been, or that the trustee was, in adverse possession of the oil and other minerals under the right of way.\n The bankruptcy court found that the trustee was in 'actual possession of the property ..., under assertion \n\n[309 \nU.S. 478, 481]\n\u00a0\n of claim to fee simple title thereto'; that the court accordingly had jurisdiction; and that immediate action was necessary 'to conserve the oil supply underlying the property for the benefit of the parties in interest as their rights, title, and interest thereto may hereafter be determined by this Court.' The trustee was therefore directed to provide for wells, production and sale of oil, with the proceeds-less expenses-to be impounded pending adjudication of ownership.\n Upon consideration of Illinois law, which admittedly must govern, the Court of Appeals reversed with instructions to dismiss the trustee's petition, concluding that, as interpreted under Illinois law, the instruments relied on by the trustee conveyed an easement only and that the trustee's possession of the right of way lands under an erroneous claim of fee-simple ownership was not such possession of the oil and gas as to give the bankruptcy court summary jurisdiction to determine fee- simple ownership. \n1\n Conveyances of rights of way in Illinois substantially similar to those here in dispute have been held by the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in which Illinois is located, to convey a fee- simple title under that State's law. \n2\n Because of this conflict and the importance of the question of the bankruptcy court's asserted summary jurisdiction, we granted certiorari. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n First. Bankruptcy courts have summary jurisdiction to adjudicate controversies relating to property over which they have actual or constructive possession. And the test of this jurisdiction is not title in but possession by the bankrupt at the time of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy. \n4\n Here, the trustee succeeded to the physical pos- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 478, 482]\n\u00a0\n session, custody and control of the right of way lands which the railroad had enjoyed at the time of bankruptcy. In fact, however, no one had, when the petition was filed, physical possession of the fugitive oil apart from the lands under which it lay. The Supreme Court of Illinois has said, 'The grant of oil and gas is a grant of such oil and gas as the grantee may find, and he is not vested with any estate in the oil or gas until it is actually found.' \n5\n And this entire controversy can only be resolved by solution of the primary question of fee-simple ownership. The parties agree that if ownership of the right of way lands is in the trustee he has the right to capture the underlying oil, and if not, that the trustee has no such right. Thus, the right to the disputed oil necessarily hinges upon where the ownership of the fee to these lands lies. And possession of those lands under claim of fee-simple ownership by the railroad and later by the trustee was an adequate basis for the District Court's summary jurisdiction. As previously determined in litigation involving another aspect of this same reorganization, the jurisdiction thus acquired by the bankruptcy court 'extends ... to the adjudication of questions respecting the title.' Ex parte Baldwin, \n291 \nU.S. 610, 616\n, 54 S.Ct. 551, 554\n\n\n Second. We are of opinion that it was not an abuse of discretion for the bankruptcy court to authorize the trustee to protect all interests-so far as it appeared possible to do so-by preserving the oil, from waste and depletion, through its extraction and sale with the net proceeds to be impounded until final determination of the controversy over title to the right of way lands.\n The verified petition and supporting evidence offered a basis for the District Court's finding that such steps were necessary to protect the estate's possible interest in the oil under the right of way. No other method has been suggested whereby such protection against ir- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 478, 483]\n\u00a0\n reparable loss to the estate of the wandering and vagrant oil6 could have been better afforded. The '... malleable processes of courts of bankruptcy give assurance of a remedy that can be moulded and adapted to the needs of the occasion.' Steelman v. All Continent Co., \n301 \nU.S. 278, 290\n, 57 S.Ct. 705, 710.\n Third. A court of bankruptcy has an exclusive and nondelegable control over the administration of an estate in its possession. \n7\n But the proper exercise of that control may, where the interests of the estate and the parties will best be served, lead the bankruptcy court to consent to submission to State courts of particular controversies involving unsettled questions of State property law and arising in the course of bankruptcy administration. \n8\n And, under the circumstances of this case, we conclude that it is desirable to have the litigation proceed in the State courts of Illinois. \n9\n An order to the trustee to proceed in the Illinois courts for a decision on the ownership of the fee to the right of way lands will be comparable to one in which the bankruptcy court, preserving the status quo the while, orders a trustee to determine in a plenary State court suit the legal right to property alleged by the trustee to have been fraudulently transferred by the bankrupt. \n10\n Decision with which the \n\n[309 \nU.S. 478, 484]\n\u00a0\n federal court of bankruptcy is here faced calls for interpretation of instruments of conveyance in accordance with Illinois law. Neither statutes nor decisions of Illinois have been pointed to which are clearly applicable. And the difficulties of determining just what should be the decision under the law of that State are persuasively indicated by the different results reached by the two Circuit Courts of Appeal that have attempted the determination. Unless the matter is referred to the State courts, upon subsequent decision by the Supreme Court of Illinois it may appear that rights in local property of parties to this proceeding have-by the accident of federal jurisdiction-been determined contrary to the law of the State which in such matters is supreme. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and that of the District Court is affirmed, except insofar as it provides for adjudication of the disputed ownership in the bankruptcy court. The cause is remanded to the District Court with instructions to modify its order so as to provide appropriate submission of the question of fee-simple ownership of the right of way to the Illinois State courts.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS took to part in the decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] No opinion filed in District Court. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 8 Cir., 106 F.2d 217. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Carter Oil Company v.

STATE OF ALABAMA(1940)\nNo. 514\nArgued: February 29, 1940Decided: April 22, 1940\n\n\n\n\n\n[310 \nU.S. 88, 90]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James J. Mayfield, of Tuscaloosa, Ala., and Joseph A. Padway, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. William H. Loeb, of Montgomery, Ala., for respondent.\n\n\n[310 \nU.S. 88, 91]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner, Byron Thornhill, was convicted in the Circuit Court of Tuscaloosa County, Alabama, of the violation of Section 3448 of the State Code of 1923. 1 The Code Section reads as follows: ' 3448. Loitering or picketing forbidden.-Any person or persons, who, without a just cause or legal excuse therefor, go near to or loiter about the premises or place of business of any other person, firm, corporation, or association of people, engaged in a lawful business, for the purpose, or with intent of influencing, or inducing other persons not to trade with, buy from, sell to, have business dealings with, or be employed by such persons, firm, corporation, or association, or who picket the works or place of business of such other persons, firms, corporations, or associations of persons, for the purpose of hindering, delaying, or interfering with or injuring any lawful business or enterprise of another, shall be guilty of a \n\n[310 \nU.S. 88, 92]\n\u00a0\n misdemeanor; but nothing herein shall prevent any person from soliciting trade or business for a competitive business.'\n The complaint against petitioner, which is set out in the margin,2 is phrased substantially in the very words of the statute. The first and second counts charge that petitioner, without just cause or legal excuse, did 'go near to or loiter about the premises' of the Brown Wood Preserving Company with the intent or purpose of influencing others to adopt one of enumerated courses of conduct. In the third count, the charge is that petitioner 'did picket' the works of the Company 'for the purpose of hindering, delaying or interfering with or injuring (its) lawful business'. Petitioner demurred to the complaint on the grounds, among others, that Section 3448 was repugnant to the Constitution of the United States ( Amendment 1) in \n\n[310 \nU.S. 88, 93]\n\u00a0\n that it deprived him of 'the right of peaceful assemblage', 'the right of freedom of speech', and 'the right to petition for redress'. The demurrer, so far as the record shows, was not ruled upon, and petitioner pleaded not guilty. The Circuit Court then proceeded to try the case without a jury, one not being asked for or demanded. At the close of the case for the State, petitioner moved to exclude all the testimony taken at the trial on the ground that Section 3448 was violative of the Constitution of the United States. \n3\n The Circuit Court overruled the motion, found petitioner 'guilty of Loitering and Picketing as charged in the complaint', and entered judgment accordingly. The judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, which considered the constitutional question and sustained the section on the authority of two previous decisions in the Alabama courts. 4 O'Rourke v. City of Birmingham, 27 Ala.App. 133, 168 So. 206, certiorari denied, 232 Ala. 355, 168 So. 209; Hardie-Tynes Mfg. Co. v. Cruise, 189 Ala. 66, 66 So. 657. A petition for certiorari was denied by the Supreme Court of the State. The case is here on certiorari granted because of the importance of the questions presented. \n308 \nU.S. 547\n, 60 S.Ct. 296, 84 L.Ed . --. December 11, 1939\n\n\n The proofs consist of the testimony of two witnesses for the prosecution. \n5\n It appears that petitioner on the morn- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 88, 94]\n\u00a0\n ing of his arrest was seen 'in company with six or eight other men' 'on the picket line' at the plant of the Brown Wood Preserving Company. Some weeks previously a strike order had been issued by a Union, apparently affiliated with The American Federation of Labor, which had as members all but four of the approximately one hundred employees of the plant. Since that time a picket line with two picket posts of six to eight men each had been maintained around the plant twenty-four hours a day. The picket posts appear to have been on Company property, 'on a private entrance for employees, and not on any public road.' One witness explained that practically all of the employees live on Company property and get their mail from a post office on Company property and that the Union holds its meetings on Company property. No demand was ever made upon the men not to come on the property. There is no testimony indicating the nature of the dispute between the Union and the Preserving Company, or the course of events which led to the issuance of the strike order, or the nature of the efforts for conciliation.\n The Company scheduled a day for the plant to resume operations. One of the witnesses, Clarence Simpson, who was not a member of the Union, on reporting to the plant on the day indicated, was approached by petitioner who told him that 'they were on strike and did not want anybody to go up there to work.' None of the other employees said anything to Simpson, who testified: 'Neither Mr. Thornhill nor any other employee threatened me on the occasion testified to. Mr. Thornhill aproached me in a peaceful manner, and did not put me in fear; he did not appear to be mad.' 'I then turned and went back to the house, and did not go to work.' The other witness, J. M. Walden, testified: 'At the time Mr. Thornhill and Clarence Simpson were talking to each other, there was no one else present, and I heard no harsh words and saw \n\n[310 \nU.S. 88, 95]\n\u00a0\n nothing threatening in the manner of either man.' \n6\n For engaging in some or all of these activities, petitioner was arrested, charged, and convicted as described.\n First. The freedom of speech and of the press, which are secured by the First Amendment against abridgment by the United States, are among the fundamental personal rights and liberties which are secured to all persons by the Fourteenth Amendment against abridgment by a state. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n The safeguarding of these rights to the ends that men may speak as they think on matters vital to them and that falsehoods may be exposed through the processes of education and discussion is essential to free government. Those who won our independence had confidence in the power of free and fearless reasoning and communication of ideas to discover and spread political and economic truth. Noxious doctrines in those fields may be refuted and their evil averted by the courageous exercise of the right of free discussion. Abridgment of freedom of speech and of the press, however, impairs those opportunities for public education that are essential to effective exercise of the power of correcting error through the processes of popular government. Compare United States v. Carolene Products, \n304 \nU.S. 144, 152\n, 153 S.n, 58 S.Ct. 778, 783, 784. Mere legislative preference for one rather than another means for combatting substantive evils, therefore, may well prove an inade- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 88, 96]\n\u00a0\n quate foundation on which to rest regulations which are aimed at or in their operation diminish the effective exercise of rights so necessary to the maintenance of democratic institutions. It is imperative that, when the effective exercise of these rights is claimed to be abridged, the courts should 'weigh the circumstances' and 'appraise the substantiality of the reasons advanced' in support of the challenged regulations. Schneider v. State, \n308 \nU.S. 147, 161\n, 162 S., 60 S.Ct. 146, 150, 151.\n Second. The section in question must be judged upon its face.\n The finding against petitioner was a general one. It did not specify the testimony upon which it rested. \n8\n The charges were framed in the words of the statute and so must be given a like construction. The courts below expressed no intention of narrowing the construction put upon the statute by prior State decisions. \n9\n In these circumstances, there is no occasion to go behind the face of the statute or of the complaint for the purpose of determining whether the evidence, together with the permissible inferences to be drawn from it, could ever support a conviction founded upon different and more precise charges. 'Conviction upon a charge not made would be sheer denial of due process.' De Jonge v. Oregon, \n299 \nU.S. 353, 362\n, 57 S.Ct. 255, 259; Stromberg v. California, \n283 \nU.S. 359, 367\n, 368 S., 51 S.Ct. 532, 535, 73 A.L.R. 1484. The State urges that petitioner may not complain of the deprivation of any rights but his own. It would not follow that on this record petitioner could not complain of the sweeping regulations here challenged. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 88, 97]\n\u00a0\n There is a further reason for testing the section on its face. Proof of an abuse of power in the particular case has never been deemed a requisite for attack on the constitutionality of a statute purporting to license the dissemination of ideas. Schneider v. State, \n308 \nU.S. 147\n, 162- 165, 60 S.Ct. 146, 151-152; Hague v. C.I.O., \n307 \nU.S. 496, 516\n, 59 S.Ct. 954, 964; Lovell v. Griffin, \n303 \nU.S. 444, 451\n, 58 S.Ct. 666, 668. The cases when interpreted in the light of their facts indicate that the rule is not based upon any assumption that application for the license would be refused or would result in the imposition of other unlawful regulations. \n10\n Rather it derives from an appreciation of the character of the evil inherent in a licensing system. The power of the licensor against which John Milton directed his assault by his 'Appeal for the Liberty of Unlicensed Printing' is pernicious not merely by reason of the censure of particular comments but by reason of the threat to censure comments on matters of public concern. It is not merely the sporadic abuse of power by the censor but the pervasive threat inherent in its very existence that constitutes the danger to freedom of discussion. See Near v. Minnesota, \n283 \nU.S. 697, 713\n, 51 S.Ct. 625, 630. One who might have had a license for the asking may therefore call into question the whole scheme of licensing when he is prosecuted for failure to procure it. Lovell v. Griffin, \n303 \nU.S. 444\n, 58 S.Ct. 666; Hague v. C.I.O., \n307 \nU.S. 496\n, 59 S.Ct. 954. A like threat is inherent in a penal statute, like that in question here, which does not aim specifically at evils within the allowable area of State control but, on the contrary, sweeps within its ambit other activities that in ordinary circumstances constitute an exercise of freedom of speech or of the press. The existence of such a statute, which readily lends itself to harsh and discriminatory enforcement by local prose- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 88, 98]\n\u00a0\n cuting officials, against particular groups deemed to merit their displeasure, results in a continuous and pervasive restraint on all freedom of discussion that might reasonably be regarded as within its purview. \n11\n It is not any less effective or, if the restraint is not permissible, less pernicious than the restraint on freedom of discussion imposed by the threat of censorship. \n12\n An accused, after arrest and conviction under such a statute, does not have to sustain the burden of demonstrating that the State could not constitutionally have written a different and specific statute covering his activities as disclosed by the charge and the evidence introduced against him. Schneider v. State, \n308 \nU.S. 147, 155\n, 162 S., 163, 60 S.Ct. 146, 148, 151. Where regulations of the liberty of free discussion are concerned, there are special reasons for observing the rule that it is the statute, and not the accusation or the evidence under it, which prescribes the limits of permissible conduct and warns against transgression. Stromberg v. California, \n283 \nU.S. 359, 368\n, 51 S.Ct. 532, 535, 73 A.L.R. 1484; Schneider v. State, \n308 \nU.S. 147, 155\n, 162 S., 163, 60 S.Ct. 146, 151. Compare Lanzetta v. New Jersey, \n306 \nU.S. 451\n, 59 S.Ct. 618.\n Third. Section 3448 has been applied by the State courts so as to prohibit a single individual from walking slowly and peacefully back and forth on the public sidewalk in \n\n[310 \nU.S. 88, 99]\n\u00a0\n front of the premises of an employer, without speaking to anyone, carrying a sign or placard on a staff above his head stating only the fact that the employer did not employ union men affiliated with the American Federation of Labor;13 the purpose of the described activity was concededly to advise customers and prospective customers of the relationship existing between the employer and its employees and thereby to induce such customers not to partronize the employer. O'Rourke v. City of Birmingham, 27 Ala.App. 133, 168 So. 206, certiorari denied 232 Ala. 355, 168 So. 209.14 The statute as thus authoritatively construed and applied leaves room for no exceptions based upon either the number of persons engaged in the proscribed activity, the peaceful character of their demeanor, the nature of their dispute with an employer, or the restrained character and the accurateness of the terminology used in notifying the public of the facts of the dispute.\n The numerous forms of conduct proscribed by Section 3448 are subsumed under two offenses: the first embraces the activities of all who 'without a just cause or legal excuse' 'go near to or loiter about the premises' of any person engaged in a lawful business for the purpose of influencing or inducing others to adopt any of certain enumerated courses of action; the second, all who 'picket' the place of business of any such person 'for the purpose of hindering, delaying, or interfering with or injuring any lawful business or enterprise of another.' \n15\n It is apparent \n\n[310 \nU.S. 88, 100]\n\u00a0\n that one or the other of the offenses comprehends every practicable method whereby the facts of a labor dispute may be publicized in the vicinity of the place of business of an employer. The phrase 'without a just cause or legal excuse' does not in any effective manner restrict the breadth of the regulation; the words themselves have no ascertainable meaning either inherent or historical. Compare Lanzetta v. New Jersey, \n306 \nU.S. 451\n, 453- 455, 59 S.Ct. 618, 619.16 The courses of action, listed under the first offense, which an accused-including an employee-may not urge others to take, comprehends those which in many instances would normally result from merely publicizing, without annoyance or threat of any kind, the facts of a labor dispute. An intention to hinder, delay or interfere with a lawful business, which is an element of the second offense, likewise can be proved merely by showing that others reacted in a way normally expectable of some upon learning the facts of a dispute. \n17\n The vague contours of the \n\n[310 \nU.S. 88, 101]\n\u00a0\n term 'picket' are nowhere delineated. \n18\n Employees or others, accordingly, may be found to be within the purview of the term and convicted for engaging in activities identical with those proscribed by the first offense. In sum, whatever the means used to publicize the facts of a labor dispute, whether by printed sign, by pamphlet, by word of mouth or otherwise, all such activity without exception is within the inclusive prohibition of the statute so long as it occurs in the vicinity of the scene of the dispute.\n Fourth. We think that Section 3448 is invalid on its face.\n The freedom of speech and of the press guaranteed by the Constitution embraces at the least the liberty to discuss publicly and truthfully all matters of public concern without previous restraint or fear of subsequent \n\n[310 \nU.S. 88, 102]\n\u00a0\n punishment. 19 The exigencies of the colonial period and the efforts to secure freedom from oppressive administration developed a broadened conception of these liberties as adequate to supply the public need for information and education with respect to the significant issues of the times. \n20\n The Continental Congress in its letter sent to the Inhabitants of Quebec (October 26, 1774) referred to the 'five great rights' and said: 'The last right we shall mention, regards the freedom of the press. The importance of this consists, besides the advancement of truth, science, morality, and arts in general, in its diffusion of liberal sentiments on the administration of Government, its ready communication of thoughts between subjects, and its consequential promotion of union among them, whereby oppressive officers are shamed or intimidated, into more honourable and just modes of conducting affairs.' Journal of the Continental Congress, 1904 Ed., vol. I, pp. 104, 108. Freedom of discussion, if it would fulfill its historic function in this nation, must embrace all issues about which information is needed or appropriate to enable the members of society to cope with the exigencies of their period.\n In the circumstances of our times the dissemination of information concerning the facts of a labor dispute must be regarded as within that area of free discussion that is guaranteed by the Constitution. Hague v. C. I.O., \n307 \nU.S. 496\n, 59 S.Ct. 954; Schneider v. State, \n308 \nU.S. 147, 155\n, 162 S., 163, 60 S.Ct. 146, 151. See Senn v. Tile Layers Union, \n301 \nU.S. 468\n, \n\n[310 \nU.S. 88, 103]\n\u00a0\n 478, 57 S.Ct. 857, 862. It is recognized now that satisfactory hours and wages and working conditions in industry and a bargaining position which makes these possible have an importance which is not less than the interests of those in the business or industry directly concerned. The health of the present generation and of those as yet unborn may depend on these matters, and the practices in a single factory may have economic repercussions upon a whole region and affect widespread systems of marketing. The merest glance at State and Federal legislation on the subject demonstrates the force of the argument that labor relations are not matters of mere local or private concern. Free discussion concerning the conditions in industry and the causes of labor disputes appears to us indispensable to the effective and intelligent use of the processes of popular government to shape the destiny of modern industrial society. The issues raised by regulations, such as are challenged here, infringing upon the right of employees effectively to inform the public of the facts of a labor dispute are part of this larger problem. We concur in the observation of Mr. Justice Brandeis, speaking for the Court in Senn's case (301 U.S. at page 478, '57 S.Ct. at page 862): 'Members of a union might, without special statutory authorization by a state, make known the facts of a labor dispute, for freedom of speech is guaranteed by the Federal Constitution.'\n It is true that the rights of employers and employees to conduct their economic affairs and to compete with others for a share in the products of industry are subject to modification or qualification in the interests of the society in which they exist. \n21\n This is but an instance \n\n[310 \nU.S. 88, 104]\n\u00a0\n of the power of the State to set the limits of permissible contest open to industrial combatants. See Mr. Justice Brandeis in Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, \n254 \nU.S. 443\n, at page 488, 41 S.Ct. 172, 184, 16 A.L.R. 196. It does not follow that the State in dealing with the evils arising from industrial disputes may impair the effective exercise of the right to discuss freely industrial relations which are matters of public concern. A contrary conclusion could be used to support abridgment of freedom of speech and of the press concerning almost every matter of importance to society.\n The range of activities proscribed by Section 3448, whether characterized as picketing or loitering or otherwise, embraces nearly every practicable, effective means whereby those interested-including the employees directly affected-may enlighten the public on the nature and causes of a labor dispute. The safeguarding of these means is essential to the securing of an informed and educated public opinion with respect to a matter which is of public concern. It may be that effective exercise of the means of advancing public knowledge may persuade some of those reached to refrain from entering into advantageous relations with the business establishment which is the scene of the dispute. Every expression of opinion on matters that are important has the potentiality of inducing action in the interests of one rather than another group in society. But the group in power at any moment may not impose penal sanctions on peaceful and truthful discussion of matters of public interest merely on a showing that others may thereby be persuaded to take action inconsistent with its interests. Abridgment of the liberty of such discussion can be justified only where the \n\n[310 \nU.S. 88, 105]\n\u00a0\n clear danger of substantive evils arises under circumstances affording no opportunity to test the merits of ideas by competition for acceptance in the market of public opinion. \n22\n We hold that the danger of injury to an industrial concern is neither so serious nor so imminent as to justify the sweeping proscription of freedom of discussion embodied in Section 3448.\n The State urges that the purpose of the challenged statute is the protection of the community from the violence and breaches of the peace, which, it asserts, are the concomitants of picketing. The power and the duty of the State to take adequate steps to preserve the peace and to protect the privacy, the lives, and the property of its residents cannot be doubted. But no clear and present danger of destruction of life or property, or invasion of the right of privacy, or breach of the peace can be thought to be inherent in the activities of every person who approaches the premises of an employer and publicizes the facts of a labor dispute involving the latter. We are not now concerned with picketing en masse or otherwise conducted which might occasion such imminent and aggravated danger to these interests as to justify a statute narrowly drawn to cover the precise situation giving rise to the danger. Compare American Steel Foundries v. Tri-City Council, \n257 \nU.S. 184, 205\n, 42 S.Ct. 72, 77, 27 A.L.R. 360. Section 3448 in question here does not aim specifically at serious encroachments on these interests and does not evidence any such care in balancing these interests against the interest of the community and that of the individual in freedom of discussion on matters of public concern.\n It is not enough to say that Section 3448 is limited or restricted in its application to such activity as takes place at the scene of the labor dispute. '(The) streets are \n\n[310 \nU.S. 88, 106]\n\u00a0\n natural and proper places for the dissemination of information and opinion; and one is not to have the exercise of his liberty of expression in appropriate places abridged on the plea that it may be exercised in some other place.' Schneider v. State, \n308 \nU.S. 147, 161\n, 60 S.Ct. 146, 150; Hague v. C.I.O., \n307 \nU.S. 496, 515\n, 516 S., 59 S.Ct. 954, 963, 964.23 The danger of breach of the peace or serious invasion of rights of property or privacy at the scene of a labor dispute is not sufficiently imminent in all cases to warrant the legislature in determining that such place is not appropriate for the range of activities outlawed by Section 3448.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS is of opinion that the judgment below should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Petitioner was first charged and convicted in the Inferior Court of Tuscaloosa County and sentenced to imprisonment for fifty-nine days in default of payment of a fine of one hundred dollars and costs. Upon appeal to the Circuit Court, another complaint was filed and a trial de novo was had pursuant to the local practice. The Circuit Court sentenced petitioner, upon his conviction, to imprisonment for seventy-three days in default of payment of a fine of one hundred dollars and costs. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] '1. The State of Alabama, by its Solicitor, complains of Byron Thornhill that, within twelve months before the commencement of this prosecution he did without just cause or legal excuse therefor, go near to or loiter about the premises or place of business of another person, firm, corporation or association of people, to-wit: the Brown Wood Preserving Company, Inc., a corporation, engaged in a lawful business, for the purpose or with the intent of influencing or inducing other persons not to trade with, buy from, sell to, have business dealings with, or be employed by the said Brown Wood Preserving Company, Inc., a corporation, for the purpose of hindering, delaying or interfering with or injuring the lawful business or enterprise of the said Brown Wood Preserving Company, Inc., a corporation.\n'2. (The second count is identical with the first, except that the last clause, charging a purpose of hinder, delay or interfere, etc., with the lawful business of the Preserving Company, is omitted.)\n\n'3. The State of Alabama, by its Solicitor, complains of Byron Thornhill that, within twelve months before the commencement of this prosecution he did picket the works or place of business of another person, firm, corporation or association of people, to-wit, the Brown Wood Preserving Company, Inc., a corporation, for the purpose of hindering, delaying, or interfering with or injuring the lawful business or enterprise of the said Brown Wood Preserving Company, Inc., a corporation.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The petitioner also moved to exclude the testimony on the ground that it was insufficient to sustain a conviction. Upon being asked by the Court whether he insisted on this ground, however, counsel for petitioner stated that the only question he wanted to raise was the constitutionality of the statute. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] The Court of Appeals stated:\n'It seems clear enough that the evidence adduced upon the trial was sufficient to bring appellant's actions, for which he was being prosecuted, within the purview of the prohibition implied in said Statute.\n\n'So, as conceded by able counsel here representing appellant, 'the only question involved in this appeal is the constitutionality vel non of Section 3448 of the Code of Alabama of 1923.\" \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] No evidence was offered on behalf of petitioner. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Simpson and Walden are not in entire accord with respect to the number of persons present during the conversation between Simpson and petitioner. A possible inference from Simpson's testimony, considered by itself, is that petitioner was in the company of six or eight others when the conversation took place. This difference is not material in our view of the case. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] Schneider v. State, \n308 \nU.S. 147, 160\n, 60 S.Ct. 146, 150; Lovell v.

Lim., 8th Ed., p. 885. See Madison's Report on the Virginia Resolutions, 4 Ell. Deb., 2d Ed., 1876, p. 569; Address on the Conduct of the Maryland Convention of 1788, 2 id., p. 552. \n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] The employer in fact had locked out its union stagehands and was working others not regularly employed as stagehands in admitted violation of the National Industrial Recovery Act (48 Stat. 195). \n[\nFootnote 14\n] Accused there asserted that the application of Section 3448 to the particular facts of his case deprived him of rights guaranteed to him by the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court of Appeals passed upon this constitutional question and decided it adversely to the contentions of accused. \n[\nFootnote 15\n] There is a proviso that 'nothing herein shall prevent any person from soliciting trade or business for a competitive business.' \n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] So far as the phrase may have been given meaning by the State courts it apparently grants authority to the court and the jury to consider defensive matter brought forward by the accused, depending for its sufficiency not upon rules of general application but upon the peculiar facts of each case. See Owens v. State, 74 Ala. 401; Bailey v. State, 161 Ala. 75, 49 So. 886; Folmar v. State, 19 Ala.App. 435, 97 So. 768. Compare O'Rourke v.

There is evidence here that the other employee was acquainted with the facts prior to his conversation with petitioner. The State concedes, however, that under Section 3448 everyone must be deemed to intend the natural and probable consequences of his acts. See Jacobs v. State, 17 Ala.App. 396, 85 So. 837; Reed v. State, 18 Ala.App. 371, 92 So. 513; Weeks v. State, 24 Ala.App. 198, 132 So. 870, certiorari denied 222 Ala. 442, 132 So. 871; Worrell v.

(2) Communicate information, e.g., that a strike is in progress, making either true, untrue or libelous statements. (3) Persuade employees or customers not to engage in relations with the employer: (a) through the use of banners, without speaking, carrying true, untrue or libelous legends; (b) by speaking, (i) in a calm, dispassionate manner, (ii) in a heated, hostile manner, (iii) using abusive epithets and profanity, (iv) yelling loudly, (v) by persisting in making arguments when employees or customers refuse to listen; (c) by offering money or similar inducements to strike breakers. (4) Threaten employees or customers: (a) by the mere presence of the picketer; the presence may be a threat of, (i) physical violence, (ii) social ostracism, being branded in the community as a 'scab', (iii) a trade or employees' boycott, i.e., preventing workers from securing employment and refusing to trade with customers, (iv) threatening injury to property; (b) by verbal threats.

STATE OF TEXAS(1940)\nNo. 635\nArgued: March 29, 1940Decided: May 6, 1940\n\n\n\n Rehearing Denied June 3, 1940\n\n\n See \n310 \nU.S. 659\n, 60 S.Ct. 1092, 84 L.Ed. --. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 141, 142]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles I. Francis, of Houston, Tex., for appellant.\n\n\n\n[310 \nU.S. 141, 143]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George W. Barcus and Lloyd Davidson, both of Austin, Tex., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal under  237(a) of the Judicial Code, as amended, 28 U.S.C.  344(a), 28 U.S.C.A.  344(a), to review a judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas sustaining the \n\n[310 \nU.S. 141, 144]\n\u00a0\n constitutionality of a Texas anti-trust law, and therefore upholding an indictment under it. Appellant was charged with participation in a conspiracy to fix the retail price of beer. Such a conspiracy is made a criminal offense by Title 19, Chapter 3, Art. 1632 et seq., of the Texas Penal Code. Because the provisions of this law to do not 'apply to agricultural products or live stock ... in the hands of the producer or raiser', Art. 1642, Tigner challenged the validity of the entire statute and sought release in the local courts by habeas corpus. His claim has been rejected by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. 132 S.W.2d 885. Essentially his contention is that the exemption granted by the Texas statute falls within the condemnation of Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co., \n184 \nU.S. 540\n, 22 S.Ct. 431, as offensive to 'the equal protection of the laws' which the Fourteenth Amendment safeguards. If that case controls, appellant contends, the Texas Act cannot survive and he must go free.\n The court below recognized that the exemption was identical with that deemed fatal to the Illinois statute involved in Connolly's case. But it felt that time and circumstances had drained that case of vitality, leaving it free to treat the exemption as an exercise of legislative discretion. A similar attitude has been reflected by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, Northern Wis. Co-operative Tobacco Pool v. Bekkedal, 182 Wis. 571, 593, 197 N.W. 936, and appears to underlie much recent state and federal legislation. Dealing as we are with an appeal to the Constitution, the Connolly case ought not to foreclose us from considering this exemption in its own setting.\n The problem, in brief, is this: May Texas promote its policy of freedom for economic enterprise by utilizing the criminal law against various forms of combination and monopoly, but exclude from criminal punishment corresponding activities of agriculture? \n\n[310 \nU.S. 141, 145]\n\u00a0\n Legislation, both state and federal, similar to that of Texas had its origin in fear of the concentration of industrial power following the Civil War. Law was invoked to buttress the traditional system of free competition, free markets and free enterprise. Pressure for this legislation came more particularly from those who as producers, as well as consumers, constituted the most dispersed economic groups. \n1\n These large sections of the population-those who labored with their hands and those who worked the soil-were as a matter of economic fact in a different relation to the community from that occupied by industrial combinations. Farmers were widely scattered and inured to habits of individualism; their economic fate was in large measure dependent upon contingencies beyond their control. In these circumstances, legislators may well have thought combinations of farmers and stockmen presented no threat to the community, or, at least, the threat was of a different order from that arising through combinations of industrialists and middlemen. At all events legislation like that of Texas rested on this view, curbing industrial and commercial combinations, and did not visit the same condemnation upon collaborative efforts by farmers and stockmen because the latter were felt to have a different economic significance. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Since Connolly's case was decided, nearly forty years ago, an impressive legislative movement bears witness to \n\n[310 \nU.S. 141, 146]\n\u00a0\n general acceptance of the view that the differences between agriculture and industry call for differentiation in the formulation of pulblic policy. The states as well as the United States have sanctioned cooperative action by farmers; have restricted their amenability to the anti-trust laws; have relieved their organizations from taxation. See, e.g., Capper-Volstead Act, 42 Stat. 388, 7 U.S.C.  291, 7 U.S.C.A.  291; Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 730, 731, 15 U.S.C.  17, 15 U.S.C.A.  17;  101(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, 53 Stat. 33, 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Code,  101(1). Such expressions of legislative policy have withstood challenge in the courts. Liberty Warehouse Co. v. Burley Tobacco Growers, \n276 \nU.S. 71\n, 48 S.Ct. 291.3 Congress and the states have sometimes thought it necessary to control the supply and price of agricultural commodities with their respective spheres of jurisdiction, and the constitutional validity of these measures has been sustained. Mulford v. Smith, \n307 \nU.S. 38\n, 59 S.Ct. 648; United States v. Rock Royal Co-op., \n307 \nU.S. 533\n, 59 S. Ct. 993; Nebbia v. New York, \n291 \nU.S. 502\n, 54 S.Ct. 505, 89 A.L.R. 1469.\n At the core of all these enactments lies a conception of price and production policy for agriculture very different from that which underlies the demands made upon industry and commerce by anti-trust laws. \n4\n These vari- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 141, 147]\n\u00a0\n ous measures are manifestations of the fact that in our national economy agriculture expresses functions and forces different from the other elements in the total economic process. Certainly these are differences which may be acted upon by the lawmakers. The equality at which the 'equal protection' clause aims is not a disembodied equality. The Fourteenth Amendment enjoins 'the equal protection of the laws', and laws are not abstract propositions. They do not relate to abstract units A, B and C, but are expressions of policy arising out of specific difficulties, addressed to the attainment of specific ends by the use of specific remedies. The Constitution does not require things which are different in fact or opinion to be treated in law as though they were the same. And so we conclude that to write into law the differences between agriculture and other economic pursuits was within the power of the Texas legislature. Connolly's case has been worn away by the erosion of time, and we are of opinion that it is no longer controlling.\n Another feature of Texas anti-trust legislation is relied on by Tigner to invalidate the criminal statute under which he is being prosecuted. Beginning with the first enactment in 1894, the Texas antitrust laws have had a complicated and checkered history. At present there are two statutes directed at combination and monopoly; the one under which Tigner was indicted, and another, subjecting to civil penalties the same conduct at which the challenged criminal law is aimed. Title 126, Revised Civil Statutes, Vernon's Ann.Civ.St.Tex. art. 7426 et seq. From such civil proceedings, which the Attorney General initiates, no exemption is given to farmers and stockmen. Appellant urges that the divergence between civil and criminal laws relating to the same conduct undermines the validity of the exemption in the criminal statute and thus invalidates the whole of it. This argument is but a minor variation on appellant's main theme. It amounts to a claim that differences \n\n[310 \nU.S. 141, 148]\n\u00a0\n substantial enough to permit substantive differentiation in formulating legislative policy do not permit differentiation as to remedy.\n How to effectuate policy-the adaptation of means to legitimately sought ends-is one of the most intractable of legislative problems. Whether proscribed conduct is to be deterred by qui tam action or triple damages or injunction, or by criminal prosecution, or merely by defense to actions in contract, or by some, or all, of these remedies in combination, is a matter within the legislature's range of choice. Judgment on the deterrent effect of the various weapons in the armory of the law can lay little claim to scientific basis. Such judgment as yet is largely a prophecy based on meager and uninterpreted experience. How empiric the process is of adjusting remedy to policy, is shown by the history of anti- trust laws in Texas and elsewhere. The Sherman Law originally employed the injunction at the suit of the government, private action for triple damages, criminal prosecution and forfeiture. Later the injunction was made available to private suitors. \n5\n In the case of combinations of common carriers the Sherman Law is qualified by the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U. S.C.A.  1 et seq., Keogh v. Chicago & N.W.R. Co., \n260 \nU.S. 156\n, 43 S.Ct. 47, and in the case of shipping combinations, by the Merchant Marine Act, 46 U.S.C.A.  861 et seq., United States Nav. Co. v. Cunard S.S. Co., \n284 \nU.S. 474\n, 52 S.Ct. 247. In its own groping efforts to deal with the problem of monopoly, the Texas legislature has in the course of nearly half a century invoked a dozen remedies. \n6\n When Iowa superimposed upon its general antitrust law an additional penalty in the case of fire insurance combinations, this Court sustained \n\n[310 \nU.S. 141, 149]\n\u00a0\n the validity of the statute. Carroll v. Greenwich Insurance Co., \n199 \nU.S. 401\n, 26 S.Ct. 66.\n Legislation concerning economic combinations presents peculiar difficulties in the fashioning of remedies. The sensitiveness of the economic mechanism, the risks of introducing new evils in trying to stamp out old, familiar ones, the difficulties of proof within the conventional modes of procedure, the effect of shifting tides of public opinion-these and many other subtle factors must influence legislative choice. Moreover, the whole problem of deterrence is related to still wider considerations affecting the temper of the community in which law operates. The traditions of a society, the habits of obedience to law, the effectiveness of the lawenforcing agencies, are all peculiarly matters of time and place. They are thus matters within legislative competence. To say that the legislature of Texas must give to farmers complete immunity or none at all, is to say that judgment on these vexing issues precludes the view that, while the dangers from combinations of farmers and stockmen are so tenuous that civil remedies suffice to secure deterrence, they are substantial enough not to warrant entire disregard. We hold otherwise. Here, again, we must be mindful not of abstract equivalents of conduct, but of conduct in the context of actuality. Differences that permit substantive differentiations also permit differentiations of remedy. We find no constitutional bar against excluding farmers and stockmen from the criminal statute against combination and monopoly, and so holding, we conclude that there was likewise no bar against making the exemption partial rather than complete.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS is of opinion that the judgment below should be reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See 2 Beard, The Rise of American Civilization, pp. 254-343; Buck, The Granger Movement, passim; Hicks, The Populist Revolt, passim; Sheldon, Populism in the Old Dominion, pp. 17-20.

BANK OF OKLAHOMA CITY v. OKLAHOMA TAX COM'N.(1940)\nNo. 596\nArgued: Decided: March 25, 1940\n\n\n\n - \n\n[309 \nU.S. 560, 561]\n\u00a0\n Mr. E. A. Walker, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for appellant.\n Mr. F. M. Dudley, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal under  237 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A.  344, from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, denying recovery of taxes alleged to have been exacted from appellant, a national banking corporation, in violation of the provisions of R.S.  5219, 12 U.S.C.A.  548, and the Constitution of the United States.\n Section 16 of the Oklahoma Income Tax Law of 1935, S.L.1935, c. 66, art. 6, 68 Okl.St.Ann.  887,1 lays a tax upon every national banking association located or doing business within the state 'according to, or measured by, its net income' at the \n\n[309 \nU.S. 560, 562]\n\u00a0\n rate of six per centum. Section 17, 68 Okl.St.Ann.  888, provides for a similar tax upon state banks and Morris Plan Companies.\n The net income used as the measure of the tax under  16 and 17 is determined by subtracting from gross income, as defined in  18, certain deductions allowed by  9, 68 Okl.St.Ann.  880, 889. Section 18 defines gross income for the purposes of 'national banking associations, state banks, trust companies and other financial corporations' ( 8(c), 68 Okl. St.Ann.  878(c)). It specifically includes in gross income 'interest upon the obligations of the United States, or its possessions, or upon securities issued under the authority of an Act of Congress, the income from which is tax free.'\n All other types of corporations are taxed at the flat rate of six per centum upon the net income allocable to business transacted within the state ( 6, 68 Okl.St.Ann.  876). Net income for this purpose is determined by making certain specified deductions from gross income ( 7, 9, 68 Okl.St.Ann.  877, 880), which is defined expressly so as to exclude interest on taximmune federal securities ( 8(b)(4)).\n The appellee Oklahoma Tax Commission, in assessing appellant's tax for the year 1936 under  16, included in gross income the dividends received by appellant on stock owned by it in a federal reserve bank and the interest received on bonds and notes issued pursuant to acts of Congress declaring the income from such securities tax exempt. \n2\n The present suit was brought by appellant to recover that portion of the tax, paid under protest, which resulted from including such dividends and interest in the computation. \n\n[309 \nU.S. 560, 563]\n\u00a0\n R.S.  5219, 12 U.S.C.  548, 12 U.S.C.A.  548, copied in the margin, 3 authorizes four alternative methods whereby a state may impose a tax on national banking associations located within its limits. Method numbered ( 4) provides for a tax on such associations 'according to, or measured by' 'the entire net income received from all sources' subject only to certain restrictions as to the rate. This method was added to the three previously authorized under R.S.  5219 by an amendment of March 25, 1926, c. 88, 44 Stat. 223, 12 U.S.C.A.  548. The plain meaning of the amendment is confirmed by its legislative history showing beyond doubt that Congress intended to authorize a franchise \n\n[309 \nU.S. 560, 564]\n\u00a0\n tax measured by net income including interest on tax-immune federal securities. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n Oklahoma in the 1935 act expressly followed and adopted the method thus authorized in the amendment. See First National Bank v. Oklahoma Tax Commission, 185 Okl. 98, 90 P.2d 438. Subsection (b) of  16 expressly declares that the state thereby adopts method numbered (4) authorized by R. S.  5219, 12 U.S.C.  548, 12 U.S.C.A.  548.\n The power of Congress to authorize a state to impose a tax on the franchise of a national banking association can not now be doubted. Van Allen v. Assessors, 3 Wall. 573. Compare Keifer & Keifer v. R.F.C., \n306 \nU.S. 381, 389\n, 59 S.Ct. 516, 517; Helvering v. Gerhardt, \n304 \nU.S. 405, 411\n, 412 S.n, 58 S.Ct. 969, 971; Federal Land Bank v. Priddy, \n295 \nU.S. 229, 234\n, 235 S., 55 S.Ct. 705, 707, 708. Any immunity attaching to the franchise by virtue of R. S.  5219 as it read prior to the 1926 amendment, compare Pittman v. Home Owners' Corp., \n308 \nU.S. 21\n, 60 S.Ct. 15, 124 A.L.R. 1263, could be withdrawn by Congress and the franchise subjected to state taxing power, just as national bank shares were so subjected by the Act of June 3, 1864. Van Allen v. Assessors, 3 Wall. 573; See Des Moines National Bank v. Fairweather, \n263 \nU.S. 103\n, 44 S.Ct. 23; Peoples National Bank v. Board of Equalization, \n260 \nU.S. 702\n, 43 S.Ct. 98.\n The power of a state to levy a tax on a legitimate subject, such as a franchise, measured by net assets or net income including tax-exempt federal instrumentalities or their income is likewise well settled. Society for Savings v. Coite, 6 Wall. 594; Provident Institution v. Massachusetts, 6 Wall. 611; Home Insurance Company v. New York, \n134 \nU.S. 594\n, 10 S.Ct. 593; Educational Films Corp. v. Ward, \n282 \nU.S. 379\n, 51 S.Ct. 170, 71 A.L.R. 1226. Thus state laws taxing the shareholders of national banks in accordance with R.S.  5219 on the full net value of their shares, although the banks owned tax- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 560, 565]\n\u00a0\n exempt federal securities, have been consistently upheld.

The rule that a tax upon a legitimate subject, measured by net income, including that from tax-immune federal instrumentalities, is not an infringement of the immunity, was affirmed in Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., \n220 \nU.S. 107, 147\n, 165 S., 31 S.Ct. 342, 347, 354, Ann.Cas.1912B, 1312; and followed in Educational Films Corp. v. Ward, \n282 \nU.S. 379\n, 51 S.Ct. 170, 71 A.L.R. 1226. Compare Pacific Co. v. Johnson, \n285 \nU.S. 480, 490\n, 52 S.Ct. 424, 426. The tax-immunity conferred on the securities owned by appellant has not been shown to be any greater in extent than that conferred on the federal securities included in the measure of the taxes sustained in the cited cases.\n Sections 16 and 17 of the 1933 act, Laws Okl.1933, c. 195, 68 Okl.St. Ann. Appendix, were for present purposes identical with the corresponding sections of the 1935 act, but  18 of the prior act contained a provision expressly excluding from gross income the interest on tax-immune federal securities.\n Appellant contends that the act of 1935, by expressly including in the measure of the tax the interest on federal securities which before had been expressly excluded from the measure, must be regarded not as a valid franchise tax but as an unconstitutional levy on the tax-immune income itself. In support of its position, its main reliance is placed upon our decision in Macallen Co. v. Massachusetts, \n279 \nU.S. 620\n, 49 S.Ct. 432, 65 A.L.R. 866.\n A similar contention was urged against the California franchise tax measured by net income, including tax-exempt income on state bonds, which was upheld in Pacific Co. v. Johnson, \n285 \nU.S. 480\n, 52 S.Ct. 424. In rejecting the claim, the holding in the Macallen case was referred to as follows (285 U.S. at page 494, 52 S.Ct. at page 427): 'There the commonwealth, which had long imposed a tax on corporate franchises measured by taxable income of the corporation, amended \n\n[309 \nU.S. 560, 566]\n\u00a0\n its statutes, so as to add the income from tax exempt bonds of the federal government to the measure of the tax. It was held that this change of taxation policy, embodied in the statute and 'adopted, as though it had been so declared in precise words, for the very purpose of subjecting these securities pro tanto to the burden of the tax,' was invalid. Thus the legislative abandonment of a policy which had previously discriminated in favor of tax exempt securities was treated as a discrimination against them, and the tax, although in fact nondiscriminatory, was condemned as analogous to the discriminatory tax held invalid in the Miller Case ( Miller v. Milwaukee, \n272 \nU.S. 713\n, 47 S.Ct. 280).' See also Educational Films Corp. v. Ward, \n282 \nU.S. 379, 392\n, 393 S., 51 S.Ct. 170, 173, 71 A.L.R. 1226\n\n\n It cannot be said that the Oklahoma tax in question here was aimed at tax-exempt federal securities in the manner thus disclosed and condemned in the Macallen case. The history of the Oklahoma legislation on this subject discloses only that it sought to change its policy pursuant to the express authorization conferred by R.S.  5219. It has effected its purpose by including within the measure of its franchise tax on national banks the entire net income without respect to source and without discrimination against tax-exempt federal securities. See First National Bank v. Oklahoma Tax Commission, 185 Okl. 98, 90 P.2d 438.\n We do not now decide just what circumstances, if any, would bring a situation within the precise scope of the Macallen case, assuming that case still has vitality. It is sufficient to hold, as we do, that the statute in the instant case merits the test stated in Pacific Co. v. Johnson, viz.: 'Since the mere intent of the legislature to do that which the Constitution permits cannot deprive legislation of its constitutional validity, ... the present act must be judged by its operation rather than by the motives which inspired it. As it operates to measure the tax on the cor- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 560, 567]\n\u00a0\n porate franchise by the entire net income of the corporation, without any discrimination between income which is exempt and that which is not, there is no infringement of any constitutional immunity.'\n Appellant finally contends that the tax here in question violates the restriction in R.S.  5219 that 'the rate shall not be higher than ... the highest of the rates assessed ... upon mercantile, manufacturing, and business corporations doing business' within the state. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n A consideration of the course of judicial decision on R.S.  5219 and its predecessors can leave no doubt that the various restrictions it places on the permitted methods of taxation are designed to prohibit only those systems of state taxation which discriminate in practical operation against national banking associations or their shareholders as a class. Compare First National Bank v. Hartford, \n273 \nU.S. 548\n, 47 S.Ct. 462, 59 A.L.R. 1; People of State of New York ex rel. Amoskeag Savings Bank v. Purdy, \n231 \nU.S. 373, 375\n, 34 S.Ct. 114; Covington v. First National Bank, \n198 \nU.S. 100\n, 25 S.Ct. 562; Lionberger v. Rowse, 9 Wall. 468. Thus it is not a valid objection to a tax on national bank shares that other moneyed capital in the state or shares of state banks are taxed at a different rate or assessed by a different method unless it appears that the difference in treatment results in fact in a discrimination unfavorable to the holders of the shares of national banks. People of State of New York ex rel. Amoskeag Savings Bank v. Purdy, \n231 \nU.S. 373, 375\n, 34 S.Ct. 114; Covington v. First National Bank, \n198 \nU.S. 100\n, 25 S.Ct. 562. 6 We think the same purpose to prevent actual discrimination but to allow the states considerable freedom in working out an equitable tax system \n\n[309 \nU.S. 560, 568]\n\u00a0\n is discernable in the particular restriction upon which appellant relies.\n The resolution of the issue raised by appellant thus turns upon an examination of the whole tax structure of the state. Counsel have stipulated that six thousand business and mercantile corporations, in addition to paying the income tax imposed by  6 on six per centum of their net income, filed a corporation license tax return for the year 1936 and paid a tax based on one dollar per one thousand dollars of the value of the capital stock employed within the state, and that the Government bonds held by each were included as capital in the measure of the franchise tax. They further stipulated that only thirty-seven of these six thousand corporations owned Government bonds and that, in the case of all but three, the franchise taxes paid exceeded the additional amounts which would have been due under the income tax imposed by  6 had their gross income, contrary to the fact, included the interest derived from the bonds. In addition to the foregoing taxes, so it is stipulated, each of these corporations paid an ad valorem tax on its moneyed capital.\n This brief survey suffices to show that, considering all the taxes imposed upon business and mercantile corporations doing business in the state, the scheme of taxation adopted by Oklahoma does not discriminate against national banking associations. Discrimination is not shown merely because a few individual corporations, out of a class of several thousand which ordinarily bear the same or a heavier tax burden, may sustain a lighter tax than that imposed on national banking associations.

It charges that certain major oil companies,4 selling gasoline in the Mid-Western area5 ( which includes the Western District of Wisconsin), (1) 'combined and conspired together for the purpose of artificially raising and fixing the tank car prices of gasoline' in the 'spot markets' in the East Texas6 and Mid-Continent7 fields; (2) 'have artificially raised and fixed said spot market tank car prices of gasoline and have maintained said prices at artificially high and non-competitive levels, and at levels agreed upon among them and have thereby intentionally increased and fixed the tank car prices of gasoline contracted to be sold and sold in interstate commerce as aforesaid in the Mid-Western area'; (3) 'have arbitrarily', by reason of the provisions of the prevailing form of jobber contracts which made the price to the jobber dependent on the average spot market price, 'exacted large sums of money from thousands of jobbers with \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 167]\n\u00a0\n whom they have had such contracts in said Mid-Western area'; and (4) 'in turn have intentionally raised the general level of retail prices prevailing in said Mid-Western area.'\n The manner and means of effectuating such conspiracy are alleged in substance as follows: Defendants, from February 1935 to December 1936 'have knowingly and unlawfully engaged and participated in two concerted gasoline buying programs' for the purchase 'from independent refiners in spot transactions of large quantities of gasoline in the East Texas and Mid-Continent fields at uniform, high, and at times progressively increased prices.' The East Texas buying program is alleged to have embraced purchases of gasoline in spot transactions from most of the independent refiners in the East Texas field, who were members of the East Texas Refiners' Marketing Association, formed in February 1935 with the knowledge and approval of some of the defendants 'for the purpose of selling and facilitating the sale of gasoline to defendant major oil companies.' It is alleged that arrangements were made and carried out for allotting orders for gasoline received from defendants among the members of that association; and that such purchases amounted to more than 50% of all gasoline produced by those independent refiners. The Mid-Continent buying program is alleged to have included 'large and increased purchases of gasoline' by defendants from independent refiners located in the Mid- Continent fields pursuant to allotments among themselves. Those purchases, it is charged, were made from independent refiners who were assigned to certain of the defendants at monthly meetings of a group representing defendants. It is alleged that the purchases in this buying program amounted to nearly 50% of all gasoline sold by those independents. As respects both the East Texas and the Mid-Continent buying programs, it is alleged that the purchases of gasoline were in excess of the amounts which defendants would have \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 168]\n\u00a0\n purchased but for those programs; that at the instance of certain defendants these independent refiners curtailed their production of gasoline.\n The independent refiners selling in these programs were named as co- conspirators, but not as defendants.\n Certain market journals-Chicago Journal of Commerce, Platt's Oilgram, National Petroleum News-were made defendants. \n8\n Their participation in the conspiracy is alleged as follows: that they have been 'the chief agencies and instrumentalities' through which the wrongfully raised prices 'have affected the prices paid by jobbers, retail dealers, and consumers for gasoline in the Mid-Western area,' that they 'knowingly published and circulated as such price quotations the wrongfully and artificially raised and fixed prices for gasoline paid by' defendants in these buying programs, while 'representing the price quotations published by them' to be gasoline prices 'prevailing in spot sales to jobbers in tank car lots' and while 'knowing and intending them to be relied on as such by jobbers and to be made the basis of prices to jobbers.'\n Jurisdiction and venue in the Western District of Wisconsin are alleged as follows: that most of defendant major oil companies have sold large quantities of gasoline in tank car lots to jobbers in that district at the 'artificially raised and fixed and non-competitive prices'; that they have 'solicited and taken contracts and orders' for \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 169]\n\u00a0\n gasoline in that district; and that they have required retail dealers and consumers therein 'to pay artificially increased prices for gasoline' pursuant to the conspiracy.\n The methods of marketing and selling gasoline in the Mid-Western area are set forth in the indictment in some detail. Since we hereafter develop the facts concerning them, it will suffice at this point to summarize them briefly. Each defendant major oil company owns, operates or leases retail service stations in this area. It supplies those stations, as well as independent retail stations, with gasoline from its bulk storage plants. All but one sell large quantities of gasoline to jobbers in tank car lots under term contracts. In this area these jobbers exceed 4,000 in number and distribute about 50% of all gasoline distributed to retail service stations therein, the bulk of the jobbers' purchases being made from the defendant companies. The price to the jobbers under those contracts with defendant companies is made dependent on the spot market price, pursuant to a formula hereinafter discussed. And the spot market tank car prices of gasoline directly and substantially influence the retail prices in the area. In sum, it is alleged that defendants by raising and fixing the tank car prices of gasoline in these spot markets could and did increase the tank car prices and the retail prices of gasoline sold in the Mid-Western area. The vulnerability of these spot markets to that type of manipulation or stabilization is emphasized by the allegation that spot market prices published in the journals were the result of spot sales made chiefly by independent refiners of a relatively small amount of the gasoline sold in that area-virtually all gasoline sold in tank car quantities in spot market transactions in the Mid- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 170]\n\u00a0\n Western area being sold by independent refiners, such sales amounting to less than 5% of all gasoline marketed therein.\n So much for the indictment.\nII. Background of the Alleged Conspiracy.\n Evidence was introduced (or respondents made offers of proof) showing or tending to show the following conditions preceding the commencement of the alleged conspiracy in February 1935. As we shall develop later, these facts were in the main relevant to certain defenses which respondents at the trial unsuccessfully sought to interpose to the indictment.\n Beginning about 1926 there commenced a period of production of crude oil in such quantities as seriously to affect crude oil and gasoline markets throughout the United States. Overproduction was wasteful, reduced the productive capacity of the oil fields and drove the price of oil down to levels below the cost of production from pumping and stripper9 wells. When the price falls below such cost, those wells must be abandoned. Once abandoned, subsurface changes make it difficult or impossible to bring those wells back into production. Since such wells constitute about 40% of the country's known oil reserves, conservation requires that the price of crude oil be maintained at a level which will permit such wells to be operated. As Oklahoma and Kansas were attempting to remedy the situation through their proration laws, the largest oil field in history was discovered in East Texas. That was in 1930. The supply of oil from this \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 171]\n\u00a0\n field was so great that at one time crude oil sank to 10 or 15 cents a barrel, and gasoline was sold in the East Texas field for 2 1\/8\u00f5 a gallon. Enforcement by Texas of its proration law was extremely difficult. Orders restricting production were violated, the oil unlawfully produced being known as 'hot oil' and the gasoline manufactured therefrom, 'hot gasoline'. Hot oil sold for substantially lower prices than those posted for legal oil. Hot gasoline therefore cost less and at times could be sold for less than it cost to manufacture legal gasoline. The latter, deprived of its normal outlets, had to be sold at distress prices. The condition of many independent refiners using legal crude oil was precarious. In spite of their unprofitable operations they could not afford to shut down, for if they did so they would be apt to lose their oil connections in the field and their regular customers. Having little storage capacity they had to sell their gasoline as fast as they made it. As a result their gasoline became 'distress' gasoline-gasoline which the refiner could not store, for which he had no regular sales outlets and which therefore he had to sell for whatever price it would bring. Such sales drove the market down.\n In the spring of 1933 conditions were acute. The wholesale market was below the cost of manufacture. As the market became flooded with cheap gasoline, gasoline was dumped at whatever price it would bring. On June 1, 1933, the price of crude oil was 25\u00f5 a barrel; the tank car price of regular gasoline was 2 5\/8\u00f5 a gallon. In June 1933 Congress passed the National Industrial Recovery Act, 48 Stat. 195. Sec. 9(c) of that Act authorized the President to forbid the interstate and foreign shipment of petroleum and its products produced or withdrawn from storage in violation of state laws. By Executive Order the President on July 11, 1933, forbade such shipments. On August 19, 1933, a code of fair competi- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 172]\n\u00a0\n tion for the petroleum industry was approved. \n10\n The Secretary of the Interior was designated as Administrator of that Code. He established a Petroleum Administrative Board to 'advise with and make recommendations' to him. A Planning and Coordination Committee was appointed, of which respondent Charles E. Arnott, a vice-president of Socony-Vacuum, was a member, to aid in the administration of the Code. In addressing that Committee in the fall of 1933 the Administrator said: 'Our task is to stabilize the oil industry upon a profitable basis.' Considerable progress was made. The price of crude oil was a dollar a barrel near the end of September 1933, as a result of the voluntary action of the industry,11 but, according to respondents, in accordance with the Administrator's policy and desire. In April 1934 an amendment to the Code was adopted under which an attempt was made to balance the supply of gasoline with the demand by allocating the amount of crude oil which each refiner could process with the view of creating a firmer condition in the market and thus increasing the \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 173]\n\u00a0\n price of gasoline. \n12\n This amendment also authorized the Planning and Coordination Committee, with the approval of the President, to make suitable arrangements for the purchase of gasoline from non-integrated or semi-integrated refiners and the resale of the same through orderly channels. Thereafter four buying programs were approved by the Administrator. \n13\n These permitted the major companies to purchase distress gasoline from the independent refiners. Standard forms of contract were provided. The evil aimed at was, in part at least, the production of hot oil and hot gasoline. The contracts (to at least one of which the Administrator was a party) were made pursuant to the provisions of the National Industrial Recovery Act and the Code and bound the purchasing company to buy fixed amounts of gasoline at designated prices14 on condition that the seller \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 174]\n\u00a0\n should abide by the provisions of the Code. According to the 1935 Annual Report of the Secretary of the Interior, these buying programs were not successful as 'the production of gasoline from 'hot oil' continued, stocks of gasoline mounted, wholesale prices for gasoline remained below parity with crude-oil prices, and in the early fall of 1934 the industry approached a serious collapse of the wholesale market.' \n15\n Restoration of the price of gasoline to parity with crude oil at one dollar per barrel was not realized.\n The flow of hot oil out of East Texas continued. Refiners in the field could procure such oil for 35\u00f5 or less a barrel and manufacture gasoline from it for 2 or 2 1\/2\u00f5 a gallon. This competition of the cheap hot gasoline drove the price of legal gasoline down below the cost of production. The problem of distress gasoline also persisted. The disparity between the price of gasoline and the cost of crude oil which had been at $ 1 per barrel since September 1933 caused losses to many independent refiners, no matter how efficient they were. In October 1934 the Administrator set up a Federal Tender Board and issued an order making it illegal to ship crude oil or gasoline out of East Texas in interstate or foreign commerce unless it were accompanied by a tender issued by that Board certifying that it had been legally produced or manufactured. Prices rose sharply. But the improvement was only temporary as the enforcement of  9(c) of the Act was enjoined in a number of suits. On January 7, 1935, this Court held  9(c) to be unconstitutional. Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, \n293 \nU.S. 388\n, 55 S.Ct. 241. Following that decision there was a renewed influx of hot gasoline into the Mid-Western area and the tank car market fell. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 175]\n\u00a0\n Meanwhile the retail markets had been swept by a series of price wars. These price wars affected all markets-service station, tank wagon, and tank car. Early in 1934 the Petroleum Administrative Board tried to deal with them-by negotiating agreements between marketing companies and persuading individual companies to raise the price level for a period. On July 9, 1934, that Board asked respondent Arnott, chairman of the Planning and Coordination Committee's Marketing Committee,16 if he would head up a voluntary, cooperative movement to deal with price wars. According to Arnott, he pointed out that in order to stabilize the retail market it was necessary to stabilize the tank car market through elimination of hot oil and distress gasoline. \n17\n On July 20, 1934, the Administrator wrote Arnott, described the disturbance caused by price wars and said:\n'Under Article VII, Section 3 of the Code it is the duty of the Planning and Coordination Committee to cooperate with the Administration as a planning and fair practice agency for the industry. I am, therefore, requesting you, as Chairman of the Marketing Committee of the Planning and Coordination Committee, to take action which we deem necessary to restore markets to their normal conditions in areas where wasteful competition has caused them to become depressed. The number and extent of these situations would make it impractical for the Petroleum Administrative Board acting alone to deal with each specific situation. Therefore, I am re- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 176]\n\u00a0\n questing and authorizing you, as Chairman of the Marketing Committee, to designate committees for each locality when and as price wars develop, with authority to confer and to negotiate and to hold due public hearings with a view to ascertaining the elements of conflict that are present, and in a cooperative manner to stabilize the price level to conform to that normally prevailing in contiguous areas where marketing conditions are similar. An activities of your Committee must, of course, be consistent with the requirements of Clause 2 of Sub-section (a) of Section III of the Act, ....'18 \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 177]\n\u00a0\n After receiving that letter Arnott appointed a General Stabilization Committee with headquarters in Washington and a regional chairman in each region. Over fifty state and local committees were set up. The Petroleum Administrative Board worked closely with Arnott and the committees until the end of the Code near the middle of 1935. The effort (first local, then state-wide, and finally regional) was to eliminate price wars by negotiation and by persuading suppliers to see to it that those who bought from them sold at a fair price. In the first week of December 1934, Arnott held a meeting of the General Stabilization Committee in Chicago and a series of meetings on the next four or five days attended by hundreds of members of the industry from the middle west. These meetings were said to have been highly successful in elimination of many price wars. Arnott reported the results to members of the Petroleum Administrative Board on December 18, 1934, and stated that he was going to have a follow-up meeting in the near future. It was at that next meeting that the groundwork for the alleged conspiracy was laid.\n\nIII. The Alleged Conspiracy.\n The alleged conspiracy is not to be found in any formal contract or agreement. It is to be pieced together from the testimony of many witnesses and the contents of over 1,000 exhibits, extending through the 3, 900 printed pages of the record. What follows is based almost entirely on unequivocal testimony or undisputed contents of exhibits, only occasionally on the irresistible inferences from those facts. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 178]\n\u00a0\n A. Formation of the Mid-Continent Buying Program.\n The next meeting of the General Stabilization Committee was held in Chicago on January 4, 1935, and was attended by all of the individual respondents, by representatives of the corporate respondents, and by others. Representatives of independent refiners, present at the meeting, complained of the failure of the price of refined gasoline to reach a parity with the crude oil price of $1 a barrel. And complaints by the independents of the depressing effect on the market of hot and distress gasoline were reported. Views were expressed to the effect that 'if we were going to have general stabilization in retail markets, we must have some sort of a firm market in the tank car market.' As a result of the discussion Arnott appointed a Tank Car Stabilization Committee19 to study the situation and make a report, or, to use the language of one of those present, 'to consider ways and means of establishing and maintaining an active and strong tank car market on gasoline.' Three days after this committee was appointed, this Court decided Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, supra. As we have said, there was evidence that following that decision there was a renewed influx of hot gasoline into the Mid-Western area with a consequent falling off of the tank car market prices.\n The first meeting of the Tank Car Committee was held February 5, 1935, and the second on February 11, 1935. At these meetings the alleged conspiracy was formed, the substance of which, so far as it pertained to the Mid-Continent phase, was as follows:\n It was estimated that there would be between 600 and 700 tank cars of distress gasoline produced in the Mid- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 179]\n\u00a0\n Continent oil field every month by about 17 independent refiners. These refiners, not having regular outlets for the gasoline, would be unable to dispose of it except at distress prices. Accordingly, it was proposed and decided that certain major companies (including the corporate respondents) would purchase gasoline from these refiners. The Committee would assemble each month information as to the quantity and location of this distress gasoline. Each of the major companies was to select one (or more) of the independent refiners having distress gasoline as its 'dancing partner',20 and would assume responsibility for purchasing its distress supply. In this manner buying power would be coordinated, purchases would be effectively placed, and the results would be much superior to the previous haphazard purchasing. There were to be no formal contractual commitments to purchase this gasoline, either between the major companies or between the majors and the independents. Rather it was an informal gentlemen's agreement or understanding whereby each undertook to perform his share of the joint undertaking. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 180]\n\u00a0\n Purchases were to be made at the 'fair going market price'.\n A Mechanical Sub-Committee21 was appointed to find purchasers for any new distress gasoline which might appear between the monthly meetings of the Tank Car Stabilization Committee and to handle detailed problems arising during these periods. It was agreed that any such attempt to stabilize the tank car market was hopeless until the flow of hot gasoline was stopped. But it was expected that a bill pending before Congress to prohibit interstate shipment of hot gasoline would soon be enacted which would deal effectively with that problem. Accordingly, it was decided not to put any program into operation until this bill had been enacted and became operative. It was left to respondent Arnott to give the signal for putting the program into operation after this had occurred.\n The Connally Act, 49 Stat. 30, 15 U.S.C.A.  715 et seq., became law on February 22, 1935. The enforcement agency under this act was the Federal Tender Board which was appointed about March 1st. It issued its first tenders March 4th. On March 1st respondents Arnott and Ashton explained the buying program to a group of Mid-Continent independent refiners in Kansas City, who expressed a desire to cooperate and who appointed a committee to attend a meeting of the Tank Car Stabilization Committee in St. Louis on March 5th to learn more about the details. This meeting was held with the committee of the independents present as one of the sessions. At a later session that day the final details of the Mid- Continent buying program were worked out, including an assignment \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 181]\n\u00a0\n of the 'dancing partners' among the major companies. \n22\n On March 6th Ashton telephoned Arnott and told him what had been accomplished at the St. Louis meeting. Later the same day Arnott told Ashton by telephone that the program should be put into operation as soon as possible, since the Federal Tender Board seemed to be cleaning up the hot oil situation in East Texas. Ashton advised McDowell, chairman of the Mechanical Sub- Committee, of Arnott's instructions. And on March 7th that committee went into action. They divided up the major companies; each communicated with those on his list, advised them that the program was launched, and suggested that they get in touch with their respective 'dancing partners'. Before the month was out all companies alleged to have participated in the program (except one or two) made purchases; 757 tank cars were bought from all but three of the independent refiners who were named in the indictment as sellers.\n B. The Mid-Continent Buying Program in Operation.\n No specific term for the buying program was decided upon, beyond the first month. But it was started with the hope of its continuance from month to month. And in fact it did go on for over a year, as we shall see.\n The concerted action under this program took the following form:\n The Tank Car Stabilization Committee had A. V. Bourque, Secretary of the Western Petroleum Refiners' \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 182]\n\u00a0\n Association,23 make a monthly survey, showing the amount of distress gasoline which each independent refiner would have during the month. From March 1935 through February 1936 that Committee met once a month. At these meetings the surveys showing the amount and location of distress gasoline were presented and discussed. They usually revealed that from 600 to 800 tank cars of distress gasoline would become available during the month. Each member of the Committee present would indicate how much his company would buy and from whom. Those companies which were not represented at the meetings were approached by the Mechanical Sub-Committee; 'word was gotten to them as to the amount of gasoline that it was felt they could take in that month.' Also, as we have stated, the Mechanical Sub-Committee would endeavor to find purchasers for any new distress gasoline which appeared between the meetings of the Tank Car Stabilization Committee. It would report such new surpluses to Bourque. The functions of the Mechanical Sub- Committee were apparently not restricted merely to dissemination of information to the buyers. One of its members testified that he urged the majors to buy more distress gasoline. Throughout, persuasion was apparently used to the end that all distress gasoline would be taken by the majors and so kept from the tank car markets. As the program progressed, most of the major companies continued to buy from the same 'dancing partners' with whom they had started.\n One of the tasks of the Mechanical Sub-Committee was to keep itself informed as to the current prices of \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 183]\n\u00a0\n gasoline and to use its persuasion and influence to see to it that the majors paid a fair going market price and did not 'chisel' on the small refiners. It did so. At its meetings during the spring of 1935 the question of the fair going market price was discussed. For example, Jacobi, a member of the Sub-Committee, testified that at the meeting of March 14, 1935, 'the sub-committee ... arrived at what we thought was a fair market price for the week following', viz. 3 3\/4\u00f5 and 4 3\/4\u00f5.24 Jacobi termed these prices arrived at by the Sub-Committee as the 'recommended prices'. He made it a practice of recommending these prices to the major companies with which he communicated. According to his testimony, those 'recommendations' were represented by him to be not the Sub-Committee's but his own idea. McDowell testified that he never made any such price recommendations but if asked would tell the purchasing companies what his own company was paying for gasoline. \n25\n Up to June 7, 1935, price 'recommendations' were made five or seven times, each time the 'recommended' prices constituting a price advance of 1\/8\u00f5 or 1\/4\u00f5 over the previous 'recommendation'. No more price 'recommendations' were made in 1935. In January 1936 there was an advance in the price of crude oil. The members of the Sub-Committee discussed the price situation and concluded that an advance of 1\/2\u00f5 a gallon of gasoline purchased under the program should be made. Jacobi made that 'recommendation' to the companies on his list. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 184]\n\u00a0\n We shall discuss later the effect of this buying program on the market.\n The major companies regularly reported to Bourque, the trade association representative of the Mid-Continent independent refiners, the volume of their purchases under the program and the prices paid. Representatives of one of the corporate respondents repeatedly characterized its purchases under the program as 'quotas', 'obligations', or 'allocations'. They spoke of one of its 'dancing partners' under the buying program as 'one of the babies placed in our lap last spring when this thing was inaugurated.' And they stated that 'we don't have much choice as to whose material we are to take, when we purchase outside third grade gasoline in connection with the Buying Program Committee's operations. On such purchases, we have refineries 'assigned' to us.' This was doubtless laymen's, not lawyers', language. As we have said, there does not appear to have been any binding commitment to purchase; the plan was wholly voluntary; there is nothing in the record to indicate that a participant would be penalized for failure to cooperate. But though the arrangement was informal, it was nonetheless effective, as we shall see. And, as stated by the Circuit Court of Appeals, there did appear to be at least a moral obligation to purchase the amounts specified at the fair market prices 'recommended'. That alone would seem to explain why some of the major companies cancelled or declined to enter into profitable deals for the exchange of gasoline with other companies in order to participate in this buying program. Respondent Skelly Oil Co. apparently lost at least some of its pipeline transportation profit of 3\/16\u00f5 a gallon 'on every car of gasoline' purchased by it in the buying program. And both that company and respondent Wadhams Oil Co. continued to make purchases of gasoline under the program although they were unable then to dispose of it. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 185]\n\u00a0\n Up to June 1935, the expenses incurred by the members of the Mechanical Sub-Committee were charged to and paid by the Planning and Coordination Committee of the Code of Fair Competition for the Petroleum Industry. On May 27, 1935, this Court held in A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 495\n, 55 S.Ct. 837, 97 A.L. R. 947, that the code-making authority conferred by the National Industrial Recovery Act was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. Shortly thereafter the Tank Car Stabilization Committee held a meeting to discuss their future course of action. It was decided that the buying program should continue. Accordingly, that Committee continued to meet each month through February 1936. The procedure at these meetings was essentially the same as at the earlier ones. Gradually the buying program worked almost automatically, as contacts between buyer and seller became well established. The Mechanical Sub-Committee met at irregular intervals until December 1935. Thereafter it conducted its work on the telephone.\n C. Formation and Nature of the East Texas Buying Program.\n In the meetings when the Mid-Continent buying program was being formulated it was recognized that it would be necessary or desirable to take the East Texas surplus gasoline off the market so that it would not be a 'disturbing influence in the Standard of Indiana territory'. The reason was that weakness in East Texas spot market prices might make East Texas gasoline competitive with Mid-Continent gasoline in the Mid-Western area and thus affect Mid-Continent spot market prices. The tank car rate on gasoline shipments from the East Texas field to points in the Mid- Western area was about 1\/8\u00f5 a gallon higher than from the Mid-Continent field. With East Texas spot market prices more then 1\/8\u00f5 a \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 186]\n\u00a0\n gallon below Mid-Continent spot market prices, there might well be a resulting depressing effect on the Mid-Continent spot market prices. \n26\n\u00a0\n\n Early in 1935 the East Texas Refiners' Marketing Association was formed to dispose of the surplus gasoline manufactured by the East Texas refiners. The occasion for the formation of this Association was the stoppage of the shipment of hot oil and gasoline as a consequence of a Texas law enacted in December 1934. As long as these refiners had operated on cheap hot oil they had been able to compete for business throughout the Middle West. If they used legal crude at a dollar a barrel, their costs would increase. Their shift from a hot oil to a legal oil basis necessitated a change in their marketing methods. They were already supplying jobbers and dealers of Texas with all the gasoline they could use. Hence, their problem was to find additional markets for the surplus gasoline which they manufactured from legal crude. The Association was to act as the sales agency for those surpluses. Shipments north would be against the freight differential. Therefore, without regular outlets for this surplus gasoline they would have been forced to dump it on the market at distress prices. Their plan was to persuade the major companies if possible to buy more East Texas gasoline and to purchase it through the Association which would allocate it among its members who had surpluses. Neil Buckley, a buyer for Cities Service \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 187]\n\u00a0\n Export Corporation in Tulsa, was recommended by one of the independents as the contact man. Buckley undertook the job. \n27\n\u00a0\n\n Thus it was not established that the major companies caused the Association to be formed. But it is clear that the services of the Association were utilized in connection with a buying program by defendant companies. The record is quite voluminous on the activities of Buckley in getting the support of the majors to the Association's program. Suffice it to say that he encountered many difficulties, most of them due to the suspicion and mistrust of the majors as a result of the earlier hot oil record of the East Texas independents. His initial task was to convince the majors of the good faith of the East Texas independents. Many conferences were had. Arnott gave help to Buckley. Thus, on March 1, 1935, Arnott wired a small group of representatives of major companies, who were buyers and users of East Texas gasoline, inviting them to attend a meeting in New York City on March 6th 'to hear outcome my meeting with East Texas refiners and to consider future action surplus gasoline this and other groups that is awaiting our decision ... matter of extreme importance.' The problem was discussed at that meeting28 but reliable information was lacking as to the probable amount of distress gasoline, the size of the independents' Federal allocations and whether or not such gasoline was going to be manufactured within \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 188]\n\u00a0\n those allocations. Accordingly Arnott appointed a committee to attend the meeting of the District Allocators29 on March 13th and to obtain the information. That information was obtained and a schedule was prepared showing the probable amount of surplus gasoline in East Texas and the Gulf, the names of the regular buyers in those areas, and the amounts they might take. Arnott, on March 14th, by telegraph called another meeting in New York City for the next day, saying 'The question of surplus gasoline which has been under consideration must be finalized tomorrow.' At that meeting someone (apparently a representative of respondent Sinclair) 'arose with a slip of paper in his hand and stated that it had been suggested' that each of 12 to 15 major companies 'take so much gasoline' from East Texas, 'the amounts being read off as to what each company would take'. Nothing definite was decided at the meeting. Buckley continued his efforts, talking with Arnott and representatives of other majors. It is impossible to find from the record the exact point of crystallization of a buying program. But it is clear that as a result of Buckley's and Arnott's efforts and of the discussions at the various meetings various major companies did come into line and that a concerted buying program was launched. The correspondence of employees of some of the majors throughout the period in question is replete with references such as the following: 'buying program in East Texas'; 'our allocation of five cars per day'; 'a general buying movement'; 'regular weekly purchases from the East Texas group'; 'allocations and purchases' in the East Texas field; and the like. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 189]\n\u00a0\n In 1935 the East Texas refiners named in the indictment sold 285,592, 188 gallons of gasoline. Of this certain defendant companies30 bought 40, 195,754 gallons or 14.07%. In the same year all independent refiners in East Texas sold 378,920,346 gallons-practically all of it on the spot market. Of this amount those defendant companies purchased 12.03% or 45, 598,453 gallons. Of the 8,797 tank cars purchased by all defendants ( except Sinclair) from March 1935 through April 1936 from independent refiners in the East Texas field, 2,412 tank cars were purchased by the present corporate respondents.\n Every Monday morning the secretary of the East Texas association ascertained from each member the amount of his forthcoming weekly surplus gasoline and the price he wanted. He used the consensus of opinion as the asking price. He would call the major companies; they would call him. He exchanged market information with them. Orders received for less than the asking price would not be handled by the Association; rather the secretary would refer the buyer to one of the independents who might sell at the lower price. Very few cars were purchased through the Association by others than the major oil companies. 31 The majors bought about 7,000 tank cars through the Association in 1935 and about 2,700 tank cars in the first four months of 1936. And in 1935 the secretary of the Association placed an additional 1,000 tank cars by bringing the purchasers and the independent refiners together. The purchases in 1935 in East Texas were, with minor exceptions, either \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 190]\n\u00a0\n at the low or slightly below the low quotation in Platt's Oilgram, following it closely as the market rose in March, April, and May, 1935; they conformed to the market as it flattened out into more or less of a plateau through the balance of 1935 with a low for third grade gasoline of 45\/8\u00f5. This was consistent with the policy of the buying program. For the majors were requested to purchase at the 'fair, going market price'.32 And it is clear that this East Texas buying program was, as we have said, supplementary or auxiliary to the Mid-Continent program. As stated in March 1935 in an inter-company memorandum of one of the majors: '... with east coast refiners having a program to purchase surplus East Texas gasoline over the next four months, we feel that still further advances can be made in the tank car market and a resultant increase in the service station price.'\n D. Scope and Purpose of the Alleged Conspiracy.\n As a result of these buying programs it was hoped and intended that both the tank car and the retail markets would improve. The conclusion is irresistible that defendants' purpose was not merely to raise the spot market prices but, as the real and ultimate end, to raise the price of gasoline in their sales to jobbers and consumers in the Mid-Western area. Their agreement or plan embraced not only buying on the spot markets but also, at least by clear implication, an understanding to maintain such improvements in Mid-Western prices as would result from those purchases of distress gasoline. The latter obviously would be achieved by selling at the increased prices, not \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 191]\n\u00a0\n by price cutting. Any other understanding would have been wholly inconsistent with and contrary to the philosophy of the broad stabilization efforts which were under way. In essence the raising and maintenance of the spot market prices were but the means adopted for raising and maintaining prices to jobbers and consumers. The broad sweep of the agreement was indicated by Arnott before a group of the industry on March 13, 1935. He described the plan as one 'whereby this whole stabilization effort of markets, the holding up of normal sales market structures, the question of the realization of refineries, the working together of those two great groups in order that we may balance this whole picture and in order that we may interest a great many buyers in this so- called surplus or homeless gasoline, can be done along organized lines . ...' Certainly there was enough evidence to support a finding by the jury that such were the scope and purpose of the plan.\n But there was no substantial competent evidence that defendants, as charged in the indictment, induced the independent refiners to curtail their production.\n E. Marketing and Distribution Methods.\n Before discussing the effect of these buying programs, some description of the methods of marketing and distributing gasoline in the Mid-Western area during the indictment period is necessary.\n The defendant companies sold about 83% of all gasoline sold in the Mid-Western area during 1935. As we have noted, major companies, such as most of the defendants, are those whose operations are fully integrated- producing crude oil, having pipe lines for shipment of the crude to its refineries, refining crude oil, and marketing gasoline at retail and at wholesale. During the greater part of the indictment period the defendant companies \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 192]\n\u00a0\n owned and operated many retail service stations33 through which they sold about 20% of their Mid-Western gasoline in 1935 and about 12% during the first seven months of 1936. Standard Oil Company (Indiana)34 was known during this period as the price leader or market leader throughout the Mid- Western area. It was customary for retail distributors, whether independent or owned or controlled by major companies, to follow Standard's posted retail prices. Its posted retail price in any given place in the Mid-Western area was determined by computing the Mid- Continent spot market price and adding thereto the tank car freight rate from the Mid-Continent field, taxes and 5 1\/2\u00f5. The 5 1\/2\u00f5 was the equivalent of the customary 2\u00f5 jobber margin and 3 1\/2\u00f5 service station margin. In this manner the retail price structure throughout the Mid- Western area during the indictment period was based in the main on Mid- Continent spot market quotations,35 or, as stated by one of the witnesses for the defendants, the spot market was a 'peg to hang the price structure on'.\n About 24% of defendant companies' sales in the Mid-Western area in 1935 were to jobbers, who perform the function of middlemen or wholesalers. Since 1925 jobbers were purchasing less of their gasoline on the spot tank car markets and more under long term supply contracts from major companies and independent refiners. These contracts usually ran for a year or more and covered all of the jobber's gasoline requirements during the period. The price which the jobber was to pay over the life of the contract was not fixed; but a formula for its com- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 193]\n\u00a0\n putation was included. About 80% or more of defendant companies' jobber contracts provided that the price of gasoline sold thereunder should be the Mid-Continent spot market price on the date of shipment. This spot market price was to be determined by averaging the high and low spot market quotations reported in the Chicago Journal of Commerce and Platt's Oilgram or by averaging the high and low quotations reported in the Journal alone. The contracts also gave the jobber a wholly or partially guaranteed margin between the price he had to pay for the gasoline and the normal price to service stations-customarily a 2\u00f5 margin. \n36\n\u00a0\n\n There is no central exchange or market place for spot market transactions. Each sale is the result of individual bargaining between a refiner and his customers, sales under long-term contracts not being included. It is a 'spot' market because shipment is to be made in the immediate future-usually within ten or fifteen days. Sales on the spot tank car markets are either sales to jobbers or consumers, sales by one refiner to another not being included. \n37\n The prices paid by jobbers and consumers in the various spot markets are published daily \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 194]\n\u00a0\n in the trade journals, Platt's Oilgram and Chicago Journal of Commerce. In the case of the Oilgram these prices are obtained by a market checker who daily calls refiners in the various refinery areas (major companies as well as independents) and ascertains the quantity and price of gasoline which they have sold to jobbers in spot sales. \n38\n After checking the prices so obtained against other sources of information (such as brokers' sales) and after considering the volume of sales reported at each price, he determines the lowest and highest prices at which gasoline is being sold to jobbers in substantial quantities on the spot market. \n39\n Thus, if he finds that substantial sales are reported at 5 1\/8\u00f5, 5 1\/4\u00f5 and 5 3\/8\u00f5, the Oilgram reports a price range of 5 1\/8-5 3\/8\u00f5. The result is published in the Oilgram that same day. \n40\n The Chicago Journal of Commerce Publishes similar quotations the day after the sales are reported. And its quotations cover sales to industrial consumers as well as to jobbers. But it was not shown that either journal had published prices paid by a major company as a price paid by jobbers on the tank car market.\n F. The Spot Market Prices during the Buying Program.\n In 1935 the 14 independent Mid-Continent refiners named in the indictment sold 377,988,736 gallons of gasoline. Of that output, the corporate respondents pur- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 195]\n\u00a0\n chased about 56,200,000 gallons or approximately 15%41 and the defendant companies who went to trial, about 17%. The monthly purchases of all defendant companies from Mid-Continent independents from March 1935 to April 1936 usually ranged between 600 and 900 tank cars and in a few months somewhat exceeded those amounts.\n Major company buying began under the Mid-Continent program on March 7, 1935. During the week before that buying commenced the Mid-Continent spot market for third grade gasoline rose 3\/8\u00f5. The low quotation on third grade gasoline was 3 1\/2\u00f5 on March 6, 1935. It rose to 4 3\/4\u00f5 early in June. That advance was evidenced by ten successive steps. The market on third grade gasoline then levelled out on a plateau which extended into January 1936, except for a temporary decline in the low quotation late in 1935. By the middle of January the low again had risen, this time to 5 1\/4 \u00f5. It held substantially at that point until the middle of February 1936. By the end of February it had dropped to 5\u00f5. It then levelled off at that low and remained there into May 1936 when the low dropped first to 4 7\/8\u00f5 and then to 4 3\/4\u00f5. It stayed there until the first week in July 1936. The low then rose to 4 7\/8\u00f5, maintained that level until mid-August, then started to drop until by successive steps it had declined to 4 1\/2\u00f5 before the middle of September. It stayed there \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 196]\n\u00a0\n until early October when it rose to 4 5\/8\u00f5, continuing at that level until middle November when it rose to 4 3\/4\u00f5. The low remained at substantially that point throughout the balance of 1936.\n During 1935, as the Mid-Continent spot market for third grade gasoline was rising, so was the East Texas spot market. And when in June 1935 the former levelled off for the balance of the year at a low of 4 3\/4 \u00f5, the latter42 levelled off, as we have seen, at a low of 4 5\/8\u00f5.\n During this period there were comparable movements on the Mid- Continent spot market for regular gasoline. From a low of 4 3\/8\u00f5 on March 7, 1935, it rose to a low of 5 5\/8\u00f5 early in June, that advance being evidenced by nine successive steps. As in the case of third grade gasoline, the market for regular gasoline then levelled out on a plateau which extended into January 1936. By the middle of January the low had risen to 6 1\/8\u00f5. It held at that point until the middle of February 1936. By the end of February it had dropped to 5 7\/8\u00f5. It rose to 6\u00f5 in the first week of March, levelled off at that low and remained there into August 1936. By mid-August it started to drop-reaching 5 1\/2\u00f5 in September, going to 5 5\/8\u00f5 in October and to 5 3\/4\u00f5 in November, where it stayed through the balance of 1936.\n These plateaus are clearly shown by a chart of the market journals' quotations. But that does not of course mean that all sales on the spot market were made between the high and the low during the period in question. As we have said, the quotations of the market journals merely indicated the range of prices (usually an eighth) within which the bulk of the gasoline was being sold. Hence actual sales took place above the high and below \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 197]\n\u00a0\n the low. Thus between June and December 1935 while the low for third grade gasoline remained substantially at 4 3\/4\u00f5 and the high at 4 7\/8\u00f5 jobbers' and consumers' purchases43 ranged from 4 3\/8\u00f5 to 5 1\/8\u00f5. A similar condition existed as respects regular gasoline.\n Purchases by the major companies likewise did not always fall within the range of these quotations. In fact, between 85 and 90% of their purchases from the independent refiners were made at prices which were at or below the low quotations in the market journals. \n44\n\u00a0\n\n[]\n Government's Respondents' Price Group Tank-Cars % Tank-Cars % []\n Above the lowest quotations in Platt's Oilgram 745 8.09 516 7.5 Above the lowest quotations in Chicago Journal of Commerce 984 10.7 992 14.3 At the lowest quotations in Platt's Oilgram 6407 69.64 4491-2\/3 64.9 At the lowest quotations in Chicago Journal of Commerce 6564 71.31 4419-2\/3 63.9 Below the lowest quotations in Platt's Oilgram 2052 22.27 1912-2\/3 27.6 Below the lowest quotations in Chicago Journal of Commerce 1656 17.99 1508-2\/3 21.8.\n Total 9204 100.0 6920-2\/3 100. []\n The government's tabulations dealt with 9,204 tank cars which defendants (excluding Sinclair) purchased on a flat price basis from independent refiners in the Mid-Continent field between March 1, 1935 and April 30, 1936. Respondents' tabulations included Sinclair and excluded sales by defendants who had already been dismissed, and eliminated or reclassified alleged omissions or improper classifications by the government.\n Respondents' computations also show that the percentage of purchases at prices below the low quotations was higher during the March-May, 1935 price rise than during the indictment period as a whole, and that the percentage of purchases above the low was lower during that period of price rise than during the period as a whole. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 198]\n\u00a0\n There were few such purchases above the high and not a substantial percentage at the high. \n45\n\u00a0\n\n G. Jobber and Retail Prices during the Buying Programs.\n That the spot market prices controlled prices of gasoline sold by the majors to the jobbers in the Mid-Western area during the indictment period is beyond question. For, as we have seen, the vest majority of jobbers' supply contracts during that period contained price formulae which were directly dependent on the Mid-Continent spot market prices. \n46\n Hence, as the latter rose, the prices to the jobbers under those contracts increased.\n There was also ample evidence that the spot market prices substantially affected the retail prices in the Mid-Western area during the indictment period. As we have seen, Standard of Indiana was known during this period as the price or market leader throughout this area. It was customary for the retailers to follow Standard's posted retail prices, which had as their original base the Mid-Continent spot market price. Standard's policy was \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 199]\n\u00a0\n to make changes in its posted retail price only when the spot market base went up or down at least 3\/10\u00f5 a gallon and maintained that change for a period of 7 days or more. \n47\n Standard's net reduction in posted prices for the 6 months preceding March 1935 was 1.9\u00f5 per gallon. From March 1935 to June 1935 its posted retail prices were advanced 3\/10\u00f5 four times.\n Retail prices in the Mid-Western area kept close step with Mid- Continent spot market prices during 1935 and 1936, though there was a short lag between advances in the spot market prices and the consequent rises in retail prices. 48 This was true in general both of the subnor- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 200]\n\u00a0\n mal49 and normal retail prices. To be sure, when the tank car spot market levelled out on a plateau from June to the end of 1935, there was not quite the same evenness in the higher plateau of the average retail prices. For there were during the period in question large numbers of retail price cuts in various parts of the Mid-Western area, though they diminished substantially during the spring and summer of 1935. Yet the average service station price50 (less tax) having reached 13.26\u00f5 by the middle of April (from 12.56\u00f5 near the first of March) never once fell below that amount; advanced regularly to 13.83\u00f5 by the middle of June; declined to 13. 44\u00f5 in August; and after an increase to 13.60\u00f5 during the last of the summer remained at 13.41\u00f5 during the balance of 1935 except for a minor intermediate drop. In sum, the contours of the retail prices conformed in general to those of the tank car spot markets. The movements of the two were not just somewhat comparable; they were strikingly similar. Irrespective of whether the tank car spot market prices controlled the retail prices in this area, there was substantial competent evidence that they influenced them-substantially and effectively. And in this connection it will be recalled that when the buying program was formulated it was in part predicated on the proposition that a firm tank car market was necessary for a stabilization of the retail markets. As reported by one who attended the meeting on February 5, 1935, where the buying program was being discussed: 'It was generally assumed that all companies would come into the picture since a stable retail market requires a higher tank car market.' \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 201]\n\u00a0\n IV. Other Circumstances Allegedly Relevant to the Offense Charged in the Indictment.\n The following facts or circumstances were developed at the trial by testimony or other evidence or were embraced in offers or proof made by respondents.\n A. Alleged Knowledge and Acquiescence of the Federal Government.\n Such of the following facts as were included in respondents' offers of proof were not sought to be proved in order to establish immunity from prosecution under the anti-trust laws. For admittedly the authorization under the National Industrial Recovery Act necessary for such immunity51 had not been obtained. Rather respondents' offers of proof were made in order to show the circumstances which, respondents argue, should be taken into consideration in order to judge the purpose, effect and reasonableness of their activities in connection with the buying program.\n Arnott testified that on January 8 or 9, 1935, he reported the appointment of the Tank Car Stabilization Committee to officials of the Petroleum Administrative Board who, he said, expressed great interest in it. A member of that Committee late in January 1935 advised the chairman of that Board of the 'necessity for action in getting tank car prices up before it is too late'. The chairman replied that 'the tank car situation in relation to the price of crude is one about which we have no disagreement. How to bring about a correction is the stumbling block.' There was evidence that at least general information concerning the meetings of the Tank Car Stabilization Committee was given a representative of the Board in February 1935. In March 1935 the Code \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 202]\n\u00a0\n authorities, with the approval of the Administrator, asked the major companies to curtail their manufacture of gasoline during that month by 1, 400,000 barrels. The purpose was said to be to aid the small refiners by forcing the majors to buy part of their requirements from them. A voluntary curtailment of some 960,000 barrels was made.\n On March 12, 1935, Arnott saw the Chairman and at least one other representative of the Board. Among other things the buying programs were discussed. Arnott did not ask for the Board's approval of these programs nor its 'blessing'. A representative of the Board testified that Arnott told them that he was conducting those buying programs 'on his own responsibility'. Arnott denied this. The Chairman of the Board asked Arnott if the programs violated the anti-trust laws. Arnott said he did not believe they did and described what his group was doing. Arnott testified that he felt that the Board thought the program was sound and hoped it would work; and that if he had thought they disapproved, he would have discontinued his activities. There was no evidence that the Board told Arnott to discontinue the program. But on March 13, 1935, Arnott in addressing the District Allocators' meeting said, respecting these buying programs:\n'I am perfectly conscious that we have made other efforts at times to have this question dealt with. It has always been done in group form. That has involved agreements, group agreements. Those of us who have had anything to do whatsoever with the whole national picture, who have come to Washington and have had any experience with the PAB and eventually the Department of Justice, know just how long that road is, and for some good reason or for some unknown reason or for no reason \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 203]\n\u00a0\n at all those agreements seem to have disappeared; those outstanding attempts-and they were really sincere and worthy attempts-have disappeared in a sort of cloud of mystery, and I don't think I for one, or anybody else can tell you just where they have gone-they are out of our minds, they are completed, they are finished, and we are not interested.'\n\n Respondents also offered to prove that a committee of the industry ( the Blazer Committee) appointed by the Administrator to study the condition of the small units in the industry, made a report to him in March 1935 which stated, inter alia, as a recommendation:\n'We know of nothing, apart from continued improvement in crude production control, which would be so helpful to the tank-car price of gasoline at this time as the substantial buying of distress gasoline by major companies. We understand a program of this sort is being considered by the Industry now in connection with a broad stabilization program. We therefore urge that the Administrator give it his approval and active support.'52\n\n They also offered a memorandum dated March 22, 1935, from the Chairman of the Petroleum Administrative \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 204]\n\u00a0\n Board to the Administrator53 commenting on the above report and making the following suggestion:\n'We believe success in Code administration, assuming that it is to continue, requires that some of the recommendations made should be adopted; e.g., we have encouraged stabilization efforts designed at this time to aid the independent refiner, ....'\n\n On April 2, 1935, the Administrator wrote Arnott, referred to his letter of July 20, 1934 and stated, inter alia:\n'The matter that at present concerns me is the necessity of complying with the requirements of the basic law. In authorizing the formulation of a stabilization program, I necessarily conditioned the authority granted, by providing that the requirements of Clause 2 of Subsection (a) of Section 3 of the National Industrial Recovery Act should be observed. I know you will appreciate that agreements between supplying companies which might be in conflict with the anti-trust laws of the United States require specific approval after due consideration if companies are to receive the protection afforded by Sections 4 and 5 of the National Industrial Recovery Act. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 205]\n\u00a0\n 'I understand that the temporary character of a number of situations and the need for immediate action has made formalized agreements impracticable and in a number of instances they may be unnecessary. However, when the understandings arrived at as bases of solution of price wars affecting the industry over a considerable area are intended to operate over a definite period of time or involve substantial changes in the policy of the various supplying companies made only in consideration of similar action on the part of other companies, it is necessary that the procedure required by the Recovery Act be followed in order that the arrangement be legal. If any such agreements have been made I should like a report as to them. If they require approval to be effective ... I should be glad to give consideration to them under the provisions of the Act.'\n\n On April 22, 1935, the Petroleum Administrative Board wrote a letter to Arnott imposing three conditions on general stabilization work: (1) there should be no stabilization meeting without a representative of the Board being present; (2) every element in the industry should be heard from before any decisions were made; (3) no general instructions should be given under the July 20, 1934 letter. A meeting of Arnott's committee and members of the Board was held on May 8, 1935. A representative of the Board testified that they called Arnott 'on the carpet to request him to explain' to them 'what he had been doing'. Arnott's group considered the conditions imposed by the Board quite impossible. The Board assigned two of its staff to work the problem out with one of Arnott's men. According to the testimony of one of the representatives of the Board at that meeting, Arnott \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 206]\n\u00a0\n did not ask for the Board's approval of the buying programs-nothing being said 'one way or the other, about approval or disapproval.' And he testified that Arnott in substance was told at that meeting by the Board's Chairman that the letter of July 20, 1934, from the Administrator to Arnott (quoted supra, 60 S.Ct. p. 823) did not give authority to conduct any buying program;54 and that Arnott said he was not relying on that letter for approval. Arnott, however, testified that he recalled no such statement made by the Board's Chairman. Apparently, however, Arnott, in answer to questions, gave a general explanation of the buying programs, stating that the majors were continuing informally to buy; that there was no pool; that no one was obliged to make purchases; that they were trying to lift from independent refiners distress gasoline which was burdening the market. \n55\n\u00a0\n\n Respondents also offered to prove that on May 14, 1935, the Chairman of the Petroleum Administrative Board asked Arnott to undertake to stabilize the Pennsylvania refinery market in the way that he had stabilized the Mid-Continent refinery market; that in connection with this request the Board evinced support and approval \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 207]\n\u00a0\n of the Mid-Continent buying program; and that Arnott undertook to do what he could in the matter and called a meeting of the Pennsylvania refiners for May 28, 1935. Apparently the Schechter decision terminated that undertaking.\n Respondents also offered portions of a final report56 prepared by the Marketing Division of the Petroleum Administrative Board which discussed the work of the General Stabilization Committee57 saying, inter alia: 'One of the most important was the tank-car committee, which attempted to get the tank-car market raised more in line with the price of crude recovery cost on the theory that a firm tank-car market was essential to a stabilized retail structure'. And respondents offered testimony of a member of the Board before a Senate Committee in 1937 respecting the 'buying pool efforts, that began in December of 1933 and continued from then on during the entire period of the Petroleum Code.' That testimony was: 'It was an effort of the Department and the industrial committees to bring about the normal relationship between gasoline prices and crude oil prices, in order to permit the independent, non integrated refiner to be able to operate without loss.'\n In sum, respondents by this and similar evidence offered to establish that the Petroleum Administrative Board knew of the buying programs and acquiesced in them. And respondents by those facts, together with those discussed under II, supra, undertook to show that their objective under the buying programs were in line \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 208]\n\u00a0\n with those of the Federal government under the Code: to keep the price of crude oil at a minimum of $1 a barrel; to restore the wholesale price level of gasoline at the refinery to a parity with crude oil; to stabilize retail prices\n at a normal spread between the refinery price and the retail price. B. Other Factors Alleged to have Caused or Contributed to the Rise in the Spot Market.\n Respondents do not contend that the buying programs were not a factor in the price rise and in the stabilization of the spot markets during 1935 and 1936. But they do contend that they were relatively minor ones, because of the presence of other economic forces such as the following:\n1. Control of production of crude oil.\n Under the Code an attempt was made for the first time to balance the production of crude oil with the consumptive demand for gasoline. Monthly estimates of gasoline consumption would be made by the Bureau of Mines. The quantity of crude oil necessary to satisfy that demand was also estimated, broken down into allowables for each state, and recommended to the states. And there was evidence that the states would approximately conform to those recommendations. After the Code the oil states continued the same practice under an Interstate Compact which permitted them to agree as to the quantities of crude oil which they would allow to be produced. \n58\n\u00a0\n\n As we have noted, this law was enacted late in February 1935 and began to be effective the first part of March 1935. Prior to this act, control of hot oil by the states \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 209]\n\u00a0\n had not been effective for any extended period of time. Throughout 1933 and 1934 from 150,000 to 200,000 barrels of crude oil a day were estimated to have been produced in East Texas in excess of the state's allowables, much of it going into interstate commerce. After the Connally Act went into operation, no hot gasoline went into interstate commerce according to respondents' evidence.\n3. $1 Crude oil.\n As we have noted, crude oil was brought to a dollar a barrel near the end of September 1933. Before the Connally Act, however, hot oil flooded the market at substantially lower prices. Gasoline produced from hot oil forced the price of gasoline produced from crude oil down below cost. But with the elimination of the hot oil, fluctuations in the price of crude ceased. This had a stabilizing effect on the price of gasoline.\n4. Increase in consumptive demand.\n Beginning in the spring of 1935 there was an increase in demand for gasoline. During the whole indictment period every month showed an increase over the corresponding month in the previous year. For the entire year of 1935 consumption for the country as a whole was 7% more than for 1934; that for 1936 was about 10% over 1935-substantially the same increases taking place in the Mid-Western area.\n5. Control of inventory withdrawal and of manufacture of gasoline.\n Under the Code crude oil could be withdrawn from storage only with the approval of the Administrator. Also under the Code there were manufacturing quotas for gasoline which through Code authorities were allocated among the refiners. In March 1935, as we have seen, gasoline inventories of the majors were reduced by over \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 210]\n\u00a0\n 900,000 barrels through a voluntary curtailment program. The demand was so heavy that the industry withdrew from storage and refined over 22,000,000 barrels of crude oil in storage in 1935. Further, imports of crude oil were limited by order of the Administrator.\n6. Improved business conditions.\n The years 1935 and 1936 were marked by improving general business conditions and rising prices everywhere.\n Much testimony was taken on these and related points. It was designed to show that under the conditions which existed during the indictment period, stability in the market was to be expected from the play of these various economic forces. For it was argued that by reason of those forces supply and demand were brought into a reasonable continuing balance with the resultant stabilization of the markets. And there was much testimony from respondents' witnesses that the above factors as well as the buying programs did contribute to price stability during this period. But no witness assumed to testify as to how much of a factor the buying program had been.\nV. Application of the Sherman Act.\n A. Charge to the Jury.\n The court charged the jury that it was a violation of the Sherman Act for a group of individuals or corporations to act together to raise the prices to be charged for the commodity which they manufactured where they controlled a substantial part of the interstate trade and commerce in that commodity. The court stated that where the members of a combination had the power to raise prices and acted together for that purpose, the combination was illegal; and that it was immaterial how reasonable or unreasonable those prices were or to what extent they had been affected by the combination. It further charged that if such illegal combination existed, \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 211]\n\u00a0\n it did not matter that there may also have been other factors which contributed to the raising of the prices. In that connection, it referred specifically to the economic factors which we have previously discussed and which respondents contended were primarily responsible for the price rise and the spot markets' stability in 1935 and 1936, viz. control of production, the Connally Act, the price of crude oil, an increase in consumptive demand, control of inventories and manufacturing quotas, and improved business conditions. The court then charged that, unless the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that the price rise and its continuance were 'caused' by the combination and not caused by those other factors, verdicts of 'not guilty' should be returned. It also charged that there was no evidence of governmental approval which would exempt the buying programs from the prohibitions of the Sherman Act; and that knowledge or acquiescence of officers of the government or the good intentions of the members of the combination would not give immunity from prosecution under that Act.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals held this charge to be reversible error, since it was based upon the theory that such a combination was illegal per se. In its view respondents' activities were not unlawful unless they constituted an unreasonable restraint of trade. Hence, since that issue had not been submitted to the jury and since evidence bearing on it had been excluded, that court reversed and remanded for a new trial so that the character of those activities and their effect on competition could be determined. In answer to the government's petition respondents here contend that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals was correct, since there was evidence that they had affected prices only in the sense that the removal of the competitive evil of distress gasoline by the buying programs had permitted prices to rise to a normal competitive level; that their activities promoted rather \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 212]\n\u00a0\n than impaired fair competitive opportunities; and therefore that their activities had not unduly or unreasonably restrained trade. And they also contend that certain evidence which was offered should have been admitted as bearing on the purpose and end sought to be attained, the evil believed to exist, and the nature of the restraint and its effect. By their cross- petition respondents contend that the record contains no substantial competent evidence that the combination, either in purpose or effect, unreasonably restrained trade within the meaning of the Sherman Act, and therefore that the Circuit Court of Appeals erred in holding that they were not entitled to directed verdicts of acquittal.\n In United States v. Trenton Potteries Co., \n273 \nU.S. 392\n, 47 S.Ct. 377, 50 A.L.R. 989, this Court sustained a conviction under the Sherman Act where the jury was charged that an agreement on the part of the members of a combination, controlling a substantial part of an industry, upon the prices which the members are to charge for their commodity is in itself an unreasonable restraint of trade without regard to the reasonableness of the prices or the good intentions of the combining units. There the combination was composed of those who controlled some 82 per cent of the business of manufacturing and distributing in the United States vitreous pottery. Their object was to fix the prices for the sale of that commodity. In that case the trial court refused various requests to charge that the agreement to fix prices did not itself constitute a violation of law unless the jury also found that it unreasonably restrained interstate commerce. This Court reviewed the various price-fixing cases under the Sherman Act beginning with United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Association, \n166 \nU.S. 290\n, 17 S.Ct. 540, and United States v. Joint Traffic Association, \n171 \nU.S. 505\n, 19 S.Ct. 25, and said '... it has since often been decided and always assumed that uniform \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 213]\n\u00a0\n price-fixing by those controlling in any substantial manner a trade or business in interstate commerce is prohibited by the Sherman Law, despite the reasonableness of the particular prices agreed upon.' 273 U.S. page 398, 47 S.Ct. page 380, 50 A.L.R. 989. This Court pointed out that the so-called 'rule of reason' announced in Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 1\n, 31 S.Ct. 502, 34 L.R.A.,N.S., 834, Ann.Cas.1912D, 734, and in United States v. American Tobacco Co., \n221 \nU.S. 106\n, 31 S.Ct. 632, had not affected this view of the illegality of price-fixing agreements. And in holding that agreements 'to fix or maintain prices' are not reasonable restraints of trade under the statute merely because the prices themselves are reasonable, it said. (273 U.S. pages 397, 398, 47 S.Ct. page 379, 50 A.L.R. 989):\n'The aim and result of every price-fixing agreement, if effective, is the elimination of one form of competition. The power to fix prices, whether reasonably exercised or not involves power to control the market and to fix arbitrary and unreasonable prices. The reasonable price fixed today may through economic and business changes become the unreasonable price of to-morrow. Once established, it may be maintained unchanged because of the absence of competition secured by the agreement for a price reasonable when fixed. Agreements which create such potential power may well be held to be in themselves unreasonable or unlawful restraints, without the necessity of minute inquiry whether a particular price is reasonable or unreasonable as fixed and without placing on the government in enforcing the Sherman Law the burden of ascertaining from day to day whether it has become unreasonable through the mere variation of economic conditions. Moreover, in the absence of express legislation requiring it, we should hesitate to adopt a construction making the difference between legal and illegal conduct in the field of business relations depend upon so uncertain a test as whether prices are reasonable-a determination which can be satisfactorily made \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 214]\n\u00a0\n only after a complete survey of our economic organization and a choice between rival philosophies.'\n\n In conclusion this Court emphasized that the Sherman Act is not only a prohibition against the infliction of a particular type of public injury, but also, as stated in Standard Sanitary Mfg. Co. v. United States, \n226 \nU.S. 20, 49\n, 33 S.Ct. 9, 15, a 'limitation of rights' which may be 'pushed to evil consequences, and therefore restrained'.\n But respondents claim that other decisions of this Court afford them adequate defenses to the indictment. Among those on which they place reliance are Appalachian Coals, Inc., v. United States, \n288 \nU.S. 344\n, 53 S. Ct. 471; Sugar Institute, Inc., v. United States, \n297 \nU.S. 553\n, 56 S.Ct. 629; Maple Flooring Mfrs' Association v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 563\n, 45 S.Ct. 578; Cement Mfrs' Protective Association v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 588\n, 45 S.Ct. 586; Chicago Board of Trade v. United States, \n246 \nU.S. 231\n, 38 S.Ct. 242; and the American Tobacco and Standard Oil cases, supra.\n But we do not think that line of cases is apposite. As clearly indicated in the Trenton Potteries case, the American Tobacco and Standard Oil cases have no application to combinations operating directly on prices or price structures.\n And we are of the opinion that Appalachian Coals, Inc., v. United States, supra, is not in point.\n In that case certain producers of bituminous coal created an exclusive selling agency for their coal. The agency was to establish standard classifications and sell the coal of its principals at the best prices obtainable. The occasion for the formation of the agency was the existence of certain so-called injurious practices and conditions in the industry. One of these was the problem of 'distress coal'-coal shipped to the market which was unsold at the time of delivery and therefore dumped on the market irrespective of demand. The agency was to promote the systematic study of the marketing and dis- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 215]\n\u00a0\n tribution of coal, its demand and consumption; to maintain an inspection and an engineering department to demonstrate to customers the advantages of this type of coal and to promote an extensive advertising campaign; to provide a research department to demonstrate proper and efficient methods of burning coal and thus to aid producers in their competition with substitute fuels; to operate a credit department dealing with the reliability of purchasers; and to make the sale of coal more economical. That agency was also to sell all the coal of its principals at the best prices obtainable and, if all could not be sold, to apportion orders upon a stated basis. And, save for certain stated exceptions, it was to determine the prices at which sales would be made without consultation with its principals. This Court concluded that so far as actual purpose was concerned, the defendant producers were engaged in a 'fair and open endeavor to aid the industry in a measurable recovery from its plight'. ( \n288 \nU.S. 344\n, 53 S.Ct. 478.) And it observed that the plan did not either contemplate or involve 'the fixing of market prices'; that defendants would not be able to fix the price of coal in the consuming markets; that their coal would continue to be subject to 'active competition'. To the contention that the plan would have a tendency to stabilize market prices and to raise them to a higher level, this Court replied (288 U.S. page 374, 53 S.Ct. page 479):\n'The fact that the correction of abuses may tend to stabilize a business, or to produce fairer price levels, does not mean that the abuses should go uncorrected or that co-operative endeavor to correct them necessarily constitutes an unreasonable restraint of trade. The intelligent conduct of commerce through the acquisition of full information of all relevant facts may properly be sought by the co- operation of those engaged in trade, although stabilization of trade and more reasonable prices may be the result.' \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 216]\n\u00a0\n In distinguishing the Trenton Potteries case this Court said (288 U.S. page 375, 53 S.Ct. page 479):\n\n'In the instant case there is, as we have seen, no intent or power to fix prices, abundant competitive opportunities will exist in all markets where defendants' coal is sold, and nothing has been shown to warrant the conclusion that defendants' plan will have an injurious effect upon competition in these markets.'\n\n Thus in reality the only essential thing in common between the instant case and the Appalachian Coals case is the presence in each of so- called demoralizing or injurious practices. The methods of dealing with them were quite divergent. In the instant case there were buying programs of distress gasoline which had as their direct purpose and aim the raising and maintenance of spot market prices and of prices to jobbers and consumers in the Mid-Western area, by the elimination of distress gasoline as a market factor. The increase in the spot market prices was to be accomplished by a well organized buying program on that market: regular ascertainment of the amounts of surplus gasoline; assignment of sellers among the buyers; regular purchases at prices which would place and keep a floor under the market. Unlike the plan in the instant case, the plan in the Appalachian Coals case was not designed to operate vis a vis the general consuming market and to fix the prices on that market. Furthermore, the effect, if any, of that plan on prices was not only wholly incidental but also highly conjectural. For the plan had not then been put into operation. Hence this Court expressly reserved jurisdiction in the District Court to take further proceedings if, inter alia, in 'actual operation' the plan proved to be 'an undue restraint upon interstate commerce'. And as we have seen it would per se constitute such a restraint if price-fixing were involved. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 217]\n\u00a0\n Nor are Maple Flooring Mfrs' Association v. United States and Cement Mfrs' Protective Association v. United States, supra, at all relevant to the problem at hand. For the systems there under attack were methods of gathering and distributing information respecting business operations. It was noted in those cases that there was not present any agreement for price-fixing. And they were decided, as indicated in the Trenton Potteries case, on the express assumption that any agreement for price-fixing would have been illegal per se. And since that element was lacking, the only issues were whether or not on the precise facts there presented such activities of the combinations constituted unlawful restraints of commerce. A majority of the Court held that they did not.\n Nor can respondents find sanction in Chicago Board of Trade v. United States, supra, for the buying programs here under attack. That case involved a prohibition on the members of the Chicago Board of Trade from purchasing or offering to purchase between the closing of the session and its opening the next day grains (under a special class of contracts) at a price other than the closing bid. The rule was somewhat akin to rules of an exchange limiting the period of trading, for as stated by this Court the 'restriction was upon the period of price-making'. (\n246 \nU.S. 231\n, 38 S. Ct. 244.) No attempt was made to show that the purpose or effect of the rule was to raise or depress prices. The rule affected only a small proportion of the commerce in question. And among its effects was the creation of a public market for grains under that special contract class, where prices were determined competitively and openly. Since it was not aimed at price manipulation or the control of the market prices and since it had 'no appreciable effect on general market prices', the rule survived as a reasonable restraint of trade.\n There was no deviation from the principle of the Trenton Potteries case in Sugar Institute, Inc., v. United States, \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 218]\n\u00a0\n supra. For in that case so-called competitive abuses were not permitted as defenses to violations of the Sherman Act bottomed on a trade association's efforts to create and maintain a uniform price structure.\n Thus for over forty years this Court has consistently and without deviation adhered to the principle that price-fixing agreements are unlawful per se under the Sherman Act and that no showing of so-called competitive abuses or evils which those agreements were designed to eliminate or alleviate may be interposed as a defense. And we reaffirmed that well established rule in clear and unequivocal terms in Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United States, \n309 \nU.S. 436\n, 60 S.Ct. 618, 626, 84 L.Ed . --, decided March 25, 1940, where we said:\n'Agreements for price maintenance of articles moving in interstate commerce are, without more, unreasonable restraints within the meaning of the Sherman Act because they eliminate competition, United States v. Trenton Potteries Co., \n273 \nU.S. 392\n, 47 S.Ct. 377, 50 A.L.R. 989, and agreements which create potential power for such price maintenance exhibited by its actual exertion for that purpose are in themselves unlawful restraints within the meaning of the Sherman Act, .... '\n\n Therefore the sole remaining question on this phase of the case is the applicability of the rule of the Trenton Potteries case to these facts.\n Respondents seek to distinguish the Trenton Potteries case from the instant one. They assert that in that case the parties substituted an agreed-on price for one determined by competition; that the defendants there had the power and purpose to suppress the play of competition in the determination of the market price; and therefore that the controlling factor in that decision was the destruction of market competition, not whether prices were higher or lower, reasonable or unreasonable. Respondents contend that in the instant case there was no elimination in the spot tank car market of competition \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 219]\n\u00a0\n which prevented the prices in that market from being made by the play of competition in sales between independent refiners and their jobber and consumer customers; that during the buying programs those prices were in fact determined by such competition; that the purchases under those programs were closely related to or dependent on the spot market prices; that there was no evidence that the purchases of distress gasoline under those programs had any effect on the competitive market price beyond that flowing from the removal of a competitive evil; and that if respondents had tried to do more than free competition from the effect of distress gasoline and to set an arbitrary non-competitive price through their purchases, they would have been without power to do so.\n But we do not deem those distinctions material.\n In the first place, there was abundant evidence that the combination had the purpose to raise prices. And likewise, there was ample evidence that the buying programs at least contributed to the price rise and the stability of the spot markets, and to increases in the price of gasoline sold in the Mid-Western area during the indictment period. That other factors also may have contributed to that rise and stability of the markets is immaterial. For in any such market movement, forces other than the purchasing power of the buyers normally would contribute to the price rise and the market stability. So far as cause and effect are concerned it is sufficient in this type of case if the buying programs of the combination resulted in a price rise and market stability which but for them would not have happened. For this reason the charge to the jury that the buying programs must have 'caused' the price rise and its continuance was more favorable to respondents than they could have required. Proof that there was a conspiracy, that its purpose was to raise prices, and that it caused or contributed to a price rise \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 220]\n\u00a0\n is proof of the actual consummation or execution of a conspiracy under  1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.A.  1.\n Secondly, the fact that sales on the spot markets were still governed by some competition is of no consequence. For it is indisputable that that competition was restricted through the removal by respondents of a part of the supply which but for the buying programs would have been a factor in determining the going prices on those markets. But the vice of the conspiracy was not merely the restriction of supply of gasoline by removal of a surplus. As we have said, this was a well organized program. The timing and strategic placement of the buying orders for distress gasoline played an important and significant role. Buying orders were carefully placed so as to remove the distress gasoline from weak hands. Purchases were timed. Sellers were assigned to the buyers so that regular outlets for distress gasoline would be available. The whole scheme was carefully planned and executed to the end that distress gasoline would not overhang the markets and depress them at any time. And as a result of the payment of fair going market prices a floor was placed and kept under the spot markets. Prices rose and jobbers and consumers in the Mid-Western area paid more for their gasoline than they would have paid but for the conspiracy. Competition was not eliminated from the markets; but it was clearly curtailed, since restriction of the supply of gasoline, the timing and placement of the purchases under the buying programs and the placing of a floor under the spot markets obviously reduced the play of the forces of supply and demand.\n The elimination of so-called competitive evils is no legal justification for such buying programs. The elimination of such conditions was sought primarily for its effect on the price structures. Fairer competitive prices, it is claimed, resulted when distress gasoline was removed from the market. But such defense is typical of the prot- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 221]\n\u00a0\n estations usually made in price-fixing cases. Ruinous competition, financial disaster, evils of price cutting and the like appear throughout our history as ostensible justifications for price-fixing. If the so- called competitive abuses were to be appraised here, the reasonableness of prices would necessarily become an issue in every price-fixing case. In that event the Sherman Act would soon be emasculated; its philosophy would be supplanted by one which is wholly alien to a system of free competition; it would not be the charter of freedom which its framers intended.\n The reasonableness of prices has no constancy due to the dynamic quality of the business facts underlying price structures. Those who fixed reasonable prices today would perpetuate unreasonable prices tomorrow, since those prices would not be subject to continuous administrative supervision and readjustment in light of changed conditions. Those who controlled the prices would control or effectively dominate the market. And those who were in that strategic position would have it in their power to destroy or drastically impair the competitive system. But the thrust of the rule is deeper and reaches more than monopoly power. Any combination which tampers with price structures is engaged in an unlawful activity. Even though the members of the price-fixing group were in no position to control the market, to the extent that they raised, lowered, or stabilized prices they would be directly interfering with the free play of market forces. The Act places all such schemes beyond the pale and protects that vital part of our economy against any degree of interference. Congress has not left with us the determination of whether or not particular price- fixing schemes are wise or unwise, healthy or destructive. It has not permitted the age-old cry of ruinous competition and competitive evils to be a defense to price-fixing conspiracies. It has no more allowed genuine or fancied \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 222]\n\u00a0\n competitive abuses as a legal justification for such schemes than it has the good intentions of the members of the combination. If such a shift is to be made, it must be done by the Congress. Certainly Congress has not left us with any such choice. Nor has the Act created or authorized the creation of any special exception in favor of the oil industry. Whatever may be its peculiar problems and characteristics, the Sherman Act, so far as price-fixing agreements are concerned, establishes one uniform rule applicable to all industries alike. There was accordingly no error in the refusal to charge that in order to convict the jury must find that the resultant prices were raised and maintained at 'high, arbitrary and non- competitive levels'. The charge in the indictment to that effect was surplusage.\n Nor is it important that the prices paid by the combination were not fixed in the sense that they were uniform and inflexible. Price-fixing as used in the Trenton Potteries case has no such limited meaning. An agreement to pay or charge rigid, uniform prices would be an illegal agreement under the Sherman Act. But so would agreements to raise or lower prices whatever machinery for price-fixing was used. That price-fixing includes more than the mere establishment of uniform prices is clearly evident from the Trenton Potteries case itself, where this Court noted with approval Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 375\n, 25 S.Ct. 276, in which a decree was affirmed which restrained a combination from 'raising or lowering prices or fixing uniform prices' at which meats will be sold. Hence prices are fixed within the meaning of the Trenton Potteries case if the range within which purchases or sales will be made is agreed upon, if the prices paid or charged are to be at a certain level or on ascending or descending scales, if they are to be uniform, or if by various formulae they are related to the market prices. They are fixed because they are agreed upon. And the \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 223]\n\u00a0\n fact that, as here, they are fixed at the fair going market price is immaterial. For purchases at or under the market are one species of price- fixing. In this case, the result was to place a floor under the market-a floor which served the function of increasing the stability and firmness of market prices. That was repeatedly characterized in this case as stabilization. But in terms of market operations stabilization is but one form of manipulation. And market manipulation in its various manifestations is implicitly an artificial stimulus applied to (or at times a brake on) market prices, a force which distorts those prices, a factor which prevents the determination of those prices by free competition alone. Respondents, however, argue that there was no correlation between the amount of gasoline which the major companies were buying and the trend of prices on the spot markets. They point to the fact that such purchasing was lightest during the period of the market rise in the spring of 1935, and heaviest in the summer and early fall of 1936 when the prices declined; and that it decreased later in 1936 when the prices rose. But those facts do not militate against the conclusion that these buying programs were a species of price-fixing or manipulation. Rather they are wholly consistent with the maintenance of a floor under the market or a stabilization operation of this type, since the need for purchases under such a program might well decrease as prices rose and increase as prices declined.\n As we have indicated, the machinery employed by a combination for price-fixing is immaterial.\n Under the Sherman Act a combination formed for the purpose and with the effect of raising, depressing, fixing, pegging, or stabilizing the price of a commodity in interstate or foreign commerce is illegal per se. Where the machinery for price-fixing is an agreement on the prices to be charged or paid for the commodity in the interstate or foreign channels of trade, the power to fix prices exists \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 224]\n\u00a0\n if the combination has control of a substantial part of the commerce in that commodity. Where the means for price-fixing are purchases or sales of the commodity in a market operation or, as here, purchases of a part of the supply of the commodity for the purpose of keeping it from having a depressive effect on the markets, such power may be found to exist though the combination does not control a substantial part of the commodity. In such a case that power may be established if as a result of market conditions, the resources available to the combinations, the timing and the strategic placement of orders and the like, effective means are at hand to accomplish the desired objective. But there may be effective influence over the market though the group in question does not control it. Price-fixing agreements may have utility to members of the group though the power possessed or exerted falls far short of domination and control. Monopoly power (United States v. Patten, \n226 \nU.S. 525\n, 33 S.Ct. 141, 44 L.R.A.,N.S., 325) is not the only power which the Act strikes down, as we have said. Proof that a combination was formed for the purpose of fixing prices and that it caused them to be fixed or contributed to that result is proof of the completion of a price-fixing conspiracy under  1 of the Act. \n59\n The indictment in this case charged that this combination had that purpose and effect. And there was abundant evidence to support it. Hence the existence of power on the part of members of the combination to fix prices was but a conclusion from the finding that the buying programs caused or contributed to the rise and stability of prices. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 225]\n\u00a0\n As to knowledge or acquiescence of officers of the Federal government little need be said. The fact that Congress through utilization of the precise methods here employed could seek to reach the same objective sought by respondents does not mean that respondents or any other \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 226]\n\u00a0\n group may do so without specific Congressional authority. Admittedly no approval of the buying programs was obtained under the National Industrial Recovery Act prior to its termination on June 16, 1935, ( 2(c) which would give immunity to respondents from prosecution under the Sherman Act. Though employees of the government may have known of those programs and winked at them or tacitly approved them, no immunity would have thereby been obtained. For Congress had specified the precise \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 227]\n\u00a0\n manner and method of securing immunity. None other would suffice. Otherwise national policy on such grave and important issues as this would be determined not by Congress nor by those to whom Congress had delegated authority but by virtual volunteers. The method adopted by Congress for alleviating the penalties of the Sherman Act through approval by designated public representatives60 would be supplanted by a foreign system. But even had approval been obtained for the buying programs, that approval would not have survived the expiration in June 1935 of the Act which was the source of that approval. As we have seen the buying program continued unabated during the balance of 1935 and far into 1936. As we said in United States v. Borden Co., \n308 \nU.S. 188, 202\n, 60 S.Ct. 182, 190, 'A conspiracy thus continued is in effect renewed during each day of its continuance.' Hence, approval or knowledge and acquiescence of federal authorities prior to June 1935 could have no relevancy to respondents' activities subsequent thereto. The fact that the buying programs may have been consistent with the \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 228]\n\u00a0\n general objectives and ends sought to be obtained under the National Industrial Recovery Act is likewise irrelevant to the legality under the Sherman Act of respondents' activities either prior to or after June 1935. For as we have seen price-fixing combinations which lack Congressional sanction are illegal per se; they are not evaluated in terms of their purpose, aim or effect in the elimination of so-called competitive evils. Only in the event that they were, would such considerations have been relevant.\n Accordingly we conclude that the Circuit Court of Appeals erred in reversing the judgments on this ground. A fortiori the position taken by respondents in their cross petition that they were entitled to directed verdicts of acquittal is untenable.\n B. Respondents' Offers of Proof.\n What we have said disposes of most of the errors alleged in exclusion of evidence. The offers of proof covering the background and operation of the National Industrial Recovery Act and the Petroleum Code, the condition of the oil industry, the alleged encouragement, cooperation and acquiescence of the Federal Petroleum Administration in the buying programs and the like were properly excluded, insofar as they bore on the nature of the restraint and the purpose or end sought to be attained. For as we have seen the reasonableness of the restraint was not properly an issue in the case.\n There were, however, offers of proof alleged to be relevant to the cause of the price rise and the subsequent stability of the markets during the period in question.\n In addition to the foregoing offers, respondents sought to show that the presence of hot oil and hot gasoline had greatly depressed the market from 1932 to early in 1935 when the Connally Act became effective, except for \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 229]\n\u00a0\n one short period from October to December 1934; that beginning in October 1934 shipment of hot oil from East Texas into interstate commerce had for the first time been effectively controlled; that within a period of six weeks thereafter the tank car spot market rose 1 1\/2\u00f5-an amount corresponding to the price rise from March to June 1935; that the various factors which primarily affect price were almost precisely the same in the fall of 1934 as they were in the spring of 1935; that the price of gasoline had borne a constant relationship to the price of crude oil from January 1918 to October 1933-that relationship disappearing when the price of hot oil fell below legal crude but reappearing in October 1934, and again in March 1935, when hot oil was eliminated; that gasoline prices were more depressed than the prices of other commodities and the cost of living in 1933 and 1934, and recovered and rose less than such other prices and the cost of living in 1935 and 1936.\n We think there was no reversible error in exclusion of these various offers.\n To the extent that they were designed to show that respondents by their buying programs had not raised the spot market prices to an artificial and non-competitive level, these offers of proof were properly denied as immaterial. For, as we have said, the reasonableness of the prices and the fact that respondents' activities merely removed from the market the depressive effect of distress gasoline were not relevant to the issues.\n And to the extent that these offers of proof were aimed at establishing and evaluating other contributory causes for the price rise and market stability during the indictment period, they were not improperly denied. In the first place, the record is replete with evidence showing the condition of the oil industry at the time of the adoption of the code and during the code period. There was \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 230]\n\u00a0\n ample testimony bearing on the other causal factors which respondents contend were primarily responsible for the price rise and market stability during the indictment period. Much of the refused testimony was merely cumulative in nature. A trial court has wide discretion in a situation of that kind. The trial lasted about three and a half months. Terminal points are necessary even in a conspiracy trial involving intricate business facts and legal issues. In the second place, the offer to show the market conditions late in 1934 when hot oil was temporarily under control was not improperly denied. There was substantial evidence in the record to demonstrate the depressive market effect of hot oil. While the offer was not wholly irrelevant to the issues, it was clearly collateral. The trial court has a wide range for discretion in the exclusion of such evidence. See Golden Reward Mining Co. v. Buxton Mining Co., 8 Cir., 97 F. 413, 416, 417; Chesterfield Mfg. Co. v. Leota Cotton Mills, 8 Cir., 194 F. 358, 359. Admission of testimony showing the market conditions late in 1934 would have opened an inquiry into causal factors as involved and interrelated as those present during the indictment period. That might have confused rather than enlightened the jury. In any event it would not have eliminated the buying programs as contributory causes to the market rise and stability in 1935 and 1936. And it would have prolonged the inquiry and protracted the trial. As once stated by Mr. Justice Holmes, one objection to the introduction of collateral issues is a 'purely practical one,-a concession to the shortness of life.' Reeve v. Dennett, 145 Mass. 23, 28, 11 N.E. 938, 944. And see Union Stock Yard & Transit Co. v. United States, \n308 \nU.S. 213, 223\n, 224 S., 60 S.Ct. 193, 197, 198. Similar reasons sustain the action of the trial court in limiting the inquiry into general economic conditions antedating and during the indictment period. In conclusion, we do not think that there was an abuse of discretion by the \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 231]\n\u00a0\n trial court in the exclusion of the proffered evidence. A great mass of evidence was received, the range of inquiry was wide, the factual questions relating to the oil industry and respondents' activities were intricate and involved. In such a case a new trial will not be ordered for alleged errors in exclusion of evidence where matters of substance are not affected. See United States v. Trenton Potteries Co., supra, 273 U.S. page 404, 47 S.Ct. page 382, 50 A.L.R. 989.\nVI. Use of The Grand Jury Transcript.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the trial court committed prejudicial error in refusing to permit defense counsel to inspect the transcript of grand jury testimony used to refresh the recollection of certain witnesses called by the government. Respondents here urge that the use made of the grand jury transcript was error because (1) they were denied the right to inspect it, (2) it had not been properly authenticated , (3) the reading of the grand jury testimony must have led the jury to conclude that it was affirmative testimony, and (4) such testimony was not given contemporaneously with the occurrences to which it was related. And in all respects, respondents contend that such use of the grand jury testimony was highly prejudicial.\n There were about 90 instances when the government used that testimony. In practically all those cases, the witnesses were employees or representatives of respondents or former defendants, or were closely associated with them. That most of them were hostile witnesses-evasive and reluctant to testify-clearly appears from a reading of their entire testimony. Each of those witnesses had testified before the grand jury which returned the indictment in the case. At times counsel for the government would state to the court that he was surprised at the witness' answer to a question and that it contradicted testimony before the grand jury. More frequently \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 232]\n\u00a0\n counsel would ask the witness if his memory could be refreshed by his grand jury testimony. During the first part of the trial government counsel apparently read some grand jury testimony to two witnesses from his notes. After objection had been made, the court instructed counsel to use the transcript. Soon thereafter, and early in the trial, the court adopted the practice of inspecting the transcript and itself seeking to refresh the witness' recollection by reading from his prior testimony. At no time was the transcript shown to the witness. At all times respondents appropriately objected to the practice.\n Throughout the trial the stated single reason for the use of such prior testimony was the refreshment of the witness' recollection. Counsel for the defense were ever alert to denounce the practice, especially when it appeared that government counsel might seek to impeach the witness. In such cases the court normally would sustain the objection or admonish government counsel; or the question and answer would be stricken. In many instances where such testimony was used, the incident ended by the witness merely saying that his recollection had not been refreshed. In case it had been, he would state what his present recollection was. Only in about one- sixth of the instances was any inconsistency in testimony developed. In the balance, recollection was either not refreshed or the testimony which had been given was wholly or substantially consistent with the previous grand jury testimony.\n During the trial the court told the jury:\n'I have used some of the testimony and read some of it for the purpose only of refreshing the witnesses' memories, and many times I have indicated that there was no conflict or nothing inconsistent between the testimony of the witness and the transcript of testimony. The only reason we use this transcript of testimony of each witness before the Grand Jury is to, if we can, refresh their \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 233]\n\u00a0\n memories so as to enable them to recall correctly what the fact is.'\n\n And the court made a similar statement in its charge to the jury.\n As in case of leading questions, St. Clair v. United States, \n154 \nU.S. 134, 150\n, 14 S.Ct. 1002, 1008, such use of grand jury testimony for the purpose of refreshing the recollection of a witness rests in the sound discretion of the trial judge. See Di Carlo v. United States, 2 Cir., 6 F.2d 364, 367, 368; Bosselman v. United States, 2 Cir., 239 F. 82, 85; Felder v. United States, 2 Cir., 9 F.2d 872. He sees the witness, can appraise his hostility, recalcitrance, and evasiveness or his need for some refreshing material, and can determine whether or not under all the circumstances the use of grand jury minutes is necessary or appropriate for refreshing his recollection. As once stated by Judge Hough, 'The bald fact that the memory refreshing words are found in the records of a grand jury is not a valid objection.' Felder v. United States, supra, 9 F.2d page 874. Normally, of course, the material so used must be shown to opposing counsel upon demand, if it is handed to the witness. Morris v. United States, 5 Cir., 149 F. 123, 126, 9 Ann.Cas. 558; Lennon v. United States, 8 Cir., 20 F.2d 490, 493, 494; Wigmore, Evidence (2d ed.)  762. And the reasons are that only in that way can opposing counsel avoid the risks of imposition on and improper communication with the witness, and 'detect circumstances not appearing on the surface' and 'expose all that detracts from the weight of testimony.' See 2 Wigmore, supra, p. 42. The first of these reasons has no relevancy here. And as to the second, no iron-clad rule requires that opposing counsel be shown the grand jury transcript where it is not shown the witness and where some appropriate procedure is adopted to prevent its improper use. That again is a matter which rests in the sound discretion of the court. Grand jury testimony is ordinarily confidential. See Wigmore, supra,  2362. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 234]\n\u00a0\n But after the grand jury's functions are ended, disclosure is wholly proper where the ends of justice require it. See Metzler v. United States, 9 Cir., 64 F.2d 203, 206. Since there is no inexorable rule which under all circumstances entitles the witness and his counsel to see the prior statement made under oath and since in this case the court itself examined and thus directly controlled the use of the grand jury testimony, we cannot say that the refusal to make it available to counsel for the defense is per se reversible error. To hold that it was error in the instances here under review would be to find abuse of discretion, where in fact we conclude from the entire record on this phase of the case that the judge supervised the procedure with commendable fairness. In sum, the selective use of this testimony and the precautions taken by the trial judge make it impossible for us to say that he transcended the limits of sound discretion in permitting it to be used by the government without making it available to the defense.\n If the record showed that the refreshing material was deliberately used for purposes not material to the issues but to arouse the passions of the jurors, so that an objective appraisal of the evidence was unlikely, there would be reversible error. Likewise there would be error where under the pretext of refreshing a witness' recollection, the prior testimony was introduced as evidence. Rosenthal v. United States, 8 Cir., 248 F. 684, 686. But here the grand jury testimony was used simply to refresh the recollection on material facts, New York & Colorado Mining Syndicate & Co. v. Fraser, \n130 \nU.S. 611\n, 9 S.Ct. 665, not as independent affirmative evidence. Bates v. Preble, \n151 \nU.S. 149\n, 14 S.Ct. 277. Furthermore, it was not used for impeachment purposes; and the content of this refreshing material related solely to conversations and events relevant to the formation and execution of the buying programs. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 235]\n\u00a0\n In addition, it clearly appears that the use of this material was not prejudicial. So far as the subject matter of the inquiry is concerned, that prior testimony was either cumulative or dealt only with the minutiae of the conspiracy. The record minus that testimony clearly establishes all the facts necessary for proof of the illegal conspiracy. No portion of it was dependent on the minor facts concerning which the memory of these witnesses was refreshed. \n61\n Hence, the situation is vastly different from those cases where essential ingredients of the crime were dependent on testimony elicited in that manner or where the evidence of guilt hung in delicate balance if that testimony was deleted. See Little v. United States, 8 Cir., 93 F.2d 401; Putnam v. United States, \n162 \nU.S. 687\n, 16 S. Ct. 923. Hence assuming arguendo, that there was error in the use of the prior testimony, to order a new trial would be to violate the standards of  269 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A.  391, since the 'substantial rights' of respondents were not affected. There are no vested individual rights in the ordinary rules of evidence; their observance should not be reduced to an idle ceremony. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 236]\n\u00a0\n Putnam v. United States, supra, held it was prejudicial error to use grand jury minutes to refresh the memory of a witness unless that testimony was contemporaneous with the occurrences as to which the witness was testifying. There the testimony before the grand jury was more than four months after the occurrence. This Court held that because of that lapse of time the testimony was not contemporaneous. Whatever may be said of the Putnam case on the merits (see Wigmore, supra,  761) it does not establish an inflexible four-months' period of limitation. There the event was a single isolated conversation, most damaging to the defendant. Here there was a continuing conspiracy extending at least up to the period when the witnesses were testifying before the grand jury. Much of the testimony related to events a year or more old. But in the main those matters were woven into the conspiracy, related to events in which the witness actively participated, concerned the regular business matters with which he was familiar, pertained to his regular employment, or constituted admissions against interest. On these facts we do not think there was an abuse of discretion on the part of the trial judge in permitting the testimony to be used. Measured by the test of whether or not the prior statement made under oath was reasonably calculated to revive the witness' present recollection within the rule of the Putnam case, there certainly cannot be said to have been error as a matter of law.\n Respondents say that the manner employed in refreshing the recollection of the witnesses was bound to inculcate in the minds of the jurors the feeling that the witnesses were testifying falsely or were concealing the truth. But here again, we find no reversible error. The trial judge, as we have said, was alert to stop impeachment. And in view of the obvious hostility and evasiveness of most of those witnesses, we cannot say that the judge transcended the bounds of discretion in permitting \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 237]\n\u00a0\n their memories to be refreshed in this manner. 'As is true of most that takes place in a trial, the right result is a matter of degree, and depends upon the sense of measure of the judge.' See United States v. Freundlich, 2 Cir., 95 F.2d 376, 379.\nVII. Arguments to the Jury by Government Counsel.\n Respondents complain of certain statements made to the jury by government counsel. Their objections are that government counsel (1) appealed to class prejudice; and (2) requested a conviction regardless of the evidence because the prosecution was convinced of respondents' guilt and because a conviction 'was the wish and the desire of the highest officials in the Government of the United States.'\n Under the first of these, they point to the opening statement that this conspiracy involved some of the 'biggest men' in the country-big in the sense of 'controlling vast volumes of financial influence'; and that it is a 'terrible thing that a group of influential, wealthy millionaires or billionaires should take over the power, take over the control, the power to make prices.' At the close of those opening remarks and on objection of defense counsel the court counselled the jury that 'any reference to the wealth of any of the defendants is entirely immaterial. A man of wealth has just as much standing in a court as a man that is poverty stricken.'\n But respondents complain that in the closing arguments the same matter was referred to again as follows: 'A hundred lawyers employed-the very cream of the American Bar, the very best legal talent that these people can obtain-every one of them working night and day with suggestions as to how the red herring can be drawn across the clear cut issue in this case'; that it should not be taken for granted 'that these more powerful people are above the law and can't be reached and \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 238]\n\u00a0\n can't be brought to book'; that the 'fear of corporate power in combination' is part of the American tradition as illustrated by a speech made in 1873 by a Wisconsin judge, who said: 'There is looming up a new and dark power ... The accumulation of individual wealth seems to be greater than it ever has been since the downfall of the Roman Empire. The enterprises of the country are ... coldly marching, not for economic conquests only, but for political power ... money is taking the field as an organized power. The question will arise ... which shall rule, wealth or man? Which shall lead, money or intellect? Who shall fill the public stations, educated and patriotic free men, or the futile serfs of corporate capital?' But as to these statements no objection was made at the time by defense counsel.\n There were other such references e.g., 'malefactors of great wealth', 'eager, grasping men' or corporations who 'take the law into their own hands ... without any consideration for the underdog or the poor man ... We are going to stop it, as our forefathers stopped it before us and left this country with us as it is now, or we are going down into ruin as did the Roman Empire.' Counsel for the defense objected to these statements as improper and prejudicial. The court overruled the objections stating it would deal with the matter in its charge to the jury. In its charge the court warned against convicting a corporation 'solely because of its size or the extent of its business'; that it was 'your duty to give these corporations the same impartial consideration' as an individual or small corporation would receive; and instructed the jurors not to be concerned 'with the financial condition of any of these defendants. Whether a man be rich or poor, he is entitled to the same consideration in this Court.'\n On this phase of the matter several observations are pertinent. In the first place, counsel for the defense \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 239]\n\u00a0\n cannot as a rule remain silent, interpose no objections, and after a verdict has been returned seize for the first time on the point that the comments to the jury were improper and prejudicial. See Crumpton v. United States, \n138 \nU.S. 361, 364\n, 11 S.Ct. 355, 356. Of course appellate courts 'in the public interest, may, of their own motion, notice errors to which no exception has been taken, if the errors are obvious, or if they otherwise seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.' See United States v. Atkinson, \n297 \nU.S. 157, 160\n, 56 S.Ct. 391, 392. But as we point out hereafter, the exceptional circumstances which call for an invocation of that rule are not present here. In the second place, it is not improper in a Sherman Act case to discuss corporate power, its use and abuse, so long as those statements are relevant to the issues at hand. For that subject is material to the philosophy of that Act. Its purposes and objectives are clearly legitimate subjects for discussion before the jury. But, thirdly, appeals to class prejudice are highly improper and cannot be condoned and trial courts should ever be alert to prevent them. Some of the statements to which respondents now object fall in this class. They were, we think, undignified and intemperate. They do not comport with the standards of propriety to be expected of the prosecutor. But it is quite another thing to say that these statements constituted prejudicial error. In the first place, it is hard for us to imagine that the minds of the jurors would be so influenced by such incidental statements during this long trial that they would not appraise the evidence objectively and dispassionately. In the second place, this was not a weak case as was Berger v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 78\n, 55 S.Ct. 629, where this Court held that prejudice to the accused was so highly probable as a result of the prosecutor's improper conduct 'that we are not justified in assuming its nonexistence.' 295 U.S. page 89, 55 S.Ct. page 633. Cf. New York Central Railroad Co. v. Johnson, 279 \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 240]\n\u00a0\n U.S. 310, 49 S.Ct. 300. Of course, appeals to passion and prejudice may so poison the minds of jurors even in a strong case that an accused may be deprived of a fair trial. But each case necessarily turns on its own facts. And where, as here, the record convinces us that these statements were minor aberrations in a prolonged trial and not cumulative evidence of a proceeding dominated by passion and prejudice, reversal would not promote the ends of justice.\n Under the second of these objections, respondents complain of the plea to the jury not to 'let your Government and the United States and its citizens and society down', and that government counsel 'believe to the bottom of their hearts in the justice of the cause that they espouse here'. No objection at that time was made by defense counsel. But they did object at the trial to the statements by government counsel, '... do you honestly think that these boys here (government counsel) ... would be trying to convict these men unless that was the wish and the desire of the highest officials in the government of the United States?'; 'You don't think the government of the United States would allow four or five lawyers to come out here and prosecute this case against them, against their wishes, or that the Secretary of the Department of the Interior would allow us to do it, if he didn't want it done?' The court overruled the objections stating, 'I suppose we have a right to assume that they are here under the instructions of the Attorney General of the United States.' Respondents further complain of the statements that the evidence is 'so overwhelming and overpowering that it doesn't even leave the trace or the shadow of a doubt'; that if 'you are going to say they are not guilty on this evidence, then you take the responsibility, I won't; you get an alibi, I won't'; that the hundreds of thousands of dollars spent by the government 'in trying to get before you the facts' should not be \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 241]\n\u00a0\n 'thrown to the winds' nor should these men 'go clear'. But no objection was made at the time by defense counsel.\n As respects the statement that it was the 'wish and the desire of the highest officials' in the government to have defendants convicted, some background should be given. This came near the end of the closing arguments. In the opening statement, during the trial, and in the closing arguments the defense continuously emphasized the knowledge and acquiescence by government officials of the buying programs. As we have noted, that was one of the main lines of defense. From the beginning of the trial to the end, the defense sought to prove, not official approval in the legal sense, but official acquiescence or at least condonation. Bald statements were made that respondents 'were conducting a program which resulted from the instigation and inducement of the Government itself'; after the Schechter case they endeavored to 'stabilize marketing practices' at the 'instance of officials of the Oil Administration'; 'what was done by these defendants was done for the purpose of accomplishing the objective and purposes of the National Industrial Recovery Act, and was undertaken at the request and pursuant to the authorization of the Secretary of the Interior, Mr. Ickes, the Administrator of the Petroleum Code'; respondents 'acted to carry out the purposes and objectives sought by the Government and initiated by the Government. ... They were objectives defined by the President of the United States. They were purposes, the accomplishment of which the Secretary of the Interior had been charged, under his oath, to seek to obtain'; 'with all this backing and all this help from the government, and all this urging from the government, are you going to brand these men as just selfish individuals?' On innumerable instances the impression was sought to be conveyed by subtle intimation, inference or suggestion \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 242]\n\u00a0\n that responsibility for these buying programs should be placed on the shoulders of high government officials. Government counsel accordingly justified his statement on the grounds that it denied what the defense had continuously stated, viz., that the buying programs were conducted with the consent and approval of the Secretary of the Interior. At a subsequent point in the closing arguments government counsel again referred to the matter. On objection of defense counsel he withdrew the statement. And the court instructed the jury to disregard it, saying 'This prosecution was commenced at the instigation of the Attorney General of the United States.'\n In view of these various circumstances we do not think that the above statements were prejudicial. Standing by themselves they appear to be highly improper. Even as a rebuttal to the defense which had been interposed throughout the trial, they overstep the bounds. But in view of the justification which respondents sought to establish for their acts, the subject matter of these statements was certainly relevant. The fact that government counsel transgressed in his rebuttal certainly cannot be said to constitute prejudicial error. For a reading of the entire argument before the jury leads to the firm conviction that the comments which respondents now rely on for their assertions of error were isolated, casual episodes in a long summation of over 200 printed pages and not at all reflective of the quality of the argument as a whole.\n Respondents further urge as prejudicial error the assertions by government counsel of personal knowledge in contradiction of the record for the purpose of discrediting an important defense witness. The statement of government counsel was that in '1935 and 1936, you couldn't get a rowboat up the Mississippi River, north of Winona.' Respondents contend that testimony as to navigability of that river was vitally material as establishing such outside competition as would have prevented them from \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 243]\n\u00a0\n raising prices to artificial and non-competitive levels. But such testimony was wholly irrelevant, since the reasonableness of the prices was not properly an issue in the case. Furthermore, when objection was made to the remark, counsel withdrew it and the jury was instructed to disregard it. That must be deemed to have cured the error if it could be considered such. As stated in Dunlop v. United States, \n165 \nU.S. 486, 498\n, 17 S.Ct. 375, 379, 'If every remark made by counsel outside of the testimony were ground for a reversal, comparatively few verdicts would stand.'\nVIII. Granting of New Trials to Some Defendants.\n Respondents contend that the trial court committed reversible error in granting new trials to some defendants and denying them to respondents.\n The court charged the jury that it could convict any of the defendants found to have been members of the combination and that it need not convict all or none. As has been noted, the jury found sixteen corporations and thirty individuals guilty. Thereafter the court discharged one corporation and ten individuals, and granted new trials to three corporations and fifteen individuals. Such action left the verdict standing as to only twelve corporations and five individuals. The trial court gave as its reason for granting some of the defendants a new trial its belief that they had not had 'an adequate separate consideration of their defense, in view of the fact that as to some of them direct evidence of participation was lacking or slight, and the circumstantial evidence viewed as a whole may well have obscured other facts and circumstances shown, in some cases, to be highly suggestive of innocence, and in all cases entitled to be considered and weighed.' United States v. Standard Oil Company (Indiana), D.C., 23 F.Supp. 937, 939. In denying the motions of respondents for a new trial it stated (page 944) that there was 'evidence to go to the jury and to sustain \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 244]\n\u00a0\n its verdict as to every essential charge in the indictment' as to them. \n62\n\u00a0\n\n Respondents' argument runs as follows: The court charged the jury that it was the purpose and the power of the combination to raise prices which were material. Hence the fact that the jury found that the entire group possessed such power does not necessarily mean that the jury would have found that respondents action alone possessed such power. Since the jury did not consider that issue, it is argued that denial of a new trial to respondents violates their constitutional right to a jury trial. And \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 245]\n\u00a0\n in support of their contention, respondents insist that Standard of Indiana alone (one of the defendants granted a new trial) possessed such power as would make it impossible for them to raise prices without its agreement and cooperation.\n Respondents' argument does not focus sharply the basic and essential elements of the offense and of the instructions to the jury. As we have stated above, the offense charged in this indictment was proved once it was established that any of the defendants conspired to fix prices through the buying programs and that those programs caused or contributed to the price rise. Power of the combination to fix prices was therefore but a conclusion from the fact that the combination did fix prices. Hence in that posture of the case, the issue here is whether or not the finding of the jury that the buying programs affected prices was necessarily dependent on the participation in those programs of all who were convicted.\n Obviously it was not. The order granting new trials in no manner impeached or questioned the evidence as to the total spot market purchases made by all companies (whether defendants, co-conspirators or others). Cf. Bartkus v. United States, 7 Cir., 21 F.2d 425. In their efforts to place a floor under the spot markets respondents assuredly received benefits and assistance from the purchases made by other companies. And the amount of benefit and assistance received did not necessarily depend on whether or not those other companies were co-conspirators. Market manipulators commonly obtain assistance from the activities of the innocent as well as from those of their allies. The fact that they may capitalize on the purchases of others is no more significant than the fact that they may gain direct or collateral benefits from market trends, bullish factors or fortuitous circumstances. And the mere fact that those circumstances \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 246]\n\u00a0\n might have changed and that Standard of Indiana, say, might have substantially impaired the effect of the buying programs on prices by a change in its retail policies was as irrelevant as was the chance that the Connally Act might have been repealed. The effect of the concerted activities was not rebutted by the fact that changes in events might have destroyed that effect.\n Nor did the case against respondents automatically fall when three of the corporate defendants63 were awarded a new trial. We have here a situation quite different from that where the participation of those to whom a new trial was granted or against whom the judgment of conviction was reversed was necessary for the existence of the crime charged. See Gebardi v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 112\n, 53 S.Ct. 35, 84 A.L. R. 370; Morrison v. California, \n291 \nU.S. 82\n, 54 S.Ct. 281; King v. Plummer (1902), 2 K.B. 339. In this case the crime was not indivisible (cf. Queen v. Gompertz, 9 A. & E., N.S., 824; Feder v. United States, 2 Cir., 257 F. 694, 5 A.L.R. 370) in the sense that the existence of a conspiracy under the Sherman Act was necessarily dependent on the cooperation of the other defendants with respondents. Nor was the case submitted to the jury on the assumption that the participation of any of the corporations which were granted new trials was indispensable to the finding of a conspiracy among the rest. As we have seen, the court charged that the jury could convict any of the defendants found to have been members of the combination and that it need not convict all or none. It was the existence of a combination and the participation in it of all or some of the defendants which were important, not the identity of each \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 247]\n\u00a0\n and every participant. A conspiracy under the Sherman Act may embrace two or more individuals or corporations. Conviction of some need not await the apprehension and conviction of all. The erroneous conviction of one does not necessarily rebut the finding that the others participated. The theory of the charge to the jury was not that the defendants must be convicted, if at all, as a body; rather the issue of guilt was distributive; the identity of all the co-conspirators was irrelevant.\n In a Sherman Act case, as in other conspiracy cases, the grant of a new trial to some defendants and its denial to others is not per se reversible error. After the jury's verdict has been set aside as respects some of the alleged co-conspirators, the remaining ones cannot seize on that action as grounds for the granting of a new trial to them, unless they can establish that such action was so clearly prejudicial to them that the denial of their motions constituted a plain abuse of discretion. See Dufour v. United States, 37 App.D.C. 497, 510, 511; State v. Christianson, 131 Minn. 276, 280, 154 N.W. 1095; Commonwealth v. Bruno, 324 Pa. 236, 248, 188 A. 320; People v. Kuland, 266 N.Y. 1, 193 N.E. 439, 97 A.L.R. 1311; Browne v. United States, 2 Cir., 145 F. 1. There is a complete lack of any showing of abuse of discretion here, for no prejudice has been established.\n Hence this case falls within the well established rule that neither this Court nor the Circuit Court of Appeals will review the action of a federal trial court in granting or denying a motion for a new trial for error of fact, since such action is a matter within the discretion of the trial court. Fairmount Glass Works v. Cub Fork Coal Co., \n287 \nU.S. 474\n, 53 S.Ct. 252. Certain exceptions have been noted, such as instances where the trial court has 'erroneously excluded from consideration matters which were appropriate to a decision on the motion'. Fairmount Glass Works v. Cub Fork Coal Co., supra, 287 U.S. page 483, 53 S. Ct. page 255. But there \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 248]\n\u00a0\n are no such circumstances here. No iota of evidence has been adduced that the trial court in denying respondents' motions failed to take into consideration the effect of the buying programs on gasoline prices in the Mid-Western area. In fact it seems apparent that the trial court considered that issue and ruled thereon adversely to respondents. It concluded in substance that whoever may have been all the members of the conspiracy, there was ample evidence to go to the jury on the nature and effect of these programs.\n Certainly, denial of a motion for a new trial on the grounds that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence would not be subject to review. Moore v. United States, \n150 \nU.S. 57, 61\n, 62 S., 14 S.Ct. 26, 28; J. W. Bishop Co. v. Shelhorse, 4 Cir., 141 F. 643, 648; O'Donnell v. New York Transp. Co., 2 Cir., 187 F. 109, 110. In substance no more than that is involved here.\nIX. Variance.\n By their cross petition respondents contend that there was a fatal variance between the agreement charged in the indictment and the agreement proved, with a consequent violation of respondents' rights under the Sixth Amendment.\n As we have noted, certain trade journals were made defendants. The indictment charged that they were 'the chief agencies and instrumentalities' through which the illegally raised prices affected prices paid for gasoline in the Mid-Western area; that they 'knowingly published and circulated as such price quotations the wrongfully and artificially raised and fixed prices for gasoline paid by' defendants in the buying programs while 'representing the price quotations published by them' to be gasoline prices 'prevailing in spot sales to jobbers in tank car lots' and while 'knowing and intending them to be relied on as such by jobbers and to be made the basis of prices to jobbers'. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 249]\n\u00a0\n At the close of the government's case the indictment was dismissed, on motion of the government, as against all trade journal defendants who went to trial. This was clearly proper, as the evidence adduced exculpated them from any wrongdoing. But respondents contend that the device charged in the indictment was one by which respondents were to pay higher than the actual spot market prices for their purchases and then to substitute in the trade journal quotations such prices for the lower prices actually paid by jobbers in spot market sales. Since there was failure of proof on this point of falsification, it is argued that there was a variance. For, according to respondents, that feature was an integral and essential part of the plan as charged.\n We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that there was no variance. Analysis of the indictment which we have set forth, supra, 60 S.Ct. pp. 819-821, makes it clear that the charge against respondents was separate from and independent of the charge against the trade journals and that the allegations against those journals constituted not the only means by which the conspiracy was to be effectuated but only one of several means (supra, 60 S.Ct. pp. 819, 820). In effect, those charges in the indictment sought to connect the trade journals with the conspiracy as aiders and abettors. On the other hand, the gist of the indictment charged a conspiracy by defendants (1) to raise and fix the spot market prices and (2) thereby to raise and fix the prices in the Mid-Western area. So far as means and methods of accomplishing those objectives were concerned, the charge of falsification of the trade journal quotations was as unessential as was the charge, likewise unproved, that defendants caused the independent refiners to curtail their production. The purpose and effect of the buying programs in raising and fixing prices were in no way made dependent on the utilization of fraudulent trade journal quotations. As charged, the trade journals \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 250]\n\u00a0\n were the chief instrumentalities by which the spot market prices were converted into prices in the Mid-Western area. Hence under this indictment they were wholly effective for respondents' purposes, though they were innocent and though their quotations were not falsified as charged. A variation between the means charged and the means utilized is not fatal. And where an indictment charges various means by which the conspiracy is effectuated, not all of them need be proved. See Nash v. United States, \n229 \nU.S. 373, 380\n, 33 S.Ct. 780, 782. Cf. Boyle v. United States, 7 Cir., 259 F. 803, 805.\nX. Jurisdiction.\n The Sixth Amendment provides that the accused shall be tried 'by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed.' Respondents contend that the district court for the Western District of Wisconsin had no jurisdiction or venue to try them since the crime was not committed in that district. The Circuit Court of Appeals held to the contrary, one judge dissenting.\n As we have noted, the indictment charged that the defendants (1) conspired together to raise and fix the prices on the spot markets; (2) raised, fixed, and maintained those prices at artificially high and non- competitive levels and 'thereby intentionally increased and fixed the tank car prices of gasoline contracted to be sold and sold in interstate commerce as aforesaid in the Mid-Western area (including the Western District of Wisconsin)'; (3) have 'exacted large sums of money from thousands of jobbers' in the Mid-Western area by reason of the provisions of the prevailing form of jobber contracts which made the price to the jobber dependent on the average spot market price; and (4) 'in turn have intentionally raised the general level of retail prices prevailing in said Mid-Western area.' \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 251]\n\u00a0\n As we have seen, there was substantial competent evidence that the buying programs resulted in an increase of spot market prices, of prices to jobbers and of retail prices in the Mid-Western area. And it is clear that certain corporate respondents sold gasoline during this period in the Mid-Western area at the increased prices. The court charged the jury that even though they found that defendants had the purpose and power to raise the spot market prices, they must acquit the defendants unless they also found and believed beyond a reasonable doubt that defendants 'have also intentionally raised and fixed the tank car price of gasoline contracted to be sold and which was sold in interstate commerce in the Mid-Western area, including the Western District of Wisconsin.' It also charged that it was not enough 'for the prosecution to show an increase in the tank car prices of gasoline within said area, but you must also find and believe beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty that the defendants combined and conspired together or with others for the purpose of increasing and fixing the same as well as for the purpose of raising and fixing the tank car prices in said spot markets, or one or more of them.' It further charged that the jury in order to convict must find some overt acts in the Western District of Wisconsin; and that sales of gasoline therein by any of the defendants would constitute such overt acts.\n Respondents, though agreeing that there were such sales in the Mid- Western area and that the prices on such sales were affected by the rise in the spot markets, deny that they were overt acts in pursuance of the conspiracy. Rather, they contend that each of such sales was an individual act of a particular conspirator in the ordinary course of his business by which he enjoyed the results of a conspiracy carried out in another district. That is to say, they take the position that the alleged conspiracy was limited to a restraint of competition in buying and \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 252]\n\u00a0\n selling on the spot markets and included no joint agreement or understanding as respects sales in the Mid-Western area. In support of this view they cite the government's concessions that it 'does not claim that each defendant 'entered into an agreement not to sell jobbers except in accordance with' the contract described in Paragraph 11 of the Indictment';64 and that it does not contend that defendants were 'sitting around a table and agreeing on a uniform retail price'. And they assert that there was no evidence that respondents agreed not to sell gasoline in the Western District of Wisconsin except on the basis of spot market prices.\n Conspiracies under the Sherman Act are on 'the common-law footing': they are not dependent on the 'doing of any act other than the act of conspiring' as a condition of liability. Nash v. United States, supra, 229 U.S. at page 378, 33 S.Ct. at page 782. But since there was no evidence that the conspiracy was formed within the Western District of Wisconsin, the trial court was without jurisdiction unless some act pursuant to the conspiracy took place there. United States v. Trenton Potteries Co., supra, 273 U.S. pages 402, 403, 47 S.Ct. page 381, 50 A.L.R. 989, and cases cited. We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 253]\n\u00a0\n there was ample evidence of such overt acts in that district. The finding of the jury on this aspect of the case was also supported by substantial evidence. As we indicated in our discussion of the buying programs, there was sufficient evidence to go to the jury that the conspiracy did not end with an agreement to make purchases on the spot markets; that those buying programs were but part of the wider stabilization efforts of respondents; that the chief end and objective were the raising and maintenance of Mid- Western prices at higher levels. As stated by the Circuit Court of Appeals a different conclusion would require a belief that respondents were 'engaged in a philanthropic endeavor'. (105 F.2d 834.) They obviously were not. The fact that no uniform jobbers' contract and no uniform retail price policy were agreed upon is immaterial. The objectives of the conspiracy would fail if respondents did not by some formula or method relate their sales in the Mid-Western area to the spot market prices. The objectives of the conspiracy would also fail if respondents, contrary to the philosophy of all the stabilization efforts, indulged in price cutting and price wars. Accordingly, successful consummation of the conspiracy necessarily involved an understanding or agreement, however informal, to maintain such improvements in Mid-Western prices as would result from the purchases of distress gasoline. The fact that that entailed nothing more than adherence to prior practice of relating those prices to the spot market is of course immaterial. In sum, the conspiracy contemplated and embraced, at least by clear implication, sales to jobbers and consumers in the Mid-Western area at the enhanced prices. The making of those sales supplied part of the 'continuous cooperation' necessary to keep the conspiracy alive. See United States v. Kissel, \n218 \nU.S. 601, 607\n, 31 S.Ct. 124. Hence, sales by any one of the respondents in the Mid- Western area bound all. For a conspiracy is a partnership in crime; and an 'overt act \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 254]\n\u00a0\n of one partner may be the act of all without any new agreement specifically directed to that act.' United States v. Kissel, supra, 218 U. S. page 608, 31 S.Ct. page 126.\nXI. Respondent McElroy.\n Respondent McElroy argues that the judgment of conviction rendered against him should be reversed and the indictment dismissed not only for the reasons heretofore discussed, but more specifically on the grounds that there was no substantial evidence that he had any knowledge of and participated in the unlawful conspiracy. His motion for a directed verdict at the conclusion of the case was denied by the trial court and the Circuit Court of Appeals held that there was no error in such denial. A question of law is thus raised, which entails an examination of the record, not for the purpose of weighing the evidence but only to ascertain whether there was some competent and substantial evidence before the jury fairly tending to sustain the verdict. Abrams v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 616, 619\n, 40 S.Ct. 17, 18; Troxell v. Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad Co., \n227 \nU.S. 434, 444\n, 33 S.Ct. 274, 277; Lancaster v. Collins, \n115 \nU.S. 222, 225\n, 6 S.Ct. 33, 34. We have carefully reviewed the record for evidence of McElroy's knowledge of and participation in the conspiracy. But without burdening the opinion with a detailed exposition of the evidence on this point, we are of opinion that there was no error in the denial of his motion.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and that of the District Court affirmed. It is so ordered.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice MURPHY did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS.\n I regret that I am unable to agree to the court's decision. I think that for various reasons the judgment of the District Court should not stand. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 255]\n\u00a0\n The opinion fully and fairly sets forth the facts proved at the trial, and to its statement nothing need be added. Some of the reasons for my inability to agree with the court's conclusions follow:\n The Government relied for venue in the Western District of Wisconsin upon the commission in that district of overt acts in aid of the alleged common enterprise. I think the indictment fails to allege, and the evidence fails to disclose, the commission of any such act in the district of trial. I agree with the dissenting judge in the Circuit Court of Appeals that the case should be dismissed for this reason.\n Paragraph 17 of the indictment alleges that the spot market tank car prices of gasoline substantially influence the retail prices.\n Paragraph 18 is the only one that defines the charged conspiracy. It alleges that the defendants and others, knowing the facts pleaded by way of inducement (including the fact that retail prices follow spot market tank car prices), 'combined and conspired together for the purpose of artificially raising and fixing the tank car prices of gasoline in the aforementioned spot markets, ... and, as intended by them, defendants have artificially raised and fixed such spot market tank car prices of gasoline and have maintained such prices at artificially high and noncompetitive levels and at levels agreed upon among them, ... and have thereby intentionally increased and fixed the tank car prices of gasoline contracted to be sold, and sold, in interstate commerce as aforesaid in the midwestern area (including the Western District of Wisconsin) ....' It is further alleged that the defendants have arbitrarily, due to the form of their contract1 with jobbers, exacted \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 256]\n\u00a0\n large sums of money from jobbers and, in turn, have intentionally raised the general level of retail prices in the midwestern area (including the Western District of Wisconsin).\n The sole and only conspiracy charged is the agreement artificially to raise and fix spot market tank car prices of gasoline in the Mid-Continent field.\n Paragraph 19 is devoted to the means by which the conspiracy thus described was 'effectuated'. The conduct of the defendants in this respect is described as their engaging and participating in two concerted gasoline buying programs, one, the East Texas buying program, and the other the Mid- Continent buying program, for the purchase by each of them from independent refiners in spot transactions of large quantities of gasoline in the East Texas and Mid-Continent fields.\n After describing these buying programs in subsequent paragraphs, the indictment, in paragraph 25, alleges that the conspiracy 'has operated and has been carried out in part within the Western District of Wisconsin'. The method of its operation in that district is described as follows: 'In pursuance of said combination and conspiracy, defendant major oil companies (with the exception of Standard of Indiana and Gulf) have contracted to sell and have sold and have delivered large quantities of gasoline in tank car lots to jobbers within said district at the artificially raised and fixed and non-competitive prices aforesaid and have arbitrarily exacted from jobbers within said district large sums of money. Defendant major oil companies (with the exception of Gulf) have solicited and taken contracts and orders for said gasoline within said district, sometimes by sales representatives located there, which district has been an important market for their product and they have required retail dealers and consumers in said districts to pay artificially increased prices for gasoline as aforesaid, all by virtue of said combination \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 257]\n\u00a0\n and conspiracy and pursuant to the purposes and ultimate objectives thereof.'\n Thus, after describing the conspiracy as one to buy on spot markets for the purpose of raising the price of gasoline on those markets, the indictment purports to charge, as overt acts, entirely unrelated transactions of individual defendants in the resale of gasoline to jobbers and at retail in the Western District of Wisconsin.\n There is no evidence in the record that any of the purchases made by the defendants pursuant to the conspiracy was made in Wisconsin. But if the indictment could bear the construction that the charged conspiracy involved an agreement as to the terms of resale to jobbers and retailers, proof was lacking to support any such alleged agreement. Government counsel, both in pleading and in admissions at trial, so conceded.\n In its Bill of Particulars the Government said: 'The Government does not claim that each defendant entered into an agreement not to sell jobbers except in accordance with 'the contract described in paragraph 11 of the indictment.\"\n At trial Government counsel repeatedly disavowed any charge in the indictment or any claim of the Government that there was an agreement amongst the defendants with respect to the price at which gasoline should be sold to jobbers or at retail. The evidence showed, without contradiction, that the Standard Oil Company of Indiana was the market leader in this area, and that when it posted its price none of the other defendants could sell at a higher price. It further showed that at various times Standard was forced to reduce its price to meet the competition of others. In this connection Government counsel made the following statements:\n'... We do not say that the Standard of Indiana when it posts a retail price first consults with the other companies to find out what retail price should be posted. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 258]\n\u00a0\n 'If that is what you're worrying about, if you think we're charging you with sitting around a table and agreeing on a uniform retail price, don't worry because that isn't what we are charging.'\n\n In its brief in this court the Government attempts to avoid the effect of these concessions by the statement that the defendants 'were not free to sell as they pleased in the midwestern areas' and adds that 'an obligation to adhere to their price practice of selling on the basis of spot market prices was implicit in their unlawful agreement.' This amounts to saying that the conspiracy was not the one charged in the indictment but was a much more ample conspiracy not only to raise the general level of tank car prices on the spot market by purchasing on that market but to raise, maintain, and fix uniform resale prices to jobbers and retailers. But this contention does not aid the Government for there is no evidence of any agreement to raise, or to maintain, jobber and retail prices, but, on the contrary, evidence that competition in such sales existed during the period in question.\n Situations arise, and results ensue, from the prosecution of any agreement or conspiracy. Individual defendants may expect benefits to follow from their adherence to a conspiracy or agreement; but benefits or results, whether anticipated or unforeseen, occurring after consummation of the conspiracy, and because of it, are not overt acts done in aid and furtherance of the conspiracy. The authorities to this effect are uniform. \n 2\n\u00a0\n\n The Government relies on United States v. Trenton Potteries Co., \n273 \nU.S. 392\n, 47 S.Ct. 377, 50 A.L.R. 989. That case is clearly not in point. There the conspiracy was to fix the prices of the commodity manufactured and sold by the defendants and to adhere to the prices so fixed. This court held that \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 259]\n\u00a0\n a sale made, pursuant to that agreement, in the Southern District of New York afforded venue in that district of an indictment for violation of the Sherman Act. The case would be apposite if the pleading and proof in the instant case were of a conspiracy to fix and maintain jobber and retail prices and adherence to the agreement in sales to jobbers and retailers. Neither pleading nor proof goes to any such conspiracy.\n In accordance with the Government's contention, the trial court repeatedly charged that, in order to convict, the jury must find that a combination existed and that the combination agreed to, and had the power to, raise the tank car spot market price of gasoline. Of course, the jury was at liberty to find that any number of the defendants less than all fulfilled the conditions named by the court. By its verdict the jury found that those who were convicted, as a body, (1) possessed the power to raise the price and (2) agreed so to do. The trial court granted a new trial to a number of defendants, including Standard of Indiana, the largest major oil company doing business in the area.\n Standard was granted a new trial on the ground that there was no sufficient evidence to connect it with the conspiracy. By refusing new trials to the other corporate defendants the court has entered its own verdict that the others involved, excluding Standard, had the power, and agreed, to raise the level of spot market prices in the midwestern area. There is no jury verdict to that effect; no jury has ever passed upon that question, but an affirmative finding on that question is vital to the guilt of the defendants now before us. To affirm the judgment of conviction is to affirm a finding of fact by the trial judge without a jury and to deny the respondents the right to jury trial guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 260]\n\u00a0\n The court's instructions to the jury were that they should return a verdict of guilty if they found that the defendants' actions had in any degree contributed to a rise in gasoline prices. The defendants insisted that the test was the effect of their combination upon competition, and that they could not be convicted unless the jury found that their agreement, and their conduct pursuant thereto, unreasonably restrained competition in interstate commerce.\n There was substantial evidence that all the defendants agreed to, or did, was to act in concert to eliminate distress gasoline; that such gasoline was a competitive evil in that it tended to impair or destroy normal competition. There was substantial evidence that what they agreed to, and did, neither fixed nor controlled prices nor unreasonably affected normal competition and that their conduct affected prices only in the sense that the purchase of distress gasoline at going prices permitted prices to rise to a normal competitive level. There was no evidence that, as charged in the indictment, they agreed to, or in fact did, fix prices. The Court of Appeals, as I think, correctly held that 'the substance of what was accomplished and agreed upon was that the major companies would purchase from the independent refiners the latters' surplus gasoline at going market prices.'\n I think the defendants were entitled to have the jury charged that, in order to convict them, the jury must find that, although defendants knew the result of their activities would be a rise in the level of prices, nevertheless, if what they agreed to do, and did, had no substantial tendency to restrain competition in interstate commerce in transactions in gasoline the verdict should be not guilty.\n As has been pointed out by this court, violation of the anti-trust act depends upon the circumstances of indi- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 261]\n\u00a0\n vidual cases. \n3\n It is always possible to distinguish earlier decisions by reference to the facts involved in them but, in the course of decision in this court, certain principles have been laid down to which, I think, the charge of the court ran counter.\n One of these firmly established principles is that concerted action to remove a harmful and destructive practice in an industry, even though such removal may have the effect of raising the price level, is not offensive to the Sherman Act if it is not intended and does not operate unreasonably to restrain interstate commerce; and such action has been held not unreasonably to restrain commerce if, as here, it involves no agreement for uniform prices but leaves the defendants free to compete with each other in the matter of price. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n No case decided by this court has held a combination illegal solely because its purpose or effect was to raise prices. The criterion of legality has always been the purpose or effect of the combination unduly to restrain commerce.\n I think Appalachian Coals, Inc., v. United States, \n288 \nU.S. 344\n, 53 S. Ct. 471, a controlling authority sustaining the defendants' contention that the charge foreclosed a defense available to them under the Sherman Act. It is said that their combination had the purpose and effect of putting a floor under the spot market for gasoline. But that was \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 262]\n\u00a0\n precisely the purpose and effect of the plan in the Appalachian case. True, the means adopted to overcome the effect of the dumping of distress products on the market were not the same in the two cases, but means are unimportant provided purpose and effect are lawful.\n Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United States, \n309 \nU.S. 436\n, 60 S.Ct. 618, 84 L.Ed. --, decided March 25, 1940, is relied upon by the Government but, in that case, as in United States v. Trenton Potteries Co., \n273 \nU.S. 392\n, 47 S.Ct. 377, 50 A.L.R. 989, maintenance of prices fixed by agreement was involved. So also in Sugar Institute v. United States, \n297 \nU.S. 553\n, 56 S.Ct. 629, condemned features of the common plan had to do with the maintenance of announced prices and the abstinence from selling certain sorts of sugar. The combinations or agreements in these cases specifically prevented competitive pricing or took a commodity out of competition. This is not such a case.\n As I think, the error in the court's charge is well illustrated by the following instruction: 'If you should find that the defendants acting together, and those independent refiners acting in concert with them, did not have the power to raise the level of spot market prices in the spot markets referred to in the indictment, or that they did not combine for that purpose, and if you should find also that the purchase of the said gasoline by the defendants affected the spot market prices only indirectly and incidentally, then you may consider all the circumstances surrounding the activities of the defendants to determine whether they were intended to produce destructive competition and restore competition to a fairer base and produce fairer price levels. In such event, you may conclude that the purchase of such gasoline in the manner shown by the evidence was reasonable, and beneficial and not injurious to the public interest and that, therefore, the restraint of trade was not undue and \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 263]\n\u00a0\n not illegal, and you may acquit the defendants.' (Italics supplied.)\n This was to tell the jury that, if they found the combination had power and purpose to raise the general level of prices, they should convict without considering whether the defendants' concert of action was intended merely to remove a source of destructive competition, and without considering whether, as defendants contended and sought to prove, other factors in the industry, over which they had no control, limited their power to raise prices beyond a level which would be the normal result of the removal of the abuses engendered by the dumping of distress gasoline.\n I think that the closing address of counsel for the Government is ground for setting aside the verdict.\n It is true that to much that was objectionable in that address the defendants did not object or, if they did, failed to except. However, they assigned error to the whole of it and excepted to some of the more egregious violations of the canons of fair comment. I am of opinion that a situation is presented, which regardless of the technicalities of procedure, requires action by an appellate court. But, in any event, portions which are the subject of exception alone require a reversal of the judgment.\n The final and closing address covers twenty-eight pages of the record. About five refer to the facts in the case. The balance consists largely of what the speaker himself characterized as 'clowning' and personal references to counsel, parties, the court, and other subjects, the object of which apparently was to distract attention from the issues.\n At many points counsel should have been stopped by the court and warned against continuance of such tactics.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals said as to this matter: \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 264]\n\u00a0\n 'The Government does not undertake to justify much of the argument and misconduct complained of, but it earnestly insists that any error committed is not of a reversible nature. As the case is to be reversed, there seems no occasion for us to make a determination in this respect. We shall merely express the opinion that some of the argument complained of was highly improper and that, taken in connection with the misuse of the Grand Jury testimony, heretofore discussed, would present a very serious obstacle to the affirmance of the judgment.'\n I shall not quote those portions of the address which are quoted or summarized in the opinion of the court. It will suffice to make added reference to several portions.\n One of the most reprehensible things a prosecutor can do is to attempt to put into evidence before the jury his own, and his colleagues', opinion as to the guilt of the defendants he is prosecuting. Such a practice brings before the jury the unsworn testimony of a sworn officer of the Government. This fact lends it undue and improper weight and injects an element into the case which is so insidious and so impossible to counteract that trial judges, in my experience, have never hesitated to withdraw a juror and declare a mistrial because of this violation of the canons.\n In the closing address counsel said to the jury: 'Now, if anybody doubts, if anybody has the least shadow of a doubt about the fact that these men (referring to Government counsel) believe to the bottom of their hearts in the justice of the cause that they espouse here, I can disabuse their minds of that doubt at any time. They have been aggressive, and they have been forceful; their movements here have been intelligent, well-timed; and, as I said, they have come into this court room morning after morning, worn and tired almost to the breaking point. And it seemed to me that, I some times got the feeling, coming as they did then before you \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 265]\n\u00a0\n to present this evidence and this case, they were something like the Crusaders of old, saying 'God wills it, God wills it.\"\n Objection was not made by counsel for the defendants at the time of this statement but when a somewhat similar statement was made a few moments later objection was noted and exception taken. I think, however, that the offense was so flagrant that the court itself should have intervened irrespective of any objection.\n A little later these statements occurred: 'Now, just between yourselves, do you honestly think that these boys here (indicating counsel at government table) fired with the enthusiasm of crusaders, as I say, and having given to this case every ounce of mental and physical strength they have and I myself have contributed, also, would be trying to convict these men unless that was the wish and desire of the highest officials in the government of the United States?'\n After objection and exception counsel continued as follows: 'Now, just what do you think about it? Do you think these are three or four or five of these young fellows, as they have been calling them, just starting out on their own, running hog-wild? These are important men. I presume you all know they are engaged in a very important business, a business, the operation of which is almost a necessity in this country today. You don't think the government of the United States would allow four or five lawyers to come out here and prosecute this case against them, against their wishes, or that the Secretary of the Department of the Interior would allow us to do it, if he didn't want it done? And if he wanted it done it was because he believed, as did the other men in Washington, that there was a violation of law here, so out-standing and so withering and far- reaching in its effect that something ought to be done to stop it; and by that to tell the people \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 266]\n\u00a0\n of this country that you can't do these things and get away with it.'\n Again there was objection and exception.\n Counsel did not confine himself to testimony as to the prosecutors' belief in the defendants' guilt but, in attacking the credibility of an important witness for defendants, essayed to contradict that testimony by a statement of counsel's own knowledge of facts. The quotation from the address will make the matter clear:\n'I want to refer in a moment to something that made an impression on me.\n\n'You know we lawyers have to depend-most of us are kind of tough guys. We have our own way of talking about witnesses. And one thing that we very often say and talk about is the three classes of liars. There is the plain liar, the damn liar, and the expert witness. And of all of them, the expert witness is the worst.\n\n'There were a few of them here. There was Swensrud, the representative of the Standard of Ohio; there was Van Covern, and I think there was another one.\n\n'But I just didn't think much of Swensrud's whole testimony, especially after I found out that he was giving testimony that they could ship gasoline in 1935 and in 1936 up the Mississippi River to St. Paul. I happen to be around the Mississippi River quite a little, and know quite a lot about it. In 1935 and 1936, you couldn't get a rowboat up the Mississippi River, north of Winona-because the Government was putting in these dams for the purpose of creating the nine-foot channel that you have read so much about. They had concrete clear across the river, spaced in so many ways that, as I say, you just couldn't get a rowboat up there. When Swensrud talked about gasoline going up that river, where I knew, because I lived there and was around there, that it couldn't be done, I just thought-.' \n\n[310 \nU.S. 150, 267]\n\u00a0\n After objection and a request that the court direct the jury to disregard the statement the court ruled: 'The jury may disregard it. I didn't hear it. I was thinking about something else.'\n\n Thereupon counsel resumed as follows:\n'Now, if you will let me alone a few minutes, I will be through. If you don't, like 'Old Man River', I will just keep rolling along. I don't want to do that.\n\n'Now I was referring to these witnesses who knew so much. There was Van Covern, Swensrud, and a fellow named J. D. Miller. He was the fellow who never looked at anybody, so you could catch his eye. They knew so much, in the way they were telling it to you, that it is impossible, just impossible to believe that they could know as much as they said they did about it. They just covered too much territory. I think all history, sacred and profane, gives us but one single example of a person who knew everything-and he was not only a man, but he was God. And He gave up His life in a shameful death upon the cross, between two thieves.'\n\n It is true that no formal exception was taken but the matter was highly prejudicial. The court should have dealt with it in some definite and positive way, which he omitted to do.\n Considering what is set out in the opinion of this court, and the additional references I have made to the address, I am of opinion that counsel's argument was highly improper, as indeed the Government admits, and, further, that it was highly prejudicial. I do not think the court took proper means to counteract the impropriety and prejudice thus created and I think the only remedy available is to set aside a verdict ensuing upon such misconduct. Compare Berger v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 78, 85\n, 88 S., 89, 55 S.Ct. 629, 632, 633.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concurs in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The indictment charged 27 corporations and 56 individuals with violations of  1 of the Sherman Law. There were brought to trial 26 corporations and 46 individuals. Prior to submission of the case to the jury the court discharged, directed verdicts of acquittal, or dismissed the indictment as to 10 of the corporations and 16 of the individuals. The jury returned verdicts of guilty as to the remaining 16 corporations and 30 individuals. Thereafter the trial court ordered new trials as to 3 corporations and 15 individuals and granted judgment non obstante veredicto to one other corporation and 10 other individuals. United States v. Stone, \n308 \nU.S. 519\n, 60 S.Ct. 177, 84 L.Ed. --. For the opinions of the District Court on that phase of the case see United States v. Standard Oil Co., 23 F.Supp. 937, 938, 939; Id., 24 F.Supp. 575; and for the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals, Ex parte United States, 7 Cir., 101 F.2d 870.\n The respondents are the remaining 12 corporations and 5 individuals, viz., Socony-Vacuum Oil Company, Inc., Wadhams Oil Company, Empire Oil and Refining Company, Continental Oil Company, The Pure Oil Company, Shell Petroleum Corporation, Sinclair Refining Company, Mid-Continent Petroleum Corporation, Phillips Petroleum Company, Skelly Oil Company, The Globe Oil & Refining Company (Oklahoma), The Globe Oil & Refining Company (Illinois ), C.

The Indictment. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The major oil companies, in the main, engage in every branch of the business-owning and operating oil wells, pipelines, refineries, bulk storage plants, and service stations. Those engaging in all such branches are major integrated oil companies; those lacking facilities for one or more of those branches are semi-integrated. 'Independent refiners' describes companies engaged exclusively in refining. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] Located in the north, eastern part of Texas. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] Described as including Oklahoma, the northern and western portions of Texas, the southern and eastern portions of Kansas, the southern portion of Arkansas, the northern portion of Louisiana. \n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Two individuals connected with those journals were also made defendants. One of the individuals was not brought to trial. At the close of the government's case the indictment was dismissed, on motion of the government, as against the other four trade journal defendants. \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Described by one witness as 'wells that have gotten down to less than 5 barrels a day, and in some cases down to less than a barrel a day, so that they only have to be pumped, sometimes, an hour or two a day to get all the oil they will produce at that stage of the game.' \n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] It provided for maximum hours of work and minimum rates of pay; forbade sales below cost; required integrated companies to conduct each branch of their business on a profitable basis; established, within certain limits, the parity between the price of a barrel of crude oil and a gallon of refined gasoline as 18.5 to 1; and authorized the fixing of certain minimum prices. \n[\nFootnote 11\n] An order of the Administrator fixing minimum prices never became effective. Respondents also made an offer of proof that the Petroleum Administrative Board endeavored, in the fall of 1933, to obtain voluntary action by the larger companies to acquire and hold large stocks of crude oil, said to be overhanging the market and in danger of depressing the price of refined gasoline. The offer of proof indicated that some purchases had been made but did not show the extent. Respondents offered to show, through testimony of the chairman of the Planning & Coordination Committee, that it was the desire of the Administrator that crude oil not fall below $1 a barrel. \n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] The testimony of one of respondents' witnesses was that this policy caused the major companies to buy gasoline-in the main from small, non-integrated refiners. \n[\nFootnote 13\n] June 23, 1934; August 13, 1934; September 8, 1934; November 2, 1934. They apparently were short-lived, their legality having been questioned by the Department of Justice. Late in 1933 the industry proposed the formation of a National Petroleum Agency, of which twenty- three of the larger companies, including most of the corporate respondents, were to be members, 'to purchase, hold and, in an orderly way, dispose of surplus gasoline which threatens the stability of the oil price structure.' Subscriptions for a pool of nearly $9,000,000 were obtained. The plan was never put into operation. In May 1934 there was another voluntary plan ( which was abortive), the Planning & Coordination Committee addressed a resolution to certain major companies calling upon each to purchase an amount of gasoline in May equal to 3% of their sales. \n[\nFootnote 14\n] Under the November 2, 1934 program the contract provided that the price to be paid for the gasoline purchased should increase 1\/4\u00f5 per gallon with each 5\u00f5 per barrel increase in the posted price of crude oil and should decrease 1\/4\u00f5 per gallon with each 5\u00f5 per barrel decrease in crude. \n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] P. 37. Excerpts from this report were part of an offer of proof by respondents. \n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] The Marketing Committee had an extensive organization of regional, state, local, or temporary committees, scattered throughout the country and representative of the various marketing elements in the industry. \n[\nFootnote 17\n] He also testified that the Board said that it could not tell him how to deal with the price wars but that it would authorize him to deal with 'the elements (of) that conflict that cause them'. \n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] Sec. 3(a) of the Act read:\n'Upon the application to the President by one or more trade or industrial associations or groups, the President may approve a code or codes of fair competition for the trade or industry or subdivision thereof, represented by the applicant or applicants, if the President finds (1) that such associations or groups impose no inequitable restrictions on admission to membership therein and are truly representative of such trades or industries or subdivisions thereof, and (2) that such code or codes are not designed to promote monopolies or to eliminate or oppress small enterprises and will not operate to discriminate against them, and will tend to effectuate the policy of this title: Provided, That such code or codes shall not permit monopolies or monopolistic practices: Provided further, That where such code or codes affect the services and welfare of persons engaged in other steps of the economic process, nothing in this section shall deprive such persons of the right to be heard prior to approval by the President of such code or codes. The President may, as a condition of his approval of any such code, impose such conditions ( including requirements for the making of reports and the keeping of accounts) for the protection of consumers, competitors, employees, and others, and in furtherance of the public interest, and may provide such exceptions to and exemptions from the provisions of such code, as the President in his discretion deems necessary to effectuate the policy herein declared.'\n\n Section 5 provided:\n'While this title is in effect (or in the case of a license, while section 4(a) is in effect) and for sixty days thereafter, any code, agreement, or license approved, prescribed, or issued and in effect under this title, and any action complying with the provisions thereof taken during such period, shall be exempt from the provisions of the antitrust laws of the United States.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] This committee eventually was composed of respondents McDowell, Ashton and Lakin and five former defendants, who were either discharged or granted new trials. \n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] Respondent R. W. McDowell, a vice president of Mid-Continent, testified as follows respecting the origin and meaning of this term:\n'The phrase 'dancing partners' came up right there after Mr. Ashton had gone around the room. There were these 7 or 8 small refiners whom no one had mentioned. He said this situation reminded him of the dances that he used to go to when he was a young fellow. He said, 'Here we are at a great economic ball.' He said, 'We have these major companies who have to buy gasoline and are buying gasoline, and they are the strong dancers.' And he said, 'They have asked certain people to dance with them. They are the better known independent refiners.' He said, 'Here are 7 or 8 that no one seems to know.' He said, 'They remind me of the wallflowers that always used to be present at those old country dances.' He said, 'I think it is going to be one of the jobs of this Committee to introduce some of these wallflowers to some of the strong dancers, so that everybody can dance.' And from that simile, or whatever you want to call it, the term 'dancing partner' arose.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 21\n] This was a committee of three of which respondent McDowell was chairman. \n\n[\nFootnote 22\n] The list of the independent refiners having the distress gasoline was read and the majors made their selections-some on the basis of prior business dealings, some on the basis of personal friendships, some because of location, freight advantages, etc. \n\n[\nFootnote 23\n] Practically all of the independent refiners named in the indictment were members of this Association. C. M. Boggs, the president of the Association, and A. V. Bourque, its secretary, were named in the indictment as defendants. As to the former, a motion for directed verdict of acquittal was granted; as to the latter, the verdict of the jury was set aside and the indictment dismissed. \n\n[\nFootnote 24\n] On March 15, 1935, Jacobi in a letter to his superiors wrote: 'The writer has been busy this week on tank car stabilization work, and thus far results are gratifying. Our Committee decided on a price of 3 3\/4\u00f5 for third grade, and 4 3\/4\u00f5 for 'Q' for next week. Purchasing companies, including our own units, are paying these prices today.' 'Q' gasoline is regular gasoline with an octane rating of 68-70. \n[\nFootnote 25\n] What the practice of the other member of the Mechanical Sub- Committee was in this respect does not appear. \n\n[\nFootnote 26\n] Arnott was reported as saying: 'East Texas has been a menace to not only the Eastern Seaboard, but its gasoline also has found its way up into the Mid-Continent and has been competitive with the so-called Mid- Continent suppliers' or refiners' gasoline.'\n The normal market for gasoline refined in East Texas was the State of Texas and the Atlantic seaboard, reached through tanker shipments from Gulf ports. \n\n[\nFootnote 27\n] Buckley first secured the approval of his employer. His company, not the Association, paid his salary while he was engaged in this work; the Association paid his travel and telephone expenses. \n[\nFootnote 28\n] Representatives of respondents Socony-Vacuum, Pure Oil, Sinclair and probably of Shell were present as well as representatives of other majors. The only individual respondents present were Arnott and McElroy. \n\n[\nFootnote 29\n] They were part of the organization of the Planning & Coordination Committee under the Code. As to allocations under the Code see infra, 60 S. Ct. pp. 834-837. \n\n[\nFootnote 30\n] Not including, inter alia, Cities Service Export Oil Co., Louisiana Oil Refining Corp., Tide Water Assoc. Oil Co., The Texas Co., and Gulf Refining Co., as respects which the indictment had been dismissed. \n[\nFootnote 31\n] Only three of the corporate respondents purchased through the Association. \n\n[\nFootnote 32\n] An inter-company communication between employees of respondent Pure Oil written in May 1935 stated: 'Prices were advanced this week in both regions to 4 1\/2\u00f5 and 4 5\/8\u00f5-5 3\/8\u00f5, in view of some of the refiners squawking because our buying price was considerably lower than the publications.' \n\n[\nFootnote 33\n] It appears that, beginning in 1935 and increasing in the latter part of 1936, state chain store legislation resulted in the majors leasing many of their retail service stations. \n[\nFootnote 34\n] A defendant to whom a new trial was granted. \n[\nFootnote 35\n] Further details of Standard's policy in posting retail prices are discussed, 60 S.Ct. p. 833. \n\n[\nFootnote 36\n] The following is illustrative: The spot market price (computed as indicated) was to govern when that price plus freight, plus 5 1\/2\u00f5 per gallon did not exceed the posted service station price, exclusive of tax, at destination on date of shipment. In case that aggregate figure exceeded the service station price, then the price to the jobber would be reduced by an amount equal to one-half of the excess. In some cases the major companies assumed the full amount of the difference. The margin of 5 1\/2\u00f5 was based on the seller's discount of 3 1\/2\u00f5 to jobbers. Hence if the seller increased or decreased that discount generally then the margin of 5 1\/2\u00f5 would be increased or decreased by an equal or like amount. The wording of the various contracts varied but there was great uniformity in principle. \n[\nFootnote 37\n] For this reason 'spot open market' is frequently used, 'open' market referring to sales which are not made on contract not based on future publications. \n\n[\nFootnote 38\n] In case actual sales cannot be obtained, he gets the prices at which the refiners will sell to jobbers in that open spot market. \n[\nFootnote 39\n] Major companies sell little gasoline to jobbers on a spot basis. The spot market prices published in the trade journals are based largely on sales by independent refiners. \n[\nFootnote 40\n] The National Petroleum News gives the Oilgram quotations in weekly form. \n\n[\nFootnote 41\n] That percentage is apparently reduced to about 10.5% if sales of 29 independent refiners (including the 14 named in the indictment) are taken.\n What percentage these purchases by respondents were of the Mid- Continent spot market in 1935 does not clearly appear, the government's estimate of one-third to a half apparently being somewhat high. \n\n[\nFootnote 42\n] Comparable movements took place in the East Texas spot market for regular gasoline until April 21, 1935, when those quotations were discontinued. \n\n[\nFootnote 43\n] Respondents computed that for 1935 8% of these purchases of third grade gasoline were above the high; 10% were at the high; 7% were between the high and low; 16% were below the low. \n[\nFootnote 44\n] Respondents' computations comparing their tabulations with the government's tabulations are as follows:\n\n\n[\nFootnote 45\n] Respondents' figures were: .7% above the high of the Journal; .8% above the high of the Oilgram; 3.7% at the high of the Journal; 6.1% at the high of the Oilgram. Apparently all purchases above the high were purchases of third grade, not regular gasoline. \n[\nFootnote 46\n] One government witness testified that out of 1,729 contracts made by the defendant major oil companies with jobbers in the Mid-Western area during 1935, 1,461 provided that the basic price was to be determined 'on the basis of the average of the averages of the high and low quotations of the Chicago Journal of Commerce and Platt's Oilgram on spot market tank car gasoline.' During 1935 defendant companies sold over 900,000,000 gallons to jobbers in the Mid-Western area out of total sales by them in that area of over 4,000,000,000 gallons. \n\n[\nFootnote 47\n] These changes were apparently not made automatically, as the factor of competition was taken into consideration. \n[\nFootnote 48\n] A comparison of Monday low quotations for house brand gasoline ( Oklahoma market) with average service station prices for Standard's regular grade gasoline (less taxes) for 28 cities (including La Crosse and Milwaukee, Wis.) in the Mid-Western area shows the latter following the former upward from March to June 1935 and in January 1936.\n Oklahoma Service Station\n March 4, 1935 4.375\u00f5 12.56\u00f5 March 11, 1935 4.625 12.56 March 18, 1935 4.750 12.56 March 25, 1935 4.750 12.90 April 1, 1935 4.875 12.90 April 8, 1935 5.000 12.97 April 15, 1935 5.125 13.26 April 22, 1935 5.250 13.32 April 29, 1935 5.250 13.32 May 6, 1935 5.250 13.56 May 13, 1935 5.250 13.56 May 20, 1935 5.375 13.56 May 27, 1935 5.500 13.56 June 3, 1935 5.625 13.56 January 6, 1936 5.625 13.35 January 13, 1936 6.125 13.45 January 20, 1936 6.125 13.93 January 27, 1936 6.125 13.93\n\n\n[\nFootnote 49\n] Prices below the normal price which Standard posted. \n[\nFootnote 50\n] Average price (28 cities Mid-Western area) for Standard's regular gasoline.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 51\n] Sec. 5 is set forth, supra, note 18. \n\n[\nFootnote 52\n] That report went on to say:\n'... we believe such a program might be successful in raising both tank-car and retail prices to their proper level in relationship to crude oil prices.\n\n'If higher tank-car prices are obtained, we believe they can be sustained only by corresponding increases in retail gasoline prices; otherwise, the burden merely would be shifted from small refiners to small marketers, who in many instances have been in just as much distress as the refiners. We find that abnormally low retail prices can depress tank-car prices just as much as low tank-car prices can pull down the retail price structure. Thus it appears to be essential that both prices move up together.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 53\n] The Administrator was reported as saying about that report that if a parity between crude oil prices and gasoline prices did not come soon he would call a meeting of representatives of the industry to see what could be done about it. On March 30, 1935, according to respondents, the Administrator wrote concerning that report:\n'Concerning the independent refiners, other than those in California, it appears from the report of the Committee on Small Enterprise that the outstanding difficulty is due to the disparity between posted crude oil prices and refinery realizations. This situation has been deplorable for many months, but it is my understanding that at present the activity of the Stabilization Committees is having a distinct effect in the improvement of refinery prices, and that were it not for old contracts, many of which are badly shaded with respect to the posted price, the independent refiner is approaching a normal market structure.'\n\n Respondents also offered to prove that the Blazer Committee advised the Board in April 1935 that there was then no occasion to reduce crude oil prices since 'we consider tank car gasoline prices now almost up to parity with sufficient additional advances anticipated in both tank car and retail prices'; and expressed its satisfaction 'with the success of the program to stabilize tank-car markets'. \n\n[\nFootnote 54\n] Respondents offered to prove that Arnott's lawyer advised him on July 31, 1934, that although the letter of July 20, 1934, was 'not precisely an approval' by the Administrator of any agreement which gave 'complete protection' from any prosecution under the anti-trust laws, it nevertheless was 'for all practical purposes a complete protection to you and your committees to engage in all reasonable activities to restore prices to normal levels.' \n[\nFootnote 55\n] A sub-committee of the Planning & Coordination Committee met with the Board on May 10, 1935, to discuss the report of the Blazer Committee. The recommendation in that report that the majors buy distress gasoline from the independents was discussed. Arnott testified that his group told the Board that 'we already had buying of gasoline in effect' to which the Chairman of the Board was said to have replied 'That is quite so and disposes of that part of the report.' \n\n[\nFootnote 56\n] Prepared between December 1935 and February 1936 and issued in June 1936 by the Department of the Interior. \n[\nFootnote 57\n] In speaking of the general work of this Committee (which as we have noted was set up to deal with price wars) the report stated: 'The stabilization program was perhaps the outstanding development under the code.' \n\n[\nFootnote 58\n] This Compact (49 Stat. 939) was authorized in February 1935 and became effective in August 1935.\n2. Connally Act. \n\n[\nFootnote 59\n] Under this indictment proof that prices in the Mid-Western area were raised as a result of the activities of the combination was essential, since sales of gasoline by respondents at the increased prices in that area were necessary in order to establish jurisdiction in the Western District of Wisconsin. Hence we have necessarily treated the case as one where exertion of the power to fix prices (i.e., the actual fixing of prices) was an ingredient of the offense. But that does not mean that both a purpose and a power to fix prices are necessary for the establishment of a conspiracy under  1 of the Sherman Act. That would be true if power or ability to commit an offense was necessary in order to convict a person of conspiring to commit it. But it is well established that a person 'may be guilty of conspiring, although incapable of committing the objective offense.' United States v. Rabinowich, \n238 \nU.S. 78, 86\n, 35 S.Ct. 682, 684. And it is likewise well settled that conspiracies under the Sherman Act are not dependent on any overt act other than the act of conspiring. Nash v. United States, \n229 \nU.S. 373, 378\n, 33 S.Ct. 780, 782. \n It is the 'contract, combination ... or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce' which  1 of the Act strikes down, whether the concerted activity be wholly nascent or abortive on the one hand, or successful on the other. See United States v. Trenton Potteries Co., \n273 \nU.S. 392, 402\n, 47 S.Ct. 377, 381, 50 A.L.R. 989. Cf. Retail Lumber Dealer's Ass'n v. State, 95 Miss. 337, 48 So. 1021, 35 L.R.A., N.S., 1054. And the amount of interstate or foreign trade involved is not material (Montague & Co. v. Lowry, \n193 \nU.S. 38\n, 24 S.Ct. 307 ), since  1 of the Act brands as illegal the character of the restraint not the amount of commerce affected. Steers v. United States, 6 Cir., 192 F. 1, 5; Patterson v. United States, 6 Cir., 222 F. 599, 618, 619. In view of these considerations a conspiracy to fix prices violates  1 of the Act though no overt act is shown, though it is not established that the conspirators had the means available for accomplishment of their objective, and though the conspiracy embraced but a part of the interstate or foreign commerce in the commodity. Whatever may have been the status of price- fixing agreements at common law (Allen, Criminal Conspiracies in Restraint of Trade at Common Law, 23 Harv.L.Rev. 531) the Sherman Act has a broader application to them than the common law prohibitions or sanctions. See United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Ass'n, \n166 \nU.S. 290, 328\n, 17 S.Ct. 540, 554. Price-fixing agreements may or may not be aimed at complete elimination of price competition. The group making those agreements may or may not have power to control the market. But the fact that the group cannot control the market prices does not necessarily mean that the agreement as to prices has no utility to the members of the combination. \n The effectiveness of price-fixing agreements is dependent on many factors, such as competitive tactics, position in the industry, the formula underlying price policies. Whatever economic justification particular price-fixing agreements may be thought to have, the law does not permit an inquiry into their reasonableness. They are all banned because of their actual or potential threat to the central nervous system of the economy. See Handler, Federal Anti-Trust Laws-A Symposium (1931), pp. 91 et seq. \n The existence or exertion of power to accomplish the desired objective (United States v. United States Steel Corp., \n251 \nU.S. 417\n, 444- 451, 40 S.Ct. 293, 296-299, 8 A.L.R. 1121; United States v. International Harvester Co., \n274 \nU.S. 693, 708\n, 709 S., 47 S.Ct. 748, 753, 754) becomes important only in cases where the offense charged is the actual monopolizing of any part of trade or commerce in violation of  2 of the Act, 15 U.S.C.A.  2. An intent and a power to produce the result which the law condemns are then necessary. As stated in Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 375, 396\n, 25 S.Ct. 276, 279, '... when that intent and the consequent dangerous probability exist, this statute, like many others, and like the common law in some cases, directs itself against that dangerous probability as well as against the completed result.' But the crime under  1 is legally distinct from that under  2 (United States v. MacAndrews & Forbes Co., C.C., 149 F. 836, United States v. Buchalter, 2 Cir., 88 F.2d 625) though the two sections overlap in the sense that a monopoly under  2 is a species of restraint of trade under  1. Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 1\n, 59-61, 31 S.Ct. 502, 515, 516, 34 L.R.A.,N.S., 834, Ann. Cas.1912D, 734; Patterson v. United States, supra, 222 F. page 620. Only a confusion between the nature of the offenses under those two sections (see United States v. Nelson, D.C., 52 F. 646; United States v. Patterson, C.C., 55 F. 605; Chesapeake & O. Fuel Co. v. United States, 6 Cir., 115 F. 610) would lead to the conclusion that power to fix prices was necessary for proof of a price-fixing conspiracy under  1. Cf. State v. Eastern Coal Co ., 29 R.I. 254, 70 A. 1, 132 Am.St.Rep. 817, 17 Ann.Cas. 96; State v. Scollard, 126 Wash. 335, 218 P. 224, 32 A.L.R. 1082. \n\n[\nFootnote 60\n] It should be noted in this connection that the typical method adopted by Congress when it has lifted the ban of the Sherman Act is the scrutiny and approval of designated public representatives. Under the N.I. R.A. this could be done through the code machinery with the approval of the President as provided in  3(a) and 5, supra note 18. Under  407(8) of the Transportation Act of 1920, 41 Stat. 482, 49 U.S.C.A.  5(8), carriers, including certain express companies, which were consolidated pursuant to any order of the Interstate Commerce Commission were relieved from the operation of the Anti-Trust laws. And see the Maloney Act ( 15A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 52 Stat. 1070, 15 U.S.C.A.  78o-3) providing for the formation of associations of brokers and dealers with the approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission and establishing continuous supervision by the Commission over specified activities of such associations; and the Bituminous Coal Act of 1937, 50 Stat. 72, 15 U.S.C.A .  828 et seq., especially  4 and 12-particularly as they relate to the fixing of minimum and maximum prices by the Bituminous Coal Commission. \n\n[\nFootnote 61\n] Respondents strongly urge that this is not true in the case of the testimony of an employee of one of the trade journals. His prior testimony indicated (1) that the major companies were buying exactly at the journal quotations, so that the graph of those quotations represented prices paid under the buying program; (2) that prices paid by the majors 'outweighed' the jobbers' sales reported to his journals. At the trial he testified that those grand jury statements were not true. And they were not. But those matters are not essential issues in the case. That purchases under the buying program did not lead the market up, that the vast majority of purchases were at or below the low quotations, that the volume of purchases did not eliminate all competition, that the spot market prices were still determined by competitive forces, that the volume of purchases under the buying programs was relatively small are wholly immaterial, as we have seen. \n\n[\nFootnote 62\n] In this connection the court said (page 944) that it appeared 'without dispute that a concerted buying movement took place in the Mid- Continent field'; that as to its character and the existence of a concerted East Texas program, there was 'ample evidence to take the case to the jury'; and that the proofs were sufficient to sustain the verdict as to the charge that defendants 'were able to and did effectually tie the jobbers' price' in the Mid-Western area to the tank car price in the spot market. It significantly added (page 944): 'It is claimed by the defendants that they did not have the power to control the price as charged, and that inasmuch as some of the large companies did not or have not been shown to have participated in the movement, the power of the defendants in that respect was inadequate for the purpose. This does not follow, for the reason that large buyers both in East Texas and in the Mid- Continent fields, while acting separately, were nevertheless buying for their requirements in these fields, as they had always done and as defendants had every reason to believe they would continue to do. The defendants were thus able to consider that these buyings would necessarily reduce the available gasoline which they proposed to take off the market just as effectively as though these other companies had joined in the program. The amount of distress gasoline would be exactly the same in any event, and the proof shows that the surplus was in fact a very small part of the total, so much so that most of the defendants have shown that its acquisition in addition to other buying did not materially increase their inventories. I am satisfied that there was ample evidence to sustain the contention of the Government that the defendants did have the power to control the market, and that they did so, as charged.' \n\n[\nFootnote 63\n] The question of the effect of the buying programs on market prices obviously concerns only the corporate defendants. The one corporate defendant granted after verdict a directed verdict of acquittal was the Globe Oil & Refining Co. (Kansas). The record does not show that this company made any spot market purchases in 1935 or 1936. \n\n[\nFootnote 64\n] The standard form of jobber contract referred to in par. 11 of the indictment was described therein as follows: 'The price of gasoline to the jobber shall be the average spot market price, determined by averaging the high and low spot market prices for gasoline of comparable octane rating published by defendant Platt's Oilgram for the Tulsa, Oklahoma, market, and by defendant Chicago Journal of Commerce on date of shipment. If the average spot market price plus freight to destination shall allow the buyer a margin of less than 5 1\/2\u00f5 per gallon below the service station price posted by defendant Standard of Indiana, then the buyer and the seller shall share equally in the deficit below a 5 1\/2\u00f5 margin. In certain States in which the Standard of Indiana has recently discontinued the posting of retail prices, such jobber margins have been calculated on the basis of a margin of 2\u00f5 below the dealer tank wagon prices posted by the Standard of Indiana (such tank wagon prices having usually been 3 1\/2\u00f5 below the posted retail prices).' \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The form and use of this contract is described in paragraph 11 of the indictment. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Lonabaugh v.

NATIONAL(1940)\nNo. 236\nArgued: Decided: February 5, 1940\n\n\n\n\n[309 \nU.S. 165, 166]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Benedict Deinard, of Minneapolis, Minn., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[309 \nU.S. 165, 167]\n\u00a0\n Mr. George T. Havel, of Le Center, Minn., for respondent Malone.\n Mr. Pierce Butler, Jr., of St. Paul, Minn., for respondent National Surety Corporation.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question presented is whether petitioner, a private user of the mails, may without the consent of any officer of the United States bring suit on the bond of an acting postmaster for consequential damages resulting from misdelivery of mail. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed a judgment of the District Court for the District of Minnesota dismissing petitioner's complaint. \n1\n We granted certiorari2 because of an alleged conflict with a decision of this Court3 and because an important question in the administration of the postal laws was involved.\n The complaint alleged that petitioner was engaged in the business of automobile financing in Minneapolis, in the course of which it purchased from automobile dealers the installment notes of buyers secured by their sales contracts. A dealer living at Montgomery, Minnesota, \n\n[309 \nU.S. 165, 168]\n\u00a0\n where the respondent Malone was acting postmaster, is alleged to have put into operation a scheme to defraud petitioner by selling it forged notes and contracts, which he sent petitioner along with a fictitious list of credit references. Petitioner, before purchasing, followed its usual practice of mailing letters of inquiry to the references, and after purchasing mailed payment books, insurance certificates, and receipts to the purported makers of the notes. The dealer persuaded the acting postmaster Malone, allegedly in violation of the Postal Regulations,4 to turn over to him all letters that arrived in Montgomery in petitioner's envelopes. Then he sent forged replies to petitioner's letters and made installment payments out of the money which petitioner had paid him in buying the notes. The dealer thus defrauded the Finance Company of some $ 34,000. The respondent Malone, on taking office as acting postmaster, had executed a bond for $16,000 to the United States as sole obligee with the respondent Surety Corporation as surety. The condition of the bond was:\n'That if the said Patrick J. Malone shall on and after the date he took charge of the post office faithfully discharge all duties and trusts imposed on him as acting postmaster either by law or by the regulations of the Post Office Department, and shall perform all duties as fiscal agent of the Government imposed on him by law or by regulation of the Treasury Department made in conformity with law, and shall also perform all duties and obligations imposed upon or required of him by law, or by regulation made pursuant to law, in connection with \n\n[309 \nU.S. 165, 169]\n\u00a0\n the Postal Savings System, then this obligation shall be void; otherwise, of force.'\n\n In its complaint, without alleging specific authorization from the United States to sue, petitioner asked judgment on the bond for the defaults of Malone as postmaster. At the close of the testimony at the trial motions to dismiss the complaint were made by respondents and the district judge reserved judgment. After a jury verdict for petitioner the motions were granted. The Court of Appeals affirmed on the ground that a private user of the mails cannot maintain such an action as is here alleged without the consent of the United States, the obligee in the bond, and that no consent was given either by the statutes, expressly or by implication, or by any appropriate officer of the United States.\n The respondent gave a statutory bond in compliance with an enactment of the Congress for the purposes specified in the statute. \n5\n As the bond is part of an integrated system of postal regulations, the determination of the parties authorized to sue upon it is a federal question governed by federal law. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n We agree with the Court of Appeals that there was no consent and that such consent is necessary. Consequently there is no occasion to determine whether the bond was intended to protect private users of the mail from all loss or damage, however consequential, occasioned by the postmaster.\n The record shows the only effort made to secure consent of an officer was a request to the Attorney General for \n\n[309 \nU.S. 165, 170]\n\u00a0\n authority to sue. This was refused. Whether as a matter of right a third party may sue on the instrument for loss covered by an official bond running only to the statutory obligee depends upon the intention of the legislative body which required the bond. This intention may be evidenced by express statutory language or by implication. This was the rule announced in Washington, use of M'Cue v. Young. \n7\n There a bond had been given to the Corporation of Washington, a municipality by the manager of a lottery 'truly and impartially to execute' his duties. Without the city's consent, the holder of a winning ticket sued on the bond. This Court said:\n'No person who is not the proprietor of an obligation, can have a legal right to put it in suit, unless such right be given by the legislature; and no person can be authorized to use the name of another, without his assent given in fact, or by legal intendment.'\n\n In Howard v. United States8 this comment was made upon the Young decision:\n'That case undoubtedly is authority for the proposition that, generally speaking, an obligation taken under legislative sanction cannot, in the absence of a statute so providing, be put in suit in the name of the obligee, the proprietor of the obligation, without his consent.'9\n\n Such official bonds are often part of a general statutory plan for the operation of governmental activities. While all the activities of a government of course confer benefits on its citizens, frequently the benefits are incidental \n\n[309 \nU.S. 165, 171]\n\u00a0\n and unenforceable. \n10\n In the case of an official bond, even if its benefits are not incidental, it may well be that the legislative body is of the opinion that actions on the bond should be limited to the government in order to secure unified administration of claims.\n We have recognized a similar need for a single control in regard to a sale bond required by a district court in an equity receivership. This Court in Munroe v. Raphael11 had before it an injunction granted by a federal district court upon the motion of its receiver to rescind a consent to sue and forbid further proceedings in a suit in a state court in the name of the United States upon a sale bond of the estate in receivership. The sale bond had been given for assets purchased from the receiver. It ran to the United States only and guaranteed the payment of a certain percentage of indebtedness to all creditors of the estate. The suit had been instituted in the state court by one creditor, with permission of the district court obtained prior to the receiver's motion for injunction. This Court upheld the injunction on the theory that the bond, a part of the estate, remained within the control of the court and that to ensure ratable payments to all creditors one should not be permitted to carry on the litigation. In the opinion, it was declared: 'Certainly no creditor could bring a suit in his own name on the bond, for his share of the purchase money. Nor could he institute such an action without leave of the District Court.' \n12\n\u00a0\n\n Petitioner's attack is pointed at the application of the consent rule rather than at the rule itself. While with \n\n[309 \nU.S. 165, 172]\n\u00a0\n some other official bonds consent if given by express provision,13 none is given in the postmaster bond statute. Petitioner urges that consent by implication is given. Attention is called to the words 'legal intendment' in the quotation from Washington, use of M'Cue v. Young and to a comment upon the Young case in the Howard case that these words show that 'consent may, under some circumstances, be assumed to have been given ....'14 These expressions are used to base an argument that the statutes and regulations of the postal service establish consent by intendment. The precedent chiefly relied upon for this position is the Howard case. This was a suit, without express consent of the United States, on a bond of a clerk of the district court, alleging breach by failure to pay over money deposited with the clerk in settlement of prior litigation. The bond was a statutory bond naming the United States as sole obligee and assuring that the clerk would faithfully discharge the duties of his office. This Court analyzed the statutory requirements and the 'peculiar relation' of the clerk to the court to determine the intendment of the Congress as to the standing of the private litigant to sue on clerks' bonds. Consideration was given to the fact that 'the great mass of litigation ... has always been between individuals,'15 that 'the practice of a century' required a ruling that the bond covered them and that it could \n\n[309 \nU.S. 165, 173]\n\u00a0\n not be said of the clerk's bond, as it was said of the lottery bond, that it was given primarily for the governmental authority. This Court concluded that even though 'generally speaking ... in the absence of a statute' the obligation cannot be put in suit in the name of the obligee without his consent, the factors of custom, similarity of governmental and private use of the courts and the surrounding circumstances, in the absence of words declaratory of intention, evidenced an intendment to permit suit without consent on the clerk's bond. 'In our opinion, Congress intended that the required bond should protect private suitors as well as the United States, and therefore, no statute forbidding it, a private suitor may bring an action thereon for his benefit in the name of the obligee, the United States. Such must be held to be the legal intendment of existing statutory provisions.' \n 16\n\u00a0\n\n We conclude in the present instance, however, that circumstances, practice, statutes and regulations combine to forbid reading into this situation a 'legal intendment' to permit suit without the consent of the United States. Assuming the bond declared upon here is intended to cover the users of mail service, its beneficiaries are legion in comparison with the users of a court's depository. Moreover, the United States has a very substantial interest in a postmaster's bond. The statutory duties of a postmaster require him to act as a fiscal officer for the government at his office. He is responsible for postal savings deposits, money orders, stamps, and salary disbursements as well as for the property of the service, buildings, mail bags and other equipment. 17 Such circumstances weigh against a holding that the Congress intended to let a private user of the mails, wronged by the \n\n[309 \nU.S. 165, 174]\n\u00a0\n principal of a postmaster's bond, sue wherever he might find defendants and gain for himself such priority on the bond as vigilance could obtain. \n 18\n\u00a0\n\n Apparently it is not customary for the United States to consent to suit by mail users upon postmasters' bonds. No case has been called to our attention where such permission has been granted though the requirement for a bond has been in existence since 1825.19 Rarely has a private individual sought recovery. \n20\n The contention of petitioner cannot be said to be supported by any continued administrative practice. On the other hand, the United States has undertaken repeatedly and successfully to recover on the bonds for the losses of mail users. Recovery has been allowed on the theory of a suit by a bailee for loss of property in his possession. \n21\n\u00a0\n\n[309 \nU.S. 165, 175]\n\u00a0\n There are over 44,000 post offices under the Post Office Department22 and it is common knowledge that millions of items of mail go through them each year. It is rather obvious that numerous claims, many of them for small amounts, are likely to arise in the course of many transactions. \n23\n Under the Department's Regulations there is a fairly complete administrative formula for handling these claims from discovery to satisfaction. \n24\n These facts, along with the substantial interest of the government in the bonds, convince us that the Congress intended that claims on the bonds would be handled through the government rather than through various suits by individuals.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 103 F.2d 450, affirming, 23 F.Supp. 411. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] \n308 \nU.S. 534\n, 60 S.Ct. 102, 84 L.Ed. --. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Howard v.

CHICAGO HEIGHTS TRUCKING CO.(1940)\nNo. 724\nArgued: Decided: May 20, 1940\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Illinois. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 344, 345]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert H. Jackson, Atty. Gen., and A. H. Feller, of Washington, D.C., for appellants.\n Messrs. John R. Turney and Robert E. Quirk, both of Washington, D.C., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondents are forty-one interstate common carriers operating motor vehicles subject to the Interstate Commerce Commission under the Federal Motor Carrier Act of 1935.1 Our decision turns upon the validity of an order of the Commission cancelling certain proposed tariffs of these carriers upon the ground that they were unlawfully discriminatory in affording lower rates to 'forwarders' of freight than to other shippers.\n Forwarders utilize common carriers by rail and motor truck to transport goods owned by others. They solicit and obtain many small shipments, from various points within an area, and cause them to be carried in less than truck-load or carload lots to a concentration center within the area. There they are assembled by the forwarder for further transportation in truck-load or carload lots. Although the forwarder gives owners of individual small shipments his own contract corresponding in form to through bills of lading and assumes responsibility for safe through carriage, the forwarder customarily arranges for the pickup, assembly and transportation of the shipments by carriers for hire. And the forwarders, not the owners of the goods, select the carriers and \n\n[310 \nU.S. 344, 346]\n\u00a0\n route the shipments. Upon arrival of a truck-load or carload of the assembled small shipments at a distribution center, the bulk shipment is broken up, the forwarder separates and takes possession of the original small shipments and arranges, where necessary, their further carriage to their various final destinations in the area served by the particular distribution point. In this final carriage of the small shipment to its ultimate destination, the forwarder again utilizes carriers for hire to move these less than truck-load or carload lots. Thus, forwarders may use the service of carriers to assemble shipments of less than truck-load or carload lots at their concentration center, to transport the assembled truck-load or carloads to a distribution center and to carry the broken up small shipments beyond their break-bulk distribution center.\n The forwarding business has been built upon the expectation that a material part of the transportation which it causes to be provided for small shippers can by consolidation of small shipments be obtained at truck-load or carload rates. For the forwarders' business was originally made profitable because it could operate upon the margin of profit represented by the difference between railroad carload rates paid by the forwarder and the higher rates, approximating less than carload rates, which the forwarder charged the owner of a shipment. \n2\n But forwarders in using railroads enjoy no special tariff rates and pay the same published carload and less than carload rates that other shippers pay. And the question here is not whether the Commission should have approved as lawful lower rates for truck-loads than for smaller shipments, but whether the court properly set aside the Commission's order which had directed cancellation of re- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 344, 347]\n\u00a0\n spondents' tariffs providing lower rates for certain less than truck-load shipments solely because they had previously been, or were intended subsequently to be, consolidated in truck-loads with other individual shipments.\n Upon the Commission's own motion, a hearing was held and the Commission ordered the cancellation of these tariffs. \n3\n Respondents brought suit in the District Court to set aside and restrain enforcement of the Commission's order. A three judge Court held the order void and perpetually enjoined its enforcement. The case is here on direct appeal by the United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n Respondents' tariffs would be available to forwarders who arrange assembling, transportation and distribution services in the trade areas surrounding concentration and break-bulk centers in Illinois, Wisconsin and Indiana. And the Commission found that 'In practical effect these rates can be used by few, if any shippers, except the forwarders.' Since in its opinion these tariffs were 'materially lower than respondents' local rates on like traffic between the same points',5 the Commission found that 'the forwarders ... and possibly a few large shippers ... will be afforded transportation at rates lower than the rates ... charged certain other shippers under substantially similar circumstances and conditions, in violation of Section 216(d).'6 In the view we take, it be- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 344, 348]\n\u00a0\n comes unnecessary to consider additional grounds upon which the Commission found the tariffs violated another Section of the Act. \n 7\n\u00a0\n\n So far as pertinent here, the tariffs before us propose rates for transportation of commodities in less than truck-load lots. All commodities (with exceptions not here material) are as a group given the same special rate. In general, respondents' other tariffs provide rates which vary for different types of commodities. Accordingly, if the suspended rates were in effect, transportation of the same commodity over the same haul might cost a forwarder less than other shippers.\n The findings of the Commission and the supporting evidence8 reveal that local less than truck-load rates charged shippers are in many if not most instances greater than rates on like commodities between the same points to be afforded forwarders under the proposed tariffs which the Commission ordered cancelled. However, upon reviewing the identical evidence which the Commission had considered, the court below drew inferences opposite to those of the Commission and disagreed with its conclusion that in operation the disputed tariffs would violate Section 216(d) which forbids undue preferences and advantages that lead to unjust discrimination. The exercise of judgment by the Commission and by the court \n\n[310 \nU.S. 344, 349]\n\u00a0\n in appraising the same evidence has led to these opposing conclusions.\n The tariffs apply on \"All freight' (except as otherwise provided ..., which has been transported to ... (an) origin station ..., as a part of a truck-load consignment or carload consignment moving under tariffs or schedules lawfully on file with the Interstate Commerce Commission and immediately reshipped in the original packages as an L.T.L. ( less than truck-load) shipment: or\n'(b) 'All freight', ... which is to be transported to ... (a named) destination station ... as an L.T.L. shipment, and immediately reshipped in the original package as part of a truck-load consignment or carload consignment moving under tariffs or schedules lawfully on file with the Interstate Commerce Commission.'\n\n It is evident that these special tariffs are available only to shippers who intend and are able (a) to arrange immediate further transportation in carloads or truck-loads for commodities that have been carried in less than truck-load lots, or (b) to move commodities in less than truck-load lots, immediately after they have been carried as part of a carload or truck-load. While, as has been noted, some few large shippers may possibly avail of the tariffs, there is no question about the finding of the court below that the 'principal traffic which will be carried under the suspended rates is what is called by the Commission 'freight forwarder traffic.\"\n Almost since its inception the Commission has been called upon to exercise its judgment relative to the Interstate Commerce Act as applied to forwarders. \n9\n Initial hostility of the railroads caused them to deny forwarders the advantage of their published rates. However, when \n\n[310 \nU.S. 344, 350]\n\u00a0\n called upon to decide, the Commission held that the railroads' action discriminated against forwarders and declared forwarders to be entitled as shippers to published carload rates. This Court sustained the action of the Commission. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n About 1920, prior to the Motor Carriers Act, forwarders began to utilize motor carriers. Forwarders and truckers operated under individual contracts providing divisions of the complete line haul charge. After the tariff provisions of the Motor Carriers Act went into effect, forwarders filed tariff schedules with the Interstate Commerce Commission on the assumption that they were subject to the Act as common carriers. Tariffs so filed were, however, ordered cancelled by the Commission upon the ground that forwarders were not motor carriers subject to the Act. A three judge District Court upheld the Commission11 and this Court affirmed. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n Here, the complaint itself has alleged that the so-called 'proportional' tariffs under consideration 'name rates which are identical with' the divisions of through L.C.L. rates which respondents would have received had the forwarders' tariffs been upheld. And, as stated by the Commission, 'Stripped of protective coloring, these rates are published as proportional rates primarily as a matter of expediency to serve the purpose of certain freight forwarders and to perpetuate in another form so- called divisions of purported joint rates of the freight forwarded.'\n Respondents contend that the Commission improperly concluded that the cancelled tariffs create undue preferences or advantages resulting in unjust discriminations in \n\n[310 \nU.S. 344, 351]\n\u00a0\n violation of 216(d) because there was no evidence that the suspended rates would subject any particular person or type of traffic to disadvantage or injury; while the suspended rates, applicable on all classes of traffic, might be lower as to some commodities, the aggregate compensation from them would not be less than that from like local traffic if all such local traffic is considered; services rendered by respondents to the forwarders are unlike and less burdensome than local services rendered individual shippers; services rendered the forwarders are on longer hauls than on other local less than truck-load commodity traffic; terminal services rendered forwarders by respondents are less expensive than in the case of other shippers; forwarders bear the expense of soliciting business thereby relieving respondents of that burden; the only evidence before the Commission was introduced by respondents; and no shippers complained of injury. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n Weighty as these arguments were, they did not persuade the Commission that forwarders could without discrimination be given lower L.T.L. rates than other shippers. The Commission was impressed by the facts that the proposed rates were not in reality available to all of the shipping public and in practical effect would operate for the special benefit of the forwarders and would not benefit the owner of goods shipped; that Section 216(d) of the Act represented a manifestation of the congressional purpose in Part I, Sec. 2, and Part II, Sec. 202(a) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A.  2, 302(a), to prevent favoritism by insuring equality of treatment on rates for substantially similar services; and that the proposed tariff would afford 'forwarders ..., and possibly a very few large shippers ..., transportation at rates lower \n\n[310 \nU.S. 344, 352]\n\u00a0\n than the rates which ... (would) be charged certain other shippers under substantially similar circumstances and conditions, in violation of Section 216(d).' Moved by these considerations, the Commission concluded that the mere fact that forwarders might ordinarily furnish a volume of traffic greater than but identical in kind with that furnished by individual shippers did not justify lower rates for forwarders.\n'It is not disputable that from the beginning the very purpose for which the Commission was created was to bring into existence a body which, from its peculiar character, would be most fitted to primarily decide whether from facts, disputed or undisputed, in a given case, preference or discrimination existed.' \n14\n And where a court substituted 'its judgment as to the exisence of preference for that of the Commission, on the ground that where there was no dispute as to the facts it had a right to do so, ( the court) obviously exerted an authority not conferred upon it by the statute.' \n15\n So here, it has been pointed out that there was no dispute in the evidence before the Commission, all of which was introduced by respondents. But the differing inferences as to discrimination finding possible support in that evidence are made to stand out by the persuasive reasoning advanced in both the majority and minority opinions of the Commission. The Interstate Commerce Act does not attempt to define an unlawful discrimination with mathematical precision. Instead, different treatment for similar transportation services is made an unlawful discrimination when 'undue', 'unjust', 'unfair', and 'unreasonable'. And the courts have always recognized that Congress intended to commit to the Commission the determination, by application of an informed judgment \n\n[310 \nU.S. 344, 353]\n\u00a0\n to existing facts, of the existence of forbidden preferences, advantages and discrimination.16\n\n A special allowance to a forwarder as an inducement to ship goods by a particular carrier would be an illegal rebate. \n17\n Similarly, and as previously pointed out, forwarders are shippers protected by the Interstate Commerce Act from discrimination by carriers. \n18\n As shippers, forwarders do business subject to the paramount principle that Congress intended our national transportation system to operate without favoritism. Pursuant to its duty to apply that principle upon a national scale, the Commission can prevent unjust rate discrimination by carriers against other shippers and in favor of forwarders. The particular problem here involved is but a segment of the larger complicated national problem of rates with which the Commission must deal. As exemplified by this record, the Commission is 'informed by experience'19 of years in its consideration of the relationship of forwarders to our national transportation system.\n The fact that the Commission acted on its motion without complaints by individual shippers did not detract \n\n[310 \nU.S. 344, 354]\n\u00a0\n from the Commission's power to protect and maintain a transportation system free from partiality to particular shippers. The Commission acted in its capacity as a public agency and carried out duties imposed upon it by Congress in the interest of shippers generally, the national transportation system and the public interest. \n20\n Its order was the embodiment of the Commission's judgment that the proposed tariff was a discrimination prohibited by the Act. 'The judgment so exercised, being supported by ample evidence, is conclusive.' \n21\n\u00a0\n\n The judgment of the court below is reversed and the bill is ordered dismissed.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 49 Stat. 543, 49 U.S.C.A.  301 et seq. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See Interstate Commerce Comm. v.

We granted certiorari because of the importance of that deci- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 371, 376]\n\u00a0\n sion to the administration of the flexible tariff provisions of the Tariff Act of 1930, 46 Stat. 590, 19 U.S.C.A.  1001 et seq. \n309 \nU.S. 643\n, 60 S. Ct. 514, 84 L.Ed. --.\n In compliance with  336(a) of that Act, 19 U.S.C.A.  1336(a), the Tariff Commission, in response to an application for an increased duty on canned clams, instituted an investigation in June 1932, gave public notice of the hearing, held the hearing in October 1932 and gave interested parties an opportunity to be present, to produce evidence, and to be heard. As a result of that investigation the Commission found that the statutory duty of 35% ad valorem on the foreign dutiable value1 did not equalize the difference in the costs of production of the domestic article and the Japanese article. On such a finding the Commission was authorized by  336( a) to recommend to the President an increase or decrease in the statutory rate but not in excess of 50 per cent; or in case the differences could not be equalized in that manner, it was empowered by  336(b) to specify such ad valorem rate of duty based upon the American selling price2 of the domestic article as it found necessary to equalize such differences. In the latter event, however, the statutory rate could not be increased. The Commission found that the rate of duty on foreign value which would be necessary to equalize the difference in costs exceeded the then existing statutory rate by more that 50 per cent. Accordingly it proceeded under  336(b) to specify an ad valorem rate based on American selling price, and recommended to the President an increase in the duty, to be effected by assessing the rate of 35 per cent ad valorem on the American selling price.\n It is provided in  336(c) that the President 'shall by proclamation approve the rates of duty and changes in classification and in basis of value specified in any report of the commission under this section, if in his judgment \n\n[310 \nU.S. 371, 377]\n\u00a0\n such rates of duty and changes are shown by such investigation of the commission to be necessary to equalize such differences in costs of production.' The Proclamation referred to the report and findings of the Commission and concluded that the change in duty recommended was 'in the judgment of the President' necessary for that purpose. After the President issued his Proclamation, respondent imported some canned clams and they were appraised on the basis of the American selling price. It was on an appeal for reappraisement pursuant to  501 that the Proclamation was held invalid by the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals. Its invalidity, according to that court, flowed from the basis on which the Commission computed the Japanese cost of production. By  336(e)(2) the Commission was authorized, when the cost of production of a foreign article was not 'readily ascertainable', to accept as evidence thereof the 'weighted average of the invoice prices or values for a representative period.' The Commission took the weighted average of such prices for the period from December 1, 1930 to September 30, 1932. Those prices were in Japanese yen. Sec. 336 contains no provision for conversion of currency. But the Commission in order to compare those prices with domestic costs converted them into United States dollars, at the average rate of exchange for 1932. That period was selected because Japan went off the gold standard in December 1931 and the value of the yen in terms of United States dollars declined steadily from that date to November 1932.3 \n\n[310 \nU.S. 371, 378]\n\u00a0\n The Court of Customs and Patent Appeals held that it was error to convert invoice prices for one period into United States dollars at the average rate of exchange for another period. In its view the phrase 'weighted average of the invoice prices of values for a representative period' contained in  336(e)(2) must be construed as though it read, 'weighted average of the invoice prices or values in United States currency for a representative period.' The government, however, urges that if the Commission were forced to take the conversion rate for the earlier period, to which it had to resort in order to obtain the invoice prices, it would use a rate which had merely an historical interest and which did not reflect the conditions which made desirable an increase in duties, viz. the depreciation in the value of the yen.\n The determination of foreign exchange value was prescribed, in the procedure outlined by Congress, neither for the action of the Commission nor for that of the President. \n4\n There is no express provision in the Act that the rate of exchange must be taken for the same period as the invoice prices. To imply it would be to add what \n\n[310 \nU.S. 371, 379]\n\u00a0\n Congress has omitted and doubtless omitted in view of the very nature of the problem. The matter was left at large. The President's method of solving the problem was open to scrutiny neither by the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals nor by us. Whatever may be the scope of appellate jurisdiction conferred by  501 of the Tariff Act of 1930,5 it certainly does not permit judicial examination of the judgment of the President that the rates of duty recommended by the Commission are necessary to equalize the differences in the domestic and foreign costs of production.\n The powers which Congress has entrusted to the President under the Act of 1930 do not essentially differ in kind from those which have been granted him under the tariff acts for well over a century. See Norwegian Nitrogen Products Co. v. United States, \n288 \nU.S. 294\n, 308 et seq., 53 S.Ct. 350, 355, for a review of the statutes. Since its creation in 1916 the Commission has acted as an adviser to the Congress or to the President. Under  336 of the Act of 1930 the Commission serves the President in that role. It does not increase or decrease the rates of duty; it is but the expert body which investigates and submits the facts and its recommendations to the President. It is the judgment of the President on those facts which is determinative of whether or not the recommended rates will be promulgated. In substance and to a great extent in form (Norwegian Nitrogen Products Co. v. United States, supra) the action of the Commission and the President is but one stage of the legislative process. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 394\n, 48 S.Ct. 348. 'No one has a legal right to the maintenance of an existing rate or duty.' Norwegian Nitrogen Products Co. v. United States, supra, 288 U.S. page 318, 53 S.Ct. page 359. And the judgment of the \n\n[310 \nU.S. 371, 380]\n\u00a0\n President that on the facts, adduced in pursuance of the procedure prescribed by Congress, a change of rate is necessary is no more subject to judicial review under this statutory scheme than if Congress itself had exercised that judgment. It has long been held that where Congress has authorized a public officer to take some specified legislative action when in his judgment that action is necessary or appropriate to carry out the policy of Congress, the judgment of the officer as to the existence of the facts calling for that action is not subject to review.

Mott, supra, 12 Wheat. pages 31, 32: 'Whenever a statute gives a discretionary power to any person, to be exercised by him upon his own opinion of certain facts, it is a sound rule of construction, that the statute constitutes him the sole and exclusive judge of the existence of those facts.'\n For the judiciary to probe the reasoning which underlies this Proclamation would amount to a clear invasion of the legislative and executive domains. Under the Constitution it is exclusively for Congress, or those to whom it delegates authority, to determine what tariffs shall be imposed. Here the President acted in full conformity with the statute. No question of law is raised when the exercise of his discretion is challenged.\n The other points raised are so unimportant as not to merit discussion.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS is of the opinion that the judgment below should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 1, Sch. 7, Par. 721(b), 19 U.S.C.A.  1001, par. 721(b). \n[\nFootnote 2\n] As defined in  402(g), 19 U.S.C.A.  1402(g). \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The Commission in its report to the President, dated April 5, 1934, stated on this point:\n'The years 1931 and 1932 are representative with respect to the domestic cost of production of canned clams and the invoice prices of Japanese canned clams, in terms of Japanese currency. During most of 1931 the exchange rate of the Japanese yen for the dollar was not much below par, whereas since that time it has been much below par. For this reason the invoice prices of the Japanese product imported in 1931, when converted to dollars at the then current rate of exchange, are not representative of the present or probable future invoice values in terms of dollars. The Commission has, therefore, used, for comparison with the domestic costs, the invoice prices in yen as evidence of costs of the Japanese product during 1931 and 1932, converted to dollars at the average rate of exchange for 1932. Although the exchange rate of the yen has risen since April 1933, the rate now prevailing is not much higher than the average rate for 1932.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Sec. 522(b), 31 U.S.C.A.  372(b), provides that for 'the purpose of the assessment and collection of duties' upon imports, foreign currency shall be converted at values proclaimed by the Secretary of the Treasury for the quarter in which the merchandise was exported. This section clearly has no application to the issue here, since it applies only to assessment and collection of duties-matters outside the functions and duties of the Tariff Commission. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] That section gives either party a right to appeal to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals on 'a question or questions of law only'. \n\n\n\n\n","131":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v.

( 1.)\n The Act granted a right of way through the public lands, with additional lands for stations, etc., and the United States agreed that it would extinguish, as rapidly as consistent with public policy and the welfare of the Indians, the Indian title to all lands falling under the operation of the Act and 'acquired in the donation to the (road).' ( 2.)\n In aid of construction, and to secure transportation of mail, troops, munitions, and public stores, every alternate section of public land, not mineral, was granted to the amount of twenty sections per mile on each side of the line through territories, and ten sections per mile through states. In case any of these sections had been granted, sold, occupied by homestead settlers, or otherwise disposed of at the time of definite location of the railroad opposite such sections, the company was to be entitled to select, in lieu thereof, alternate odd-numbered sections not more than ten miles beyond the limits of the grant. In lieu of mineral lands, the company might \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 325]\n\u00a0\n select a like quantity of agricultural lands 'nearest to the line of said road and within fifty miles thereof.'* ( 3.)\n Whenever twenty-five consecutive miles of any portion of the railroad and telegraph became ready for service, the President was to appoint three Commissioners to examine the same and, upon their favorable report, patents were to be issued to the company for the lands opposite the completed sections. This procedure was to be repeated as each section of twenty-five miles was completed. ( 4.)\n The grant was subject to the conditions that the company should commence work within two years and complete not less than fifty miles per year after the expiration of the second year, and complete and equip the whole road by July 4, 1876. ( 8.) In the event of a breach of these conditions, not cured within one year, the United States might 'do any and all acts and things which may be needful and necessary to insure a speedy completion of the said road.' ( 9.)\n The capital stock was to be publicly offered to the people of the United States; no mortgage or construction bonds were to be issued, or any mortgage lien created, except with the consent of Congress. ( 10.) The road was to be a post and military road, for the use of the United States, subject to regulations imposed by Congress restricting the charges for such use. ( 11.)\n The acceptance of the terms of the Act was to be signified in writing by the board of directors of the company within two years after the passage of the Act. ( 12.)\n Unless the company should obtain bona fide subscriptions to its stock in the amount of $2,000,000 with ten per cent. paid, within two years from the approval of the Act, the Act was to be null and void. ( 19.)\n___ * Enrolled Bill. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 326]\n\u00a0\n Congress reserved power 'at any time, having due regard for the rights of said Northern Pacific Railroad Company,' to 'add to, alter, amend, or repeal' the Act. ( 20.)\n The company claimed to have been duly organized and the incorporators filed the acceptance provided for in  12 within two years.\n The belief that the road could be financed by popular stock subscriptions proved unfounded. The time for commencing and completing the road was twice extended. \n2\n The date ultimately fixed for final completion was July 4, 1879. There tentative route adopted by the company showed a line reaching to Puget Sound via the Yakima River. Ultimately the line was so definitely located and constructed. In 1869 Congress gave consent to the issue of mortgage bonds,3 and also authorized the company to extend a branch line from a point at or near Portland to a suitable point on Puget Sound and to connect the branch with the main line west of the Cascade Mountains but made no land grant except for the right of way. \n4\n The company did not avail itself of either of the privileges granted. May 31, 1870, Congress again authorized the company to issue bonds to aid in the construction and equipment of its road, to be secured by mortgage on all of its property, railroad, land grant, and franchise to be a corporation. It further authorized the location and construction of the main railroad via the valley of the Columbia River to Puget Sound and of a branch from the main line across the Cascade Mountains to Puget Sound, and made a grant of land in connection with the construction authorized between Portland and Puget Sound, on the same terms as the original grant. It also provided a second indemnity belt \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 327]\n\u00a0\n extending ten miles beyond the first on either side of the right of way. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n Pursuant to this authority the company created bonds, secured by mortgage of the railroad and land grant. By December 30, 1871, the line was completed from Carlton, Minnesota, to the Red River at Moorhead; by the spring of 1873 it was completed to the Missouri River at Bismarck, a total distance of four hundred and twenty-four miles. During the same period the road from Portland to Puget Sound was constructed from Kalama, Washington, to Tacoma, a distance of one hundred and six miles. The land grant concomitant to this construction amounted to approximately 10,000, 000 acres.\n The panic of 1873 caused cessation of construction; the company was short of funds; a receiver was appointed and a reorganization effected whereby a bondholders' committee purchased at foreclosure sale, and, jointly with the receiver, reconveyed the property to the company.\n Construction was resumed in 1879 and reached the Yellowstone River in Montana in 1880. In 1879 the company began building eastward at Ainsworth in Washington Territory. The road from Carlton, Minnesota, to Ashland on Lake Superior was completed in 1883. Eastward and westward extensions met at a point in Montana in August, 1883. The Cascade Branch from Pasco to Tacoma was completed in 1887. The company, by contract with the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company, obtained the right to use the line of the latter from Wallula to Portland where it connected with the line to Puget Sound. As sections of twenty-five miles were completed, Commissioners were appointed, examined the road, reported favorably, and the construction was accepted by the President. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 328]\n\u00a0\n The corporation chartered by Congress operated the road until receivers were appointed in 1893. Pursuant to foreclosure proceedings the Northern Pacific Railway Company acquired title to the railroad, the land grant, and all other property of the original corporation and has since operated the road and obtained patents for millions of acres under the land grants.\n The grant of 1864 was of the ten nearest alternate odd-numbered sections of public land, not mineral, on each side of every mile of the line as definitely located, in a state, and of twenty such sections in a territory. This grant was in praesenti. \n6\n The lands thus granted are spoken of as 'place lands'. They were in two belts each twenty miles wide in states, and forty in territories, parallel to the right of way.\n Excepted from the grant were lands reserved, granted, appropriated, preempted, or subject to other claims and rights at the date of definite location. These exempted lands are spoken of as 'lands lost to the grant'. In lieu of such lost lands the Act provided that other lands were to be selected by the company, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, from odd-numbered sections not more than ten miles beyond the place lands, on each side of the road. The two ten-mile strips thus defined are spoken of as 'the first indemnity belts' or 'the first indemnity limits'.\n The Resolution of May 31, 1870, granted, as respects the additional line authorized between Portland and Puget Sound, place and indemnity lands, as granted for the original line by the Act of 1864. It also authorized what are spoken of as 'second indemnity' belts ten miles wide, on either side of the original indemnity limits, in any state or territory in which the company could not obtain the number of sections intended for it by its \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 329]\n\u00a0\n charter. This additional grant, however, was conditioned that lieu lands in the second indemnity limits might be chosen only in the same state or territory in which place lands were lost to the grant.\n Mineral lands are excepted from both grants. In lieu of lands lost because of their mineral character the legislation permits selection of agricultural lands within fifty miles on either side of the right of way. These fifty mile strips are known as 'the mineral indemnity belts'. Their exterior limits coincide with the exterior limits of the first indemnity belt in territories and lie ten miles beyond the exterior limits of the second indemnity belts in states.\n'The ultimate obligation of the Government in respect of the indemnity lands is on the same plane as that respecting the lands in place. The only difference is in the mode of identification. Those in place are identified by filing the map of definite location, and the indemnity lands by selections made in lieu of losses in the place limits.'7\n\n Since the grant excluded mineral lands and gave agricultural lands in lieu thereof, but made no provision for the determination of the character of the lands, Congress passed an Act of February 26, 1895,8 which directed that the mineral character of the lands should be ascertained by a classification by commissioners appointed by the President which, when approved by the Secretary of the Interior, should be final except in case of fraud. Such a classification was made, whereby approximately 3,782,377 acres of place lands and more than 1,000,000 acres of indemnity lands, were ascertained to be mineral.\n Between March 1, 1898, and May 15, 1924, 1,103,424 acres in the first indemnity limits, under the 1864 grant, \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 330]\n\u00a0\n and 961,992 acres in second indemnity limits of the same grant, were withdrawn and placed in national forests and other Government reservations. During the same period 155,727 acres from the first indemnity limits of the grant of 1870, and 213,001 acres from the second indemnity limits laid down under that grant, were withdrawn for the same purposes. This action was taken, in the main, pursuant to an Act of March 3, 1891.9\n The company sought to select indemnity lands within the reservations but the Secretary of the Interior would not accept or approve the selections and the company was unable, by litigation, to compel action favorable to it. \n10\n In 1905, however, the company filed a selection list for over five thousand acres of surveyed lands in a Government forest reserve in Montana. The list was approved and the Secretary of the Interior issued patents. Subsequently, upon discovering that these lands were within the forest reserve, the United States brought suit to cancel the patents. The case reached this court,11 which held that the Act of 1864, and the Resolution of 1870, embodied an offer that, if the company would construct and operate the railroad, it should receive the granted lands; that this offer had ripened into a contract by the company's acceptance and performance; that the promise of indemnity for granted lands not available to the company was a vested right protected from destruction; that, though the lands in the indemnity belts were open to acquisition by settlers before survey, they were open to selection by the company only after survey; and, finally, that withdrawals of indemnity lands for governmental purposes were invalid unless, at the time of withdrawal, there remained nonmineral lands available for selection sufficient to satisfy prior losses to the company \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 331]\n\u00a0\n from the grant. The measure of the grant was held to be the aggregate of the odd-numbered sections within the place limits, subject to certain deductions not here material. Although a stipulation had been filed as to the measure of the grant, the court held that, since the evidence did not disclose that certain necessary deductions from the grant had been made to ascertain the net amount of land to which the company was entitled, the case was not ripe for judgment. Accordingly the cause was remanded for a determination of the alleged deficiency in the grant and for further proceedings dependent upon such determination.\n The Department of Agriculture, which was charged with the administration of the forest reserves, realized that if the company's claims as to the deficiency in the grant, with consequent right of selection of withdrawn lands as indemnity, were sustained, much of the land in the forest reserves would be diverted from the purpose intended by their reservation. The Forester of the United States called the situation to the attention of the Secretary of the Interior and suggested that the latter should investigate a number of questions affecting the company's claims. The Land Office, with the cooperation of the company, undertook an adjustment of the grant and a tentative adjustment was prepared. The Forester raised many objections. Ultimately the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Secretary of the Interior, called the situation to the attention of the President and he and they communicated with Congress. As a result, that body adopted a Joint Resolution on June 5, 1924,12 directing the Secretary of the Interior to withhold approval of any adjustment of the company's land grants and to withhold the issue of further patents; and appointing a Joint Committee to make an investigation of the grants and to report its conclusions and recom- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 332]\n\u00a0\n mendations to Congress. This Committee held protracted hearings, at which the Government departments and the company were represented, and presented evidence amounting to over five thousand printed pages.\n In April 1929 the Committee rendered its report13 recommending passage of a bill authorizing the institution of proceedings by the Attorney General to procure 'a final and complete determination of the respective rights of the United States and the Northern Pacific Railway Co. to the end that the grants shall be finally adjusted and the interests of the United States and the grantee shall be fully protected.' The result was the Act of June 25, 1929. 14 The title indicates that the purpose of the Act was to alter and amend the Act of July 2, 1864, and the Resolution of May 31, 1870; 'to declare forfeited to the United States certain claimed rights asserted' by the company; and 'to direct the institution and prosecution of proceedings looking to the adjustment of the grant.'\n The Act retains for the United States, free of claim by the company, and removes from the grant, any lands within the indemnity limits which, on June 5, 1924, were within the boundaries of any national forest or other Government reservation and which, on the date of withdrawals for governmental purposes, would be, or were, available to the company, by indemnity selection or otherwise, in satisfaction of any deficiency; and directs that the company shall have from the United States such compensation, if any, as the courts hold due for the loss of such lands. ( 1.)\n It declares that all unsatisfied indemnity selection rights, if any exist, claimed by the company, are forfeited to the United States. ( 2.) It reserves the right to amend and repeal the charter act and supplementary \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 333]\n\u00a0\n resolution and asserts the adherence of Congress to the original policy with respect to the company's disposition of granted lands. Right of way lands and those in good faith employed in the operation of the railroad are excluded from the declared forfeiture. ( 3, 4.)\n It directs the Attorney General to bring suit to remove the cloud of the company's claims upon any lands of the United States; to determine all controversies between the United States and the company, and to obtain a full accounting of what the company may be entitled to recover, and what the United States may be entitled to recover; to find and determine the extent of the performance by the United States, and by the company, of the terms of the granting Acts and what lands, if any, have been patented or certified as a result of fraud, mistake of law or fact, or legislative or administrative misapprehension; and, finally, to determine all questions of law and fact germane to a complete adjudication of the respective rights under the granting act and resolution, and all other questions of law and fact presented to the Committee. ( 5.)\n It lays down, in general terms, the considerations which are to govern in the mutual account to be taken between the United States and the company and empowers the court to render such judgments and decrees as law and equity may require. ( 6.)\n It establishes the venue for the trial of the suit, and for appeal, and provides that a reasonable time shall be fixed by the court within which Congress may adopt appropriate legislation to meet the requirements of the judgment. ( 7.)\n It requires reports to Congress from time to time from the Attorney General as to the decisions rendered in the proceeding. ( 8.)\n It provides for the withholding of the approval of the adjustment of the land grants by the Secretary of the \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 334]\n\u00a0\n Interior and for the withholding of patents until the determination of the litigation. ( 9.)\n Pursuant to the Act, the Attorney General caused a bill to be filed, on behalf of the United States, in the District Court for Eastern Washington. The company and the trustees under certain of its mortgages filed answers and motions to dismiss the whole bill and each paragraph. The court referred the motions to a special master. He reported that they should be sustained as to certain paragraphs of the bill. The court overruled exceptions to his report. The case was then again referred to the master before whom testimony was taken upon the issues raised by the answers to those portions of the bill which had not been dismissed. The master reported that the company should be awarded compensation for the loss of the right of indemnity selection in the withdrawn lands, and submitted his calculation of the acreage involved.\n The court, after sustaining certain of the plaintiff's exceptions and dismissing almost all of the defendants', found the company entitled to patents for certain lands outside the reserves and to compensation for the loss of 1,453,061 acres of land within them. The court reserved for future decision the contentions of the mortgagees that they are purchasers for value whose rights cannot be affected by the Government's claim and also ascertainment of the amount to be awarded to the company.\n At this stage of the litigation Congress adopted the Act of May 22, 1936, 15 authorizing a direct appeal from the decree of the District Court to this court. Pursuant to that statute the present appeals by the United States and the company were taken. As to many of the issues the parties have accepted the decision of the Dis- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 335]\n\u00a0\n trict Court. Errors are, however, assigned to the decree below by both the Government and the company.\n The Government concedes that the Act of 1929, supra, is not a declaration of forfeiture for breach of conditions imposed by the Act of 1864 and the Resolution of 1870, but a reference to the courts of all questions as to performance and breach of the contracts created by the Act and the Resolution, to the end that the respective rights and liabilities of the parties may be determined and enforced. The company asserts that the Act of 1929 is an exercise of the power of eminent domain whereby the company is deprived of further right to select indemnity lands, and is to be paid just compensation for the right so taken. But the company does not deny that, in ascertaining the amount due it, the Government may offset the amount of any claims it may now be entitled to assert by reason of the company's breaches of contract.\n The Government urges that the breaches of covenant by the company have been so substantial that it cannot call for further performance by the United States and is, therefore, not entitled to further selection rights or to any money compensation for their abrogation. Reliance is placed upon the following alleged breaches.\n\n 1. \nThe alleged failure of the company to obtain bona fide subscription to its stock and payments thereof required by the Act of 1864.\n Section 19 of the Act of 1864 provides that, unless within two years of its approval the company shall obtain bona fide stock subscriptions to the amount of two million dollars, with ten per cent. paid, the Act shall be null and void.\n Paragraph VI of the bill alleges that, although within the two years pretended subscriptions and payments were made, the pretended payments were sham and a \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 336]\n\u00a0\n fraud upon the corporation and the United States; that the Act thus became void and the company is not entitled to any compensation in the present suit.\n The master recommended that the motion to dismiss this paragraph should be granted, and the District Court so ordered.\n\n 2. \nThe alleged failure of the company to perform the condition of the grant that it complete the whole railroad.\n Section 8 of the Act of 1864 provides that 'each and every grant, right, and privilege herein are so made and given to, and accepted by, said Northern Pacific Railroad Company, upon and subject to the following conditions, namely: That the said company shall commence the work on said road within two years from the approval of this act by the President, and shall complete not less than fifty miles per year after the second year, and shall construct, equip, furnish, and complete the whole road by the fourth day of July, anno Domini eighteen hundred and seventy-six.' The time for the completion of the road was extended by Congress to July 4, 1879. It is undisputed that the company never definitely located or built that portion of its line embracing the two hundred and twenty-five miles between Wallula and Portland. Instead, it made a contract for running rights over the tracks of the Oregon Railway & Navigation Company.\n In paragraphs XIV and XXVI of the bill the United States alleges that the road was never completed. The master recommended that the company's motion to dismiss these paragraphs be granted. The court so ordered.\n\n 3. \nThe claim that diversion of funds in the building of branch lines disentitles the company to select further lands.\n Paragraph XIV of the bill alleges that, through various described contracts and transactions, the funds of \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 337]\n\u00a0\n the Northern Pacific Railroad Company were used in the building of branch lines which were unjustified and unprofitable and that further funds were, under contract, advanced to such branch lines to keep them in operation. It is alleged that these things were done at a time when the company had not completed its main line from Wallula to Portland. The bill charges that the illegal and fraudulent conduct it describes resulted in the branch lines receiving unconscionable and illegal profits at the cost of the Northern Pacific when the latter's funds should have been used to complete its main line, all in violation of the contract between the United States and the Northern Pacific created by the Act of 1864 and the Resolution of 1870. The master recommended that this paragraph be dismissed in the view that the transactions in question did not disentitle the company to exercise indemnity selection rights in connection with the grant so far as concerns the road actually constructed. The court dismissed the paragraph.\n\n 4. \nThe claim that the company failed to perform its contract by refusing to open lands granted it by the Resolution of 1870 to settlement and preemption at $2.50 per acre.\n Section 10 of the Act of 1864 provides that 'no mortgage or construction bonds shall ever be issued by said company on said road, or mortgage, or lien made in any way, except by the consent of the congress of the United States.'\n An additional line was authorized by the Joint Resolution of 1870 and a land grant made therefor. The Resolution empowered the company to issue bonds in aid of construction and equipment, and to 'secure the same by mortgage on its property and rights of prop- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 338]\n\u00a0\n erty of all kinds and descriptions, real, personal, and mixed, including its franchise as a corporation.' The Resolution further provided 'that all lands hereby granted to said company which shall not be sold or disposed of or remain subject to the mortgage by this act authorized, at the expiration of five years after the completion of the entire road, shall be subject to settlement and preemption like other lands, at a price to be paid to said company not exceeding two dollars and fifty cents per acre.'\n Paragraph XIII of the Bill refers to these provisions of the Joint Resolution and alleges that among the place lands granted there are many million acres the quantity and description of which are known only to the company, or its predecessor, which should have been opened to settlement and preemption whereas they were, subsequent to July 4, 1884, (five years from the date finally fixed for completion of the road), sold at such prices, and on such conditions, as to the company seemed best, and that this was a breach of the company's contract with the United States and defeated the policy of the United States. The master reached the conclusion that the motion to dismiss paragraph XIII should be sustained and the court so ruled.\n The Government insists that the Resolution required the company to hold the lands open for settlement, at the price and in parcels as specified, after five years, whether mortgaged or not; that it failed to do so, and sold the lands at higher prices and in larger parcels than the Resolution required, and that its breach of covenant defeats its right to any award. The company contends that the intent of the Resolution was to permit it to mortgage all its property rights; that if, at the expiration of five years from the completion of the road, any of the granted lands were undisposed of, or were \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 339]\n\u00a0\n not subject to mortgage, those lands were open to pre-emption; that, whether or not the existence of a mortgage prevented settlement of the lands, after five years, there was no duty on the company to dispose of them to settlers; and that the company has not broken any covenant in respect of the lands in question.\n\n 5. \nThe claim that unauthorized withdrawals of place and indemnity lands preclude any award to the company.\n Section 3 of the Act of 1864 grants place lands 'on each side of said railroad line, as said company may adopt', and fixes the date of passage of title to the company as 'the time the line of said road is definitely fixed.' Section 6 provides that the President shall cause the place lands to be surveyed 'after the general route shall be fixed.'\n Pursuant to preliminary surveys, the Railroad Company filed with the Secretary of the Interior a map showing the general route of the proposed line. Thereupon the Secretary caused place limits to be laid down on either side of the proposed general route and withdrew from sale or entry the odd-numbered sections within those limits. In 1903 this court held that title to the granted place lands did not vest in the company until the filing of a map of definite location and that, consequently, the withdrawal of the lands by the Secretary prior to that time and coterminous with the general route was unauthorized. \n16\n\u00a0\n\n After the company had filed its maps of definite location the Secretary mapped the indemnity limits specified by the Act of 1864 and withdrew the lands comprehended within those limits from sale or entry. In 1888 the then Secretary held that land within in the indemnity limits was open to preemption under the homestead \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 340]\n\u00a0\n laws and that such preemption, even before actual survey of the lands, deprived the company of the right to select the lands preempted. This view was adopted by this court in 1901.17\n Paragraph XXXII of the bill recites these facts and alleges that, by virtue of the withdrawals, the Railroad Company and the Railway Company have received benefits, lands, and values to which they were not entitled, to the injury of the United States. The master recommended that the motion to dismiss the paragraph be sustained and the court so decreed.\n\n 6. \nThe claim that the foreclosures and reorganizations of the railroad and its property disentitle the company to select further lands.\n The Resolution of 1870 authorized the railroad company to issue its bonds and secure the same by mortgage on its property of every kind and provided that if the mortgage authorized should at any time be enforced by foreclosure or other legal proceeding, or the mortgaged lands granted by the Resolution, or any of them, should be sold by the mortgage trustees, upon default, 'such lands shall be sold at public sale, at places within the States and Territories in which they shall be situate, after not less than sixty days' previous notice, in single sections or subdivisions thereof, to the highest and best bidder ....'\n The bill alleges that two reorganizations occurred,-one in 1875 and the other in 1896. As respects the first, it is charged that, pursuant to court order, the trustees of the mortgage conveyed the mortgaged railroad and property in a block to certain individuals who thereupon retransferred to the railroad company under an arrangement whereby mortgage bondholders received preferred stock in lieu of their bonds, such preferred stock to be \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 341]\n\u00a0\n redeemed from the proceeds of the sale of the company's lands. With respect to the latter foreclosure it is alleged that the company, after reorganization, created a number of mortgages which were foreclosed and that, in the course of the foreclosure, sales of the mortgaged lands, while made in the respective states and territories where they lay, and although made section by section, were all, by prearrangement, purchased by, or in behalf of, a new company, whereas it was the intent of Congress that they should be so sold as to give individuals an opportunity to acquire them.\n Paragraphs IX, X, XI, XII, XVI and XVIII describe the transactions in great detail and charge that what was done was in the teeth of the policy of the United States and to its injury. The master recommended dismissal of these paragraphs and the court adopted his recommendation. The United States insists that what was done constitutes a breach of the company's obligation under the Resolution of 1870 so substantial as to disentitle it to any further performance of the land grants. The company asserts that the reorganization of 1875 involved no sale of the mortgaged lands within the contemplation of the statute but a mere device for reinvesting the company with its lands, freed of the mortgage, and that the foreclosure sales made in the reorganization of 1896 were made in strict and exact accordance with the provisions of the Resolution of 1870.\n The Government asserts that none of the paragraphs referred to above should have been dismissed. It says that each of the breaches charged was so substantial as to disentitle the company to further performance by the United States. But, in any event, it says that all of them, taken together, certainly require this conclusion. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 342]\n\u00a0\n The company, on the other hand, contends that, as to some of the matters charged, the allegations of the bill do not show any breach, and that, as to others, if a breach is sufficiently alleged it was not such as, in the light of the history of the grants and the performance received by the United States, would disentitle the company to all further performance.\n If the Government's position is sound the decree below should be reversed and the cause remanded with instructions to enter a judgment against the company and in favor of the United States.\n The justices who heard this case are equally divided in opinion upon these issues. No opinion is expressed upon them, and they are reserved, in view of the fact that our rulings on other issues may be dispositive of the entire controversy.\n The Government puts forward certain further claims which, if sustained, would preclude any recovery by the company.\n\n 7. \nThe claim that no compensation should have been awarded because unsurveyed public lands were available for selection, and the company failed to show that it would, or could, have selected and obtained all of the withdrawn lands.\n The District Court found that, at March 1, 1898, just prior to the first forest withdrawal, the company had unsatisfied losses of 5,946,664 acres under the 1864 grant and that the total lands available for selection at the date were 1,137,508 acres, leaving a deficiency in the grant of 4,809,156 acres; and the deficiency in the 1870 grant, excluding available land in second indemnity limits, at March 1, 1898, was 593,656 acres, and there has been, ever since, a deficiency in respect of that grant. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 343]\n\u00a0\n In these findings the court computed as lands available for selection only nonmineral, surveyed, vacant land. The company asserts that in this the court was right. The Government insists that vacant unsurveyed lands were 'available' as indemnity to the company notwithstanding the concession that, as lands selected must be identified, the company cannot select them until they have been so identified by survey. \n18\n It says the company failed to show that there were not ample unsurveyed lands within the indemnity limits to set off losses in the place limits at the time of the withdrawals and adds that, inasmuch as homesteaders might, in the interim, obtain prior rights by actual settlement of these unsurveyed lands, 19 it is a matter of pure speculation whether the company would ultimately have obtained adequate indemnity even if unsurveyed lands had not been withdrawn for forest reserves. It further claims that if the court below had treated unsurveyed lands as available for indemnity selection, there would have been no deficiency at the dates of withdrawal.\n These contentions cannot be sustained.\n Decision turns on the inquiry as to what lands were available to the company for selection at the time of the respective governmental withdrawals.\n It is, of course, evident that the company could not select mineral lands as indemnity. It follows that all lands classified as mineral were excluded from selection.\n By Sec. 3 of the Act of 1864 it is provided that whenever any of the place lands granted to the company \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 344]\n\u00a0\n shall have been, prior to the time of definite location of the road, 'granted, sold, reserved, occupied by homestead settlers, or pree mpted, or otherwise disposed of, other lands shall be selected by said company in lieu thereof, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, in alternate sections, and designated by odd numbers, ....'\n The fact that the lands in the indemnity limits are, before survey, subject to be taken by preemptors and settlers, and thus ultimate satisfaction of the railroad company may be defeated, does not justify the Government itself in reserving lands contained within those limits and thus rendering impossible the company's obtaining them. This was definitely held in the Forest Reserve Case. \n 20\n\u00a0\n\n Much was said in argument as to the meaning of the phrase 'lands available as indemnity' as used in that case. It seems clear that unsurveyed lands are not available to the company under the Act of 1864. It will be observed that the company must select indemnity lands under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior. That officer has invariably ruled that no selection can be made or approved until the lands in question are surveyed. \n21\n\u00a0\n\n This ruling was necessitated by the very terms of the Act of 1864, which requires selection of alternate sections designated by odd numbers. Obviously, until surveyed, no odd-numbered sections could exist. Unsurveyed lands are not public lands. \n22\n\u00a0\n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 345]\n\u00a0\n The decision in the Forest Reserve Case, supra, did not suggest any different view. The allegation of deficiency in indemnity lands in that case, found in the stipulation of the parties, was that the lands were those odd-numbered sections which the defendant was entitled to select under the regulations of the Land Department. This could only mean, and the decision could only have gone upon the view that it meant, that the surveyed lands within the indemnity limits were deficient to meet the selection rights of the railroad company. The case is not an authority, as the Government contends, for the proposition that unsurveyed vacant lands within the indemnity limits are to be considered as available to the company in ascertaining whether the Government has reserved to itself lands as to which the company has selection rights. Under the doctrine of the Forest Reserve Case the challenged withdrawals for forest and other governmental purposes left the indemnity lands available to the company deficient to satisfy its rights of selection.\n The holding was that the withdrawals were void and the company's rights remained as if the withdrawals had never been made. If and when any of the withdrawn lands were surveyed the company was entitled to select them, as it did in the Forest Reserve Case.\n It would appear, however, that the Government's contention is moot as respects all but 23,364 acres of lands in Idaho second indemnity limits for which the company was awarded compensation by the District Court's decree. If unsurveyed vacant lands remaining within the indemnity limits after a government withdrawal are to be treated as available to the company for selection, then the grant was not deficient as respects second indemnity limits in Idaho and the company should not have been awarded compensation for the acreage mentioned. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 346]\n\u00a0\n As respects withdrawals from first indemnity limits of the 1864 grant, and withdrawals from the limits of the 1870 grant, it appears to be undisputed that, other contentions of the Covernment, such as that with respect to the noncompletion of the entire road, being laid to one side, the withdrawals left the grants deficient even though unsurveyed lands remaining within the limits after the withdrawals be counted as available to the company. And the same conclusion would seem to be required respecting lands within the second indemnity limits in Montana with the exception of 4004.38 acres withdrawn on July 14, 1899.\n Thus the issue becomes, to a large extent, moot but, as respects approximately 30,000 acres above referred to, we think what has been said on the subject of the availability of unsurveyed lands sustains the decree of the District Court.\n The Government, however, argues that even though the withdrawals for governmental purposes created such a deficiency of lands available for selection that, to satisfy the grant, the company would have been compelled to select lands within the withdrawn reserves, nevertheless, in order to obtain indemnity for the deficiency so created, the company is bound to prove that it would have selected lands within the reserves, and what lands it would have selected, before it can claim compensation from the Government for the deprivation of its right to select. A majority of the justices who heard the case think the position is untenable.\n Under the ruling in the Forest Reserve Case it was the obligation of the Government to refrain from any action which would deprive the company of its right of selection in accordance with the terms of the grant. When the United States withdrew the lands for forest and other reserves it signified its purpose to retain them for its own use and not to allow the company or anyone \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 347]\n\u00a0\n else to obtain them, any law or contract to the contrary notwithstanding. We think the company's right of selection, to the extent of the deficiency in the grant, remained available as to the withdrawn lands, provided the lands selected were such as are defined in the grant. The Government's contention that no one can say how soon the lands would have been surveyed and selected if they had not been withdrawn and reserved, or, if they had remained unsurveyed and not withdrawn, that areas would have been taken up by settlers and preemptors, does not avail to abrogate or qualify the company's right to exercise its privilege of selection notwithstanding the withdrawals. Moreover, the argument ignores the repeal of the preemption laws by the Act of March 3, 1891.23\n\n 8. \nThe claim that the company should be charged with 13,300,000 acres wrongfully received because lying within Indian reservations.\n Paragraph XXIX of the bill alleges that by treaties of September 17, 1851, and October 17, 1855,24 the United States 'reserved' certain lands for Indian tribes. The paragraph alleges that the place and indemnity belts established by the Act of 1864 crossed certain of the lands reserved by the treaties, and that, by mistake and without lawful authority, the company received from the United States lands comprised in the reservations amounting to about 12,000,000 acres in place and first indemnity limits and 1,300,000 acres in second indemnity limits; that for all of them it had obtained patents to which it was not entitled, as it should have known.\n In accordance with the master's recommendation, the court below sustained the motion to dismiss paragraph XXIX on the ground that the lands in question were \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 348]\n\u00a0\n granted to the company by the Act of 1864 and the Resolution of 1870. We think the court was right.\n By an Act of June 30, 1834,25 all lands lying west of the Mississippi River, not within the States of Missouri and Louisiana or the Territory of Arkansas, were designated as Indian Country. The fee of all this territory was in the United States, subject to the Indian right of occupancy. The treaties of 1851 and 1855 did not alter the status of the lands described in them. The purpose of those treaties was to establish peace and amity between warring Indian tribes inter sese and between the tribes and the United States. To this end the country or territory of each tribe was described and the tribes agreed to respect the boundaries named in the treaties. No alteration in the status of the lands had occurred up to the date of definite location of the Northern Pacific's line. About seven hundred miles of the railroad traversed the area embraced in the treaties.\n By  2 of the Act of 1864 it was provided that 'The United States shall extinguish, as rapidly as may be consistent with public policy and the welfare of the said Indians, the Indian titles to all lands falling under the operation of this act, and acquired in the donation to the (road) named in this bill.' The Government now contends that this section is inapplicable to any but right-of-way lands lying within the areas described by the treaties. The contention was not made or considered below, and we think, if it were open here, the plain language of the section renders it untenable.\n Section 3 limits the land grant to lands as to which the United States 'have full title, not reserved, sold, granted, or otherwise appropriated, and free from pree mption, or other claims or rights, at the time the line of said road is definitely fixed, ....' The Government contends that this section excludes lands embraced \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 349]\n\u00a0\n within the treaty limits for the reason that the treaties 'reserve' all the lands described in them for the signatory Indian tribes. We think the contention is unsound.\n As we have noted, the treaties did not create technical reservations as have many other treaties and acts of Congress. They did not set aside a defined territory for the exclusive use of a tribe nor contain the usual provisions for an Indian Agent for schools, assistance in farming operations, etc. The county described in the Treaty of 1851 amounts to 163, 000,000 acres and, that described in the Treaty of 1855, to 37,000,000 acres. In the case of one of the tribes if the treaty were considered to create a technical reservation it would have allotted to each man, woman, and child in the tribe more than eighteen square miles.\n The Department of the Interior, as is evidenced by the patents issued, has consistently treated the lands in question as included in the grant. This court has repeatedly passed upon the question; has held the lands were Indian country, subject only to the Indians' right of occupancy; were within the grant made by the Act of 1864, and that, by  2 of the Act, the United States assumed the obligation of extinguishing the Indian title in favor of the company. \n26\n\u00a0\n\n We come now to the contentions of the Government which go to the quantum of the award.\n\n 9. \nThe claim that the company should be charged with approximately 1, 400,000 acres received as the result of adoption of an unnecessarily circuitous route.\n Section 1 of the Act of 1864 empowered the company to locate and construct a continuous railroad line from \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 350]\n\u00a0\n a point on Lake Superior 'westerly by the most eligible railroad route, as shall be determined by said company, ... to some point on Puget's Sound, with a branch, via the valley of the Columbia River, to a point at or near Portland, ....' The Resolution of 1870 authorized the company to construct its main line to a point on Puget Sound via the valley of the Columbia River, with the right to locate its branch from a point on the main line, across the Cascade Mountains, to Puget Sound.\n Paragraph XXVI alleged that the company was required to construct its railroad to the western terminus upon the most direct and practicable line without unnecessary deviations but that, instead of doing so, the company built the road from Lind, Washington, to Ellensburg, Washington, by an unnecessarily circuitous route southwestward to Pasco on the Coumbia River and thence northwestward via the valley of the Yakima, whereas it could have constructed the line nearly due westward from Lind to Ellensburg and have saved about eighty-two miles; that, by reason of this unnecessary circuity, approximately 1,400,000 acres were added to the lands within the limits described in the grant over and above the amount which would have been included had the more direct route been followed. The allegations of the paragraph are that, after filing general route maps, the company ultimately filed definite maps of location and thereupon the Department of the Interior surveyed and patented to it lands lying along the line; that this was an error as the Department should have refused to patent place lands or allow selection of indemnity lands coterminous with the circuitous route. The paragraph contains no averment that the route was selected by the company fraud- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 351]\n\u00a0\n ulently in order to obtain additional lands or that it was not in good faith thought to be the most eligible route. The paragraph refers to the fact that subsequently the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway located its line from Lind to Ellensburg by the more direct route. The master recommended that the motion to dismiss the paragraph be sustained and the court so ordered. We think there was no error in this disposition of the matter.\n The Joint Resolution of 1870 called for the main line to run via the valley of the Columbia River to Puget Sound with a branch line from a convenient point on the main line across the Cascade Mountains to Puget Sound. In pursuance of this requirement the company filed a map of definite location and constructed its route between Spokane and Wallula on the Columbia River. At that point it was able to make a connection with the Oregon Railway & Navigation Company. In 1880 it, therefore, entered into a contract for running rights over the line of that railroad and has used its line for traffic into Portland. It was natural, in this situation, to lay out the authorized branch line over the Cascade Mountains from the main line at Pasco. Maps of the line from Pasco to Tacoma were approved by the Secretary of the Interior between June 1883 and December 1884. Inspection reports in 1879 and 1880, made to the Secretary of the Interior, show that the Department was familiar with the line the company was building.\n On March 3, 1893, Congress ratified an agreement for the payment to the Yakima Indians for right of way through their reservation provided the company should, within sixty days, pay the necessary money therefor into the Treasury of the United States. \n27\n This action shows that Congress was fully informed of the adopted route and cooperated in making its construction feasible. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 352]\n\u00a0\n The master and the court below judicially noticed that the route via the Yakima valley was a much more advantageous one in respect of the country traversed, and the probable available traffic, than the more direct route between Lind and Ellensburg. The total population along the latter is said to be less than a thousand persons and the traffic originating thereon practically nil. On the other hand, the Yakima valley is one of the most fertile and productive agricultural sections in the Northwest.\n The circuity is not such as to be an obvious evasion of the terms of the grant, and in the absence of any charge of fraud, it must be taken that the directors of the company considered the line laid out the most eligible one. We think the allegations of the paragraph do not support the contention that the company illegally acquired place and indemnity lands contiguous to this portion of its line.\n 10. The claim that the company should have been charged with 1,198, 000 acres received as indemnity in the second indemnity belt in Montana and should not have been awarded compensation for 170,000 acres in the same belt.\n Under the Act of 1864 losses of land in the place limits could be supplied only in the first and the mineral indemnity limits. The Resolution of 1870 added a second indemnity belt in which selections could be made only for losses in the same state or territory occurring through reservation, preemption, or other disposition subsequent to the passage of the Act of 1864.\n As has been stated under heading 8, supra, the Land Office properly treated the lands within the boundaries described by the treaty of 185128 as available under the grant. By the Crow Treaty of 186829 a distinct and \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 353]\n\u00a0\n exclusive reservation for that tribe was carved out of the larger territory designated in the earlier days as the Crow country. The Land Office treated the lands thus specifically reserved as lost to the grant and permitted indemnity selections from the second indemnity belt in Montana, in which State the loss occurred.\n It appears that, by virtue of withdrawals chiefly for forest reserves in Montana, the company has been deprived of the right to select about 170, 000 acres of lieu lands, about 64,000 acres of which losses were due to the creation of the Crow Reservation. In its computation of the lands for which the company was entitled to indemnity and compensation in this suit the court below included this entire acreage.\n The Government contends that the court should have charged the company with the indemnity lands received in second indemnity limits in Montana due to alleged losses from the creation of the Crow Reservation and that it should not have awarded any further compensation for the loss of selection rights in that belt resulting from the creation of the Crow Reservation, or otherwise, as the company had already received more than was proper. We think the position cannot be maintained.\n As shown under heading 8, supra, no lands were removed from the operation of the grant by the Treaties of 1851 and 1855. On the other hand, the creation of the Crow Reservation-a typical Indian reservation-in 1868, removed the lands in that reservation from the grant within the intent and meaning of the Act of 1864, as supplemented by the Joint Resolution of 1870, and conferred the right to indemnity selections from the second indemnity belt within the same state.\n 11. The credit to the company for lands within the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation.\n The court below, in its award, treated the company as entitled to select indemnity lands in first and second \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 354]\n\u00a0\n indemnity limits where these limits lay within the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation in Montana. The area in question was part of the Crow country recognized by the Treaty of September 17, 1851.30 When in 1868, the Crow Reservation was created, the Crow Nation ceded all its right and title in other lands embraced within the treaty area to the United States. By an Executive Order of March 19, 1900, the lands in question became part of the Northern Cheyenne Reservation. This action was confirmed by Congress June 3, 1926,31 which declared that the lands were the property of the Northern Cheyennes, authorized allotments, etc.\n The Government contends that these lands were not, on June 5, 1924- the pivotal date mentioned in the Act of June 25, 1929-'embraced within the exterior boundaries of any national forest or other Government reservation.'\n We think that under the terms of the Act these lands had been withdrawn as a 'Government reservation' and for 'governmental purposes'; and the Act which authorized this suit contemplated that compensation should be awarded for lands so withdrawn, which, but for the withdrawal, would have been available to the company as indemnity.\n 12. The award for land within the reservations on which homesteaders filed prior to June 5, 1924, and for which they received patents after June 5, 1924.\n After the withdrawals had been made homesteaders filed on certain of the lands within the forest reserves. These filings were prior to June 5, 1924. Subsequent to that date patents were issued under the forest homestead laws. The court below, we think properly, treated these \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 355]\n\u00a0\n lands as having been available for indemnity selection by the company at the date of withdrawal and awarded the company compensation for the abrogation of its right to select them. The Government asserts that this was error, in the view that the Act of 1929 awarded compensation only for those lands which would be, or were, available for selection on June 5, 1924. The Act, however, does not so provide. It awards indemnity for lands which, on June 5, 1924, were embraced in any reservation, and 'which, in the event of a deficiency in the said land grants to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company upon the dates of the withdrawals of the said indemnity lands for governmental purposes, would be, or were,' available for selection.\n 13. The claim that, as to more than a million acres, the award rests upon a fraudulent mineral classification which will not support indemnity selection rights.\n Section 3 of the Act of 1864, granting odd-numbered sections, excluded mineral lands from the grant. The section provides that iron or coal lands are not to be classed as mineral. In lieu of mineral lands the company is given the right to select a like quantity of 'unoccupied and unappropriated agricultural lands, in odd numbered sections, nearest to the line of said road and within fifty miles thereof,' ....\n One of the contentions strongly pressed by the Department of Agriculture before the Joint Committee acting under the Resolution of June 5, 1924, was that, due to the company's fraud, great quantities of place lands had been improperly classified as mineral, with the result that the company had been allowed to select, and had received patents for, over a million acres of land in lieu of those so classified. The company resisted this contention. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 356]\n\u00a0\n By the Act of June 25, 1929, this matter was remitted to the courts for adjudication. Section 5 directs that in the judicial proceedings contemplated there shall be presented, and the court shall consider, make findings relating to, and determine, to what extent the terms, conditions and covenants of the granting acts have been performed by the United States and the company, including the question what lands, if any, have been wrongfully or erroneously patented or certified as the result of fraud. Section 6 requires that, in fixing the amount of compensation to be received by the company on account of the retention by the United States of indemnity lands for national forests or Government reserves, the court shall determine what quantities in lands or values the company and its predecessors have received as a result of fraud and that such excess lands and values, if any, shall be charged against the company in the judgment of the court.\n Paragraph XXVIII of the complaint refers to the Act of February 26, 1895, 32 providing for the examination and classification, as mineral or nonmineral, of place and indemnity lands within four land districts in Idaho and Montana; recites the appointment and functioning of the Commissions authorized by the Act; alleges that the Commissioners undertook to classify approximately 11,500,000 acres of land, and pretended to classify the same; filed their reports which, with minor exceptions, were approved by the Secretary of the Interior; asserts that 3, 782,377 acres, more or less, were classified as mineral, and that the company, and its predecessor in interest, made mineral lieu selections totaling 1,330,762 acres, more or less, and received patents therefor; alleges that the company is claiming additional indemnity lands of approximately 2,451,615 acres \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 357]\n\u00a0\n in lieu of lands classified as mineral; and charges that the company, and its predecessor, were guilty of fraudulent and collusive practices whereby the Commissioners were persuaded to classify, as mineral, lands of little value, so that the railroad could select more valuable lands in lieu thereof, and that the lands so selected and patented to the company were of a value in excess of the entire 3,782,377 acres, more or less, of lands fraudulently classified as mineral.\n The company moved to dismiss the paragraph and in its answer denied the allegations. The master recommended that the motion be sustained and the court so ordered. In this we think there was error.\n The master, after considering the facts set out, and matters of which he took judicial notice, stated that he would have no difficulty in overruling the motion to dismiss had it not been for the position taken by the Government in argument. The master states that a goodly portion of the nearly 4,000,000 acres classified as mineral consisted of lands within the forest reserves, which by the Act of June 25, 1929, the Government signified its intention to retain, that still other lands so classified had been patented to claimants as mineral claims, and that the Government had sold much valuable timber from still other of such lands. The master says that in the light of these facts he inquired of counsel whether the Government desired a reclassification by reason of the alleged fraud and that the reply was in the negative. He reports that counsel contended the Government's pleading was meant to meet and defeat the company's claim, on the theory that, as to the lands classified as mineral and the claims to lieu lands therefor, the company must be treated as a plaintiff, and, as Paragraph XXVIII disclosed that the company did not have clean hands, it could not maintain its claim. The master overruled this contention, holding that the com- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 358]\n\u00a0\n pany was, in this case, a defendant and that the doctrine of clean hands did not apply to a defendant in equity.\n Whatever gloss Government counsel may have put upon the paragraph, we think the master and the court below were bound to give full effect to the pleading and that the master was right in his original view that the facts set up, and the issues made by the answer, required a trial; and, if the Government succeeds in maintaining the truth of its allegations, the company should be charged with lands or values obtained as mineral indemnity through the fraud of its agents and their collusion with the Commissioners.\n Although it is alleged, and the master found, that it was impossible in the time allowed by Congress for the Commissioners to make such a survey and classification as the legislation contemplated, we think the reports and the Secretary's approval and acceptance thereof, create a prima facie showing in favor of the classification and the company's selection of indemnity lands.\n The United States pleaded the fraud which it says renders the classification, and the actions consequent upon it, a nullity. We think it necessarily has the burden of proof to sustain its pleading. It is not barred by laches or estoppel from asserting and proving the alleged fraud, and from having the company charged with the lands or values received as a result of it.\n The case must go back for a trial of the issues made by paragraph XXVIII of the complaint and the answer thereto. It may be that on the trial the Government's evidence will prove fraud on the part of the company of such a character and extent as would disentitle the latter to any award even though the fraud does not extend to an acreage equal in extent to that of the selection rights taken away by the Act of 1929.\n 14. The meaning of the phrase 'agricultural lands' in the provision for selection in lieu of excepted mineral lands.\n In computing the deficiency of lands available for indemnity selection the District Court included the nearly \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 359]\n\u00a0\n two million acres of mineral losses as to which indemnity selection had not been made at the time of the withdrawals and treated the withdrawn lands as available for selection in respect of mineral losses. The Government insists that this was error because much of the withdrawn land is not agricultural and is not, therefore, available as indemnity for mineral losses. The company, on the other hand, asserts that in the granting Act the word 'agricultural' is not used in its ordinary sense of tillable or cultivable but as meaning merely lands not mineral. It bases this contention largely upon the alleged administrative construction and practise of the Department of the Interior which, so it claims, has treated the word 'agricultural' as a term of classification and not one of strict definition. 33 This was the view taken by the master and the District Court.\n Section 3 of the Act of 1864, which contains the grant to the railroad, employs three descriptions of public lands. The place land granted is denominated 'public land, not mineral'; the lieu lands which may be selected to make up losses in the place lands are referred to as 'other lands'; the mineral lieu lands are designated as 'unoccupied and unappropriated agricultural lands'.\n The Act seems to have served as a model for other railroad grants made shortly thereafter. Section 3 of an Act of July 27, 1866,34 which incorporated and granted lands to the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad Company, is \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 360]\n\u00a0\n in the same words except that the mineral indemnity is limited to a distance of twenty miles from the line. Section 9 of an Act of March 3, 1871,35 incorporating and granting lands to the Texas Pacific Railroad Company, employs the same phraseology.\n The granting clause of the Act of 1964, differed from those theretofore commonly used. In earlier acts indemnity selections were required to be of lands nearest the line. By the Act of 1864 lands in lieu of place lands previously sold, or otherwise disposed of, might be selected from land anywhere within the indemnity belt. In the mineral indemnity provision, however, Congress reverted to the earlier practise of requiring that agricultural lands nearest to the line, but within an unusually wide belt of fifty miles on either side, should be selected. It seems obvious that this provision was inserted in the knowledge that the mountainous Western country would afford less opportunity to obtain good lands by indemnity selection than the more level farming country to the East.\n It is also to be noted that the bill as it passed the House omitted a provision found in bills earlier introduced in aid of railroads in the far West, requiring that the lieu lands for mineral losses should not only be those nearest the line, but 'nearest the line of the road through said mineral lands ....'36 In the Senate the grant of mineral indemnity was stricken out and mineral lands were defined to exclude coal and iron. \n37\n The bill passed the Senate in this form and was sent to a Conference Committee. \n38\n The measure came from the Conference Committee in the form in which it finally passed. The \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 361]\n\u00a0\n Act thus permitted a selection of agricultural lieu lands not only in the territory adjacent to the mineral place lands but within fifty miles on either side of the right of way anywhere along the entire route of the road. It has consistently been so construed and the company has been allowed to select, as mineral indemnity, lands not more than fifty miles from its right of way opposite any part of the road and in any state traversed by the line. \n39\n\u00a0\n\n The Government contends that 'agricultural' means 'presently tillable' or 'presently fit for the plough'. We agree, however, with the master and the court below that the words 'mineral' and 'agricultural' as used in the Act are not to be read strictly as defined by the dictionary. Mineral lands, as the phrase has been applied in the administration of public lands, embrace not only those which the lexicon defines as mineral, but, in addition, such as are valuable for deposits of marble, slate, petroleum, asphaltum, and even guano. Likewise, in the administration of preemption and homestead legislation, the terms 'agricultural' and 'cultivation' have been given a liberal construction. It appears from the record, and from the evidence before the Joint Congressional Committee, that a preemptor or a homesteader, under the acts requiring settlement and cultivation as a prerequisite to a patent, have been allowed to take up forests, grazing land, and, in fact, all types of land which, in good faith, were sought for a home, provided the lands could, be the settler's effort, be made habitable \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 362]\n\u00a0\n and used as a farm home. This has been true in spite of the fact that the applicable acts of Congress have required cultivation as a prerequisite to acquisition by the preemptor or homesteader. \n 40\n\u00a0\n\n Under the administrative practise, although lands containing timber could be taken for homes in the public land states, a certain portion of the lands had to be cleared preliminary to cultivation. But, the preemptor or homesteader has not been permitted to take up lands valuable only for timber or for stone or for some other use, which could not be rendered cultivable or usable in a broad sense for farming, by clearing or other work done thereon. Pursuant to legislation enacted years after the grants to the company, lands unfit for a farm home could be acquired. \n41\n\u00a0\n\n It seems to us that inasmuch as the railroad company could not take other mineral lands in lieu of mineral place lands lost to the grant and, if it were confined to non-mineral lands, contiguous to the lost mineral lands, it would probably receive lands then considered of little or no value, Congress, by the use of the term 'agricultural', and by granting the right to select the lieu lands anywhere along the line, intended to give the company the privilege of taking more valuable lands than those wild forest lands contiguous to the mineral place lands in the Western mountain regions.\n The truth seems to be that, in extending this privilege to select more valuable lands, Congress did not have in mind a distinction between 'non-mineral' and 'agricul- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 363]\n\u00a0\n tural' lands, in the sense that the company must select the more valuable agricultural lands and refrain from taking less valuable lands non-mineral but not susceptible of cultivation. As the master well says, at the time of the grant agricultural lands in states eastward of the Rocky Mountains were far more valuable than the rough mountain lands farther to the west. It is reasonable to suppose that, at that time, neither Congress nor the company contemplated the selection of unusable mountain lands rather than lands ultimately available for agriculture. Nevertheless, we are bound to attribute some meaning to the language Congress employed. It is obvious that, by the use of the word 'agricultural', the company was precluded from selecting other mineral lands in lieu of mineral lands lost in the place limits. With mineral lands thus excluded, we think the phrase 'agricultural' is to be interpreted in the light of existing legislation and conditions.\n We are of the view that the word 'agricultural' was not, therefore, used as synonymous with 'non-mineral' but as synonymous with 'land subject to be taken by preemptors or homesteaders under the public land laws.' It is conceded that much of the land in the forest reserves which the company claims the right to select as mineral indemnity is not such as could have been acquired by individuals under the land laws in force at the time of the grant.\n We have already noted that until the public lands were surveyed the company could not make selections and that, in the meantime, unsurveyed lands might be taken, under the preemption and homestead laws, to the company's loss or detriment. No doubt if the railroad had been more promptly built, and if the company had been more active in paying for and procuring surveys, good lands in various states within the mineral indemnity belt would have been available for selection. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 364]\n\u00a0\n These, however, were taken up and removed from the company's right of selection, with the result that the existing deficiency in the grant must be satisfied, if at all, by selections of lands now in the forest reserves. But, for whatever reason, the company has lost the right to select the better lands mentioned, and we cannot rewrite the statute to confer upon it the privilege of taking lands of a different character than those specified.\n We conclude that, while the company had, at the time of withdrawal, the right of selection of any lands which, under the existing practise of the Land Office, a settler could have taken under the preemption or homestead laws, it may not take lands valuable solely for timber or for other uses which would not justify preemption or homestead settlement under the land laws as contemporaneously understood and administered. The company's right of selection in the forest reserves is limited to such land as would, under the practise of the Land Office, have been available to individuals under the public land laws either for clearing and subsequent cultivation, or for grazing, or for any other purpose commonly classified by the Land Office as coming within the preemption and homestead laws.\n Since the court below has accorded the company a much broader right of selection, its decree must be reversed and the cause must be remanded for ascertainment of the company's selection rights as of the dates of the withdrawals, in accordance with the views herein expressed.\n 15. The claim that the United States is liable to account to the Railway Company only for the ascertained deficiency at the time of withdrawal.\n In its brief upon reargument the Government takes the position that even if the withdrawals left the grant deficient in lands lying in the second indemnity limits, the United States is liable to account to the Railway \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 365]\n\u00a0\n Company only for the amount of such deficiency. The District Court held that if a given withdrawal had the effect of leaving within the indemnity limits an insufficient acreage to satisfy the selection rights of the company the withdrawal was a breach of the Government's obligation because thereby the Government disenabled itself to carry out that obligation. The consequence which the District Court attached to such action on the part of the Government was that the lands withdrawn were, notwithstanding the withdrawal, still open to selection by the company if and when surveyed. The court below thought that, as the company was entitled, under the terms of the grant, to exercise its selection rights with respect to the withdrawn lands in these circumstances, the Act of 1929 contemplated that it should be compensated for the deprivation of that right.\n We think that the District Court was right and that the Government's position that it is liable to account only for any deficiency in the vacant lands at the time of withdrawal is not in accord with the granting act of 1864. The Forest Reserve Case, supra, supports the decision below. It is clearly there held that if, by the Government's own act in withdrawing lands from the indemnity limits, it leaves insufficient vacant land available for selection the company thereby becomes entitled to select lands within the indemnity limits. That is exactly what was done by the company which brought about the litigation in the Forest Reserve Case. The decision is clear to the effect that, assuming the grant was deficient ( which was the matter the court could not determine on the record then presented), the company was entitled to select lands within the reserve.\n 16. The claim that subsequent restorations of withdrawn lands defeat the company's right of selection of lands within the Governmental withdrawals.\n What has just been said requires denial of the Government's contention that where withdrawn lands were \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 366]\n\u00a0\n subsequently restored to the public domain, in an amount sufficient to make up the deficiency created by the original withdrawal, the company's claim to choose lands within the withdrawal areas was thereby defeated.\n Under the Act of 1929 the company's right to compensation depends upon the availability of lands on the dates of withdrawals for governmental purposes. This provision of the Act of 1929 is, we think, in strict accordance with the purpose and intent of the granting act and resolution. If, by the withdrawals, the Government disenabled itself to comply with its obligations to the company, the withdrawals were unauthorized and the company's right attached to the withdrawn lands equally with the vacant lands remaining in the indemnity limits.\n 17. The illegal withdrawals of place and indemnity lands.\n As has been noted under heading 5, supra, the action of the Department of the Interior in prematurely withdrawing lands in the place and indemnity limits from settlement and preemption is claimed to have the effect of denying the company any further rights under the grants.\n The further argument is made that, in any event, the company is liable to the Government for damages consequent upon its receiving lands which, if it had not been for the improvident withdrawals, would have gone to settlers and preemptors. The claim is that the court below should have permitted the Government to prove any damages it might be able to show as a result of this incorrect administration of the grant. A majority of the Court is of the opinion that a good ground for a credit in favor of the United States against the company is set up by paragraph XXXII of the bill and that \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 367]\n\u00a0\n this paragraph is not, in this aspect, subject to the motion to strike.\n The paragraph sets up the disadvantages to the Government of the action of the Secretary of the Interior in withdrawing lands prematurely; that as a consequence the company and its predecessor secured benefits, lands and values to which they were not entitled to the injury of the United States.\n The majority of the Court thinks that section six of the Act of 1929 requires a charge against the company for sums received in lands or values in excess of that to which it was rightfully entitled through mistake of law or fact, or through misapprehension as to the proper construction of said grants, or as a result of fraud, or otherwise.\n The proof of these alleged advantages gained or losses suffered may be difficult. This is for development at the hearing. The proof, however, must be of financial detriment to the United States or of financial benefit to the company.\n 18. The company's failure to open lands granted by the Resolution of 1870 to settlement and preemption.\n The company's alleged breach in this aspect as a defense to the company's entire claim is mentioned in heading 4, supra.\n The bill alleges, in paragraph XIII, the company's failure to open the granted lands to settlement and preemption was a breach of its contract and 'in defeat of the policy of the United States with respect to the disposition of its public domain, ....' In paragraph XLII the court is asked to determine the extent to which the company has failed to comply with the obligation imposed by the Joint Resolution pertaining to the disposition of the lands by settlement and preemption and to decree that the company now perform its cove- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 368]\n\u00a0\n nant to the extent this is possible and, where it is found impossible for the company to perform, the plaintiff have such relief as the court may deem proper; and further that the court decree that any and all moneys received by the company from or by reason of the granted lands after the breach of its covenant be declared to have been received by the company in trust for the use and benefit of the United States and that the plaintiff be awarded judgment for the amount of such moneys. The prayer is, therefore, in the alternative for damages or for an accounting, as upon a constructive trust.\n We hold, contrary to the Government's assertion, that the proviso of the Resolution of 1870, requiring the lands be opened by the company to settlement and preemption applies only to the additional lands granted by that Resolution and not to lands acquired under the grant of 1864.42 We hold further that the company was not a trustee of the lands for the United States either in its own right or in behalf of possible settlers. \n43\n It results that the Government cannot can upon the company to account as a trustee for the proceeds of sale of the lands.\n A majority of the justices who heard this case are of opinion that the proviso of the Resolution of 1870 required the company to open the lands granted by the Resolution to preemption and settlement at the expiration of five years from the completion of the entire road in 1887, whether the lands were then subject to mortgage or not; that its failure so to do was a breach of its contract with the United States and that the Government \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 369]\n\u00a0\n is entitled, if it can, to prove any damage to it, or advantage to the company, which resulted from this breach of contract. In this view the court below should not have dismissed paragraph XIII of the bill and that paragraph should be reinstated for the purpose of permitting the Government to prove damages and proof should be submitted thereunder to that end.\n 19. The claim that the decree below in directing patents to issue for 428,986.68 acres of land outside the reserves was erroneous to the extent of 44,838.60 acres of indemnity lands.\n In its brief upon reargument, the Government advances the claim that the decree of the District Court quieting the company's title to 428,986. 68 acres of land lying outside the reserves, and directing that patents issue upon payment of any balance of fees due by the company, was erroneous as to 44,838.60 acres. It is asserted that 383,808.08 of the acres in question lie within the place limits of the grant but 45,178.60 acres lie within indemnity limits. Of these the Government concedes that, by a stipulation filed, 340 acres are to be patented to the company. As to the remaining acreage, the contention is that the company is not entitled to patents, although selections were filed with the Department of the Interior, prior to June 5, 1924.\n It is said that, on grounds heretofore stated, the company's breaches disentitle it to further performance on the part of the Government. And, it is urged that, as to over 30,000 acres of the lands in question, the company assigned losses of mineral lands as base for indemnity selection and the alleged fraud in mineral classification vitiates the selection of this acreage as indemnity. The Government also asserts that some 13,000 acres of lands selected for patent prior to the bar date are Indian lands within the Crow reservation. The first contention \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 370]\n\u00a0\n cannot prevail in view of the even division of opinion already stated; the second cannot, since the bill prays no affirmative relief in respect of the fraudulent classification it alleges; the third cannot, in the light of our decision stated under heading 10, supra.\n Secondly, the Government urges, since the District Court has held that, in order to obtain compensation for the deprivation of rights to select lands lying within the withdrawn Government reserves, the company must assign base for the lands selected as to which compensation is claimed, the same principle must apply to selection rights exercised prior to the Resolution of June 5, 1924. It adds that the company has failed to show that in selecting lands within the indemnity limits prior to the date of that resolution it assigned base for such selections, to which the company replies that the Government is in error in asserting that it did not assign such base.\n The argument with respect to the selected indemnity lands, which the District Court decreed should be patented to the company, first emerged in this court on reargument. In its original brief the Government said:\n'The decree quiets title to the lands from the indemnity belts retained by the United States in the forest reserves and other reserves and directs the issuance of patents to the company for 428,986.68 acres, mostly in place limits of the grants. In these and several other respects the decree is not the subject of this appeal.'\n\n It is now said that, despite this concession, the point was preserved in the record below and is open here. We cannot agree.\n By its exhibits Nos. 149 to 158, inclusive, the company listed the lands in place and indemnity limits which had been selected for patent amounting to over \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 371]\n\u00a0\n 455,000 acres. By stipulation of the parties certain of these were eliminated. Thereafter the Government, by its exhibits Nos. 103 (Revised) and 210 (Revised) listed the remaining lands as chargeable to the grant. With negligible exceptions the master found that they were so chargeable. In its findings the District Court adopted the master's ruling and stated definitely in its findings that the plaintiff took no exception to the master's report in connection with this matter. The court found, therefore, on the basis of the master's report, that the total of the lands both in place and indemnity limits so selected by the company should go to patent. The Government, while not controverting the fact found by the court that it had taken no exception to this portion of the master's report, points to an assignment of error filed on the appeal to this Court asserting that the District Court erred: '52. In holding that the railroad is now entitled to receive patent to any of the indemnity lands mentioned or referred to in subdivision XVIII of the court's findings.' Subdivision XVIII is that subdivision of the findings in which the court dealt with the whole matter of patents to be issued for lands selected prior to the adoption of the Resolution of 1924 and does not deal specifically or separately with indemnity lands as contrasted with place lands.\n It is obvious that the decision of the court sustaining the Government's position that, in the claim for compensation for loss of indemnity selection rights to lands within the reserves the company must assign base for the lands it alleged it lost by their withdrawal, furnishes no justification for the claim that the master or the District Court was asked to annul and hold ineffectual selection rights exercised with respect to lands outside the reserves which, but for the interposition of Congress in the Resolution of 1924, would have gone to \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 372]\n\u00a0\n patent. Moreover, it is not clear from the record whether the company did in fact assign base in the lists of selection rights filed, or failed to do so. The implication from the record seems to be that the company did assign such base. In any event, we think the point was not brought to the master's or the court's attention in any such manner as to justify its being made the basis of a claim of error in this court. This must have been the Government's view when the case was first argued. In the light of its sweeping concession above quoted, and the state of the record, we are unwilling to disturb the District Court's decree as respects lands to be patented to the company.\n 20. The company's claim to indemnity resulting from the Tacoma overlap.\n In its appeal (No. 4) the company challenges the rejection of its claim for loss of selection rights in second indemnity limits appurtenant to the Portland-Tacoma line. It is urged that the Joint Resolution of 1870, which made a grant in aid of this line, authorized the creation of second indemnity limits, in the event that there was a deficiency of lands in first indemnity limits, to supply loss of place lands lying along the route. The company insists that when, in 1898, 1902 and 1906, 213,000 acres of land were withdrawn and placed in national forests, these withdrawals deprived the company of selection of odd-numbered sections in second indemnity limits, as the 1870 grant was deficient in 1882, the date of the definite location of the last segment of the Portland-Tacoma line, and so remained.\n For an understanding of the contention certain facts must be borne in mind. By the Act of 1864 the line authorized was to run from a point on Lake Superior to some point on Puget Sound, with a branch via the Columbia River to a point at or near Portland. By the Joint Resolution of 1870 the company was authorized to \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 373]\n\u00a0\n construct its main line to a point on Puget Sound via the valley of the Columbia River with the right to construct its branch from a point on its main line, across the Cascade Mountains to Puget Sound. Thus the resolution altered what had been the proposed main line across the Cascade Mountains into a branch line, and the former branch line to Portland into a section of the main line running down the Columbia River to Portland and thence turning north to Puget Sound. Although by an Act of 1869 the company had been authorized to construct a line between Portland and Tacoma, and a right of way had been granted therefor, no grant of lands in aid of such construction was made until the adoption of the Resolution of 1870. That resolution in authoriing the location and construction of this portion of the company's road, did so in these words: 'Under the provisions and with the privileges, grants, and duties provided for in its act of incorporation'. Obviously the land grant was the same as that in the charter act, namely, place lands in a strip extending twenty miles on each side of the road in states and forty miles on each side in territories, with an indemnity belt ten miles in width on either side of the exterior limits of the place grant.\n The legislative history of the resolution shows that Congress was informed the company could not obtain, in connection with its original grant, all that Congress intended it should have, for the reason that, prior to selection of indemnity lands for losses in place lands, much territory had been removed from the operation of the Act by preemption and settlement under the land laws. In order to compensate the company for such losses there was inserted in the Joint Resolution the following: 'and in the event of there not being in any State or Territory in which said main line or branch may be located, at the time of the final location thereof, the amount of lands per mile granted by Congress to said \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 374]\n\u00a0\n company, within the limits prescribed by its charter, then said company shall be entitled, under the directions of the Secretary of the Interior, to receive so many sections of land belonging to the United States, and designated by old numbers, in such State or Territory, within ten miles on each side of said road, beyond the limits prescribed in said charter, as will make up such deficiency, on said main line or branch, except mineral and other lands as excepted in the charter of said company ... to the amount of the lands that have been granted, sold, reserved, occupied by homestead settlers, pre-empted, or otherwise disposed of subsequent to the passage of the act of July two, eighteen hundred and sixty-four.'\n The Resolution made a new grant in aid of the Portland-Tacoma line. \n44\n The portion of the Cascade branch (designated as main line in the Act of 1864) entering Tacoma from the east was definitely located in 1884. This location defined the place lands granted by the Act of 1864. The line authorized by the Joint Resolution entering Tacoma from the south was definitely located in 1874, thus earning the grant made by the Resolution. The place limits forty miles wide to the south of the Cascade line, and of equal width to the east of the Portland-Tacoma line, overlap. The area of the overlap, approximately forty miles square, contains alternate sections totaling 637,580 acres. The company says that, under the 1864 grant pursuant to which the Cascade line was built, title to the place lands vested in the company on the date of definite location, as of the date of the original grant; that these lands were thus lost to the grant of 1870 appurtenant to the Portland-Tacoma line; \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 375]\n\u00a0\n and that the company was entitled to indemnity for them. If this is the right view, 637,580 acres must be added to the other losses for which indemnity was needed at the date of the forest withdrawals and thus the deficiency in the grant required a large quantity of lands in second indemnity limits through the withdrawn lands, if any such limits were created in connection with the 1870 grant. The Land Office construed the Resolution of 1870 as requiring the laying down of second indemnity limits for the Portland-Tacoma line, and laid them down in 1906. The master and the court below concluded that no place lands were lost to the 1870 grant by the overlap. We are of opinion that they were right.\n Several decisions respecting overlaps of railroad land grants are cited but none is precisely in point. It seems to be conceded that if the Cascade branch and the Portland-Tacoma line had been authorized by the same Act there would have been but a single grant of odd-numbered sections in the overlap and the company could not have claimed indemnity as for a grant of double aid in the area. \n45\n And it is settled that such a grant as that under consideration is a grant not of lands by quantity but of lands in place or by description. \n46\n Whether Congress intended, in connection with its later grant of 1870, to accord the company indemnity for failure to receive, in aid of the Portland-Tacoma line, lands to which it would get title in virtue of its definite location of the Cascade line, is the question. We conclude that Congress did not so intend. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 317, 376]\n\u00a0\n It is true that the grant of 1870 was upon the same terms as that of 1864. Unquestionably the company, in respect of the line built under the later grant, was entitled to indemnity for lands granted or disposed of by the United States to others prior to the grant. Indeed, it would be entitled to indemnity for loss due to an earlier overlapping grant to another railroad. \n47\n The grant of 1864, carried title to the lands within the overlap to the company and, therefore, Congress could not and did not make a second grant of the same lands in 1870. Did Congress intend to grant the company indemnity for a preceeding grant, not to a stranger, but to the company itself? In answering the question we must bear in mind that if the grants had been contemporaneous no intent to make a double grant, or a grant of indemnity, would be inferred, and that the two grants here in question really dealt with but a single railroad system. We think it clear that Congress did not intend to confer a right to indemnity upon the company which would give it lands double in quantity at the point of intesection of two of its lines. As, in this view, the alternate sections in the overlap granted to aid the Cascade line by the Act of 1864, were not a loss to the grant to the Portland-Tacoma line made by the Resolution of 1870, the latter grant was not deficient and no right to select lands in second indemnity limits was infringed by Government withdrawals.\n The appeal in No. 4 is without merit, but, upon the appeal in No. 3, the judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings as indicated in this opinion.\n So ordered.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice MURPHY took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 13 Stat. 365. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 14 Stat. 355; 15 Stat. 255. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] 15 Stat. 346. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] 16 Stat. 57. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Joint Resolution of May 31, 1870, 16 Stat. 378. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] St. Paul & P.R.

Gen., and Mr. Frederick Bernays Wiener, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Asbury Summerlin, of Winter Haven, Fla., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By a series of transactions, which it is unnecessary to review, the Federal Housing Administrator, acting on behalf of the United States, became the assignee of a claim against the estate of one J. F. Andrew, deceased. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 414, 415]\n\u00a0\n Respondent was appointed ancillary administratrix of that estate by the County Judge of Polk County, Florida. Respondent, on August 13, 1937, gave notice by publication to the creditors of the estate to file proof of their claims within eight months as required by the state statute.\n The United States filed its claim in the office of the County Judge on July 1, 1938, with a petition asking that the claim be allowed with the priority accorded by the federal statutes (31 U.S.C.  191, 192, 31 U.S.C. A.  191, 192) and also asserting that the state statute as to the time for filing claims did not apply to claims of the United States. The County Judge denied the petition, holding that the state statute was applicable and further adjudging that the claim of the United States be 'disallowed as a claim against the estate' of the decedent.\n The United States appealed to the Circuit Court for Polk County, where the order of the County Judge was in all respects affirmed. The judgment explicitly declared the claim of the United States to be 'void', because not filed within the time prescribed, An appeal to the Supreme Court of Florida resulted in affirmance of the judgment of the Circuit Court. 191 So. 842. We granted certiorari because of the importance of the question. March 25, 1940. \n309 \nU.S. 647\n, 60 S.Ct. 714, 84 L.Ed. --.\n The statute of Florida (Section 5541(92), Compiled General Laws of 1927) provides:\n'No claim or demand, whether due or not, direct or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, or claim for personal property in the possession of the personal representative or for damages, shall be valid or binding upon an estate, or upon the personal representative thereof, or upon any heir, legatee or devisee of the decedent unless the same shall be in writing and contain the place of residence and post office address of the claimant and shall be sworn to by the claimant, his agent or attorney and be filed in the office of the county judge granting letters. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 414, 416]\n\u00a0\n Any such claim or demand not so filed within eight months from the time of the first publication of the notice to creditors shall be void even though the personal representative has recognized such claim or demand by paying a portion thereof or interest thereon or otherwise: ....'\n\n The claim assigned to the Federal Housing Administrator acting on behalf of the United States became the claim of the United States, and the United States thereupon became entitled to enforce it. Act of June 27, 1934, 48 Stat. 1246, 12 U.S.C.A.  1701 et seq. Compare Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, \n306 \nU.S. 466, 477\n, 59 S.Ct. 595, 596, 120 A. L.R. 1466; Pittman v.

United States v. Thompson, \n98 \nU.S. 486\n; United States v. Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis R. Co., \n118 \nU.S. 120, 125\n, 126 S., 6 S.Ct. 1006, 1008; Stanley v.

Davis, Director General of Railroads v. Corona Coal Co., \n265 \nU.S. 219, 222\n, 223 S., 44 S.Ct. 552, 553.\n We are of the opinion that the fact that the claim was acquired by the United States through operations under the National Housing Act does not take the case out of this rule. The state court treated the case as in the same category as one of 'statutes providing for conveyancing and marketing negotiable instruments, and conducting other business relations' . (191 So. 843.) But this is not a case relating to the application of the law merchant as to the transfer of negotiable paper and the diligence necessary to charge an endorser or as to the incurring by the United States of certain responsibilities by becoming a party to such paper. United States v. Barker, 12 Wheat. 559; Cooke v. United States, \n91 \nU.S. 389\n, 396. Even as a holder of such paper, \n\n[310 \nU.S. 414, 417]\n\u00a0\n as e.g. negotiable bonds, the United States suing the maker is not bound by a state statute of limitations. United States v. Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis R. Co., supra. When the United States becomes entitled to a claim, acting in its governmental capacity and asserts its claim in that right, it cannot be deemed to have abdicated its governmental authority so as to become subject to a state statute putting a time limit upon enforcement. Chesapeake & Delaware Canal Company v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 123, 126\n, 127 S., 39 S.Ct. 407, 408.\n The state court, however, has said that the statute in question is not a statute of limitations, but rather a statute of 'non-claim' for the orderly and expeditious settlement of decedents' estates. Presumably the court refers to the provision of the statute that if a claim is not filed within the specified period it 'shall be void even though the personal representative has recognized such claim or demand by paying a portion thereof or interest thereon or otherwise'.\n If this were a statute merely determining the limits of the jurisdiction of a probate court and thus providing that the County Judge should have no jurisdiction to receive or pass upon claims not filed within the eight months, while leaving an opportunity to the United States otherwise to enforce its claim, the authority of the State to impose such a limitation upon its probate court might be conceded. But if the statute, as sustained by the state court, undertakes to invalidate the claim of the United States, so that it cannot be enforced at all, because not filed within eight months, we think the statute in that sense transgressed the limits of state power. Davis, Director General of Railroads, v. Corona Coal Company, supra.\n Mr. Justice Story had occasion to consider the application to the Government of a state statute purporting to bar claims against decedent's estates in United States v. Hoar, Fed.Cas.No. 15,373, 2 Mason 311. There an action was brought by the United States against an ad- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 414, 418]\n\u00a0\n ministrator of an estate and the defendant pleaded the general statute of limitation of Massachusetts as to personal actions and also the particular statute limiting suits against executors and administrators to four years after the acceptance of the trust. Mr. Justice Story thought it clear that the defense of these statutes of limitations could not avail. The question whether a further defense of plene administravit was good, that is, whether a distribution of surplus assets after the payment of all known debts among the heirs, either voluntary or under a probate decree, would protect the administrator from suit by the United States, it was thought not necessary to decide. Nor have we such a question here.\n We hold that the state statute in this instance requiring claims to be filed within eight months cannot deprive the United States of its right to enforce its claim; that the United States still has its right of action against the administrator, even though the probate court is to be regarded as having no jurisdiction to receive a claim after the expiration of the specified period.\n So far as the judgment goes beyond the question of the jurisdiction of the probate court and purports to adjudge that the claim of the Unitd States is void as a claim against the estate of the decedent because of failure to comply with the statute, the judgment is reversed.\n The cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\n\n\n","133":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNION JOINT STOCK LAND BANK OF DETROIT v.

Martin, of Columbus, Ohio, for petitioner.\n Messrs. Elmer McClain, of Lima, Ohio, and Wm. Lemke, of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n September 1, 1932, the petitioner instituted a mortgage foreclosure suit against respondent in the Common Pleas Court of Madison County, Ohio. The cause was prosecuted to judgment and advertisement was made of a sheriff's sale of the property to take place November 24, 1934.\n November 19, 1934, the respondent filed his petition in the United States District Court under  75 of the Bankruptcy Act,1 and the court issued an order restraining proceedings in the foreclosure suit until the further order of the court.\n November 23, 1934, the District Court, on application of the petitioner, without reference of the matter to a conciliation commissioner, modified the restraining order to permit the sale of the premises as advertised but enjoined any further proceedings, particularly confirmation of the sale or execution of sheriff's deed.\n November 24, 1934, the sheriff, as permitted by the modification of the restraining order, held the sale as advertised. The petitioner bid the property in and the sheriff made return of the sale. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n December 14, 1934, the District Court approved the respondent's petition under  75 of the Bankruptcy Act and ordered a reference to a conciliation commissioner. The latter reported that no agreement could be reached between the respondent and his creditors.\n February 11, 1935, the respondent abandoned proceedings under subsections a to r of  75 and filed an amended petition to be adjudged a bankrupt pursuant to  75, sub. s. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n May 27, 1935, this court held certain features of  75, sub. s, unconstitutional. Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford, \n295 \nU.S. 555\n, 55 S.Ct. 854, 97 A.L.R. 1106.\n August 26, 1935, on the application of the respondent, the District Court ordered that, because of the unconstitutionality of  75, sub. s, the respondent's petition and amended petition be dismissed and that the case be terminated.\n August 28, 1935,  75 was amended3 to meet the decision in Louisville Bank v. Radford, supra. The Act, as so amended, provided in paragraph 5 of  75, sub. s:\n'This Act (title) shall be held to apply to all existing cases now pending in any Federal court, under this Act (title), as well as to future cases; and all cases that have been dismissed by any conciliation commissioner, referee, or court because of the Supreme Court decision holding the former subsection (s) unconstitutional, shall be promptly reinstated, without any additional filing fees or charges.'\n\n September 10, 1935, the sheriff's sale was confirmed by the Common Pleas Court. Subsequently this action was, on appeal by respondent, affirmed by the Court of Appeals of Madison County.\n September 11, 1935, the sheriff's deed was delivered to the petitioner and was recorded. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n September 24, 1935, the respondent moved the District Court for reinstatement of his bankruptcy case. The motion was granted but apparently no amended petition has been filed nor any adjudication entered under  75, sub. s.\n May 8, 1936, the petitioner moved the District Court for an order of disclaimer of the real estate in question.\n October 22, 1936, an order of disclaimer was entered. October 26 a petition for rehearing was filed by the respondent and was entertained by the court.\n April 17, 1937, the respondent moved the District Court that the proceedings in bankruptcy be referred to a conciliation commissioner pursuant to  75, sub. s.\n May 6, 1937, the District Court overruled the respondent's petition for a rehearing of the order of disclaimer.\n May 8, 1937, the District Court overruled the motion of the respondent to refer the cause to a conciliation commissioner.\n May 27, 1937, the respondent petitioned the District Court for an appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals from the order denying his petition for rehearing of the order of disclaimer and from the order denying his motion to refer the cause to a conciliation commissioner and, on the same date, the District Court allowed an appeal.\n June 3, 1937, the respondent petitioned the Circuit Court of Appeals for leave to appeal from the orders of the District Court and, June 7, 1937, leave was granted.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the orders of the District Court, holding that, at the time of filing his new petition under  75, as amended, the respondent had a property right,-a right of redemption-in the mortgaged premises, which had not been cut off by the sale and its confirmation in the State court, and that the cause should be referred to a conciliation commissioner and prosecuted before him. \n4\n On account of the \n\n[310 \nU.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n importance of the question involved in the administration of the Bankruptcy Act, we granted certiorari.\n The petitioner asserts that the court below erred, as the action of the District Court modifying the restraining order and permitting a sale of the mortgaged premises was authorized by the bankruptcy act and, if not, it is binding upon the respondent since he failed to except to or appeal from it.\n The petitioner further asserts that the respondent's procurement of the termination of the original bankruptcy case amounted to a waiver of any irregularity which occurred while the proceeding was pending and precluded the respondent from objecting to such irregularity. Further, petitioner contends that the sale made by the sheriff did not change the legal status of the debtor and his property since his right of redemption, under Ohio law, remained until confirmation of the sale by the State court; and, although that court was without jurisdiction while the original bankruptcy proceeding was pending, it regained such jurisdiction by the termination of the bankruptcy case, and had exclusive jurisdiction of the parties and the subject matter, when the decree of confirmation was entered. The claim is that the decree of confirmation cannot be collaterally attacked in the bankruptcy court.\n The respondent, on the other hand, argues that the express provisions of  75, in force at the time the sale was made, rendered void the District Court's permission to make the sale and the sheriff's action in making it; and that confirmation or delivery of a deed can give no validity to such void action, which the bankruptcy court should, therefore, have disregarded.\n First. The action of the District Court in permitting the holding of the sale was not void but voidable; and the sale made pursuant thereto was not void.\n Section 75, as it stood during the pendency of the original bankruptcy proceeding, provided: \n\n[310 \nU.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n '(e) ... After the filing of the petition and prior to the confirmation or other disposition of the composition or extension proposal by the court, the court shall exercise such control over the property of the farmer as the court deems in the best interests of the farmer and his creditors.\n'(n) The filing of a petition pleading for relief under this section shall subject the farmer and his property, wherever located, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court. In proceedings under this section, except as otherwise provided herein, the jurisdiction and powers of the court, the title, powers, and duties of its officers, the duties of the farmer, and the rights and liabilities of creditors, and of all persons with respect to the property of the farmer and the jurisdiction of the appellate courts, shall be the same as if a voluntary petition for adjudication had been filed and a decree of adjudication had been entered on the day when the farmer's petition or answer was filed.\n\n'(o) Except upon petition made to and granted by the judge after hearing and report by the conciliation commissioner, the following proceedings shall not be instituted, or if instituted at any time prior to the filing of a petition under this section, shall not be maintained, in any court or otherwise, against the farmer or his property, at any time after the filing of the petition under this section, and prior to the confirmation or other disposition of the composition or extension proposal by the court:\n\n'(6) Seizure, distress, sale, or other proceedings under an execution or under any lease, lien, chattel mortgage, conditional sale agreement, crop payment agreement, or mortgage.'\n\n The provisions of subsection p as it was when the petition was filed have no application. That subsection was amended by the act of August 28, 1935, supra, to \n\n[310 \nU.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n provide 'The prohibitions of subsection (o) shall apply to all judicial or official proceedings in any court or under the direction of any official ....' This amendment was made after the dismissal of the bankruptcy case.\n Exclusive jurisdiction of the debtor and his property vested in the District Court on the filing of the petition. Up to that time jurisdiction of the debtor and the mortgaged property was in the State court. Without action by the District Court the State court could not have proceeded further. \n5\n But without changing the status of the debtor's right of redemption the federal court gave permission to the State officer to hold the sale. The sale was, however, incomplete until confirmation by the court. \n6\n Until confirmed it amounted to an unaccepted offer to purchase. No sale was consummated while the bankruptcy proceeding was pending.\n In view of the provisions of subsection o, it was error for the District Court, in the absence of the preliminary steps required by that subsection, to permit the sheriff to hold the sale. \n7\n But the court had jurisdiction in the premises. Error committed by it in the exercise of that jurisdiction could have been corrected by appeal from its order. \n8\n The State court and its officer, the sheriff, were entitled, in view of the District Court's plenary jurisdiction over the debtor and his property, to rely upon the order granting permission to make the sale. The District Court did not lose jurisdiction by erroneously construing or applying provisions of the statute under which it administered the bankrupt estate. Its order was voidable, \n\n[310 \nU.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n but not void, and was not to be disregarded or attacked collaterally in the State court. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n Second. The termination of the bankruptcy proceeding restored the jurisdiction and power of the State court and its further proceedings in the foreclosure suit were not subject to attack in the bankruptcy court.\n Although the State court's jurisdiction was superseded by that of the bankruptcy court, it again attached upon the dismissal of the bankruptcy case, and, thenceforward, as respects the foreclosure suit, and the State court's procedure, it was as if no bankruptcy case had ever existed. With jurisdiction of the parties and the subject matter, the State court entered a decree confirming the sale and authorizing a deed, the sheriff executed his deed, which was duly recorded, and the petitioner went into possession as purchaser of the mortgaged premises. Thereafter the respondent moved for reinstatement of the bankruptcy case and his motion was granted. In the interim, no bankruptcy cause was pending and the State court had jurisdiction to proceed as it did.\n We cannot assent to the view advanced by the respondent that the amendment to  75 of August 28, 1935, automatically reinstated the earlier proceeding which had been dismissed; or that the motion to reinstate the proceeding operated by relation to close the gap of twenty-nine days between the dismissal of the original bankruptcy case, and the State court's action in confirming the sale, and to deprive the latter of jurisdiction to act in the interim. The amendatory act merely authorized the reinstatement of proceedings which had been dismissed. The case is analogous to one wherein a state court foreclosure proceeding \n\n[310 \nU.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n has been completed and deed delivered to the sheriff's vendee prior to the filing of a petition under  75.10 The provision for the reinstatement, upon the debtor's motion, of a proceeding theretofore dismissed and finally terminated, cannot affect the jurisdiction of the court conducting the foreclosure proceeding when no bankruptcy cause was pending.\n Wayne United Gas Co. v. Owens-Illinois Glass Co., \n300 \nU.S. 131\n, 57 S. Ct. 382, relied upon by the respondent, is not in conflict with our decision. There a petition in bankruptcy filed under  77B was dismissed by the bankruptcy court, not on motion of the bankrupt but at the instance of mortgage creditors and over the bankrupt's objection. In due time a petition for rehearing was filed. With notice of the filing of this petition for rehearing, and that it would be set for hearing before the bankruptcy court, the creditors took further steps in a foreclosure proceeding pending in a State court. The District Court entertained the petition for rehearing and an amended petition. The creditors who were prosecuting the foreclosure proceeding in the State court appeared and were heard in opposition.\n In entertaining the petition for rehearing the District Court found that good cause existed for vacation of its order of dismissal and reconsideration of the cause; that the application for rehearing had been seasonably presented, and that no rights had vested in reliance upon its earlier order of dismissal which would be disturbed by setting aside the order.\n The petition was dismissed, the debtor appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals and was granted a supersedeas. From an order of the Circuit Court of Appeals affirming the dismissal of the petition by the District Court the debtor sought certiorari from this court. The State court in which the foreclosure proceeding was pending had full notice of all of these facts when it proceeded \n\n[310 \nU.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n to consummate the foreclosure sale. We held that, in the circumstances, no rights were acquired under the State court proceedings since termination of the bankruptcy case did not occur until final disposition of the efforts in the District Court and on appeal to reverse the decree of dismissal.\n The District Court was right in refusing to refer the reinstated cause to a conciliation commissioner. Since the foreclosure proceedings had been completed and title had passed thereunder prior to the filing of the debtor's petition for reinstatement, it would have been a vain thing to refer the cause to a conciliation commissioner for administration of property which no longer belonged to the debtor. \n11\n We have no occasion to pass upon the authority of the court to enter an order of disclaimer. It is sufficient that the court's action in refusing to refer the cause to a conciliation commissioner was justified. That order, we think, should have been affirmed.\n It is said that, even where title has passed from the mortgagor in foreclosure proceedings before the filing of the petition, the debtor should be, if he so requests, adjudicated a bankrupt so that a trustee may, if so advised, challenge the validity of the sale. Here, however, there is no suggestion of any infirmity in the petitioner's title save that the sale was made in violation of the prohibitions of the bankruptcy act. But that sale was made under leave of the bankruptcy court and it was within the State court's jurisdiction, when no bankruptcy proceeding was pending, to confirm the sale and order delivery of a deed. If it erred in that respect its action was subject to correction by appeal but not subject to attack in a collateral proceeding. The fact is that the debtor appealed from the confirmation of the sale to the Court of Appeals of Madison County, Ohio, which affirmed the de- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n cree of the Common Pleas Court. An issue of fraud alleged to have been practiced upon the debtor to obtain his withdrawal of his original bankruptcy proceeding was there finally decided against him.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed. So ordered.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK, Mr. Justice DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice MURPHY, dissenting.\n We believe that to deny this farmer the benefits of the Act because the purchase by the mortgagee at the Sheriff's sale was confirmed during the short interval between the dismissal of his petition and its reinstatement, would be largely to defeat the purposes of the Act.\n After the original subsection  of the Frazier-Lemke Act was declared unconstitutional by the decision of this Court, May 27, 1935,1 this farmer's petition was dismissed, August 26, 1935. A scant two days after the dismissal, August 28, Congress enacted the present Frazier-Lemke Act designed to supply the constitutional deficiency and providing that all cases dismissed because of that decision 'be promptly reinstated.' \n2\n After the filing of the petition and even before dismissal, the bankruptcy court allowed this farmer's property to be sold by the Sheriff under foreclosure in the State Court. And it is admitted that the order purporting to permit that sale was erroneous because entered in disregard of the requirements of subsection o. 3 The Ohio State court confirmed the Sheriff's sale, September 10, 1935, a date prior to the lapse of the thirty day \n\n[310 \nU.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n period within which an appeal would lie from an order of dismissal. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n Instead of appealing, the farmer, within the thirty day period prayed relief from the dismissal decree by reinstatement in the District Court itself. In his application for reinstatement, he alleged that dismissal of his petition had been induced by the deliberate misrepresentations of the mortgagee-bank, that he had no notice of the consummation of the Sheriff's sale until several days after it took place and that he wished to avail himself of Section 75 as amended August 28. Upon the prayer 'that his ... proceeding ... be reinstated as of the date of its ... dismissal,' the case was reinstated. We do not understand that either the power of the bankruptcy court to reinstate or the reinstatement which was in fact granted, is questioned.\n Until disposition of the farmer's petition, he was entitled to the protection and benefit of the Act, and the bankruptcy court had exclusive jurisdiction of his property. \n5\n Dismissal of the proceeding did not constitute its final disposition where reinstatement was available. Certainly, this must hold true at least for the period of time after dismissal during which the farmer had a statutory right to appeal from the District Court's action. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n[310 \nU.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n Otherwise, even appeal might be wholly unavailing and futile. When a court of bankruptcy reinstates a case previously retired from the docket, as this farmer's case was reinstated, the court reconsiders the cause on the merits upon the original as well as any supplemental petitions unless rights have 'intervened which would render it inequitable to reconsider the merits.' Wayne Gas Co. v. Owens Co., \n300 \nU.S. 131, 137\n, 138 S., 57 S.Ct. 382, 386. We find no intervening equities here.\n In the Wayne case, a corporate reorganization in 77B was dismissed and subsequent to the dismissal a State court confirmed a foreclosure sale of the debtor's property which had been decreed prior to the filing of the 77B proceeding. After the Circuit Court of Appeals had denied the debtor's petition for allowance of an appeal and the time for appeal as of right had expired, the bankruptcy court reinstated the proceeding and reheard the case upon the merits. The plan of reorganization was again found wanting and the court entered a second order of dismissal. The debtor's appeal from the second dismissal was in turn dismissed by the Circuit Court of Appeals on the ground that lack of power in the District Court in bankruptcy rendered the order of reinstatement-as well as the second order of dismissal-void. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n When the case reached here, arguments presented by the foreclosure purchaser were in substance those upon which we are now asked to reverse the court below-that the first order of dismissal had terminated the cause ( so that an appeal not taken within thirty days of its entry was not timely ); and that the State court's confirmation \n\n[310 \nU.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n of sale, after dismissal, had finally divested the bankrupt of all title to its foreclosed property leaving no property for administration by the bankruptcy court (and the controversy was therefore moot).\n This Court denied these contentions, and held that the dismissal had not terminated the proceeding; that the controversy was not moot and that the District Court had properly found that no intervening rights had accrued to divest the debtor of its property foreclosed subsequent to the dismissal in the bankruptcy court; that the rehearing had been sought in good faith and with due diligence and that the Circuit Court of Appeals had erred in not passing upon the merits of a plan of reorganization which included the property sold under the State court's order. The decision here thus approved the exercise of the bankruptcy court's jurisdiction over the encumbered property of the debtor which, after dismissal, had been bought in the State court foreclosure by creditors who were parties to the 77B proceedings and who 'went forward with the proceedings in the state court, looking to a sale of the debtor's property, with full knowledge that a rehearing might be granted ....' Id., 300 U.S. at page 135, 57 S.Ct. at page 384.\n Accordingly, the case was not remanded to the District Court for reconsideration of its finding that no rights cognizable in equity had intervened as a result of the State court foreclosure. Instead, the remand went to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings. And that Court properly construed the mandate to require consideration of the merits of the debtor's plan which assumed ownership in the debtor of the particular property upon which foreclosure had been attempted. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n So here, as in the Wayne case, State court proceedings subsequent to dismissal, but while further proceedings could be had in bankruptcy, did not divest the debtor of \n\n[310 \nU.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n his property; there 'was no abuse of sound discretion in granting the motion (for reinstatement) and reconsidering the cause'; the district court in bankruptcy had 'the power, for good reason, to revise its judgments (of dismissal and to reinstate) upon seasonable application and before rights (had) vested on the faith of its action.' Id., 300 U.S. at page 137, 138, 57 S.Ct. at page 385, 386. And its general power to do so at least during the period allowed for taking an appeal,9 was reinforced by recognition of the specific statutory right of reinstatement, in the amended 75, sub. s, which sprang into being only two days after dismissal of this farmer's petition. Paralleling the situation presented by the Wayne case, not only was the mortgagee-purchaser here a party to the 75 proceeding, but the State court itself may be said to have acted with knowledge that the dismissal-of which it was notified-did not necessarily represent the last step in the Federal court proceeding. Cf. Id., 300 U.S. at page 135, 57 S.Ct. at page 384.\n Here, the only asserted rights which intervened against this farmer- debtor were not those of a bona fide purchaser. The purchaser was the mortgagee who was a party to the Section 75 proceeding and who relied-at least in part-on an order of the bankruptcy court admittedly erroneous because contrary to the Frazier-Lemke Act, and rendered at the mortgagee's instigation. Therefore, the mortgagee-purchaser is not entitled to rely upon the status acquired by it in the State court after dismissal 'as precluding further consideration of the petition' for composition. Cf. Id., 300 U.S. at page 135, 57 S.Ct. at page 384. To decide otherwise than that the dismissal here did not deprive the farmerdebtor of the right to proceed-before rights have vested-by reinstatement to obtain the benefits of the Act, is to permit dismissal at the instance of the farmer's creditors and without the farmer's knowledge to prove a ready means of circumvent- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n ing the Act. \n10\n Title to a farmer's property acquired in the manner pursued by petitioner cannot limit the power of the bankruptcy court to afford the protection of and to enforce this remedial legislation. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of March 3, 1933, c. 204, 47 Stat. 1467, 1470, 11 U.S.C.A.  203. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Subsection  was added to Section 75 by the Act of June 28, 1934, c. 869, 48 Stat. 1289. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Act of August 28, 1935, c. 792, 49 Stat. 942. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Byerly v.

Jackson, Atty. Gen., and Thomas E. Harris, of Washington, D. C., for appellants.\n\n\n\n[310 \nU.S. 534, 536]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. Ninian Beall, of Washington, D.C., for appellees.\n\n\n\n[310 \nU.S. 534, 538]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This appeal requires determination of the power of the Interstate Commerce Commission under the Motor Carrier Act, 1935, to establish reasonable requirements with respect to the qualifications and maximum hours of service of employees of motor carriers, other than employees whose duties affect safety of operation.\n After detailed consideration, the Motor Carrier Act, 1935, was passed. 1 It followed generally the suggestion of form made by the Federal Coordinator of Transportation. \n2\n The difficulty and wide scope of the problems raised by the growth of the motor carrier industry were obvious. Congress sought to set out its purpose and the range of its action in a declaration of policy which covered the preservation and fostering of motor transportation in the public interest, tariffs, the coordination of motor carriage with other forms of transportation and cooperation with the several states in their efforts to systematize the industry. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n While efficient and economical movement in interstate commerce is obviously a major objective of the Act,4 there are numerous provisions which make it clear that Congress intended to exercise its powers in the non-transpor- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 534, 539]\n\u00a0\n tation phases of motor carrier activity. \n5\n Safety of operation was constantly before the committees and Congress in their study of the situation. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The pertinent portions of the section of the Act immediately under discussion read as follows:\n'Sec. 204 ( 304) (a). It shall be the duty of the Commission-\n\n'(1) To regulate common carriers by motor vehicle as provided in this part (chapter), and to that end the Commission may establish reasonable requirements with respect to continuous and adequate service, transportation of baggage and express, uniform systems of accounts, records, and reports, preservation of records, qualifications and maximum hours of service of employees, and safety of operation and equipment.\n\n'(2) To regulate contract carriers by motor vehicle as provided in this part (chapter), and to that end the Commission may establish reasonable requirements with respect to uniform systems of accounts, records, and reports, preservation of records, qualifications and maximum hours of service of employees, and safety of operation and equipment.\n\n'(3) To establish for private carriers of property by motor vehicle, if need therefor is found, reasonable requirements to promote safety of operation, and to that end prescribe qualifications and maximum hours of service of employees, and standards of equipment. ...'\n\n Shortly after the approval of the Act, the Commission on its own motion undertook to and did fix maximum hours \n\n[310 \nU.S. 534, 540]\n\u00a0\n of service for 'employees whose functions in the operation of motor vehicles make such regulations desirable because of safety considerations.' 7 A few months after this determination, the Fair Labor Standards Act was enacted. \n8\n Section 7 of this act limits the workweek at the normal rate of pay of all employees subject to its terms and Section 18 makes the maximum hours of the Fair Labor Standards Act subject to further reduction by applicable federal or state law or municipal ordinances. There were certain employees excepted, however, from these regulations by Section 13( b). It reads as follows:\n'Sec. 13( 213). ... (b) The provisions of section 7 (207) shall not apply with respect to (1) any employee with respect to whom the Interstate Commerce Commission has power to establish qualifications and maximum hours of service pursuant to the provisions of section 204 (304 of Title 49) of the Motor Carrier Act, 1935; ....'\n\n This exemption brought sharply into focus the coverage of employees by Motor Carrier Act, Section 204(a). Clerical, storage and other non- transportation workers are under this or the Fair Labor Standards Act, dependent upon the sweep of the word employee in this act. The Commission again examined the question of its jurisdiction and in Ex parte No. MC-289 again reached the conclusion that its power under 'section 204(a)(1) and ( 2) is limited to prescribing qualifications and maximum hours of service for those employees ... whose activities affect the safety of operation.' It added: 'The provisions of section 202 evince a clear intent of Congress to limit our jurisdiction to regulating the motor-carrier industry as a part of the transportation system of the nation. To extend that regulation to features which are not char- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 534, 541]\n\u00a0\n acteristic of transportation nor inherent in that industry strikes us as an enlargement of our jurisdiction unwarranted by any express or implied provision in the act, which vests in us all the powers we have.' \n10\n The Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor arrived at the same result in an interpretation. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n Shortly thereafter appellees, an association of truckmen and various common carriers by motor, filed a petition with the Commission in the present case seeking an exercise of the Commission's jurisdiction under Section 204(a) to fix reasonable requirements 'with respect to qualifications and maximum hours of service of all employees of common and contract carriers, except employees whose duties are related to safety of operations; (3) to disregard its report and order in Ex parte MC-28'12 The Commission reaffirmed its position and denied the petition. The appellees petitioned a three-judge district court to compel the Commission to take jurisdiction and consider the establishment of qualifications and hours of service of all employees of common and contract carriers by motor vehicle. 13 The Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division was permitted to intervene. \n14\n The district court reversed the Commission, set aside its order and directed it to take jurisdiction of the appellees' petition. 31 F.Supp. 35. A direct appeal to this Court was granted. \n15\n\u00a0\n\n In the broad domain of social legislation few problems are enmeshed with the difficulties that surround a de- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 534, 542]\n\u00a0\n termination of what qualifications an employee shall have and how long his hours of work may be. Upon the proper adjustment of these factors within an industry and in relation to competitive activities may well depend the economic success of the enterprises affected as well as the employment and efficiency of the workers. The Motor Carrier Act lays little emphasis upon the clause we are called upon now to construe, 'qualifications and maximum hours of service of employees.' None of the words are defined by the Section, 203, devoted to the explanation of the meaning of the words used in the Act. They are a part of an elaborate enactment drawn and passed in an attempt to adjust a new and growing transportation service to the needs of the public. To find their content, they must be viewed in their setting.\n In the interpretation of statutes, the function of the courts is easily stated. It is to construe the language so as to give effect to the intent of Congress. \n16\n There is no invariable rule for the discovery of that intention. To take a few words from their context and with them thus isolated to attempt to determine their meaning, certainly would not contribute greatly to the discovery of the purpose of the draftsmen of a statute, particularly in \n\n[310 \nU.S. 534, 543]\n\u00a0\n a law drawn to meet many needs of a major occupation. \n17\n\u00a0\n\n There is, of course, no more persuasive evidence of the purpose of a statute than the words by which the legislature undertook to give expression to its wishes. Often these words are sufficient in and of themselves to determine the purpose of the legislation. In such cases we have followed their plain meaning. \n18\n When that meaning has led to absurd or futile results, however, this Court has looked beyond the words to the purpose of the act. \n19\n Frequently, however, even when the plain meaning did not produce absurd results but merely an unreasonable one 'plainly at variance with the policy of the legislation as a whole'20 this Court has followed that purpose, rather than the literal words. \n21\n When aid to construction of \n\n[310 \nU.S. 534, 544]\n\u00a0\n the meaning of words, as used in the statute, is available, there certainly can be no 'rule of law' which forbids its use,22 however clear the words may appear on 'superficial examination.' \n23\n The interpretation of the meaning of statutes, as applied to justiciable controversies, is exclusively a judicial function. This duty requires one body of public servants, the judges, to construe the meaning of what another body, the legislators, has said. Obviously there is danger that the courts' conclusion as to legislative purpose will be unconsciously influenced by the judges' own views or by factors not considered by the enacting body. A lively appreciation of the danger is the best assurance of escape from its threat but hardly justifies an acceptance of a literal interpretation dogma which withholds from the courts available information for reaching a correct conclusion. \n24\n Emphasis should be laid, too, upon the necessity for appraisal of the purposes as a whole of Congress in analyzing the meaning of clauses or sections of general acts. A few words of general connotation appearing in the text of statutes should not be given a wide meaning, contrary to a settled policy, 'excepting as a different purpose is plainly shown.' \n25\n\u00a0\n\n The language here under consideration, if construed as appellees contend, gives to the Commission a power of regulation as to qualifications and hours of employees quite distinct from the settled practice of Congress. That policy has been consistent in legislating for such regulation of transportation employees in matters of movement \n\n[310 \nU.S. 534, 545]\n\u00a0\n and safety only. The Hours of Service Act26 imposes restrictions on the hours of labor of employees 'actually engaged in or connected with the movement of any train.' The Seamen's Act27 limits employee regulations under it to members of ships' crews. The Civil Aeronautics Authority has authority over hours of service of employees 'in the interest of safety.' 28 It is stated by appellants in their brief with detailed citations, and the statement is uncontradicted, that at the time of the passage of the Motor Vehicle Act 'forty states had regulatory measures relating to the hours of service of employees' and every one 'applied exclusively to drivers or helpers on the vehicles.' In the face of this course of legislation, coupled with the supporting interpretation of the two administrative agencies concerned with its interpretation, the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Wage and Hour Division, it cannot be said that the word 'employee' as used in Section 204(a) is so clear as to the workmen it embraces that we would accept its broadest meaning. The word, of course, is not a word of art. It takes color from its surroundings and frequently is carefully defined by the statute where it appears. \n29\n\u00a0\n\n[310 \nU.S. 534, 546]\n\u00a0\n We are especially hesitant to conclude that Congress intended to grant the Commission other than the customary power to secure safety in view of the absence in the \n\n[310 \nU.S. 534, 547]\n\u00a0\n legislative history of the Act of any discussion of the desirability of giving the Commission broad and unusual powers over all employees. The clause in question was not contained in the bill as introduced. 30 Nor was it in the Coordinator's draft. \n31\n It was presented on the Senate Floor as a committee amendment following a suggestion of the Chairman of the Legislative Committee of the Commission, Mr. McManamy. \n32\n The committee reports \n\n[310 \nU.S. 534, 548]\n\u00a0\n and the debates contain no indication that a regulation of the qualifications and hours of service of all employees was contemplated; in fact the evidence points the other way. The Senate Committee's report explained the provisions of Section 204(a)(1), (2) as giving the commission authority over common and contract carriers similar to that given over private carriers by Section 204(a)(3).33 The Chairman of the Senate Committee expressed the same thought while explaining the provisions on the floor of the Senate. \n34\n When suggesting the addition of the clause, the Chairman of the Commission's Legislative Committee said: ' ... it relates to safety.' \n35\n In the House the member in charge of the bill characterized the provisions as tending 'greatly to promote careful operation for safety on the highways,' and spoke with assurance of the Commission's ability to 'formulate a set of reasonable rules ... including therein maximum labor- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 534, 549]\n\u00a0\n hours service on the highway.' 36 And in the report of the House Committee a member set out separate views criticizing the delegation of discretion to the Commission and proposing an amendment providing for an eight-hour day for 'any employee engaged in the operation of such motor vehicle.' \n37\n\u00a0\n\n The Commission and the Wage and Hour Division, as we have said, have both interpreted Section 204(a) as relating solely to safety of operation. In any case such interpretations are entitled to great weight. This is peculiarly true here where the interpretations involve 'contemporaneous construction of a statute by the men charged with the responsibility of setting its machinery in motion; of making the parts work efficiently and smoothly while they are yet untried and new.' \n38\n Furthermore, the Commission's interpretation gains much persuasiveness from the fact that it was the Commission which suggested the provisions' enactment to Congress. \n39\n\u00a0\n\n It is important to remember that the Commission has three times concluded that its authority was limited to securing safety of operation. The first interpretation was made on December 29, 1937, when the Commission stated: '... until the Congress shall have given us a more particular and definite command in the premises, we shall limit our regulations concerning maximum hours of service to those employees whose functions in the operation of motor vehicles make such regulations desirable because of safety considerations.' 40 This expression was half a year old when Congress enacted the Fair Labor Standards Act with the exemption of Section 13(b)(1). Seemingly the \n\n[310 \nU.S. 534, 550]\n\u00a0\n Senate at least was aware of the Commission's investigation of its powers even before its interpretation was announced. \n41\n Under the circumstances it is unlikely indeed that Congress would not have explicitly overruled the Commission's interpretation had it intended to exempt others than employees who affected safety from the Labor Standards Act.\n It is contended by appellees that the difference in language between subsections (1) and (2) and subsection (3) is indicative of a congressional purpose of restrict the regulation of employees of private carriers to 'safety of operation' while inserting broader authority in (1) and (2) for employees of common and contract carriers. Appellants answer that the difference in language is explained by the difference in the powers. As (1) and (2) give powers beyond safety for service, goods, accounts and records, language limiting those subsections to safety would be inapt.\n Appellees call our attention to certain pending legislation as sustaining their view of the congressional purpose in enacting the Motor Carrier Act. We do not think it can be said that the action of the Senate and House of Representatives on this pending transportation legislation throws much light on the policy of Congress or the meaning attributed by that body to Section 204(a). Aside from the very pertinent fact that the legislation is still unadopted, the legislative history up to now points only to a hesitation to determine a controversy as to the meaning of the present Motor Carrier Act, pending a judicial determination. \n42\n\u00a0\n\n[310 \nU.S. 534, 551]\n\u00a0\n One amendment made to the then pending Motor Carrier Act has relevance to our inquiry. Section 203(b) reads as set out in the note below. \n43\n The words, 'except \n\n[310 \nU.S. 534, 552]\n\u00a0\n the provisions of section 204(304) relative to qualifications and maximum hours of service of employees and scafety of \n\n[310 \nU.S. 534, 553]\n\u00a0\n operation or standards of equipment,' italicized in the note, were added by amendment in the House after the passage of S. 1629 in the Senate with the addition of the disputed clause to Section 204(a)(1) and (2).44 It is evident that the exempted vehicles and operators include common, contract and private carriers. It seems equally evident that where these vehicles or operators were common or contract carriers, it was not intended by Congress to give the Commission power to regulate the qualifications and hours of service of employees, other than those concerned with the safety of operations.\n Our conclusion, in view of the circumstances set out in this opinion, is that the meaning of employees in Section 204(a)(1) and (2) is limited to those employees whose activities affect the safety of operation. The Commission has no jurisdiction to regulate the qualifications or hours of service of any others. The decree of the district court is accordingly reversed and it is directed to dismiss the complaint of the appellees. It is so ordered.\n Reversed with directions.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice STONE and Mr. Justice ROBERTS are of opinion that the decree should be affirmed for the reasons stated in the opinion of the district court, 31 F.Supp. 35. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 49 Stat. 543, 49 U.S.C.A.  301 et seq. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] S.Doc.

Thus the Social Security Act specifically provides that 'The term 'employee' includes an officer of a corporation,' 42 U.S.C.  1301(a)( 6), 42 U.S.C.A.  1301(a)(6), while the Fair Labor Standards Act specifically exempts 'any employee employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, professional, or local retailing capacity ....' 29 U.S.C .  213(a)(1), 29 U.S.C.A.  213(a)(1). In the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, Congress expressly recognized the variable meaning of employee even when defined at length and used only in a single act: '... 'employee' (except when used in phrases establishing a different meaning) means ....' 45 U.S.C.  351(d), 45 U.S.C.A.  351(d). In a statute permitting heads of departments to settle claims up to $1000 arising from the negligence of 'employees of the Government,' Congress gives recognition to the fact that the term is not on its face all-inclusive by providing: \"Employee' shall include enlisted men in the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps.' 31 U.S.C.  215, 216, 31 U.S.C.A.  215, 216. See also the varying definitions of 'employees' in the following statutes: Railroad Retirement Act, 45 U.S.C.  228a(b)(c), 45 U.S.C.A.  228a(b, c); Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.  1(7), 49 U.S.C.A.  1(7); Emergency Railroad Transportation Act, 49 U.S.C.  251(f), 49 U.S.C.A.  251(f), Act June 16, 1933, 48 Stat. 211; Communications Act, 47 U.S.C.  210, 47 U.S.C.

See Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, \n269 \nU.S. 514, 520\n, 46 S.Ct. 172, 173 (consulting engineers performing services for states, municipalities, and water districts held not to be 'employees' under statute exempting 'officers and employees under ... any state , ... or any local subdivision thereof' from the income tax); Waskey v.

This could be accomplished by inserting in section 304(a)(1) and (2), lines 9 and 15, page 8, following the word 'records' in both lines, the words which appear in S. 394, as follows: 'qualifications and maximum hours of service of employees.\"\n\n The clause in question came from  2(a)(1) of S. 394, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., a subsection otherwise substantially like the corresponding subsection in S. 1629.\n Senator Wheeler, Chairman of the Committee on Interstate Commerce and sponsor of the bill, explained the provision on the floor of the Senate:\n'... the committee amended paragraphs (1) and (2) (of  204) to confer power on the Commission to establish reasonable requirements with respect to the qualifications and maximum hours of service of employees of common and contract carriers, ... This suggestion came to us, I think, from the chairman of the legislative committee of the Interstate Commerce Commission. ...\n\n'In order to make the highways more safe, and so that common and contract carriers may not be unduly prejudiced in their competition with peddler trucks and other private operators of motor trucks, a provision was added in subparagraph 3 giving the Commission authority to establish similar requirements with respect to the qualifications and hours of service of the employees of such operators. ...' 79 Cong.Rec. 5652. \n\n\n[\nFootnote 33\n] S.Rep. 482, 74th Cong., 1st Sess.

As to the point here under discussion, the report of the Senate Committee said: 'Paragraph (1) of section 34 of the bill is based on the provisions of subparagraphs (1), (2), and (3) of section 204(a) of the Motor Carrier Act. In the original draft, there was inserted at the beginning of the paragraph the clause 'in order to promote safety of operations.' thus making clear that the Commission's power to regulate qualifications and maximum hours of service of employees is confined to those who have anything to do with safety of operation. This is a question with respect to which considerable doubt seems to have arisen under the wording of the present law. Upon the strenuous objection of the truckers claiming conflict between this law and the Fair Labor Standards Act, the bill (i.e., the committee amendment) restores the law to the present provisions of the Motor Carrier Act.' S.Rep. No. 433, 76th Cong., 1st Sess ., p. 24. The bill passed the Senate. The House bill left  204(a)(1), (2) and (3) of the present act unchanged. 84 Cong.Rec. 9456; H.R.Rep. No. 1217, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., 84 Cong.Rec. 10125. \n While the bills were in conference the Chairman of the Legislative Committee of the Interstate Commerce Commission sent to the chairmen of the House and Senate Committees a letter on the House and Senate bills which suggested that both bills explicitly limit the Commission's jurisdiction over qualifications and hours of service of employees to considerations of safety. The letter stated: 'While the subsection (in the Senate bill) follows the existing language of section 204 ..., a controversy has arisen in regard to the meaning of that language. ... This controversy has now reached the Supreme Court. We think it may well be determined in this new legislation. In our judgment, if restrictions on hours of labor for social and economic reasons are to be imposed, this should be done by Congress, and no duty in that respect should be delegated to the Commission, which has no experience which particularly fits it for the performance of such a duty. Our authority over qualifications and hours of service of employees should, therefore, be confined to the needs of safety in operation. ...'

To reach this issue requires, preliminarily, a decision as to the navigability of the New River, a watercourse flowing through Virginia and West Virginia. The district court and the circuit court of appeals have both held that the New River is not navigable, and that the United States cannot enjoin the respondent from constructing and putting into operation a hydroelectric dam situated in the river just above Radford, Virginia.\n Sections 9 and 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 make it unlawful to construct a dam in any navigable water of the United States without the consent of Congress. \n1\n By the Federal Water Power Act of 1920,2 \n\n[311 \nU.S. 377, 399]\n\u00a0\n however, Congress created a Federal Power Commission with authority to license the construction of such dams upon specified conditions. Section 23 of that Act provided that persons intending to construct a dam in a nonnavigable stream may file a declaration of intention with the Commission. If after investigation the Commission finds that the interests of interstate or foreign commerce will not be affected, permission shall be granted for the construction. Otherwise construction cannot go forward without a license.\n The Radford Dam project was initiated by respondent's predecessor, the New River Development Company, which filed its declaration of intention with the Federal Power Commission on June 25, 1925. The Commission requested a report from General Harry Taylor, then Chief of Engineers of the War Department. He first reported that the river was navigable, and also that while the water flow from the dam, if not properly regulated, could have an adverse effect on navigation during low water stages in the Kanawha River (of which the New was one of the principal tributaries), such possible adverse effect would not warrant refusing a license to construct the dam if control was maintained by the United States. On review at the Commission's request, however, General Taylor rendered a second report, concluding that the New River in its present condition was not navigable and that navigation on the Kanawha would not be adversely affected by the proposed power development. On March 2, 1926, the Commission held a hearing on the declaration; the only evidence then submitted was General Taylor's second report.\n Respondent, the Appalachian Electric Power Company, took an assignment of the declaration of intention on August 30, 1926, and several days later filed an application for a license on the Commission's suggestion that this would expedite matters and could be withdrawn if it later developed that no federal license was required. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 377, 400]\n\u00a0\n In October, the district engineer of the War Department held a public hearing at Radford. On June 1, 1927, the Commission made a finding that the New River was not 'navigable waters' within the definition in section 3 of the Federal Water Power Act of 1920 but that (under section 23 of the Act) the project would affect the interests of interstate and foreign commerce. On July 1, 1927, the Commission tendered to respondent a standard form license which the respondent refused in April, 1928, principally on the ground that the conditions-especially those concerning rates, accounts and eventual acquisition-were unrelated to navigation. In February, 1930, respondent reiterated that its project was not within the Commission's jurisdiction, but nevertheless offered to accept a 'minor- part' license3 containing only such conditions as would protect the interests of the United States in navigation. In September, 1930, Attorney General Mitchell advised the Commission that it could properly issue such a minor-part license;4 the question submitted by the Commission had stated that the New River was neither navigated nor navigable in fact. On November 25, the Commission 'declined to take action on the application favorable or adverse,' on the ground that a court adjudication was desirable. After the establishment of the Commission as an independent agency,5 it held another hearing in February, 1931; in April it denied the application for a minor-part license, directed that the respondent be tendered a standard form license under the Act, and ordered it not to proceed without such a license. A minority of the Commission then \n\n[311 \nU.S. 377, 401]\n\u00a0\n favored a finding that the New River was navigable; the majority, however, thought that question was for the courts and that the Commission's jurisdiction was properly based upon section 23 of the Federal Water Power Act.\n On June 8, 1931, the respondent brought an action against the Commission to remove a cloud on its title and to restrain interference with the use of its property. This case was dismissed for jurisdictional reasons. \n6\n While it was pending, on October 12, 1932, the Commission without notice adopted a resolution that the New River, from the mouth of Wilson Creek, Virginia, north, was navigable.\n The respondent began construction work on the dam about June 1, 1934. On May 6, 1935, the United States filed this bill for an injunction against the construction or maintenance of the proposed dam otherwise than under a license from the Federal Power Commission, and in the alternative a mandatory order of removal. It alleged that the New River is navigable; that the dam would constitute an obstruction to navigation and would impair the navigable capacity of the navigable waters of the United States on the New, Kanawha and Ohio Rivers; that the Commission had found the dam would affect the interests of interstate or foreign commerce; and that its construction therefore violated both the Rivers and Harbors Act and the Federal Water Power Act. Respondent denied these allegations, and also set forth a number of separate defenses based on the assumption that the New River was nonnavigable. The fortieth and forty-first paragrahs of the answer, however, set forth defenses relied on by the respondent even if the river were held navigable. The substance of these was (1) that the conditions of any federal license must \n\n[311 \nU.S. 377, 402]\n\u00a0\n be strictly limited to the protection of the navigable capacity of the waters of the United States; and (2) that the Commission's refusal to grant the minor-part license containing only such conditions was unlawful, and that any relief should be conditioned upon the Commission's granting respondent such a license. By these defenses respondent put in question-in the event of an adverse holding on navigability-the validity of the conditions of the Act carried over into the standard form license which relate to accounts, control of operation and eventual acquisition of the project at the expiration of the license.\n After trial, in an opinion reinforced by formal findings of fact and law, the district court decided that the New River is not a navigable water of the United States; that respondent's dam would not obstruct the navigable capacity of the Kanawha or any other navigable river, and would not affect the interests of interstate commerce; that the Power Commission's findings on these matters were not final but subject to the determination of the courts;7 that the Federal Water Power Act did not vest in the Commission authority to require a license in a nonnavigable river; that even if the Commission had authority to require some license for a dam in nonnavigable waters, it could not impose conditions having no relation to the protection of the navigable capacity of waters of the United States; and that its effort to impose upon respondent a license containing unlawful conditions barred the United States from relief. The district judge therefore dismissed the bill, but left it open \n\n[311 \nU.S. 377, 403]\n\u00a0\n to the Government to assert its rights if future operation of the project interfered with the navigable capacity of the waters of the United States. The circuit court of appeals, with one judge dissenting, affirmed. We granted certiorari. \n 8\n\u00a0\n\n Concurrent Findings. The district court's finding that the new River was not navigable was concurred in by the circuit court of appeals after a careful appraisal of the evidence in the record. \n9\n Both courts stated in detail the circumstantial facts relating to the use of the river and its physical characteristics, such as volume of water, swiftness and obstructions. There is no real disagreement between the parties here concerning these physical and historical evidentiary facts. But there are sharp divergencies of view as to their reliability as indicia of navigability and the weight which should be attributed to them. The disagreement is over the ultimate conclusion upon navigability to be drawn from this uncontroverted evidence.\n The respondent relies upon this Court's statement that 'each determination as to navigability must stand on its own facts,'10 and upon the conventional rule that factual findings concurred in by two courts will be accepted by this Court unless clear error is shown. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n In cases involving the navigability of water courses, this Court, without expressly passing on the finality of the findings, on some occasions has entered into consideration of the facts found by two courts to determine for \n\n[311 \nU.S. 377, 404]\n\u00a0\n itself whether the courts have correctly applied to the facts found the proper legal tests. \n12\n When we deal with issues such as these before us, facts and their constitutional significance are too closely connected to make the two-court rule a serviceable guide. The legal concept of navigability embraces both public and private interests. It is not to be determined by a formula which fits every type of stream under all circumstances and at all times. Our past decisions have taken due account of the changes and complexities in the circumstances of a river. We do not purport now to lay down any single definitive test. We draw from the prior decisions in this field and apply them, with due regard to the dynamic nature of the problem, to the particular circumstances presented by the New River. To these circumstances certain judicial standards are to be applied for determining whether the complex of the conditions in respect to its capacity for use in interstate commerce remder it a navigable stream within the Constitutional requirements. Both the standards and the ultimate conclusion invorve questions of law inseparable from the particular facts to which they are applied.\n Navigability. The power of the United States over its waters which are capable of use as interstate highways arises from the commerce clause of the Constitution, art. 1,  8, cl. 3. 'The Congress shall have Power ... To regulate Commerce ... among the several States.' It was held early in our history that the power to regulate commerce necessarily included power over navigation. \n13\n To make its control effective the Congress may keep the 'navi- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 377, 405]\n\u00a0\n gable waters of the United States' open and free and provide by sanctions against any interference with the country's water assets. \n14\n It may legislate to forbid or license dams in the waters;15 its power over improvements for navigation in rivers is 'absolute.' \n16\n\u00a0\n\n The states possess control of the waters within their borders, 'subject to the acknowledged jurisdiction of the United States under the constitution in regard to commerce and the navigation of the waters of rivers.' \n17\n It is this subordinate local control that, even as to navigable rivers, creates between the respective governments a contrariety of interests relating to the regulation and protection of waters through licenses, the operation of structures and the acquisition of projects at the end of the license term. But there is no doubt that the United States possesses the power to control the erection of structures in navigable waters.\n The navigability of the New River is, of course, a factual question18 but to call it a fact cannot obscure the diverse elements that enter into the application of the legal tests as to navigability. We are dealing here with the sovereign powers of the Union, the Nation's right that its waterways be utilized for the interests of the commerce of the whole country. It is obvious that the uses to which the streams may be put vary from the carriage of ocean liners to the floating out of logs;19 that the density of traffic varies equally widely from the busy \n\n[311 \nU.S. 377, 406]\n\u00a0\n harbors of the seacoast to the sparsely settled regions of the Western mountains. \n20\n The tests as to navigability must take these variations into consideration.\n Both lower courts based their investigation primarily upon the generally accepted definition of The Daniel Ball. \n21\n In so doing they were in accord with the rulings of this Court on the basic concept of navigability. \n22\n Each application of this test, however, is apt to uncover variations and refinements which require further elaboration.\n In the lower courts and here, the Government urges that the phrase 'susceptible of being used, in their ordinary condition,' in the Daniel Ball definition, should not be construed as eliminating the possibility of determining navigability in the light of the effect of reasonable improvements. The district court thought the argument inapplicable. \n23\n\u00a0\n\n[311 \nU.S. 377, 407]\n\u00a0\n The circuit court of appeals said:\n'If this stretch of the river was not navigable in fact in its unimproved condition, it is not to be considered navigable merely because it might have been made navigable by improvements which were not in fact made. Of course if the improvements had been made the question of fact might have been different.' 24\n\n To appraise the evidence of navigability on the natural condition only of the waterway is erroneous. Its availability for navigation must also be considered. 'Natural or ordinary conditions'25 refers to volume of water, the gradients and the regularity of the flow. A waterway, otherwise suitable for navigation, is not barred from that classification merely because artificial aids must make the highway suitable for use before commercial navigation may be undertaken. Congress has recognized this in section 3 of the Water Power Act by defining 'navigable waters' as those 'which either in their natural or improved condition' are used or suitable for use. The district court is quite right in saying there are obvious limits to such improvements as affecting navigability. These limits are necessarily a matter of degree. \n26\n There must be a balance between cost and need at a time when \n\n[311 \nU.S. 377, 408]\n\u00a0\n the improvement would be useful. When once found to be navigable, a waterway remains so.27 This is no more indefinite than a rule of navigability in fact as adopted below based upon 'useful interstate commerce' or 'general and common usefulness for purposes of trade and commerce' if these are interpreted as barring improvements. \n28\n Nor is it necessary that the improvements should be actually completed or even authorized. The power of Congress over commerce is not to be hampered because of the necessity for reasonable improvements to make an interstate waterway available for traffic.\n Of course there are difficulties in applying these views. Improvements that may be entirely reasonable in a thickly populated, highly developed, industrial region may have been entirely too costly for the same region in the days of the pioneers. The changes in engineering practices or the coming of new industries with varying classes of freight may affect the type of the improvement. Although navigability to fix ownership of the river bed29 or riparian rights30 is determined as the cases just cited in the notes show, as of the formation of the Union in the original states or the admission to statehood of those formed later, navigability, for the purpose of the regulation of commerce, may later arise. \n31\n An analogy is found in admiralty jurisdiction, 32 which may be extended over places formerly nonnavigable. \n33\n There \n\n[311 \nU.S. 377, 409]\n\u00a0\n has never been doubt that the navigability referred to in the cases was navigability despite the obstruction of falls, rapids, sand bars, carries or shifting currents. \n34\n The plenary federal power over commerce must be able to develop with the needs of that commerce which is the reason for its existence. It cannot properly be said that the federal power over navigation is enlarged by the improvements to the waterways. It is merely that improvements make applicable to certain waterways the existing power over commerce. \n35\n In determining the navigable character of the New River it is proper to consider the feasibility of interstate use after reasonable improvements which might be made. \n36\n\u00a0\n\n Nor is it necessary for navigability that the use should be continuous. The character of the region, its products and the difficulties or dangers of the navigation influence the regularity and extent of the use. \n37\n Small traffic compared to the available commerce of the region is sufficient. \n38\n Even absence of use over long periods of years, because of changed conditions, the coming of the railroad or improved highways does not affect the navigability \n\n[311 \nU.S. 377, 410]\n\u00a0\n of rivers in the constitutional sense. \n39\n It is well recognized too that the navigability may be of a substantial part only of the waterway in question. 40 Of course, these evidences of nonnavigability in whole or in part are to be appraised in totality to determine the effect of all. With these legal tests in mind we proceed to examine the facts to see whether the 111-mile reach of this river from Allisonia to Hinton, across the Virginia-West Virginia state line, has 'capability of use by the public for purposes of transportation and commerce.' \n41\n\u00a0\n\n Physical Characteristics. New River may be said to assume its character as such at the mouth of Wilson Creek near the North Carolina- Virginia line. From that point it flows first in a northeast and then in a northwest direction something over 250 miles to Kanawha Falls, West Virginia. It passes through Allisonia and Radford, Virginia, and then Hinton, West Virginia. It is joined by many tributaries, the largest of which is the Gauley. At Kanawha Falls, it changes its name to the Kanawha, a navigable river of commercial importance which joins the Ohio 97 miles below. The whole territory traversed by the New is broken and mountainous. Between Hinton and Kanawha Falls, the river is swift and the gorge precipitous. Above Hinton the river flows more slowly, through a broader valley and between less rugged mountains. The same may be said of the area above Radford. Throughout the river there is an abundance of water, and the respondent hardly denies that the flowage suffices if other conditions make the New available for navigation. \n42\n\u00a0\n\n[311 \nU.S. 377, 411]\n\u00a0\n It will conserve discussion to appraise the navigability of the 111- mile stretch between Allisonia and Hinton in three sections which together form the whole reach between these points: the 28 miles from Allisonia to Radford, which the United States improved between 1876 and 1883; the 59- mile stretch from Radford to Wiley's Falls, Virginia, never improved except at Wiley's Falls itself; and the 24 miles from Wiley's Falls across the state line to Hinton, West Virginia, which, like the upper section, the Government improved during 1876-1883. We shall examine chiefly the disputed middle section for as to the others the evidence of navigability is much stronger and that of obstructions much weaker. For instance, the report of the Chief of Engineers for 1873 refers to certain keelboats operating on the river, and his report for 1883 shows that 17 keelboats operated above Hinton. Keelboats were flat-bottomed bateaux, 50 to 70 feet long, with a draft of two feet and a carrying capacity varying up to 10 or 12 tons. They were used commercially to transport lumber, tobacco and other products of the region. The evidence is clear that these bateaux plied from Hinton up to near Glen Lyn with fair regularity through the first decade of this century and well into the second; timber and lumber in large quantities apparently were boated and rafted down to Hinton from various up-river points below Glen Lyn until about the beginning of the World War. 43 Around and above Radford the Chief of Engineers reported two keelboats operating in 1881, eight in 1882, and eight together with a small steamboat in 1883. The corroborating testimony of many witnesses shows that in the 80s \n\n[311 \nU.S. 377, 412]\n\u00a0\n these boats carried iron ore and pig iron, as well as produce and merchandise, between Allisonia and New River Bridge, which is a little above Radford. \n44\n At the Hinton and New River Bridge railroad stations, freight brought in by the keelboats or other river craft was trans-shipped, and freight arriving by rail was forwarded by river.\n We come then to a consideration of the crucial stretch from Radford to below Wiley's Falls where junction is made with the interstate reach from Wiley's Falls to Hinton. In the report of the Secretary of War for 1872 appears Hutton's useful mile-by-mile survey of the river from above Allisonia to the mouth of the Greenbrier, which is nearly down to Hinton. It was made as a basis for plans to improve the New by federal appropriation. \n45\n This survey designates the Radford-Wiley's Falls stretch as 'mile 46' to 'mile 104' inclusive. Eighteen of these miles have grades falling, gradually or abruptly, more than four feet in the mile. Several of these where there are rapids or falls show drops of eight, nine and in one instance 11 1\/2 feet. The higher footage represents, of course, miles in which small falls are found. Between there more precipitous sections are many miles of what is called 'good water,' with a gradual fall of 4 feet or less. Even in miles where the declivity is rapid, the fall is apparently largely in sections containing obstructions. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 377, 413]\n\u00a0\n For instance, the 51st mile reads 'Rapid, over bowlders and gravel, 1,500 feet long; fall, 8 1\/2 feet,' and the 100th mile 'Neilley's Falls and rapids; whole fall, 11 feet, 6 of it nearly vertical. A sluice 500 feet long, along left bank, will pass them, with 50 feet of rock excavation and 450 feet of bowlders and gravel.' Quite frequently where the fall is moderate, other obstructions appear, as the 78th mile 'Rapids, 500 feet long, over bowlders and gravel; fall, 2 feet.' Large isolated rocks are scattered abundantly throughout the stretch. A geologist testifying for the respondent tells strikingly how the faulting and folding of the surface at this stretch has resulted in the tilting of the rock strata to a steep degree. 'In its flow, the water of New River moves along and up the slopes of successive rock strata or ledges ... this results in a river with numerous ledges of rock strata, some partly submerged, some exposed, which are substantially vertical or standing on end, and which extend across the stream at right angles to the line of flow ... The slope of the strata is downward in an upstream direction rather than in a downstream direction,' contrary to the usual condition. No other data point to material variations from these descriptions.\n Use of the River from Radford to Wiley's Falls. Navigation on the Radford-Wiley's Falls stretch was not large. Undoubtedly the difficulties restricted it and with the coming of the Norfolk & Western and the Chesapeake & Ohio railroads in the 80s, such use as there had been practically ceased, except for small public ferries going from one bank to the other. \n46\n Well authenticated instances of boating along this stretch, however, exist. In 1819 a survey was made by Moore and Briggs, whom the \n\n[311 \nU.S. 377, 414]\n\u00a0\n General Assembly of Virginia had sent to report on the availability of the New for improvement. Beginning at the mouth of the Greenbrier they boated up to the mouth of Sinking Creek, some 55 miles, noting the characteristics of the river as they went. They reported that they ascended all falls with their boat, 'though, in two or three instances, with considerable difficulty, after taking out our baggage, stores, &c.' \n47\n Sinking Creek is about half way up this stretch of river we are considering.\n In 1861 the Virginia General Assembly appropriated $30,000 to improve the New River to accommodate transportation of military stores by bateaux from Central depot (Radford) to the mouth of the Greenbrier. \n48\n While there is no direct proof that this particular appropriation was spent, reports of the War Department engineers make it clear that the Confederate government effected some improvements on the river. \n49\n These facts buttress the testimony of several witnesses, one a Confederate veteran, that during the Civil War Keelbottom boats brought supplies from Radford to a commissary at \n\n[311 \nU.S. 377, 415]\n\u00a0\n the Narrows (about 7 miles above Glen Lyn), and then continued further downstream. \n50\n This testimony the circuit court of appeals accepted as true. \n 51\n\u00a0\n\n From the end of the Civil War to the coming of the railroads, the evidence of elderly residents familiar with events along the banks of the river between Radford and Wiley's Falls leaves no doubt that at least sporadic transportation took place in and throughout this stretch. By this it is not meant that the keelboats above Radford and above Hinton, which operated frequently in the improved sections, made regular through trips from Allisonia past Radford to Hinton. Through navigation, however, did occur as is shown by the testimony of a number of witnesses and recognized by the lower courts. \n52\n There are also numerous references to isolated bits of boating along parts of the Radford-Wiley's Falls reach. \n53\n And when the Government stopped improvement in 1883, it ordered the boats it was using in the lead mines' division above Allisonia, and at various places downstream, to be brought down the full stretch of the river to Hinton for sale. Under the supervision of the assistant engineer, a derrick boat, four bateaux, and numerous flat boats, skiffs and canoes-more than twenty vessels in all-were taken down to Hinton, a number of them from points above Radford. This was accomplished, as the Chief of Engineers' report shows, despite difficulties \n\n[311 \nU.S. 377, 416]\n\u00a0\n occasioned by 'weather, low water, and scarcity of labor.' \n54\n\u00a0\n\n In addition to the testimony of use in the days before railways and good roads, there was a demonstration of the possibility of navigation by a government survey boat with an outboard motor, 16 feet long, five feet wide, drawing 2 1\/2 to 3 feet, loaded with a crew of five and its survey equipment. This boat made a round trip from the Narrows, just above Wiley's Falls, to Allisonia, a distance of 72 miles one way, in July, 1936, when the river stage was normal summer low water. While the crew was out of the boat and used poles a number of times, there were no carries or portages. Going upstream it was not necessary to pull or push the boat more than a mile and a quarter and not more than a few hundred feet on the return trip.\n Use of a stream long abandoned by water commerce is difficult to prove by abundant evidence. Fourteen authenticated instances of use in a century and a half by explorers and trappers, coupled with general historical references to the river as a water route for the early fur traders and their supplies in pirogues and Durham or flat-bottomed craft similar to the keelboats of the New, sufficed upon that phase in the case of the DesPlaines. \n55\n Nor is lack of commercial traffic a bar to a conclusion of navigability where personal or private use by boats demonstrates the availability of the stream for the simpler types of commercial navigation. \n56\n\u00a0\n\n The evidence of actual use of the Radford-Wiley's Falls section for commerce and for private convenience, \n\n[311 \nU.S. 377, 417]\n\u00a0\n when taken in connection with its physical condition make it quite plain that by reasonable improvement the reach would be navigable for the type of boats employed on the less obstructed sections. Indeed the evidence detailed above is strikingly similar to that relied upon by this Court in United States v. Utah57 to establish the navigability of the Colorado from Cataract Canyon to the Utah-Arizona boundary line. There had been seventeen through trips over a period of sixty years from the original exploration; and these together with sporadic trips on parts of the stretch, and considerable use-in connection with gold placer mining-of other parts from 1888 to 1915, sufficed to sustain navigability. \n58\n\u00a0\n\n Effect of Improvability. Respondent denied the practicability of artificial means to bring about the navigability of the New River and the effectiveness of any improvement to make the river a navigable water of the United States. The Government supported its allegation of improvability by pointing out that the use of the section for through navigation and local boating on favorable stretches of the Radford-Wiley's Falls reach showed the feasibility of such use and that little was needed in the way of improvements to make the section a thoroughfare for the typical, light commercial traffic of the area. Keelboats, eight feet wide, drawing two feet, were the usual equipment. In the 1872 report of the Chief of Engineers, Major Craighill in charge of New River reports that to get 'good sluice navigation of 2 feet at all times' for 54 miles up from the mouth of the Greenbrier River, near Hinton, would cost $30,000 and for 128 miles, Greenbrier to the lead mines (above Allisonia), would cost $100, 000. The depth over the shoals could be increased to 2 feet without 'too much increase \n\n[311 \nU.S. 377, 418]\n\u00a0\n of velocity of the current.' This recommendation was based on Hutton's mile-by-mile survey and includes all of the Radford-Wiley's Falls section.\n The improvements were undertaken beginning in 1887. As the region was becoming better developed, a higher type of improvement became desirable, wider sluice ways and a deeper channel, usable by small steamboats. Work went forward above Hinton and above Radford to meet the pressing demands of the communities. Annual reports of the Chief of Engineers assumed or reaffirmed the navigability of the entire river above Hinton and the practicality of the improvements. \n59\n By 1891, $109,733.21 had been spent. It was in that year estimated $159,000 more would be required to complete the project the full length from Wilson Creek to Hinton. \n60\n Useful navigation moved regularly between Hinton and near Glenlyn and between Radford and Allisonia. About half the reach between Hinton and Allisonia was improved. The Radford-Wiley's Falls section was never improved. It was reported that conditions had changed and the project should not be completed. \n61\n The provisions for improvements were repealed in 1902.62 By 1912 the region's need for use of the river had so diminished that the army engineers advised against undertaking improvements again, and even referred to the cost as 'prohibitive.' \n63\n From the use of the Radford- Wiley's Falls stretch and the evidence as to its ready improvability at a low cost for easier keelboat use, we conclude that this section of the New River is navigable. It follows from this, together with the undisputed commercial \n\n[311 \nU.S. 377, 419]\n\u00a0\n use of the two stretches above Radford and Hinton, that the New River from Allisonia, Virginia, to Hinton, West Virginia, is a navigable water of the United States.\n License Provisions. The determination that the New River is navigable eliminates from this case issues which may arise only where the river involved is nonnavigable. \n64\n But even accepting the navigability of the New River, the respondent urges that certain provisions of the license, which seek to control affairs of the licensee, are unconnected with navigation and are beyond the power of the Commission, indeed beyond the constitutional power of Congress to authorize.\n The issue arises because of the prayer of the bill that the respondent be compelled to accept the license as required by law or remove the dam as an obstruction and the answer of the respondent that the license required by law and tendered to it by the Commission contains provisions, unrelated to navigation or the protection of navigable capacity, which are beyond the consititutional authority of Congress to require on account of the Fifth and Tenth Amendments. There is no contention that the provisions of the license are not authorized by the statute. In the note below65 the chief \n\n[311 \nU.S. 377, 420]\n\u00a0\n statutory conditions for a license are epitomized. The license offered the respondent on May 5, 1931, embodied these statutory requirements and we assume it to be in conformity with the existing administration of the Power Act. We shall pass upon the validity of only those provisions of the license called to our attention by the respondent as being unrelated to the purposes of navigation. These are the conditions derived from sections 10(a), 10(c), 10(d), 10(e) and 14. We do not consider that the validity of other clauses has been raised by the respondent's general challenge to the constitutionality of any provision 'other than those relating solely to the protection' of navigable waters. \n66\n It should also be noted that no complaint is made of any conditions of the license dependent upon the authorization of  10(g), the omnibus \n\n[311 \nU.S. 377, 421]\n\u00a0\n clause requiring compliance with such other conditions as the Commission may require.\n The petitioner suggests that consideration of the validity of section 14, the acquisition clause, and the license conditions based upon its language are properly to be deferred until the United States undertakes to claim the right to purchase the project on the license terms fifty years after its issuance. 67 Assuming that the mere acceptance of a license would not later bar the objection of unconstitutional conditions, even when accompanied by a specific agreement to abide by the statute and license,68 we conclude that here the requirements of section 14 so vitally effect the establishment and financing of respondent's project as to require a determination of their validity before finally adjudging the issue of injunction.\n The respondent's objections to the statutory and license provisions, as applied to navigable streams, are based on the contentions (1) that the United States' control of the waters is limited to control for purposes of navigation, (2) that certain license provisions take its property without due process, and (3) that the claimed right to acquire this project and to regulate its financing, records and affairs, is an invasion of the rights of the states, contrary to the Tenth Amendment.\n Forty-one states join as amici in support of the respondent's arguments. While conceding, as of course, that Congress may prohibit the erection in navigable waters of the United States of any structure deemed to impair navigation, the Attorneys General speaking for the states insist that this power of prohibition does not comprehend a power to exact conditions, which are un- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 377, 422]\n\u00a0\n related to navigation, for the permission to erect such structures. To permit, the argument continues, the imposition of licenses involving conditions such as this acquisition clause, enabling the Federal Government to take over a natural resource such as water-power, allows logically similar acquisition of mines, oil or farmlands as consideration for the privilege of doing an interstate business. The states thus lose control of their resources and property is withdrawn from taxation in violation of the Tenth Amendment.\n Further, the point is made that a clash of sovereignty arises between the license provisions of the Power Act and state licensing provisions. The Commonwealth of Virginia advances forcibly its contention that the affirmative regulation of waterpower projects on its navigable streams within its boundaries rests with the state, beyond that needed for navigation. 'While the supremacy of the Federal Government in its own proper sphere, as delineated in the Constitution, is cheerfully conceded, yet just as earnestly does Virginia insist upon the supremacy of her own government in its proper field as established by that instrument.' Virginia has a Water Power Act. \n69\n It, too, offers a fifty-year license, with the right to use the natural resources of the state, the stream flow and the beds of the water courses for the period of the license or its extensions subject to state condemnation at any time on Virginia's terms for ascertainment of value. Operation is likewise regulated by state law. 70 The Commonwealth objects that the development of its water power resources is subjected to Federal Power Act requirements such as are detailed above in stating the respondent's objection, even to the point that Virginia itself may not build and operate a dam in \n\n[311 \nU.S. 377, 423]\n\u00a0\n navigable water without authorization and regulation by the Federal Government.\n The briefs and arguments at the bar have marshaled reasons and precedents to cover the wide range of possible disagreement between Nation and state in the functioning of the Federal Power Act. To predetermine, even in the limited field of water power, the rights of different sovereignties, pregnant with future controversies, is beyond the judicial function. The courts deal with concrete legal issues, presented in actual cases, not abstractions. \n71\n The possibility of other uses of the coercive power of license, if it is here upheld, is not before us. We deem the pictured extremes irrelevant save as possibilities for consideration in determining the present question of the validity of the challenged license provisions. To this we limit this portion of our decision. \n72\n\u00a0\n\n The respondent is a riparian owner with a valid state license to use the natural resources of the state for its enterprise. Consequently it has as complete a right to the use of the riparian lands, the water, and the river bed as can be obtained under state law. The state and respondent, alike, however, hold that waters and the lands under them subject to the power of Congress to control the waters for the purpose of commerce. \n73\n The power flows from the grant to regulate, i.e., to 'prescribe the rule by which commerce is to be governed.' \n74\n This in- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 377, 424]\n\u00a0\n cludes the protection of navigable waters in capacity as well as use. \n75\n This power of Congress to regulate commerce is so unfettered that its judgment as to whether a structure is or is not a hindrance is conclusive. Its determination is legislative in character. \n76\n The Federal Government has domination over the water power inherent in the flowing stream. It is liable to no one for its use or non-use. The flow of a navigable stream is in no sense private property; 'that the running water in a great navigable stream is capable of private ownership is inconceivable.' Exclusion of riparian owners from its benefits without compensation is entirely within the Government's discretion. \n77\n\u00a0\n\n Possessing this plenary power to exclude structures from navigable waters and dominion over flowage and its product, energy, the United States may make the erection or maintenance of a structure in a navigable water dependent upon a license. \n78\n This power is exercised through section 9 of the Rivers nad Harbors Act of 1899 prohibiting construction without Congressional consent and through section 4(e) of the present Power Act.\n It is quite true that the criticized provisions summarized above are not essential to or even concerned with navigation as such. Respondent asserts that the rights of the United States to the use of the waters is limited to navigation. It is pointed out that the federal sovereignty over waters was so described in Port of Seattle v. Oregon & Washington Railroad Company,79 United States v. Ore- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 377, 425]\n\u00a0\n gon,80 Kansas v. Colorado,81 United States v. River Rouge Company,82 and Wisconsin v. Illinois. \n83\n The first two of these cases centered around the issue of title to land under navigable water. Nothing further was involved as to the use of the water than its navigability. In Kansas v. Colorado the point was the Government's advocacy of the doctrine of sovereign and inherent power to justify the United States taking charge of the waters of the Arkansas to control the reclamation of arid lands. 206 U.S. pages 85- 89, 27 S.Ct. pages 662-664. There was found no constitutional authority for irrigation in the commerce clause or the clause relating to properly of the United States. \n84\n It cannot be said, however, that the case is authority for limiting federal power over navigable waters to navigation,85 especially since the stretch of the Arkansas River involved in the dispute was asserted by the Government to be nonnavigable. 206 U.S. page 86, 27 S.Ct. page 662. In the River Rouge controversy, this Court spoke of the limitation 'to the control thereof for the purposes of navigation.' But there, too, it was a question of the riparian owner's use of his property for access to the channel, a use fixed by state law. The conclusion that the United States could not interfere, except for navigation, with his right of access to navigable water, required no appraisal of other rights. Wisconsin v. Illinois is a part of the Chicago Drainage Canal litigation. In so far as pertinent here, it merely decided that under a certain federal statute86 there was no authority for diversion of the waters of Lake Michigan for sanitary purposes. 278 U.S. page 418, 49 S.Ct. page 171. There is no consideration \n\n[311 \nU.S. 377, 426]\n\u00a0\n of the constitutional power to use water for other than navigable purposes, though it is plain that other advantages occur. 278 U.S. pages 415, 419, 49 S.Ct. pages 170, 172.\n In our view, it cannot properly be said that the constitutional power of the United States over its waters is limited to control for navigation. By navigation respondent means no more than operation of boats and improvement of the waterway itself. In truth the authority of the United States is the regulation of commerce on its waters. Navigability, in the sense just stated, is but a part of this whole. Flood protection, watershed development, recovery of the cost of improvements through utilization of power are likewise parts of commerce control. \n87\n As respondent soundly argues, the United States cannot by calling a project of its own 'a multiple purpose dam' give to itself additional powers, but equally truly the respondent cannot, by seeking to use a navigable waterway for power generation alone, avoid the authority of the Government over the stream. That authority is as broad as the needs of commerce. Water power development from dams in navigable streams is from the public's standpoint a by-product of the general use of the rivers for commerce. To this general power, the respondent must submit its single purpose of electrical production. The fact that the Commission is willing to give a license for a power dam only is of no significance in appraising the type of conditions allowable. It may well be that this portion of the river is not needed for navigation at this time. Or that the dam proposed may function satisfactorily with others, contemplated or intended. It may fit in as a part of the river development. The point is that navigable waters are subject to national planning and control in the broad regulation of commerce granted the \n\n[311 \nU.S. 377, 427]\n\u00a0\n Federal Government. The license conditions to which objection is made have an obvious relationship to the exercise of the commerce power. Even if there were no such relationship the plenary power of Congress over navigable waters would empower it to deny the privilege of constructing an obstruction in those waters. It may likewise grant the privilege on terms. It is no objection to the terms and to the exertion of the power that 'its exercise is attended by the same incidents which attend the exercise of the police power of the states.' \n88\n The Congressional authority under the commerce clause is complete unless limited by the Fifth Amendment.\n The respondent urges that as riparian owner with state approval of its plans, it is entitled to freedom in the development of its property and particularly cannot be compelled to submit to the acquisition clause with a price fixed at less than a fair value, in the eminent domain sense, at the time of taking. Such a taking, it is contended, would violate the Fifth Amendment. It is now a question whether the Government in taking over the property may do so at less than a fair value. It has been shown, note 77, supra, that there is no private property in the flow of the stream. This has no assessable value to the riparian owner. If the Government were now to build the dam, it would have to pay the fair value, judicially determined,89 for the fast land; nothing for the water power. \n90\n We assume without deciding that by compulsion of the method of acquisition provided in section 14 of the Power Act and the tendered license, these riparian rights may pass to the United States for less than their value. In our view this 'is the price which (respondents) must pay to secure the right to maintain \n\n[311 \nU.S. 377, 428]\n\u00a0\n their dam.' The quoted words are the conclusion of the opinion in Fox River Company v. Railroad Commission. \n91\n The case is decisive on the issue of confiscation. It relates to an acquisition clause in a Wisconsin license by which a dam in navigable water of the state might be taken over a such a price as would, this Court assumed, amount to violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment if it were not for the license provision. Title to the bank and bed were in the objector, just as, by virtue of the state's license and the riparian ownership, all rights here belong to respondent. There, as here, the rights were subject to governmental 'control of navigable waters.' \n92\n The fact that the Fox River case involved a state and that this case involves the United States is immaterial from the due process standpoint. Since the United States might erect a structure in these waters itself, even one equipped for electrical generation,93 it may constitutionally acquire one already built.\n Such an acquisition or such an option to acquire is not an invasion of the sovereignty of a state. At the formation of the Union, the states delegated to the Federal Government authority to regulate commerce among the states. So long as the things done within the states by the United States are valid under that power, there can be no interference with the sovereignty of the state. It is the non-delegated power which under the Tenth Amendment remains in the state or the people. The water power statutes of the United States and of Virginia recognize the difficulties of our dual system of \n\n[311 \nU.S. 377, 429]\n\u00a0\n government by providing, each in its own enactments, for the exercise of rights of the other. \n94\n\u00a0\n\n Reversed and remanded to the District Court with instructions to enter an order enjoining the construction, maintenance or operation of the Radford project otherwise than under a license, accepted by the respondent within a reasonable time, substantially in the form tendered respondent by the Federal Power Commission on or about May 5, 1931, or in the alternative, as prayed in the bill.\n Reversed and remanded.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS (dissenting).\n The judgment of reversal rests on the conclusion that New River is navigable,- a conclusion resting on findings of fact, made here de novo, and in contradiction of the concurrent findings of the two courts below. I am of opinion that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be affirmed, first, because this court ought to respect and give effect to such concurrent findings which have substantial support in the evidence; secondly, because the evidence will not support contrary findings if the navigability of New River be tested by criteria long established.\n\n 1. \nA river is navigable in law if it is navigable in fact. \n1\n Indeed the issue of navigability vel non is so peculiarly one of fact that a determination as to one stream can have little relevancy in determining the status of another. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 377, 430]\n\u00a0\n As this court has said, 'each determination as to navigability must stand on its own facts.' \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The evidence supports,-indeed I think it requires,-a finding that, applying accepted criteria, New River is not, and never has been, in fact navigable. On this record the rule of decision, many times announced by this court, that the concurrent findings of fact of two lower courts, if supported by substantial evidence, will be accepted here, requires affirmance of the judgment. The rule applies not only to evidentiary facts but to conclusions of fact based thereon. Moreover, it has been the basis of this court's decision in a suit involving the question of navigability. Invoking the rule, this court, in Brewer-Elliott Oil & Gas Co. v. United States, \n260 \nU.S. 77, 86\n, 43 S.Ct. 60, 64, declined to review a judgment based on a concurrent finding of two lower courts that a stream 'was not, and had never been, navigable within the adjudged meaning of that term.'\n The cases cited for the proposition that where navigability was an issue this court has reconsidered the facts found by the courts below to determine whether they have correctly applied the proper legal tests do not, when the questions involved are understood, lend support to the action of the court in this case. 3 \n\n[311 \nU.S. 377, 431]\n\u00a0\n The petitioner, in effect, asks this court to convict the courts below of error in determining the credibility, weight and relevance of the evidence. But that determination is peculiarly within their province, as this court has often said. The doctrine applies in this case with especial force. The respondent says, without contradiction, that the Government in its brief in the Circuit Court stated: 'It cannot be said that the New River presents a 'clear case' of navigability or non-navigability ...'. Yet this court is asked to ignore concurrent findings on the subject.\n If the evidence may fairly support these findings, the courts below can be convicted of error only in applying an erroneous rule of law to the facts found.\n Examination of the opinions below shows that the courts faithfully followed the decisions of this court in applying the law to the facts. They adopted the definition4 and applied the criteria this court has announced in appraising the effect of the facts found.\n As shown by the cases cited in the margin,5 a stream to be navigable in fact must have 'a capacity for general and common usefulness for purposes of trade and commerce'. Exceptional use or capability of use at high water or under other abnormal conditions will not suf- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 377, 432]\n\u00a0\n fice. Moreover, the stream must be used, or available to use, 'for commerce of a substantial and permanent character'. Where the stream 'has never been impressed with the character of navigability by past use in commerce, ... commerce actually in esse or at least in posse is essential to navigability' and 'a theoretical or potential navigability or one that is temporary, precarious and unprofitable is not sufficient.' The most important criterion by which to ascertain the navigability of a stream is that navigability in fact must exist under 'natural and ordinary conditions'. Application of these tests by the court below to the evidence in the case led to but one conclusion,-that New River has not been, and is not now a navigable water of the United States. If the findings below had been the other way, the Government would be here strenuously contending that they could not be set aside, as it successfully did in Brewer-Elliott Oil & Gas Co. v. United States, supra.\n\n 2. \nThe petitioner contends that the application of the accepted tests to the facts disclosed amounts to a ruling of law, and asserts that error in their application is reviewable. As I read the court's opinion, the argument is not found persuasive. While apparently endorsing it in the abstract the court, instead of relying on it, adopts two additional tests in the teeth of the uniform current of authority. If anything has been settled by our decisions it is that, in order for a water to be found navigable, navigability in fact must exist under 'natural and ordinary conditions'. This means all conditions, including a multiplicity of obstacles, falls and rapids which make navigation a practical impossibility. The court now, however, announces that 'natural and ordinary conditions' refers only to volume of water, gradients, and regularity of flow. No authority is cited and I believe none can be found for thus limiting the \n\n[311 \nU.S. 377, 433]\n\u00a0\n connotation of the phrase. But further the court holds, contrary to all that has heretofore been said on the subject, that the natural and ordinary condition of the stream, however impassable it may be without improvement, means that if, by 'reasonable' improvement, the stream may be rendered navigable then it is navigable without such improvement; that 'there must be a balance between cost and need at a time when the improvement would be useful.' No authority is cited and I think none can be cited which countenances any such test. It is of course true that if a stream in its natural and ordinary condition is navigable it does not cease to be so because improvements have bettered the conditions of navigation. \n6\n But the converse is not true,-that where a stream in its natural and ordinary condition is nonnavigable, a project to build a canal along its entire course, or dams and locks every few miles, at enormous expense, would render it a navigable water of the United States. Who is to determine what is a reasonable or an unreasonable improvement in the circumstances; or what is a proper balance between cost and need? If these questions must be answered it is for Congress, certainly not for this court to answer them. If this test be adopted, then every creek in every state of the Union which has enough water, when conserved by dams and locks or channelled by wing dams and sluices, to float a boat drawing two feet of water, may be pronounced navigable because, by the expenditure of some enormous sum, such a project would be possible of execution. In other words, Congress can create navigability by determining to improve a non- navigable stream.\n If this criterion be the correct one, it is not seen how any stream can be found not to be navigable nor is it \n\n[311 \nU.S. 377, 434]\n\u00a0\n seen why this court and other federal courts have been at pains for many years to apply the other tests mentioned when the simple solution of the problem in each case would have been to speculate as to whether, at 'reasonable' cost, the United States could render a most difficult and forbidding mountain torrent suitable for the least pretentious form of water traffic. In the light of the court's opinion, if this test be applied to the New River it must, of course, be admitted that by blasting out channels through reefs and shoals, by digging canals around falls and rapids, and possibly by dams and locks, the New River could be rendered fit for some sort of commercial use. What the expense would be no one knows. Obviously it would be enormous. Congress in the past has undertaken to render the river navigable and decades ago gave up the attempt. Still we are told that, at 'reasonable' cost, the thing can be done, and so the stream is navigable.\n In the light of the grounds upon which the decision of the court is based it hardly seems necessary to comment on the evidence, for it is in the main addressed to issues no longer in the case. The two courts below have analyzed it and examined it in detail and reference to their carefully considered opinions suffices. \n7\n I think the conclusion reached by the courts below must stand unless the two novel doctrines now announced be thrown into the scale to overcome it.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concurs in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 30 Stat. 1151, 33 U.S.C.  401, 403, 33 U.S.C.A.  401, 403. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 41 Stat. 1063.

The supreme court of the Territory of New Mexico observed that 'the navigability of a river does not depend upon its susceptibility of being so improved by high engineering skill and the expenditures of vast sums of money, but upon its natural present conditions.' 9 N.M. 292, 299, 51 P. 674, 676.

Section 6 provides 'That the grantee (the City) is prohibited from ever selling or letting to any corporation or individual, except a municipality or a municipal water district or irrigation district, the right to sell or sublet the water or the electric energy sold or given to it or him by the said grantee: Provided, That the rights hereby granted shall not be sold, \n\n[310 \nU.S. 16, 19]\n\u00a0\n assigned, or transferred to any private person, corporation, or association, and in case of any attempt to so sell, assign, transfer, or convey, this grant shall revert to the Government of the United States.'\n The District Court concluded that the City was violating Section 6 by the sale and distribution of Hetch-Hetchy power through the Pacific Gas & Electric Company, a private utility. Accordingly, the City was required by injunction alternatively to discontinue such disposal of the power or cease further use of the lands and rights granted it under the Act for generation and transmission of electric energy. \n4\n The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed,5 finding that the private utility was merely acting as the City's agent in the sale and distribution of Hetch-Hetchy power and holding that Section 6 does not prohibit such sale and distribution of that power by private utility.\n Here, as in the courts below, the City has defended the sale and distribution by the Pacific Gas & Electric Company of power originating at Hetch-Hetchy upon the grounds that such disposition does not violate the prohibitions of Section 6; that imposition of these prohibitions was not within the constitutional authority of Congress; and that if Section 6 is valid and has been violated, the United States is not entitled to injunctive relief in equity.\n First. Prohibitions of Section 6. In the City's view, Section 6 does not preclude private utilities from all participation in the ultimate sale and distribution of Hetch-Hetchy power. The City insists that the Section, so construed, does no more than prohibit the City from selling \n\n[310 \nU.S. 16, 20]\n\u00a0\n Hetch-Hetchy power to a private utility for resale to consumers and therefore permits consignment of the power to the Company, as agent of the City, for sale and distribution. On the contrary, the Government's position rests upon the claim that Pacific Gas & Electric Company is not in reality selling and distributing Hetch-Hetchy power as consignee and agent but as purchaser for resale; that the grant to the City was made upon the mandatory condition that this power be sold solely and exclusively by the City directly to consumers and without private profit in order to bring it into direct competition with adjacent privately owned utilities; and that Section 6 not only withholds the right of selling for resale but also prohibits the City 'from ever selling or letting' to any private corporation 'the right to sell or sublet the ... electric energy sold or given to it ...' by the City. The language of the Act, its background and its history require the construction given Section 6 by the Government.\n From its provisions,6 it is apparent that the Act conditions the grant upon and contemplates the development, sale and distribution of electrical power by the City itself 'for municipal and commercial use' on a scale to be gradually stepped up over a period of years. 'The ... grantee shall develop and use hydroelectric power for the use of its people and shall ... sell or supply such power for irrigation, pumping, or other beneficial use.' The 'right to sell or sublet the ... electric energy' so generated by the City cannot, as a consequence of Section 6, be sold or let. And in case of any attempt to 'sell, assign, transfer, or convey (the rights granted), this grant shall revert to the Government of the United States.'\n From the statement of the Congressman responsible for the application of the prohibitions of Section 6 specifically to \n\n[310 \nU.S. 16, 21]\n\u00a0\n electric energy,7 it is clear that as enacted Section 6 was understood to prohibit the City from transferring to a private utility the right to sell Hetch-Hetchy power (the Government's contention) and not merely to forbid sale of power as a commodity for resale as the City would have us hold:\n'Mr. Taylor of Colorado. We have got to let the municipality sell to individuals or consumers.\n\n'Mr. Thomson of Illinois. Yes; but not the right to sell some one else the power.\n\n'Mr. Taylor of Colorado. Supposing that San Francisco sells a certain block, you may say, of its power to Alameda. Has not Alameda got the right to resell that to its inhabitants?\n\n'Mr. Thomson of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, in answering the question of the gentleman from Colorado, I would like to call his attention to the fact that the subject of sale as printed in this section is not the power or the water, but the right to sell the power or the water.\n\n'...\n\n'Mr. Raker. That (the word 'individual') really is intended to cover any person who might attempt to buy this electric power or right. I think it would cover everybody outside of a corporation, the intention being to prevent anybody getting in and getting a right and sub-letting it.'8\n\n In its Report on the Bill, the House Committee on Public Lands stated that the provision of Section 6 'acquiesced in by the grantee, was designed to prevent any monopoly or private corporation from hereafter obtaining control of the water supply of San Francisco.'9 \n\n[310 \nU.S. 16, 22]\n\u00a0\n From the congressional debates on the passage of the Raker Act can be read a common understanding both on the part of sponsors of the Bill and its opponents that the grant was to be so conditioned as to require municipal performance of the function of supplying Hetch-Hetchy water and electric power directly to the ultimate consumers, and to prohibit sale or distribution of that power and water by any private corporation or individual. \n10\n On the floor of the House, the following took place between the Bill's author and other Representatives:\n'Mr. Sumners. Does San Francisco own its own lighting plant now?\n\n'Mr. Kahn. No; it does not.\n\n'Mr. Raker. I understand it does not.\n\n'Mr. Kahn. It does not own its own water supply. Its present water supply is furnished by a private company.\n\n'Mr. Raker. The Spring Valley Water System.\n\n'Mr. Sumners. Is it the purpose of this bill to have San Francisco supply electric power and water to its own people?\n\n'Mr. Raker. Yes.\n\n'Mr. Sumners. Or to supply these corporations, which will in turn supply the people?\n\n'Mr. Raker. Under this bill it is to supply its own inhabitants first . ...'11\n\n These views were in accord with the recommendation of the then Secretary of the Interior, as set out in the Report of the Public Lands Committee of the House: \n\n[310 \nU.S. 16, 23]\n\u00a0\n 'I think that it is very proper that the Federal Government should use whatever power it has over the public lands, over the parks, and over the forests, to compel the fullest use of these waters, and indirectly to require through its power to make conditions, the lowest possible rate for consumers.' \n 12\n\u00a0\n\n The theme-of an intent to require public utilization of Hetch-Hetchy power independently of private utilities-recurred at a later stage of the debate in the House:\n'Mr. Gray. ...\n\n'As I understand the bill, it provides for the furnishing of water, and also for power for commercial use. ...\n\n'... if these words here are to be constructed to serve the baseness of commercialism, it is the vilest of all vandalism. My suggestion here to you is to strike out of this bill all the commercial profit. ...\n\n'Mr. Kent. (a Member of the California delegation and a supporter of the measure) Mr. Chairman, I should like to suggest to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Gray) that this bill is strictly drawn in the public interest, that there is no possibility of selfish gain, and that no corporation or individual can obtain any benefit whatsoever from this bill. It is for the benefit of the people of California.'13\n\n In the Senate, Senator Thomas, a Member of the Committee reporting the Bill, said:\n'... San Francisco needs electric power, and California needs development in electric power just as much as she needs ownership in water , ... \n\n[310 \nU.S. 16, 24]\n\u00a0\n '... She is anxious to extend her spheres of municipal usefulness, but she is in the grip of a power monopoly as well as that of the Spring Valley Co.\n\n'... This scheme appeals to me, Mr. President, so far as the power is concerned, because the city of San Francisco as a municipality will be the owner of it, the manufacturer, the distributer of it.'14\n\n And the words of Senator Norris, also a Member of the reporting Committee and a leading sponsor of the bill, on the day of its final passage through the Senate, illuminate just what the Raker Act was intended to accomplish:\n'... I said that I was in favor of this bill to a great extent for the reason that it developed this power. This power will come into competition with the various water-power companies of California, and there are lots of them there.\n\n'... this proposition is to harness that power and to put it to public use not to give it to a private corporation. ...\n\n'Here is an instance where we are going to give it directly to the people, if we pass this bill. It is going to come into competition with power companies and corporations that have, or will have, if this bill is defeated, almost a monopoly not only in San Francisco but throughout the greater portion of California.\n\n ...\n'These make in all, as I have counted them, 18 corporations controlling the power in the vicinity of San Francisco that are under the control of this one corporation. (Pacific Gas & Electric Company.)\n\n'... When you sum them all up you will find that they own practically all of the hydroelectric power of the State of California, and this bill, if passed, will bring \n\n[310 \nU.S. 16, 25]\n\u00a0\n into competition with them one of the greatest units for the development of power that has ever been developed in the history of the world. It means competition.\n\n'... Conservation does not mean dealing out these resources to private capital for gain. It is not necessary to accuse those corporations of doing any wrong; but here will be an instance where the cheapest power on earth with be developed and where it will be sold at cost.'15\n\n Opponents of the bill themselves recognized that its regulatory conditions were designed to insure distribution of power from Hetch-Hetchy through a municipal system in San Francisco. Before final passage in the Senate, opposition had practically narrowed down to the power provisions of the measure,16 and these provisions contemplated a publicly owned and operated power system. \n17\n\u00a0\n\n[310 \nU.S. 16, 26]\n\u00a0\n Immediately before the vote in the Senate, Senator McCumber, opposed to the power provisions of Section 6, offered a sweeping amendment which would have omitted that Section and all other provisions relating to the generation, sale and distribution of Hetch-Hetchy power. \n18\n But his amendment was defeated. \n19\n And despite this articulate opposition to the policy embodied in its power features, the Act was passed.\n To limit the prohibitions of Section 6 of the Act narrowly to sales of power for resale without more, as the City asks, would permit evasion and frustration of the purpose of the lawmakers. Congress clearly intended to require-as a condition of its grant-sale and distribution of Hetch- Hetchy power exclusively by San Francisco and municipal agencies directly to consumers in the belief that consumers would thus be afforded power at cheap rates in competition with private power companies, particularly Pacific Gas & Electric Company. It is not the office of the courts to pass upon the justification for that belief or the efficacy of the measures chosen for putting it into effect. Selection of the emphatically expressed purpose embodied in this Act was the appropriate business of the legislative body. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 16, 27]\n\u00a0\n The admitted facts shown by this record required the District Court to find-as it did-that the City was violating Section 6 in permitting sale and distribution of Hetch-Hetchy power by the Pacific Gas & Electric Company. Now, as it has been doing since contracting with the City in 1925, the Company sells and distributes that power as follows:\n Power generated in the City's plant is transmitted to the Company at Newark, about thirty-five miles from San Francisco. There the power is delivered to the Company's sub-station and thereafter is under the Company's complete control. The Company distributes and sells this power to its customers in San Francisco and elsewhere exactly as it handles other power which it generates, buys or owns. Consumers of the power are billed by and pay the Company. The City buys Hetch-Hetchy power from the Company exactly as do other consumers. The City receives monthly payments from the Company on a fixed basis set out in the contract. The price received by the City has remained constant from 1925 to date although rates to the consumers have varied in the interim. In the event of the refusal, failure or inability of the Company to take the available output of the City's plant in accordance with the agreement, the amount of energy which the City could have delivered is the basis of making the monthly payment, and the Company must pay for power delivered to it whether actually disposed of by resale or not. The rate paid by consumers for the Hetch-Hetchy power is not fixed by the City, as it could be under the Constitution of California,20 but is fixed by the State Railroad Commission just as the price of \n\n[310 \nU.S. 16, 28]\n\u00a0\n all other power sold by the Pacific Gas & Electric Company in California is fixed.\n Thus, in brief, the City does not itself distribute and sell the power directly to consumers; it has not provided competition with the private power company; and it has transferred the right to sell and distribute the power to a private power company in violation of the express prohibition of Section 6 of the Act.\n Terminology of consignment of power, rather than of transfer by sale, and verbal description of the power Company as the City's agent or consignee, are not sufficient to take the actions of the parties under the contract out of Section 6. Congress, in effect trustee of public lands for all the people, has by this Act sought to protect and control the disposition of a section of the public domain. The City has in fact followed a course of conduct which Congress, by Section 6, has forbidden. Mere words and ingenuity of contractual expression, whatever their effect between the parties, cannot by description make permissible a course of conduct forbidden by law. When we look behind the word description of the arrangement between the City and the power company to what was actually done, we see that the City has-contrary to the terms of Section 6- abdicated its control over the sale and ultimate distribution of Hetch- Hetchy power. There remain only the determinations whether the prohibitions of Section 6 are constitutional and can be enforced in equity.\n Second. The prohibitions of Section 6 are challenged by the City as an unconstitutional invasion of the rights of the State of California on the ground that they attempt to regulate the manner in which electricity shall be disposed of in San Francisco. And the City therefore insists that these prohibitions must be considered only as covenants in a contract between the City and the United States. Upon this premise, the City has argued here, as it did in \n\n[310 \nU.S. 16, 29]\n\u00a0\n the Court of Appeals, that alleged equitable defenses render the covenants unenforceable.\n When the Raker Bill was before Congress, the City filed with the Public Lands Committee of the House a brief and argument in support of the Bill. Citing authorities, including this Court's opinions, and legislative precedents, the City submitted to Congress that as grantee it would be bound by and as grantor Congress was empowered to impose 'the conditions set forth in the Hetch-Hetchy bill.' \n21\n After passage of the Bill the City accepted the grant by formal ordinance, assented to all the conditions contained in the grant, constructed the required power and water facilities and up to date has utilized the rights, privileges and benefits granted by Congress. Now, the City seeks to retain the benefits of the Act while attacking the constitutionality of one of its important conditions. \n 22\n\u00a0\n\n Article 4, Section 3, Cl. 2 of the Constitution provides that 'The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States.' The power over the public land thus entrusted to Congress is without limitations. \n23\n 'And it is not for the courts to say how that trust shall be administered. That it for Con- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 16, 30]\n\u00a0\n gress to determine.' \n24\n Thus, Congress may constitutionally limit the disposition of the public domain to a manner consistent with its views of public policy. And the policy to govern disposal of rights to develop hydroelectric power in such public lands may, if Congress chooses, be one designed to avoid monopoly and to bring about a widespread distribution of benefits. The statutory requirement that Hetch-Hetchy power be publicly distributed does not represent an exercise of a general control over public policy in a State but instead only an exercise of the complete power which Congress has over particular public property entrusted to it. \n 25\n\u00a0\n\n Third. Finally, on the basis of numerous objections to the District Court's judgment, assigned as errors in the Court below and pressed here, the City denies the Government's right-upon a balancing of equities-to relief by injunction even if the present disposition of Hetch-Hetchy power be in violation of the Act.\n However, after consideration of all these objections, we are satisfied that this case does not call for a balancing of equities or for the invocation of the generalities of judicial maxims in order to determine whether an injunction should have issued. The City is availing itself of valuable rights and privileges granted by the Government and yet persists in violating the very conditions upon which those benefits were granted. Congress provided 'That the grantee (City) shall at all times comply with and observe on its part all the conditions specified in this Act, and in the event that the same are not reasonably complied with and carried out by the grantee, upon written request of the Secretary of the Interior, it is made the duty of the Attorney General in the name of the United \n\n[310 \nU.S. 16, 31]\n\u00a0\n States to commerce all necessary suits or proceedings in the proper court having jurisdiction thereof, for the purpose of enforcing and carrying out the provisions of this Act.' Pursuant to this legislative mandate, the present suit was instituted to enforce covenants exacted from a grantee of rights in the public domain by a Congress sympathetic with the local needs of San Francisco but also jealous of its own responsibility to dispose of such rights in a manner deemed by it most likely to render their benefits widespread. The equitable doctrines relied on do not militate against the capacity of a court of equity as a proper forum in which to make a declared policy of Congress effective. Injunction to prohibit continued use-in violation of that policy-of property granted by the United States, and to enforce the grantee's covenants, is both appropriate and necessary. \n 26\n\u00a0\n\n A substantial part of the City's argument rests upon its claim that the Department of the Interior in the period from 1913 to 1937 construed Section 6 to forbid no more than sale of power for resale. We are asked to accept these administrative interpretations. And in addition the City suggests that conduct of the Department, of which these interpretations were a part, is sufficient to create an estoppel against the Government. Whether the Department at any time ever did more than merely to tolerate sale and distribution of Hetch-Hetchy power by the Company as a temporary expedient is doubtful. Certain it is, however, that in 1935 the Secretary of the Interior declared the City's disposition of the power through the Company to be a violation of Section 6, demanded discontinuance of this violation without success and thereafter instigated this proceeding. We cannot accept the contention that administrative rulings-such as those here \n\n[310 \nU.S. 16, 32]\n\u00a0\n relied on-can thwart the plain purpose of a valid law. As to estoppel, it is enough to repeat that '... the United States is neither bound nor estopped by acts of its officers or agents in entering into an arrangement or agreement to do or cause to be done what the law does not sanction or permit.' \n27\n\u00a0\n\n The judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed. The judgment of the District Court is affirmed and we remand the case to it. It is so ordered.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS is of the opinion that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] c. 4, 38 Stat. 242. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The City and County of San Francisco is a municipal corporation of California and will be referred to here as the City. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Section 9(u) of the Act contains the following: 'Provided, however, That the grantee shall at all times comply with and observe on its part all the conditions specified in this Act, and in the event that the same are not reasonably complied with and carried out by the grantee, upon written request of the Secretary of the Interior, it is made the duty of the Attorney General in the name of the United States to commence all necessary suits or proceedings in the proper court having jurisdiction thereof, for the purpose of enforcing and carrying out the provisions of this Act.' 38 Stat. 250. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] D.C., 23 F.Supp. 40.

Gen., and Francis M. Shea, Asst. Atty. Gen., for petitioner.\n Mr. Herman J. Galloway, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question is whether respondent, Dickerson, may recover a judgment against the United States upon a cause of action founded upon Section 9 of the Act of June 10, 1922, c. 212, 42 Stat. 625, 629, 630, 10 U.S.C.A.  633.\n Section 9 provides that after the 1st of July, 1922, an enlistment allowance shall be paid 'to every honorably \n\n[310 \nU.S. 554, 555]\n\u00a0\n discharged enlisted man ... who reenlists within a period of three months from the date of his discharge'. Respondent, who was honorably discharged upon the termination of an enlisted period ending on the 21st of July, 1938, reenlisted on the following day, the 22nd, for a period of three years, but was not paid an enlistment allowance. He thereupon brought this action in the Court of Claims. It is conceded that Section 9, if not repealed or suspended at the date of his reenlistment, would entitle him to the sum of seventy-five dollars.\n The Government opposed the action before the Court of Claims on the ground that Section 402 of Public Resolution No. 122, June 21, 1938, c. 554, 52 Stat. 809, 818, 819, suspended the allowance for reenlistment during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1939. Section 402 contains a proviso, appended to an appropriation for the Rural Electrification Administration, that 'no part of any appropriation contained in this or any other Act for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1939, shall be available for the payment' of any enlistment allowance for 'reenlistments made during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1939, notwithstanding the applicable portions of sections 9 and 10' of the Act of June 10, 1922\n\n\n The Court of Claims entered judgment for respondent on the ground that Section 402, while it restricted the funds available for payment of the allowance, did not suspend or repeal Section 9. Because of the importance of the issue in the administration of the revenues, we granted certiorari. March 25, 1940, \n309 \nU.S. 647\n, 60 S.Ct. 713, 84 L.Ed. --.\n There can be no doubt that Congress could suspend or repeal the authorization contained in Section 9; and it could accomplish its purpose by an amendment to an appropriation bill, or otherwise. United States v. Mitchell, \n109 \nU.S. 146, 150\n, 3 S.Ct. 151, 153; Mathews v. United States, \n123 \nU.S. 182\n, 8 S.Ct. 80; Dunwoody v. United States, \n143 \nU.S. 578\n, 12 S.Ct. 465; Belknap \n\n[310 \nU.S. 554, 556]\n\u00a0\n v. United States, \n150 \nU.S. 588, 593\n, 14 S.Ct. 183, 185; United States v. Vulte, \n233 \nU.S. 509, 513\n, 34 S.Ct. 664, 666. See United States v. Langston, \n118 \nU.S. 389\n, 6 S.Ct. 1185. The question remains whether it did so during the fiscal year ending on the 30th of June, 1939.\n Section 9 remained in full force and effect during the eleven fiscal years ending on the 30th of June, 1923 to 1933, after which date it was suspended during the ensuing four fiscal years by a provision inserted in various appropriation acts. Section 18 of the Economy Act of March 3, 1933, c. 212, 47 Stat. 1489, 1519, 37 U.S.C.A.  13 note, provided that: 'So much of sections 9 and 10 of the Act ... approved June 10, 1922 ... as provides for the payment of enlistment allowance to enlisted men for reenlistment within a period of three months from date of discharge is hereby suspended as to reenlistments made during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1934.' This provision, which concededly suspended the authorization for the enlistment allowance, was continued in full force and effect for the fiscal years ending on the 30th of June, 1935, 1936 and 1937, by its insertion in the Economy Provisions of the Independent Office Appropriation Act for the fiscal year 1935 and in the Treasury-Post Office Appropriation Acts for the fiscal years 1936 and 1937.1\n The Second Deficiency Appropriation Bill of May 28, 1937, c. 277, 50 Stat. 213, 232, also contained a provision affecting the enlistment allowance, but the form of words used was changed. That Act as passed by Congress provided that 'no part of any appropriation contained in this or any other Act for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1938, shall be available for the payment of enlistment allowance to enlisted men for reenlistment within a period of three months from date of discharge as to reenlistments \n\n[310 \nU.S. 554, 557]\n\u00a0\n made during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1938, notwithstanding the applicable provisions of sections 9 and 10 of the Act' approved June 10, 1922. The identical provision, with the exception of the dates, was appended as a proviso to Section 402 of Public Resolution 122, copied above, and was made applicable during the fiscal year ending on the 30th of June, 1939.\n The provision inserted in the Second Deficiency Appropriation Bill for 1937 was introduced on the floor of the Senate as an amendment by Senator Byrnes. In response to questions concerning the amendment, the Senator stated (81 Cong.Rec. 4426): '... the language of the amendment has been carried ordinarily in the Treasury and Post Office Appropriation Bill, but was not carried in that appropriation bill this year, and is therefore proposed to be included in the bill now before us. ... The effect of it is simply to carry the same limitation that has been carried for years in the appropriation bills. ... Its purpose is to continue the appropriation situation that has existed for years, so that no bounty shall be paid for reenlistment in the military and other uniformed services.' The amendment was thereupon adopted in the Senate without recorded opposition, and was sent to conference. The House managers, in reporting the amendment to the House, described it as 'Continuing during the fiscal year 1938 the suspension of the reenlistment gratuity for enlisted personnel of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard.' 81 Cong.Rec. 5084. The course of the debate amply discloses that the House regarded the amendment as continuing during the fiscal year 1938 the same restriction on the enlistment allowance as the pro- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 554, 558]\n\u00a0\n vision inserted in earlier appropriation bills. \n2\n It was then adopted by the House. 81 Cong.Rec. 5091.\n The identical provision (except as to the dates), eventually appended to Section 402 of Public Resolution 122, was \n\n[310 \nU.S. 554, 559]\n\u00a0\n introduced as an amendment to the Second Deficiency Appropriation Bill for the fiscal year 1938 (H.R. 10851, 75th Cong., 3d Sess.), then pending in the House. 83 Cong.Rec. 8522-8569. A point of order was made against the amendment on the ground that it was legislation in an appropriation bill; Representative Woodrum, who had charge of the amendment, admitted that the point of order was good, and the Chair sustained it. 83 Cong.Rec. 8567. The amendment was then offered in the Senate, where the Presiding Officer also sustained a point of order that it was legislation in an appropriation bill. \n3\n 83 Cong.Rec. 9189. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 554, 560]\n\u00a0\n The provision was thereafter included by the conference committee as a proviso to Section 402 of H.J.Res. 679 (which later became Pub.Res. No. 122). See 83 Cong.Rec. 9512, 9677. It was passed by the Senate without much debate. \n4\n In the House, the debate disclosed that the amendment had the same purpose and effect as the provision inserted in the various appropriation bills for the preceding years. Representative Woodrum, in presenting the amendment to the House, described it as follows (83 Cong. Rec. 9677):\n'... we are providing a further inhibition for 1 year against payment of the reenlistment allowances in the military and naval services. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 554, 561]\n\u00a0\n 'No reenlistment allowances have been paid for the past 5 fiscal years in any of the services, and in the absence of permanent law stopping it, the inhibition has been shuttled about in economy bills and appropriation bills at one time or another. We have not paid them for 5 years, and the latter part of this amendment now before the House is a Senate amendment which discontinues for another year the payment of the reenlistment allowances.' The opponents of the amendment, while questioning its wisdom, were in general agreement with its sponsors concerning its purpose and effect. 83 Cong.Rec. 9678-9679. The amendment was then adopted by the House. 83 Cong.Rec. 9679.\n\n We are of opinion that Congress intended in Section 402 to suspend the enlistment allowance authorized by Section 9 during the fiscal year ending on the 30th of June, 1939. The legislative history, summarized above, discloses that Congress intended the legislation concerning the allowance during the fiscal years 1938 and 1939 as a continuation of the suspension enacted in each of the four preceding years. The adoption in the act of May 28, 1937, of different terminology might in other circumstances indicate an intent to change the object of the legislation. Compare Brewster v. Gage, \n280 \nU.S. 327, 337\n, 50 S.Ct. 115, 117; Crawford v. Burke, \n195 \nU.S. 176, 190\n, 25 S.Ct. 9, 12; Pirie v. Chicago Title & Trust Co., \n182 \nU.S. 438, 448\n, 21 S.Ct. 906, 910. But the drawing of such an inference is a workable rule of construction, not an infallible guide to legislative intent, and cannot overcome more persuasive evidence where, as here, it exists. Compare Boston Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 41, 48\n, 49 S.Ct. 52, 53.\n The respondent contends that the words of Section 402 are plain and unambiguous and that other aids to construction may not be utilized. It is sufficient answer to deny that such words when used in an appropriation bill are \n\n[310 \nU.S. 554, 562]\n\u00a0\n words of art or have a settled meaning. See United States v. Perry, 8 Cir., 50 F. 743, 748.5 The very legislative materials which respondent would exclude refute his assumption. It would be anomalous to close our minds to persuasive evidence of intention on the ground that reasonable men could not differ as to the meaning of the words. Legislative materials may be without probative value, or contradictory, or ambiguous, it is true, and in such cases will not be permitted to control the customary meaning of words or overcome rules of syntax or construction found by experience to be workable; they can scarcely be deemed to be incompetent or irrelevant. See Boston Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, supra, 278 U.S. at page 48, 49 S.Ct. at page 53. The meaning to be ascribed to an Act of Congress can only be derived from a considered weighing of every relevant aid to construction. \n6\n These lead to the conclusion that the judgment of the court below must be reversed.\nREVERSED.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice STONE and Mr. Justice ROBERTS are of opinion that the judgment should be affirmed on the views expressed by the Court of Claims. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act March 28, 1934, c. 102, 48 Stat. 509, 523; Act May 14, 1935, c. 110, 49 Stat. 218, 226, 227; Act June 23, 1936, c. 725, 49 Stat. 1827, 1837. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Mr. Scott, one of the chief speakers against the amendment, stated ( 81 Cong.Rec. 5089):\n'In 1933 an amendment went into the Treasury-Post Office appropriation bill taking away or suspending this reenlistment bonus. ... The provision was continued by inserting it in the Treasury-Post Office appropriation bill each year from 1933 until this year. It was in the Treasury-Post Office appropriation bill that was brought into the House for consideration this year. I raised a point of order against the provision on the ground it was legislation on an appropriation bill, and that it did not come under the Holman rule. The Chairman of the Committee sustained the point of order.\n\n'The bill went to the Senate and the suspension was not placed in the bill. The second deficiency appropriation bill passed the House and went over to the Senate. This amendment was placed in there. It was clearly subject to a point of order in the Senate, but the point was not made against it.\n\n'It now comes back to the House for a separate vote as an amendment. If we vote for this amendment it means the further suspension of the reenlistment bonus to the enlisted personnel of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast and Geodetic Survey, and Coast Guard.'\n\n Mr. Woodrum, who took charge of explaining the Conference Report to the House, stated (81 Cong.Rec. 5090):\n'In the first place, I wish to emphasize the fact that the language in the amendment only asks to continue this legislation for the fiscal year 1938. ... We ask in this amendment that during the next fiscal year this reenlistment bonus be not allowed; and I may say, Mr. Speaker, this is not taking one solitary thing away from any enlisted man in the Army, Navy, or Marine Corps. He is getting exactly the pay that was promised him, and every member of the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps who enlisted during the last 3 years enlisted with the knowledge there was no reenlistment bonus going to be paid to him if he did reenlist.\n\n'... they know now what they knew when they reenlisted, that the time has not yet come when the Congress can offer a bonus to people working for the Government.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Senator Byrnes, who had offered the amendment on behalf of the Appropriations Committee, then engaged in the following colloquy with Senator Walsh (83 Cong.Rec. 9189, 9190):\n'Mr. Byrnes. ... I will say to the Senator from Massachusetts, in the light of the ruling of the Chair, that before the Congress adjourns I shall certainly make an effort to do something to bring about a change, so that there will not be dissatisfaction among the various services. If the bounties were all restored, millions of dollars would be involved.\n\n'Mr. Walsh. Is not the situation that under existing law there is now an authorization of funds to be paid to those who reenlist in the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Public Health Service? Is not that the situation?\n\n'Mr. Byrnes. There is authority to pay the bounty. It has not been paid for 6 years.\n\n'Mr. Walsh. No funds are available.\n\n'Mr. Byrnes. No funds are available.\n\n'Mr. Walsh. The House Bill did seek to provide funds for reenlistment bounties in the Army. Of course, it would be highly discriminatory to have reenlistment bounties paid to those who reenlist in the Army, and none paid to those who reenlist in the other branches of the military service.\n\n'Mr. Byrnes. It would certainly be discriminatory, and cause great dissatisfaction among the services.\n\n'Mr. Walsh. Is the bill now in such shape that no funds are provided for reenlistment bounties for any branch of the military service?\n\n'Mr. Byrnes. That is correct.\n\n'Mr. Walsh. What the Senator sought to do was to have Congress declare as its policy that it did not intend in the future to pay such reenlistment bounties, so as to prevent possible claims; is not that true?\n\n'Mr. Byrnes. Mr. President, the sole position of the Committee is that no funds being provided, we should not leave open the opportunity for numbers of persons to file claims in the Court of Claims in behalf of men who reenlist, with the result that a year from now, or 2 years from now, some men would receive the reenlistment bounty or some part of it, after the attorneys received their fees.\n\n'Mr. Walsh. I think I understand.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The debate in the Senate was as follows (83 Cong.Rec. 9512):\n'Mr. Walsh. Mr. President, I understand that the bill as it passed the House contained a provision for the use of funds from this appropriation for reenlistments in the Army, and no provisions were made for the use of any of the appropriation for the payment of reenlistments in the Navy, the Marine Corps, or the Coast Guard.\n\n'Mr. Adams. That is correct.\n\n'Mr. Walsh. The purpose of the amendment is to eliminate the provision for payment in case of reenlistments in the Army because it is discriminatory against the other services and civil forces, which formerly received reenlistment pay and allowances.\n\n'Mr. Adams. That is correct, and it is to open the way for statutory clearing of the whole situation. \n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Compare Luce, Legislative Problems (1935), pp. 421 et seq., 432. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] 'Where the mind labours to discover the design of the legislature, it seizes every thing from which aid can be derived ....'

FALCONE(1940)\nNo. 42\nArgued: November 18, 1940Decided: December 9, 1940\n\n\n\n Messrs. Robert H. Jackson, Atty. Gen., and O. John Rogge, Asst. Atty. Gen., for petitioner. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 205, 206]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Daniel H. Prior, of Albany, N.Y., for respondents Salvatore Falcone and Joseph Falcone.\n Mr. Roger O. Baldwin, of Syracuse, N.Y., for respondent Henry Alberico.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question presented by this record is whether one who sells materials with knowledge that they are intended for use or will be used in the production of illicit distilled spirits may be convicted as a co- conspirator with a distiller who conspired with others to distill the spirits in violation of the revenue laws.\n Respondents were indicted with sixty-three others in the Northern District of New York for conspiring to violate the revenue laws by the operation of twenty-two illicit stills in the vicinity of Utica, New York. The case was submitted to the jury as to twenty-four defendants, of whom the five respondents and sixteen operators of stills were convicted. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the conviction of the five respondents on the ground that as there was no evidence that respondents were themselves conspirators, the sale by them of materials, knowing that they would be used by others in illicit distilling, was not sufficient to establish that respondents were guilty of the conspiracy charged. 109 F.2d 579. We granted certiorari, \n310 \nU.S. 620\n, 60 S.Ct. 1075, to resolve an asserted conflict of the decision below with those of Courts of Appeals in other circuits. Simpson v. United States, 4 Cir., 11 F.2d 591; Pattis v. United States, 9 Cir., 17 F.2d 562; Borgia v. United States, 9 Cir., 78 F.2d 550; Marino v. United States, 9 Cir., 91 F. 2d 691, 113 A.L.R. 975; see Backun v. United States, 4 Cir., 112 F.2d 635. Compare Young v. United States, 5 Cir., 48 F.2d 26.\n All of respondents were jobbers or distributors who, during the period in question, sold sugar, yeast or cans, \n\n[311 \nU.S. 205, 207]\n\u00a0\n some of which found their way into the possession and use of some of the distiller defendants. The indictment while charging generally that all the defendants were parties to the conspiracy did not allege specifically that any of respondents had knowledge of the conspiracy, but it did allege that respondents Alberico and Nole brothers sold the materials mentioned knowing that they were to be used in illicit distilling. The Court of Appeals reviewing the evidence thought, in the case of some of the respondents, that the jury might take it that they were knowingly supplying the distillers. As to Nicholas Nole, whose case it considered most doubtful, it thought that his equivocal conduct 'was as likely to have come from a belief that it was a crime to sell the yeast and the cans to distillers as from being in fact any further involved in their business'. (109 F.2d 582.) But it assumed for purposes of decision that all furnished supplies which they knew ultimately reached and were used by some of the distillers. Upon this assumption it said, 'In the light of all this, it is apparent that the first question is whether the seller of goods, in themselves innocent, becomes a conspirator with-or, what is in substance the same thing, an abettor of-the buyer because he knows that the buyer means to use the goods to commit a crime.' And it concluded that merely because respondent did not forego a 'normally lawful activity, of the fruits of which he (knew) that others (were making) an unlawful use' he is not guilty of a conspiracy.\n The Government does not argue here the point which seems to be implicit in the question raised by its petition for certiorari, that conviction of conspiracy can rest on proof alone of knowingly supplying an illicit distiller, who is not conspiring with others. In such a case, as the Government concedes, the act of supplying or some other proof must import an agreement or concert of action between buyer and seller, which admittedly is not present \n\n[311 \nU.S. 205, 208]\n\u00a0\n here. Cf. Gebardi v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 112, 121\n, 53 S.Ct. 35, 37, 84 A.L.R. 370; Di Bonaventura v. United States, 4 Cir., 15 F.2d 494. But the Government does contend that one who with knowledge of a conspiracy to distill illicit spirits sells materials to a conspirator knowing that they will be used in the distilling, is himself guilty of the conspiracy. It is said that he is, either because his knowledge combined with his action makes him a participant in the agreement which is the conspiracy, or what is the same thing he is a principal in the conspiracy as an aider or abettor by virtue of  332 of the Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C.  550, 18 U.S.C.A.  550, which provides: 'Whoever directly commits any act constituting an offense defined in any law of the United States, or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, or procures its commission, is a principal.'\n The argument, the merits of which we do not consider, overlooks the fact that the opinion below proceeded on the assumption that the evidence showed only that respondents or some of them knew that the materials sold would be used in the distillation of illicit spirits, and fell short of showing respondents' participation in the conspiracy or that they knew of it. We did not bring the case here to review the evidence, but we are satisfied that the evidence on which the Government relies does not do more than show knowledge by respondents that the materials would be used for illicit distilling if it does as much in the case of some. \n1\n In the case of Alberico, \n\n[311 \nU.S. 205, 209]\n\u00a0\n as in the case of Nicholas Nole, the jury could have found that he knew that one of their customers who is an unconvicted defendant was using the purchased mate- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 205, 210]\n\u00a0\n rial in illicit distilling. But it could not be inferred from that or from the casual and unexplained meetings of some of respondents with others who were convicted as conspirators that respondents knew of the conspiracy. The evidence respecting the volume of sales to any known to be distillers is too vague and inconclusive to support a jury finding that respondents knew of a conspiracy from the size of the purchases even though we were to assume what we do not decide that the knowledge would make them conspirators or aiders or abettors of the conspiracy. Respondents are not charged with aiding and abetting illicit distilling, and they cannot be brought within the sweep of the Government's conspiracy dragnet if they had no knowledge that there was a conspiracy.\n The gist of the offense of conspiracy as defined by  37 of the Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C.  88, 18 U.S.C.A.  88, is agreement among the conspirators to commit an offense attended by an act of one or more of the conspirators to effect the object of the conspiracy. Pettibone v. United States, \n148 \nU.S. 197\n, 13 S.Ct. 542; Marino v. United States, supra; Troutman v. United States, 10 Cir., 100 F.2d 628; Beland v. United States, 5 Cir., 100 F.2d 289; cf. Gebardi v. United States, supra. Those having no knowledge of the conspiracy are not conspirators, United States v. Hirsch, \n100 \nU.S. 33\n, 34; Weniger v. United States, 9 Cir., 47 F.2d 692, 693; and one who \n\n[311 \nU.S. 205, 211]\n\u00a0\n without more furnishes supplies to an illicit distiller is not guilty of conspiracy even though his sale may have furthered the object of a conspiracy to which the distiller was a party but of which the supplier had no knowledge. On this record we have no occasion to decide any other question.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The two Falcones who were in business as sugar jobbers were shown to have sold sugar to three wholesale grocers who in turn were shown to have sold some of the sugar to distillers. To establish guilty knowledge the Government relies upon evidence showing that the volume of their sales was materially larger during the periods of activity of the illicit stills; that Joseph Falcone was shown on two occasions, at one of which Salvatore Falcone was present, to have been in conversation with one of the conspirators who was a distiller, and on one occasion with another distiller conspirator who was his brother-in-law; that Joseph Falcone had been seen at the Venezia Restaurant which was patronized by some of the conspirators and knew its proprietor; and on two occasions Salvatore Falcone had visited the restaurant, on one to collect funds for the Red Cross and on another for a monument to Marconi.\n Respondent Alberico was a member of a firm of wholesale grocers who dealt in sugar and five-gallon tin cans among other things. They sold sugar to wholesale grocers and jobbers. To establish Alberico's guilty knowledge the Government relies on evidence that his total purchases of sugar materially increased during the period when the illicit stills were shown to be in operation; that some of his sugar purchases from a local wholesaler were at higher prices than he was then paying others; that on the premises of one of the distillers there were found fifty-five cardboard cartons, each suitable for containing one dozen five-gallon cans, on one of which was stencilled the name of Alberico's firm; that on eight to ten occasions Alberico sold sugar and cans in unnamed amounts to Morreale, one of the defendant distillers who was not convicted, and on one occasion was overheard to say, in refusing credit to Morreale, 'I could not trust you because your business is too risky.'\n\n Respondent Nicholas Nole was shown to be proprietor of Acme Yeast Company and also the Utica Freight Forwarding Company, to which one and one-half tons of K & M yeast was consigned by the seller. Wrappers bearing the distinctive marks of the Acme Yeast Company and K & M yeast, quantity not stated, were found at one of the stills; and a K & M yeast container was found at another. To show guilty knowledge of Nicholas Nole the Government relies on the circumstance that he registered the Acme Yeast Company in the county clerk's office in the name of a cousin; that the order for the consignment of K & M yeast was placed in the name of an unidentified person; that Nole had been seen in conversation with some of the convicted distillers at a time when some of the illicit stills were in operation, and that on one occasion during that period he sold and delivered fifteen five-gallon cans of illicit alcohol from a source not stated.\n Respondent John Nole was shown to be a distributor for the National Grain Yeast Company in Utica during the period in question. Yeast wrappers bearing the National labels were found at three of the stills. To show guilty knowledge of John Nole the Government relies on evidence that he had assisted his brother Nicholas in unloading yeast at the Utica Freight Forwarding Co.; that he was a patron of the Venezia Restaurant; that on one occasion he was seen talking with Morreale, the unconvicted distiller, in the vicinity of a store in Utica, whose store it does not appear. On three occasions Morreale and another convicted defendant procured yeast in cartons and some in kegs at the store and on one occasion John Nole told the person in charge of the store to let them have the yeast; that John Noles' information return required by the Government of all sales of yeast in excess of five pounds to one person did not show in February or March, 1938, any sale of yeast to Morreale or any sale of keg yeast. \n\n\n\n\n","139":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v.

Tweedy, of Washington, D.C., for appellant.\n No appearance for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In a proceeding before a grand jury, appellees were asked whether, in 1937, they had made certain statements to government agents concerning earlier conver- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 292, 293]\n\u00a0\n sations with one Ray Born and others regarding the operation of places of ill repute. They denied having made the statements. The grand jury thereupon found the indictments1 now before us which charge, in effect, that appellees' testimony was false, that it was material to the investigation of the grand jury, and that appellees therefore committed perjury in violation of Section 125 of the Criminal Code (35 Stat. 1111, 18 U.S.C.  231, 18 U.S.C.A.  231).2\n Appellees promptly moved to quash the indictments on the ground that they failed 'to charge an offense against the United States'. After hearing on the motions, the trial judge entered orders in both cases quashing the indictments because they did not charge an offense under the statute. The cases are here on appeals from these rulings. 18 U.S.C.  682, 18 U.S.C.A.  682, 28 U.S.C.  345, 28 U.S.C.A.  345; see United States v.

The indictment against May Harris alleged that '... the said May Harris ... at the times she made the statements aforesaid (before the grand jury), then and there well and fully knew that they were, as a matter of fact, false and untrue in that, and for the reason that, May Harris aforesaid then and there well and fully knew that she did in fact tell and inform the \n\n[311 \nU.S. 292, 294]\n\u00a0\n said Special Agents ... that she had gone to Ray Born in 1932 and talked to him ...; that she had spoken to Lou Kissel ...; that she had paid money to said James McCullough. ...'3\n The trial judge apparently thought that the alleged perjury consisted of contradicting, before the grand jury, the earlier statements made by appellees in conversations with Born and others, for in the opinion accompanying the orders quashing the indictments he stated: '... I am satisfied ... that perjury cannot be predicated upon a contrary statement made by the witness at a time prior to or after the making of the sworn statement, notwithstanding the claim that the witness on her oath denied that she made such statements, which, it is averred, can be proven by two or more credible witnesses.' He cited several cases to show that mere proof of prior inconsistent or contradictory statements would not support a charge of perjury. See Phair v. United States, 3 Cir., 60 F. 2d 953, 954; Clayton v. United States, 4 Cir., 284 F. 537, 540.\n It is evident, however, that the indictment charged perjury not in the mere making of contradictory and inconsistent statements concerning these conversations, but in swearing falsely before the grand jury that appellees had never told the government agents they had had such conversations. Moreover, proof that appellees had told government agents that they had conversed with Born and others would not be evidence of mere previous inconsistent or contradictory statements by appellees affecting only their credibility as witnesses, but would be direct evidence of the offense itself and hence would support the charge made in the indictment. The difference between the instant cases and such cases as Phair \n\n[311 \nU.S. 292, 295]\n\u00a0\n v. United States, 3 Cir., 60 F.2d 953, therefore, is obvious and substantial. See O'Brien v. United States, 69 App.D.C. 135, 99 F.2d 368.\n Section 125 of the Criminal Code makes no distinction between the false assertions of the fact of prior statements and the false assertions of any other fact. Nor can we see any reason to make one. As the government points out, the denial of the fact that certain statements have been made may be equally as clear, deliberate, and material a falsehood as the denial of any other fact. And since statements made to government agents are generally one of the bases upon which criminal proceedings are instituted and indictments returned, such a distinction might substantially impede effective administration of criminal law.\n The facts stated in the indictment are clearly sufficient to charge a violation of the perjury statute. Accordingly, the orders quashing the indictments are reversed and the cause is remanded.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Although appellees were indicted separately, the indictments in all material respects are identical, and the appeals present the same question. They are therefore treated in one opinion. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 'Section 125 (231).

SHAW(1940)\nNo. 570\nArgued: February 27, 1940Decided: March 25, 1940\n\n\n\n\n[309 \nU.S. 495, 496]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert H. Jackson, Atty. Gen., and Francis B. Biddle, Sol. Gen., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Eugene F. Black and Shirley Stewart, both of Port Huron, Mich ., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[309 \nU.S. 495, 497]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1918 Sydney C. McLouth contracted to construct nine tugs for the United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation. On May 24, 1920, the contract was cancelled and the parties entered into a settlement agreement providing that McLouth was to keep as bailee certain materials furnished him for use in building the tugs and that the Fleet Corporation was to assume certain of McLouth's subcontracts and commitments. Among the commitments assumed was a contract of Mc- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 495, 498]\n\u00a0\n Louth's to purchase lumber from the Ingram-Day Lumber Company. The Lumber Company obtained a judgment against McLouth for $42,789.96 for breach of this contract,1 and, McLouth having died in 1923, filed its claim on the judgment in the probate court of St. Clair County, Michigan. Subsequently the Unites States obtained a judgment of $40,165.48 against McLouth's administrator,2 representing damages for the conversion of the materials left with McLouth as bailee, and claim on this judgment was filed in the probate court. The administrator, respondent here, having presented without success the Lumber Company's judgment to the General Accounting Office,3 sought to set off that judgment against the judgment of the United States. The probate court allowed the claim of the United States and denied the set-off, but its ruling as to the set-off was reversed on appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court. \n4\n The administrator then petitioned the probate court to grant statutory judgment of the balance due the estate. The court found that the claim of the United States, with interest, amounted to $49,442.41 and the Lumber Company's claim to $73,071.38 and 'ordered, adjudged and ascertained' that the United States was indebted to the estate for the difference, $23,628.97, 'and that such indebtedness be and the same is hereby allowed as and determined to be a proper claim which is owing to said estate by the United States of America.' The probate court's judgment was affirmed on appeal. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n[309 \nU.S. 495, 499]\n\u00a0\n On this certiorari we are concerned with the question whether the United States by filing a claim against an estate in a state court subjects itself, in accordance with local statutory practice, to a binding, though not immediately enforceable, ascertainment and allowance by the state court of a cross-claim against itself.\n Because of different views of other federal courts as to the decisions of this Court in the important federal field of cross-claims against the United States, 6 we granted certiorari. \n7\n United States v. United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company8 involves this question.\n The statute of Michigan under which this ascertainment of indebtedness was made, so far as pertinent, is set out in the footnote. \n9\n There is no contention on the part of respondent that the judgment is enforceable against the United States even in the limited sense of statutory direction to report the judgment to Congress as in the Court \n\n[309 \nU.S. 495, 500]\n\u00a0\n of Claims Act10 or the Merchant Marine Act. \n11\n Execution against property of governmental agencies subjected to such procedure by statute is sometimes allowed. \n12\n The position taken is that the probate court judgment is a 'final determination' of the rights of the litigants, howsoever such rights may later become important. We are not here concerned with the manner of collection. Such was the holding of the Supreme Court of Michigan. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n The state procedure for the determination of the balance against or in favor of an estate, which was employed here, was the recognized method of closing an estate at the time of the probate judgment. The probate judge was empowered to act as commissioner under the statute quoted above. 14 His decision unreviewed was considered final. \n15\n The determination of the probate court between private parties was enforceable without reexamination in the circuit court. \n16\n Even the right to execution is not essential to a complete judicial process. \n17\n The order entered was a final determination of the amounts due the estate by the United States on this claim and cross-claim if the probate court had jurisdiction to render the order against the petitioner.\n Whether that jurisdiction exists depends upon the effect of the voluntary submission to the Michigan court by the United States of its claim against the estate. As a foundation for the examination of that question we may lay the postulate that without specific statutory consent, no suit may be brought against the United \n\n[309 \nU.S. 495, 501]\n\u00a0\n States. \n18\n No officer by his action can confer jurisdiction. \n19\n Even when suits are authorized they must be brought only in designated courts. \n20\n The reasons for this immunity are imbedded in our legal philosophy. They partake somewhat of dignity and decorum, somewhat of practical administration, somewhat of the political desirability of an impregnable legal citadel where government as distinct from its functionaries may operate undisturbed by the demands of litigants. A sense of justice has brought a progressive relaxation by legislative enactments of the rigor of the immunity rule. As representative governments attempt to ameliorate inequalities as necessities will permit, prerogatives of the government yield to the needs of the citizen. By the act of March 3, 1797, and its successor legislation, as interpreted by this Court, cross-claims are allowed to the amount of the government's claim, where the government voluntarily sues. \n21\n Specially designated claims against the United States may be sued upon in the Court of Claims or the district courts under the Tucker Act. \n22\n Special government activities, set apart as corporations or individual agencies, have been made suable freely. When authority is given, it is liberally construed. 23 As to these matters no controversy exists.\n Respondent contends this immunity extends, however, only to original suits; that when a sovereign voluntarily seeks the aid of the courts for collection of its indebted- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 495, 502]\n\u00a0\n ness it takes the form of a private suitor and thereby subjects itself to the full jurisdiction of the court. The principle of a single adjudication is stressed, as is the necessity for a complete examination into the cross- claim, despite attendant dislocation of government business by the appearance of important officers at distant points and the production of documents as evidence, to justify the allowance of an offset to the government's claim. \n24\n It is pointed out that surprise is not involved as no cross-claim may be proven until after submission to and refusal by the government accounting officers. \n25\n Respondent further insists that his position is supported by The Thekla26 and subsequent decisions quoting its language. \n27\n Emphasis is placed upon the fact that these probate proceedings are in rem or quasi in rem28 as were the libels in admiralty in The Thekla.\n It is not our right to extend the waiver of sovereign immunity more broadly that has been directed by the Congress. We, of course, intimate no opinion as to the desirability of further changes. That is immaterial. Against the background of complete immunity we find no Congressional action modifying the immunity rule in favor of cross-actions beyond the amount necessary as a set-off.\n The Thekla turns upon a relationship characteristic of claims of collision in admiralty but entirely absent in claims and cross-claims in settlement of estates. The subject matter of a suit for damages in collision is not the vessel libelled but the collision. Libels and cross- libels for collision are one litigation and give rise to one \n\n[309 \nU.S. 495, 503]\n\u00a0\n liability. \n29\n In equal fault, the entire damage is divided. As a consequence when the United States libels the vessel of another for collision damages and a cross-libel is filed, it is necessary to determine the cross-libel as well as the original libel to reach a conclusion as to liability for the collision. That conclusion must be stated in terms of responsibility for damages. In The Thekla opinion the cases of Illinois Central Railroad Company v. Public Utilities Commission30 and Nassau Smelting Works v. United States31 were cited in support of the statement that '... generally speaking a claim that would not constitute a cause of action against the sovereign cannot be asserted as a counterclaim.' This Court then said: 'We do not qualify the foregoing decisions in any way.' In the Smelting case this Court had said, two weeks before, on a certificate as to the jurisdiction of the district court to consider a counterclaim:\n'The objection to a suit against the United States is fundamental, whether it be in the form of an original action, or a set-off, or a counterclaim. Jurisdiction in either case does not exist, unless there is specific congressional authority for it. Nor is there doubt that the question is one which involves the jurisdiction of the District Court as a federal court under the statutes of the United States, for the jurisdiction of the District Court in this regard is wholly dependent on such statutes.'32\n\n There is little indication in the facts or language of The Thekla to indicate an intention to permit generally unlimited cross-claims. Quotations from The Thekla in later opinions of this Court are used to illustrate prob- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 495, 504]\n\u00a0\n lems entirely apart from the one under consideration here. \n33\n\u00a0\n\n The suggestion that the order of the probate court is in reality not a judgment but only a 'judicial ascertainment' of credits does not affect our conclusion. No judgment against the United States is more than that. But such an entry, if within the competence of the court passing the order would be res judicata of the issue of indebtedness. \n34\n The suggestion springs from the opinion in United States v. Eckford. \n35\n These words there appear:\n'Without extending the argument, we adopt the views expressed by this court in the case of De Groot v. United States (5 Wall. 419, 432), decided at the last term, that when the United States is plaintiff and the defendant has pleaded a set-off, which the acts of Congress have authorized him to do, no judgment can be rendered against the government, although it may be judicially ascertained that, on striking a balance of just demands, the government is indebted to the defendant in an ascertained amount.'\n\n The Court had just written that no action could be sustained against the government without consent and that to permit a demand in set-off to become the foundation of a judgment would be the same thing as sustaining the prosecution of a suit. \n36\n The language quoted above means no more than that no judgment may be entered against the government even though the court has ascertained, through its processes that the government is actually indebted to the defendants. The judgment should be limited to a dismissal of the government's claim.\n In the Eckford case this Court was dealing with the litigation at a more advanced stage than the present liti- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 495, 505]\n\u00a0\n gation has reached. The United States had sued Eckford's executors on his bond in the District Court for the Sourthern District of New York. They pleaded a set-off, a balance was found in their favor and a judgment entered that the executors were entitled to be paid the amount found. Suit in the Court of Claims was instituted by the executors, the record was proven, over objection, and judgment entered accordingly. Consequently a reversal of the Court of Claims was the only step necessary. This Court did not deal with the New York judgment. \n37\n\u00a0\n\n We have considered respondent's further argument that sovereign immunity was waived when the United States took possession of the assets of its agent the Fleet Corporation prior to the institution of this action and later, but prior to the entry of the probate judgment appealed from, assumed the Corporation's obligations by the act of June 29, 1936.38 We see nothing in these transactions which indicates an intention to waive the immunity of the United States in the state courts.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS took no part in the decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Ingram-Day Lumber Co. v.

Wilkinson, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here on certiorari to resolve a conflict of the decision below (9 Cir., 106 F.2d 405) with Stern Brothers & Co. v. Commissioner, 8 Cir., 108 F.2d 309.\n During the year 1930 respondent purchased farm loan bonds issued by joint-stock land banks under the Federal Farm Loan Act of 1916, 39 Stat. 360, 12 U.S.C.A.  641 et seq. The purchases were made for the prospective increment to the bonds and not for their interest. At the time the purchases were made the banks were in receivership. The bonds were acquired at prices substantially below par. In making these purchases respondent relied upon statements contained in circulars and bulletins issued by the Farm Loan Board, reasonably believing that he was purchasing securities the profit upon which in case of sale would be exempt income. A part of the bonds so purchased, with their appurtenant coupons, was sold in 1931; and a part was surrendered in that year to the receiver of the issuing \n\n[311 \nU.S. 60, 62]\n\u00a0\n bank in exchange for cash paid to respondent 'under and pursuant to the covenants contained' in the bonds. Each of these transactions resulted in a profit to respondent. \n1\n The Commissioner held that those gains were taxable income. Consequently respondent included them in his income tax return for the year 1931 and claimed a refund. On disallowance of that claim, this suit for refund was instituted. The District Court determined that the gains so realized were income and taxable. 24 F.Supp. 145. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed.\n Sec. 22(a) of the Revenue Act of 1928, 45 Stat. 791, 26 U.S.C.A. Int. Rev.Acts page 354, includes in gross income 'gains, profits, and income derived from ... sales, or dealings in property, whether real or personal.' Sec. 22(b)(4) exempts from taxation 'Interest upon ... securities issued under the provisions of the Federal Farm Loan Act, or under the provisions of such Act as amended.'\n If those two sections are controlling, it is clear that respondent is taxable on these gains, for they fall squarely within the definition of gross income contained in  22(a) and they are not 'interest'2 within the meaning of  22(b)(4). But respondent places his main reliance on  26 of the Federal Farm Loan Act, 12 U.S.C.A.  931, which provides that 'farm loan bonds issued under the provisions of this Act (chapter), shall be deemed and held to be instrumentalities of the Government of the United States, and as such they and the income derived therefrom shall be exempt from \n\n[311 \nU.S. 60, 63]\n\u00a0\n Federal, State, municipal, and local taxation.' It is urged that the gains here involved were 'income derived' from the bonds within the meaning of that section.\n We disagree with that conclusion. It is our view that under  26 respondent is entitled to an exemption only for interest on the bonds.\n To be sure, 'income' is a generic term amply broad to include capital gains for purposes of the income tax.

But  26 does not exempt simply 'income'; it exempts the bonds and the 'income derived therefrom.' Analytically, income derived from mere ownership of the bonds is clearly different from income derived from dealings or transactions in the bonds. As stated in Willcuts v. Bunn, \n282 \nU.S. 216, 227\n, 228 S., 51 S.Ct. 125, 127, 71 A.L.R. 1260:\n'The tax upon interest is levied upon the return which comes to the owner of the security according to the provisions of the obligation and without any further transaction on his part. The tax falls upon the owner by virtue of the mere fact of ownership, regardless of use or disposition of the security. The tax upon profits made upon purchases and sales is an excise upon the result of the combination of several factors, including capital investment and, quite generally, some measure of sagacity; the gain may be regarded as 'the creation of capital, industry and skill.' Tax Commissioner v. Putnam, 227 Mass. 522, 531, 116 N.E. 904, 910, L.R.A.1917F, 806.'\n\n True, the Bunn cases dealt only with the alleged constitutional inhibition against taxation of capital gains on municipal bonds and not with a specific statutory exemption. But its analysis is cognate here as indicating that, in absence of clear countervailing evidence, an exemption of 'income derived' from a security does not embrace 'income derived' from transactions in that security. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 60, 64]\n\u00a0\n There are no circumstances here which should make the reasoning of the Bunn case inapplicable.\n The Revenue Act of 1916, 39 Stat. 756, was enacted shortly after the Farm Loan Act by the same Congress and at the same session. \n3\n Sec. 2 of that Act, like  22(a) of the 1928 Act, included in taxable income 'gains, profits, and income derived from ... sales, or dealings in property.' And  4 of that Act, like  22(b)(4) of the 1928 Act, exempted from taxation 'interest upon ... securities issued under the provisions of the Federal Farm Loan Act.' It is clear that 'all acts in pari materia are to be taken together, as if they were one law.' United States v. Freeman, 3 How, 556, 564. That these two acts are in pari materia is plain. Both deal with precisely the same subject matter, viz., the scope of the tax exemption afforded farm loan bonds. The later act can therefore be regarded as a legislative interpretation of the earlier act (Cope v. Cope, \n137 \nU.S. 682, 688\n, 11 S.Ct. 222, 224; Cf. Stockdale v. Atlantic Insurance Company, 20 Wall. 323, 331, 332) in the sense that it aids in ascertaining the meaning of the words as used in their contemporary setting. \n4\n It is therefore en- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 60, 65]\n\u00a0\n titled to great weight in resolving any ambiguities and doubts. Cf. United States v. Stafoff, \n260 \nU.S. 477, 480\n, 43 S.Ct. 197, 199. In that view the express exemption of interest alone makes tolerably clear that capital gains are not exempt.\n In support of the contrary view great stress is placed on the legislative history of  26. Extensive references are made to the hearings on this bill and to the debates in Congress. Typical are the statements or criticisms that the bill gave 'these investments a distinct advantage over other investments',5 that the exemption provision was important,6 that maintenance of a market for the bonds was desirable,7 that the exemption was too broad. \n8\n These comments, however, are inconclusive. They are not suf- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 60, 66]\n\u00a0\n ficiently discriminating in their analysis or criticism to throw light on the narrow issue involved here.\n Respondent's resort to administrative interpretation of  26 is equally unproductive. No established administrative practice is shown. The holding of the unpublished published memorandum9 of the General Counsel of the Bureau of Internal Revenue relied upon is not precisely in point, even were we to assume that it is entitled to authoritative weight. \n10\n It merely ruled that a joint-stock land bank was not taxable on gains from purchases of its own bonds. And when the question of the taxability of an individual on his capital gains from sales of these bonds was raised less than two years later, another such ruling was issued to the effect that he did not have the benefit of any exemption. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n Nor is respondent materially aided by the change in  26 made by  817 of the Revenue Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 447, 578, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev. Code,  3799. That amendment provides that 'all income, except interest, derived' from such bonds shall be included in gross income. \n12\n It is urged that this amendment is affirmative recognition by the Congress that  26 exempts these capital gains. But here again the legislative record is ambiguous and hence inconclusive. The purpose of  817, as originally introduced, clearly was to \n\n[311 \nU.S. 60, 67]\n\u00a0\n make certain that capital gains realized by joint-stock land banks on transactions in their own obligations would not be exempt. \n13\n The section was amended on the floor of the Senate to its present form on the suggestion that 'perhaps the language is not as broad as it should be.' \n14\n\u00a0\n\n[311 \nU.S. 60, 68]\n\u00a0\n The purpose of the amendment may well have been to clarity the doubtful and uncertain status of capital gains which were not covered by the Committee's recommendation. There is no clear and convincing evidence that it was designed to change existing law, so far as these other categories of capital gains were concerned. But even if a contrary implication were to be assumed, it would not override so belatedly the clear inference, based on a long series of revenue acts exempting only interest, that capital gains were taxable.\n Respondent further argues that comparison of other exemption statutes with the language of  26 reinforces the view that these capital gains are exempt. In that connection our attention is called to numerous statutes- some exempting only bonds15 and others exempting principal and interest;16 some exempting a corporation, 'including the capital stock and surplus therein, and the income derived therefrom,'17 and others18 containing \n\n[311 \nU.S. 60, 69]\n\u00a0\n somewhat similar exemptions for the corporation but only an exemption as to principal and interest for its bonds; and still others19 containing the same kind of exemption as  26 of the Farm Loan Act. From this painstaking review respondent argues that where Congress has desired to exempt only 'interest' it has said so and where it has intended to grant a broader exemption it has used the word 'income'; that statutes exempting only 'interest' have a narrower meaning than those exempting 'income'; and that this long and recurrent legislative practice discloses a clear design of the part of Congress to draw distinctions and to shape the various exemptions to suit its differing policy in divers situations.\n Suggestive as this analysis is, it is entitled to little weight. No mere collation of other statutes can be decisive in determining what the instant statute means. The meaning of each phrase must be closely related to the time and circumstance of its use. The phrase 'income derived therefrom' as used in  26 clearly has taken on coloration from the express exemption for nearly a quarter century of only interest on these bonds. We have no occasion to intimate an opinion as to the meaning of other similar statutes. It is sufficient here to note that in another legislative setting 'income derived' from bonds may or may not be synonymous with 'interest' on bonds. That must necessarily be dependent on a host of factors which only a minute scrutiny of the particular legislative scheme would reveal. For this reason the fact that the same Congress which in 1938 amended  26 granted an exemption to another federal instrumentality20 couched in the identical language of the original  26 is merely a straw in the wind. So far as the instant \n\n[311 \nU.S. 60, 70]\n\u00a0\n bonds are concerned, that in itself is entitled to little weight as against the long standing express exemption in successive revenue acts of interest alone.\n Respondent also stresses the fact that circulars, prepared and distributed by the Farm Loan Board 'advising investors of the merits and advantages of farm loan bonds',21 stated that these bonds and their income were 'free from all forms of taxation' including the income tax, that 'this exemption is complete', etc. As we have said, it was found that respondent relied upon such statements reasonably believing that capital gains would not be taxable. But aside from the fact that those statements are hardly more specific than the statute itself, they cannot be accorded the weight of uniform and long standing administrative treatment. \n22\n There was no authority for the Board to make representations that capital gains were or were not tax exempt. That administrative function resided only in the Treasury. An officer or agency of the United States to whom no administrative authority has been delegated cannot estop the United States even by an affirmative undertaking to waive or surrender a public right. Utah v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 534, 545\n, 546 S., 52 S.Ct. 232, 235; Wilber National Bank v. United States, \n294 \nU.S. 120, 123\n, 124 S., 55 S. Ct. 362, 363, 364.\n We return to our conclusion that the weight of these various considerations leans to the view that only interest is exempt. The cumulative strength of the several factors urged by respondent is not such clear evidence \n\n[311 \nU.S. 60, 71]\n\u00a0\n of Congressional purpose as to make inapposite the application of the reasoning of Willcuts v. Bunn, supra, to this situation. In that posture of the case, respondent has succeeded only in casting some doubt on the proper construction of the statute. Yet those who seek an exemption from a tax must rest it on more than a doubt or ambiguity. Bank of Commerce v. Tennessee, \n161 \nU.S. 134, 146\n, 16 S.Ct. 456, 460; Id., \n163 \nU.S. 416, 423\n, 16 S.Ct. 1113, 1116. Exemptions from taxation cannot rest upon mere implications. United States Trust Co. v. Helvering, \n307 \nU.S. 57, 60\n, 59 S.Ct. 692, 693. As stated by Mr. Justice Cardozo in Trotter v. Tennessee, \n290 \nU.S. 354, 356\n, 54 S.Ct. 138, 139, 'Exemptions from taxation are not to be enlarged by implication if doubts are nicely balanced.' And see Pacific Co., Ltd., v. Johnson, \n285 \nU.S. 480, 491\n, 52 S.Ct. 424, 426. Hence broad, generalized statutory exemptions have frequently been construed narrowly and confined to those situations where the subject matter of the exemption was directly, not indirectly or remotely, involved. Murdock v. Ward, \n178 \nU.S. 139\n, 20 S.Ct. 775; Hale v. State Board of Assessment and Review, \n302 \nU.S. 95\n, 58 S.Ct. 102; United States Trust Co. v. Helvering, supra. The exemption contained in  26 of the Farm Loan Act must be so construed.\n For these reasons the challenged judgment must be reversed.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS is of opinion that the judgment should be affirmed on the grounds stated by the Circuit Court of Appeals in its opinion below, 9 Cir., 106 F.2d 405. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] These purchases were for respondent and his wife who filed separate returns for the year in question. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The record does not show what portion, if any, of the sums received on the sale or on the exchange of the bonds and appurtenant coupons was received as payment on accrued interest. Nor did the complaint allege that any portion of the sums received was exempt because it was 'interest' on the bonds. Hence that point was not raised below or here. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The Farm Loan Act became law on July 17, 1916, the Revenue Act of 1916 on September 8, 1916. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] It should be noted in this connection that the exemption of 'interest' contained in  4 of the 1916 Act was continued in each subsequent Revenue Act until 1934. Sec. 213(b)(4), Revenue Act of 1918, 40 Stat. 1057, 1065;  213(b) (4), Revenue Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 227, 238, and  213(b)(4), Revenue Act of 1924, 43 Stat. 253, 268;  213(b)(4), Revenue Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 9, 24;  22(b)(4), Revenue Act of 1928, 45 Stat. 791, 798;  22(b)(4), Revenue Act of 1932, 47 Stat. 169, 178, 26 U.S. C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, pages 20, 164, 355, 488. By  22(b)(4) of the Revenue Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 680, 687, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code  22(b)(4), the exemption was generalized so as to include interest on obligations of any federal corporation which is an instrumentality of the United States, subject to the limitation that interest is exempt only if and to the extent provided for in the acts of Congress authorizing the issuance of such obligations. The Senate Committee (S.Rep. No. 558, 73d Cong., 2d Sess ., pp. 23, 24; Internal Rev. Bull., Cum. Bull. 1939-1, Part 2, p. 604) made the following comment on that change:\n'This is merely a clarifying change made by the House. Under the language of this section, as contained in existing law, interest on securities issued under the Federal Farm Loan Act, or such Act as amended, is expressly excluded from gross income and thereby made exempt from the income tax. Other Acts have been enacted which also exempt the interest on obligations issued thereunder from tax. In order to bring the section into accord with the Acts authorizing such exemptions and to avoid the necessity of referring to all such Acts, a general provision has been inserted by the House excluding from gross income the interest upon the obligations of a corporation organized under Act of Congress if such corporation is an instrumentality of the United States; subject to the limitation, however, that the interest is exempt only to the extent provided for in the Acts of Congress authorizing the issuance of such obligations.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Cong.

Therefore the implication is not warranted that the failure of their adoption was due to the desire of Congress to grant a broader exemption than 'interest'. \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] This is reproduced, so far as material here, in S.

Commissioner, 39 B.T.A. 1103, 1111. \n[\nFootnote 12\n] This amendment is prospective only. It provides:\n'Notwithstanding the provisions of section 26 of the Federal Farm Loan Act (39 Stat. 380 (U.S.C., Title 12,  931-3)), as amended, in the case of mortgages made or obligations issued by any joint-stock land bank after the date of the enactment of this Act (May 28, 1938), all income, except interest, derived therefrom shall be included in gross income and shall not be exempt from Federal income taxation.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] S. Rep. No. 1567, 75th Cong., 3d Sess., p. 47. This report clearly indicates that the Committee was of the view that under  26 joint- stock land banks were exempt from capital gains resulting from purchases of their own obligations. A change in that regard was clearly intended, for the Committee said, p. 47:\n'This section subjects to Federal income taxation the capital gain realized by a joint-stock land bank on the purchase of its own obligations or of mortgages made by it. It has been brought to the attention of the committee that these banks have been purchasing their own bonds at below par and issuing new bonds at or above par. Gain realized on such a purchase is, under the law, taxable income and in the case of an ordinary corporation, is taxed. Under the Federal Farm Loan Act, however, which governs the taxability of obligations of joint-stock land banks, such income is exempt. The committee is of the opinion that such income ought to be taxed.'\n\n The Committee draft of  817 (then  816) provided for that change as follows (H.R. 9682, 75th Cong., 3d Sess.):\n'Notwithstanding the provisions of section 26 of the Federal Farm Loan Act, as amended, gain realized on the acquisition by a joint-stock land bank of obligations issued by it or mortgages made by it, if such obligations or mortgages are made or issued after the date of the enactment of this Act, shall not be exempt from Federal income taxation.'\n\n As indicated, supra, note 9, the unpublished memorandum of the General Counsel of the Bureau of Internal Revenue ruling that a joint- stock land bank was not taxable on gains from purchases of its own bonds was before the Senate Committee. Cf. the recommendation made to the Committee, S. Hearings, op. cit., supra, note 9, pp. 614, 615. \n[\nFootnote 14\n] Statement by Senator King, member of the Committee on Finance, Cong. Record, Vol. 83, 75th Cong., 3 Sess., p. 4959. When Senator King offered the amendment, he gave the following explanation (Id. p. 5174):\n'The bill as reported subjected to Federal income taxation capital gains realized by a joint-stock land bank on obligations issued and mortgages made by it after the date of enactment of the act. The effect of the amendment is not only to tax that gain but also to tax gain realized by another joint-stock land bank or by an individual or corporation which itself is not exempt from Federal taxation. Thus, gain on a sale of such a joint-stock land bank bond by an investor is subject to tax. The amendment continues the present provision of law under which interest on such bonds and mortgages is exempt from Federal taxation.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] Statutes governing Panama Canal Toll Bonds, 32 Stat. 481, 484, 31 U.S.C.A.  744; 36 Stat. 11, 117, 31 U.S.C.A.  745, and Postal Savings Bonds, 36 Stat. 814, 817, 39 U.S.C.A.  760, are cited. \n[\nFootnote 16\n] Reference is made to various statutes including those pertaining to Treasury notes, 38 Stat. 251, 269, 12 U.S.C.A.  447, and several of the Liberty loans, 40 Stat. 35, 31 U.S.C.A.  746; 40 Stat. 288, 291, 31 U.

Bridewell of Chicago, Ill., of counsel) for United States Savings and Loan League, amicus curiae.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1928 and 1929 appellant purchased prepaid shares of the appellee, a New Jersey building and loan association, paying the pay value of $200 per share. At that \n\n[310 \nU.S. 32, 35]\n\u00a0\n time the applicable New Jersey statutes provided that shares in such an association could be withdrawn by giving such written notice as the constitution or by-laws of the association provided, not to exceed 30 days; that withdrawals should be paid in the order in which notices were received, with not more than one-half of the receipts of any month being required to be used for payment of withdrawals, without the consent of the board of directors, until the oldest unpaid claim of withdrawal had been on file for six months; that no payment should be postponed for longer than six months from the date of notice; and that any member who had given notice could sue and recover the withdrawal value if it was not paid within six months of the notice. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n On April 22, 1932, these statutes were amended in four respects: (1) 'total receipts' of an association, one-half of which were required to be used for the payment of withdrawals and which had not been previously defined, were defined as income on authorized investments, dues on shares of the association which were pledged with it to secure loans, and repayments from loans; (2) if in any one month the funds required to be payable for withdrawals were insufficient to pay all requested withdrawals, withdrawing members were to receive $500 each in the order of priority until the fund for withdrawals was exhausted; (3) no withdrawals were to be paid if the funds available for payment of matured shares were insufficient to pay all matured shares, the payment of which had been requested within thirty days after maturity; (4) so long as the funds of an association were applied as required by the amendment, no member who had filed his withdrawal notice should have a right to sue for the withdrawal value of his shares. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[310 \nU.S. 32, 36]\n\u00a0\n In 1935 another amendment was passed providing that one-third of the 'net receipts' of an association were to be payable for withdrawals, with 'net receipts' defined as monies, other than borrowed monies, received by the association less operating expenses, payments on creditor obligations, payments for protecting the property of the association and reserves for any of these purposes. At the same time payments of withdrawals in the order in which notices had been received was continued but the payments were limited to $50 per member.\n Minor amendments, not pertinent here, were added in 1936 and in 1937 the statutes, as they stood in 1936 with some immaterial changes, were carried into a general revision of New Jersey's statute law.\n On August 17, 1932, after the passage of the 1932 amendment, appellant filed a written notice of withdrawal with respondent. In 1939, he brought this suit against respondent for the withdrawal value of his shares, claiming that, in so far as any of the amendments referred to altered the statutes in existence at the time of purchase of the shares, the amendments were unconstitutional violations of the contracts clause of Article I and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The allegations show that the Association was solvent at the time of notice of withdrawal and has remained solvent. The trial court dismissed appellant's complaint. The Court of Errors and Appeals affirmed. 123 N.J.L. 356, 8 A. 2d 350.\n The ruling was based squarely on the constitutionality of the Act of 1932. The later acts were not referred to in the opinion except by pointing out that the Act of 1932 would be found in the 1937 revision. The case is here on appeal under Section 237(a) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C. A.  344(a). As this section gives a review to this Court only of state statutes held valid by the highest court of a state against an attack for repugnancy to the Constitution of the United States, we \n\n[310 \nU.S. 32, 37]\n\u00a0\n deem ourselves limited to the Act of 1932.3 The question of the applicability to withdrawals of statutes on the subject which were passed subsequent to the notice of withdrawal is not considered in this opinion. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The New Jersey statutes concerning the regulation of building and loan associations reach back many years prior to the purchase of these shares. Beginning in 1903 general regulatory acts were passed at intervals with sections directed at the mode of withdrawal. \n5\n The form of these statutes and the judicial notice of the Court of Errors and Appeals in the Bucsi case of the importance to the State of New Jersey of building and loan associations makes clear that in dealing in 1932 with the problem of withdrawals the legislature was faced with the threat of wrecked associations and the consequent further depression of real estate values throughout its area. While the act of 1932 now under review was not emergency legislation, the dangers of unrestricted withdrawals then became apparent. It was passed in the public interest to protect the activities of the associations for the economic welfare of the State. It is also plain that the 1932 act was one of a long series regulating the many integrated phases of the building and loan business such as formation, membership, powers, investments, reports, liquidations, foreign associations and examinations. We are dealing here with financial institutions of major importance to the credit system of the State. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n[310 \nU.S. 32, 38]\n\u00a0\n With institutions of such importance to its economy, the State retains police powers adequate to authorize the enactment of statutes regulating the withdrawal of shares. \n7\n Unquestionably for the future, the provisions of the 1932 act would be effective. \n8\n We think they were equally effective as to shares bought prior to the enactment of the statute, notwithstanding the provisions of Article I, Section 10 of the Constitution that 'No State shall ... pass any ... Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts ....' This is so because the obligation of the Association to respond to the application for withdrawal was subject to the paramount police power. Beginning with the 1903 act the State of New Jersey has laid down specifically by statute the requirements for withdrawal. The charter, by-laws and membership certificate ceased to determine withdrawal rights. (See Note 5, supra.) It was while statutory requirements were in effect that petitioner purchased his shares. When he purchased into an enterprise already regulated in the particular to which he now objects, he purchased subject to further legislation upon the same topic. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n In Home Building & Loan Association v. Blaisdell10 this Court considered the authority retained by the state over contracts 'to safeguard the vital interests of its people.' The rule that all contracts are made subject to this paramount authority was there reiterated. Such authority is not limited to health, morals and safety. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n[310 \nU.S. 32, 39]\n\u00a0\n It extends to economic needs as well. \n12\n Utility rate contracts give way to this power,13 as do contractual arrangements between landlords and tenants. \n 14\n\u00a0\n\n The cases cited in the preceding paragraph make repeated reference to the emergency existing at the time of the enactment of the questioned statutes. Many of the enactments were temporary in character. We are here considering a permanent piece of legislation. So far as the contract clause is concerned, is this significant? We think not. 'Emergency does not create (constitutional) power, emergency may furnish the occasion for the exercise of power.' \n15\n We think of emergencies as suddenly arising and quickly passing. The emergency of the depression may have caused the 1932 legislation, but the weakness in the financial system brought to light by that emergency remains. If the legislature could enact the legislation as to withdrawals to protect the associations in that emergency, we see no reason why the new status should not continue. When the 1932 act was passed commercial and savings banks, insurance companies and building and loan associations were suffering heavy withdrawals. The liquid portion of their assets were being rapidly drained off by their customers, leaving the long term investments and depreciated assets as an inadequate source for pay- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 32, 40]\n\u00a0\n ment of the remaining liabilities. An acceleration or a continuance of this tendency to withdraw available funds threatened a quick end to the ability of the institutions to meet even normal demands. Such threatened insolvency demands legislation for its control in the same way that liquidation after insolvency does. Such legislation may be classed as emergency in one sense but it need not be temporary. \n16\n\u00a0\n\n This power of the state to protect its citizens by statutory enactments affecting contract rights, without a violation of the contract clause of the Constitution, is analogous to the power often reserved to amend charters. Under this reserved power, it is held that the relations between a stockholder or certificate holder and the corporation may be varied without impairing the contract existing between the corporation and its stockholder or member. \n17\n The contract rights considered in Coombes v. Getz18 arose from a contract between a third party and the corporation. And the power reserved against the corporation and its members was deemed to be ineffective against a stranger to the reservation.\n Appellant relies upon Treigle v. Acme Homestead Association19 as a determinative precedent in support of his argument that the withdrawal arrangements between the association and appellant were contractual and secure from impairment by the statutory exercise of the paramount police power of the State. In that case statutory changes as to the right of withdrawal, similar to these involved here, had been made after the purchase of the shares. The enactment in the Treigle case occurred after notice of \n\n[310 \nU.S. 32, 41]\n\u00a0\n withdrawal. From all the circumstances of the Louisiana building and loan situation at the time of the legislation attacked in the Treigle case this Court reached the factual conclusion that the withdrawal amendment to the building and loan statutes was directed merely toward a private right and not deemed in the public interest.\n It is to be noted that this Court was careful to point out in the Treigle case20 that where the police power is exercised 'for an end which is in fact public' contracts must yield to the accomplishment of that end. \n 21\n\u00a0\n\n Certainly the protection of building and loan associations against the catastrophe of excessive withdrawal is, today, within legislative power.\n Separate consideration of the objection to the legislation under the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment seems wholly unnecessary.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concurs in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Laws N.J.1925, c. 65,  52. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Laws N.J.1932, c. 102, N.J.S.A. 17:12-53. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Cf.

Griswold, of Cambridge, Mass., for petitioners.\n\n\n\n[310 \nU.S. 132, 135]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Hermon J. Wells, of New Haven, Conn., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice REED delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Boston and Providence Railroad Corporation in 1888 leased its property, a line of road running between Boston and Providence, for 99 years to the Old Colony Railroad. It has continued as a separate corporation, receiving and distributing its rent, and is not a subsidiary or affiliate of the New Haven or the Old Colony. In 1899 the Old Colony leased its lines, including its leasehold in the Boston and Providence, to the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad for 99 years. The New Haven operated its own and the leased property until it was put into reorganization under Section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act1 in the District Court of Connecticut on October 23, 1935. The trustees of the New Haven operated the Old Colony under the lease until they rejected the lease by order of the court on June 2, 1936. Next day the Old Colony filed under Section 77 in the same Connecticut court as a subsidiary debtor, the court appointed the trustees of the New Haven trustees of the Old Colony, and on June 18, 1936, the court ordered the New Haven trustees to continue to operate the Old Colony as an integral part of the New Haven, the operation being for the account of the Old Colony. The order provided that, in the event leases of the Old Colony were later rejected, payments for operating the leased property and payments of rent under the lease would be deemed to have been for the account of the lessor and could be recovered from the \n\n[310 \nU.S. 132, 136]\n\u00a0\n leased property prior to any mortgage or lien thereon. On July 19, 1938, the court directed the trustees of the Old Colony to reject the lease of the Boston and Providence and to continue operation of the road for the account of the Boston and Providence pursuant to Section 77, sub. c(6), 11 U.S.C.A.  207, sub. c(6). On August 4, 1938, the Boston and Providence was put into reorganization in the District Court of Massachusetts. Previously the system had been operating at a loss and the trustees of the New Haven and the Old Colony asked the Connecticut court to determine the amount of the deficit attributable to the Boston and Providence for the period from June 4, 1936, to December 31, 1937, and to declare that amount a lien on the Boston and Providence in favor of the New Haven and the Old Colony. On January 16, 1939, the Connecticut court decided that it had jurisdiction to grant the requested lien on the Boston and Providence, although that road was under reorganization in another bankruptcy court, and on April 20, 1939, the court entered an order fixing the amount of the deficit and declaring it a first lien on the property of the Boston and Providence. The Circuit Court of Appeals, holding that the Connecticut court had jurisdiction to determine the lien, affirmed the order of January 16, 1939, but concluded that the Boston and Providence had been given no chance to be heard on the merits of the question and remanded the later order for a determination of the 'existence and amount of the obligation.' \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The obligation on which the claimed lien is based arises, so the trustees of the New Haven and the Old Colony contend, from the operation of the Boston and Providence under Section 77, sub. c(6) by the Old Colony for the account of the Boston and Providence. Petitioners deny that Section 77, sub. c(6) was properly invoked and claim that the deficit is not chargeable to them. This phase of the contro- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 132, 137]\n\u00a0\n versy is not before us, for petitioners have brought here only the question of the Connecticut court's jurisdiction to determine the amount of the deficit chargeable to the Boston and Providence and to impose a lien on its property to secure it. If the Connecticut court has that jurisdiction, it will determine whether the deficit is chargeable to the Boston and Providence when it determines the 'existence and extent of the obligation' pursuant to the order of remand of the Court of Appeals.\n The controversy has substance because of the contention of the trustees for the Boston and Providence that, as the court charged with the reorganization of that road (the Massachusetts District Court) has 'exclusive jurisdiction' under Section 77, sub. a 'of the debtor and its property wherever located,' the Connecticut court cannot consider the claims of the New Haven and Old Colony trustees for operating deficits or impose a lien on the Boston and Providence property to secure them.\n The lease of the Boston and Providence to the Old Colony is the type of lease covered by the order of June 18, 1936, by which the trustees of Old Colony were authorized to charge operating deficits against the lessor in the event of subsequent disaffirmance of the lease.\n Railroad reorganization in bankruptcy is a field completely within the ambit of the bankruptcy powers of Congress. \n3\n Under the commerce clause of the Constitution Congress likewise has exercised its power to provide for the continued operation of interstate railroads such as petitioner. \n4\n The fact that the operator operates under a \n\n[310 \nU.S. 132, 138]\n\u00a0\n lease does not affect the force of the requirement that the operation must continue until a certificate permitting abandonment is issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission. \n5\n The judicial functions of the bankruptcy court and the administrative functions of the Commission work cooperatively in reorganizations. \n6\n Provision is made by the Bankruptcy Act 7 for the operation of leased property on surrender. It is under this subsection that respondent claims to have become entitled to the amount sought in the motion for allowance and lien. This subsection modifies pro tanto the rule of the Interstate Commerce Act for operation.\n The property of the Boston and Providence came into the possession of the trustees of the New Haven and the Old Colony and remained there during the entire time covered by the claim. These roads were lessees of the property and debtors under Section 77 in the Connecticut court. It is immaterial what title the debtors had, whether a lease or a fee. The physical property covered by the lease \n\n[310 \nU.S. 132, 139]\n\u00a0\n was in the custody of the Connecticut court by virtue of the provision of Section 77, sub. a. \n8\n By virtue of subdivisions 77, sub. c(10) and 77, sub. c(6)9 it is clear that leaseholds are in some instances to be operated by the lessee's trustees.\n This Court has held 'upon principles of general application' that courts having custody of property or a fund have the power 'to require that expenses which have contributed either to the preservation or creation of the fund in its custody shall be paid before a general distribution among those entitled to receive it.' \n10\n Such a power reposes in any court charged with custody of property. It is an in rem jurisdiction springing from possession of the property which is necessary in order that the court may adequately care for the property. Thus a court having custody of a ship is able to secure wharfage by virtue of its power to decree a preferential payment. \n11\n And here the court is able to carry out the operation of the Boston and Providence by promising or granting a lien to those who carry out the operation. \n\n[310 \nU.S. 132, 140]\n\u00a0\n If the Connecticut court has possession of the property and operated it under Section 77, sub. c(6) for its owners, could it fix a lien on the property after another bankruptcy court took the administration of the property? By Section 77, sub. c(6) railroads in reorganization which had been operating lines under lease were allowed to reject the lease but required to continue operation of the leased lines if the lessor had no ability to operate. Thus Congress recognized the possible occurrence of the situation now before us and evinced a desire that rail service should not in such a case be interrupted. In view of the public importance of rail service, we think this subsection represents an intention to give the court charged with operation the fullest ability to secure the necessities of operation-an intention to give the operating court power to promise those having the materials, men and equipment needed for operation a first lien on the road to secure payment for the operation. \n12\n This in no way impairs the operation of Section 77, sub. a which grants to the Massachusetts court, 'during the pendency of the proceedings under this section and for the purposes thereof, ... exclusive jurisdiction of the debtor and its property wherever located.' The 'purposes' of Section 77 include the development of a 'fair and equitable'13 plan of reorganization. The Massachusetts court is left with jurisdiction to accomplish this, but is bound to recognize the priority of the lien declared by the Connecticut court. By Section 77, sub. c(6) the Connecticut court was given jurisdic- \n\n[310 \nU.S. 132, 141]\n\u00a0\n tion so long as it continued to operate the road to grant a lien for operating expenses prior to any existing claims against the road. The decision of the Court of Appeals that the Connecticut court had jurisdiction to grant the lien sought by respondent is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 11 U.S.C.  205, 11 U.S.C.A.  205. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 2 Cir., 108 F.2d 164, 169. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Continental Illinois Nat.

Cattron Rigby, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n\n[311 \nU.S. 20, 24]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question is whether a Puerto Rico sales tax imposed by  16(a), 62 of the Internal Revenue Act of Puerto Rico, (as amended by Act No. 17 of June 3, 1927, Laws of 1927, Special Session, pp. 458-486), is invalid because as applied it infringes Congressional regulations of foreign and domestic commerce effected by the tariff laws and customs regulations of the United States. The tax is challenged so far as it is laid on the delivery, in consummation of sales, of fuel oil which has previously been imported in bond and then withdrawn, duty free for delivery to vessels in Puerto Rican ports for use as fuel upon their voyages to ports of the United States or foreign countries. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has affirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico sustaining the tax, 54 P.R.Dec. 732 (Spanish edition). West India Oil Co. v. Sancho, 108 F.2d 144. We granted certiorari, \n309 \nU.S. 652\n, 60 S.Ct. 888, because the question presented is of importance in the administration of the customs laws of the United States and of the revenue laws of Puerto Rico, and because of an asserted conflict with our decision in McGoldrick v. Gulf Oil Corporation, \n309 \nU.S. 414\n, 60 S.Ct. 664.\n Petitioner brings fuel oil from a foreign country, where it is produced and refined, to Puerto Rico, where it is stored in bonded warehouses in the joint custody of peti- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 20, 25]\n\u00a0\n tioner and the customs officers of the United States, as provided by  555 of the Tariff Act of 1930, 46 Stat. 743, 19 U.S.C.  1555, 19 U.S.C.A.  1555, and applicable customs regulations. From time to time petitioner withdraws some of the oil from bond, for disposition and use in Puerto Rico. Petitioner also withdraws some of the oil, with which we are now concerned, and delivers it to vessels in Puerto Rican ports upon sales for use as ships' stores in the manner already indicated. Upon such withdrawal and delivery the import tax imposed on fuel oil by  601(a), (c)(4) of the Revenue Act of 1932, 47 Stat. 169, 259, 260, 26 U.S.C.A.

Int.Rev.Acts page 624.\n Section 309 authorizes withdrawal from bonded warehouse, duty free under treasury regulations, of articles of foreign manufacture or production for use as ships' supplies, and  601(b), 630 of the Revenue Act of 1932 extend the benefit of those provisions to fuel oil imported in bond and withdrawn and 'sold for use as fuel ... on vessels ... engaged in foreign trade or trade ... between the United States and any of its possessions'. See McGoldrick v. Gulf Oil Corp., supra, 309 U.S. page 423 et seq., 60 S.Ct. page 666.\n It is true, as petitioner urges, that in McGoldrick v. Gulf Oil Corporation, supra, we held that the provisions of the Tariff Act of 1930 and of the Revenue Act of 1932, and the customs regulations relating to bonded manufacturing warehouses, when applied to crude oil imported into New York and there manufactured into fuel oil in bonded warehouses and withdrawn duty free for sale as ships' stores, manifested an intention of Congress to regulate the foreign commerce involved, in the interest of and for the protection of American manufacturers, and that a \n\n[311 \nU.S. 20, 26]\n\u00a0\n state tax on the sale was invalid because in conflict with such regulation. We do not stop to consider whether, as respondent insists, a different result should be reached here because the imported oil was imported in its manufactured state and was not, as in the Gulf Oil case, earmarked for manufacture in bonded warehouse and withdrawn after manufacture for sale as ships' stores. We need not now determine whether standing alone the statutory characterization of the oil sold as ships' supplies as 'exports' within the meaning of the customs laws,  309(b) Tariff Act of 1930;  630 of the Revenue Act of 1932, does more than make applicable to it the provisions of the Tariff Act of 1930 for remission of customs duties upon merchandise imported in bond and later exported. Nor is it necessary to examine the various arguments advanced that the tax, without the consent of Congress, is an infringement of its constitutional power over commerce. For we think a sufficient answer to all the contentions of petitioner is to be found in the Congressional consent to the tax given by the March 4, 1927 amendment of  3 of the Organic Act of Puerto Rico, 44 Stat. 1418, 48 U.S.C.A.  741, 741a, 745.\n Before the amendment,  3 had prohibited duties 'on exports from Puerto Rico', but had provided that 'taxes and assessments on property, internal revenue' etc., 'may be imposed for the purposes of the insular and municipal governments respectively, as may be provided and defined by the legislature of Puerto Rico ....' Congress, by the amendment, added to  3 a proviso 48 U.S.C.A.  741a 'that the internal-revenue taxes levied by the Legislature of Puerto Rico in pursuance of the authority granted by this Act (chapter) on articles, goods, wares or merchandise may be levied and collected as such legislature may direct, on the articles subject to said tax, as soon as the same are manufactured, sold, used, or brought into the island: Provided, That no discrimination be made between the articles imported \n\n[311 \nU.S. 20, 27]\n\u00a0\n from the United States or foreign countries and similar articles produced or manufactured in Puerto Rico. The officials of the Customs and Postal Services of the United States are hereby directed to assist the appropriate officials of the Puerto Rican government in the collection of these taxes.'\n The plain purport of the words of this proviso is that any tax authorized by the Organic Act with respect to articles of domestic production may likewise be levied with respect to imported articles 'as soon as (they) are manufactured, sold, used, or brought into the island' provided only that there be no tax discrimination between articles brought from the United States and foreign countries and domestic articles. The amendment seems to have been occasioned by doubts which had arisen whether merchandise brought to the Island from the United States was subject to local taxation while in the original package and also whether the merchandise has, while in the control of the customs authorities, the same status as respects local taxation as goods similarly controlled which have been imported from foreign countries and whether the power of the insular legislature to tax imports from foreign countries was any greater than that of the states which are forbidden, by Clause 2, of  10 of Art. I of the Constitution, to tax imports and exports without the consent of Congress. S.Rep. No. 1011, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 2. Cf. Sonneborn Bros. v. Cureton, \n262 \nU.S. 506\n, 43 S.Ct. 643, with Baldwin v. Seelig, \n294 \nU.S. 511, 526\n, 55 S.Ct. 497, 501, 101 A.L.R. 55. These questions were involved in Porto Rico Tax Appeals, 1 Cir., 16 F.2d 545, decided January 7, 1927, shortly before the amendment of  3 of the Organic Act. The judgments in that case were reversed and the suits ordered dismissed by this Court for want of jurisdiction October 24, 1927, after the amendment to the Organic Act of March 4, 1927, which deprived the federal courts of jurisdiction in the pending and other like suits to restrain the assessment and collection of Puerto Rico taxes. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 20, 28]\n\u00a0\n Moreover practical difficulties appear to have been experienced in levying insular taxes upon goods on their arrival from the United States and while in the custody or control of postal or customs officers, due to the fact that the local tax while in its practical effect a customs duty was not collected by postal or customs officials. S.Rep.No. 1011, 69th Cong., 1st Sess. The doubts and the difficulty were removed by the amendment to  3, giving the Congressional consent that articles should be subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the Puerto Rico legislature as soon as brought into the Island whether from the United States or from foreign countries, and directing that the United States customs officials and postal service should aid local officers in the collection of the tax. The effect of the broad language of the amendment was not only to subject to taxation all imported goods, whether from the United States or foreign countries, when brought into the Island in the original package, but to neutralize the regulatory effect of the customs laws and regulations in so far as they protected articles from local taxation after their arrival. Merchandise in the original package was thus subjected to tax when brought into the Island without regard to customs regulations. It would seem plain that other merchandise not in the original package was left in no more favorable situation and in the face of the broad and unambiguous language of the statute we cannot say that the one, more than the other, is immune from local taxation. Even if the oil sold as ships' stores were to be regarded as 'exported', cf. Swan & Finch Co. v. United States, \n190 \nU.S. 143, 145\n, 23 S.Ct. 702, 703; United States v. Chavez, \n228 \nU.S. 525\n, 33 S.Ct. 595; Cunard S.S. Co. v. Mellon, \n262 \nU.S. 100\n, 43 S.Ct. 504, 27 A.L.R. 1306, the tax is one clearly within the terms of the proviso added to  3 and so is one consented to by the United States.\n The procedure for segregating imported merchandise in bond without payment of customs duties pending its \n\n[311 \nU.S. 20, 29]\n\u00a0\n withdrawal and shipment out of the country is old, long antedating the amendment of  3 of the Organic Act. See McGoldrick v. Gulf Oil Corp., supra. The later Acts of 1930 and 1932 thus placed fuel oil so far as Puerto Rico is concerned, in the same category as other merchandise brought into the Island in the original package or in bond which, by virtue of the proviso of  3 of the Organic Act was made subject to local taxation as soon as brought into the Island. The extension by Congress to fuel oil of the benefits of the customs laws and regulations affecting merchandise imported in bond did not imply that those laws and regulations were to be given any different effect in Puerto Rico than they then were permitted to have under  3 of the Organic Act. In any event, considering the relationship of general Congressional legislation to legislation specifically applicable to our territories, and possessions, repeals by implication are not to be favored and will not be adjudged unless the legislative intention to repeal is clear. Posadas v. National City Bank, \n296 \nU.S. 497\n, 501 et seq., 56 S.Ct. 349, 351.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice REED, dissenting.\n This judgment should be reversed on the authority of McGoldrick v. Gulf Oil Corporation, \n309 \nU.S. 414\n, 60 S.Ct. 664. That case has just established the superiority of a federal statute for the protection of commerce over a state's right to levy a sales tax. In it we pointed out that it was inconsistent with the plenary power of Congress over commerce to permit local exactions to cut into the competitive advantages provided through the remission of customs duties to suppliers and exporters by the ship stores and fuel oil provisions of  309 of the Tariff Act of 1930 and  601(b) and  630 of the Revenue Act of 1932. Congress authorized these advantages to give our ship chan- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 20, 30]\n\u00a0\n dlers opportunity to compete for this trade on an even basis with nonresidents. The Gulf Oil case held that imported fuel oil carried in New York bonded warehouses for export might be sold, under Treasury oversight, to noncoastwise shipping without payment of the city sales tax. The opinion demonstrated that the purpose of Congress would be thwarted if local taxation were permitted to interfere. The same holding in my opinion is required here.\n Fuel oil imports into Puerto Rico are governed by the same tariff provisions, regulations for bonded warehouses and deliveries in bond to purchasers for use in overseas voyages as are those into the continental United States. The language of the Butler Act is held by the Court to require different treatment in New York or Puerto Rico of the same situation, despite the tax inequality produced between the respective taxing units. One would expect that Puerto Rico would have no more authority than a state to levy a sales tax on bonded fuel oil but this Court's ruling permits it to tax where New York failed.\n The authority is said to lie in the grant by Congress to Puerto Rico of the right to tax 'as soon as the same (articles subject to tax) are manufactured, sold, used, or brought into the island.' As the fuel oil is brought into the Island, this Court's opinion concludes, it is taxable. The report upon the Butler Act points out the reason for its enactment. \n1\n It was to enable Puerto Rico to tax \n\n[311 \nU.S. 20, 31]\n\u00a0\n in the original package. It should take more than a general tax authorization to destroy the symmetry of the federal control over imports bonded for export and to permit local taxation in Puerto Rico of what is free from local taxation in New York. 'Brought' should be construed to mean when goods pass from the customs control to private control, or the authority to tax of the Butler Act should be held to be subject to the federal power of tax exemption exercised generally in favor of fuel oil by  309 of the Tariff Act of 1930 and  601(b) and  630 of the Revenue Act of 1932. Since the right to tax imports in the original package, granted Puerto Rico by the Butler Act, merely makes goods in the original package in Puerto Rico taxable as other goods in the common mass of taxable property, the Butler Act gives to Puerto Rico no broader power to tax oil sales than was \n\n[311 \nU.S. 20, 32]\n\u00a0\n possessed by New York, by virtue of its sovereign power, in the Gulf Oil case. McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Co., \n309 \nU.S. 33\n, 60 S.Ct. 388, 128 A.L.R. 876. Nothing requires us to frustrate the legislative policy of free competition in world markets.\n The decree below should be reversed.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS joins in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'In making use of the authority granted by section 3 to levy and collect internal-revenue taxes the government of Porto Rico has found itself unable to collect said taxes on articles purchased in and sent from the United States to Porto Rico by mail, or sometimes when said articles are sent by vessel, as the courts have held that the post-office or customs officials have no authority to whthhold (the) delivery of such articles subject to the internal-revenue tax until the tax is paid, as such tax collected in this manner is in effect a customs duty. In other words, the courts have held that the internal-revenue tax can not be collected while the article subject to the tax is in the original package.\n'This condition of affairs has practically nullified the power of the insular government to levy internal-revenue taxes, and therefore the efficacy of this sort of revenue has been seriously impaired. \n\n'For the purpose of righting this situation, a new provision is added to section 3, which states as follows:\n\n'And it is further provided, That the internal-revenue taxes levied by the Legislature of Porto Rico in pursuance of the authority granted by this act on articles, goods, wares, or merchandise may be levied and collected as such legislature may direct, on the articles subject to said tax, as soon as the same are manufactured, sold, used, or brought into the island: Provided, That no discrimination in rates be made between the articles imported from the United States or foreign countries and similar articles produced or manufactured in Porto Rico. The officials of the Customs and Postal Services of the United States are hereby directed to assist the appropriate officials of the Porto Rican government in the collection of these taxes.'\n\n'It is expected that the government of Porto Rico will so make use of this power as not to unnecessarily place any barriers in the way of the free-trade conditions now existing between (Porto Rico) and the mainland, which is the principal factor in the progress and prosperity of Porto Rico.'

American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 54 Ohio App. 369, 7 N.E.2d 805, 7 O.O. 363, of the Cuyahoga County Court of Appeals, an intermediate appellate court of Ohio. The question for decision is whether, in refusing to follow the rule of law announced by the state court, the court below failed to apply state law within the requirement of  34 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 28 U.S.C.A.  725, and of our decision in Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n, 58 S.Ct. 817, 114 A. L.R. 1487\n\n\n In 1926 an Ohio decedent, domiciled at death in Cuyahoga County, bequeathed his estate, including ninety-two shares of the common stock of respondent, to his widow for life, with remainder to petitioners, the sons of decedent's first wife, who was the sister of his widow. February 2, 1927, the widow tendered to respondent, for transfer, certificates for the ninety-two shares of stock standing in decedent's name, each endorsed with an assignment of the shares evidenced by the certificate, to the widow, signed in her name as executrix of decedent's estate. Accompanying the certificate were duly attested documents as follows: A copy of decedent's will, a cer- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 223, 232]\n\u00a0\n tificate of the Cuyahoga County Probate Court of the qualification of the widow as executrix under the will; copy of an application of the executrix for the distribution in kind of the estate, consisting of specified corporate stocks including the ninety-two shares of respondent's stock, with the appended consent of petitioners to the distribution in kind, and a copy of the journal of the probate court showing that it had granted the application and ordered the distribution.\n Thereupon respondent issued a new certificate for the ninety-two shares in the name of the widow which did not disclose her limited interest as life tenant or that of petitioners as remaindermen. October 31, 1929 the widow endorsed and delivered the certificate as collateral security for her brokerage account to a stock broker to whom respondent issued a new certificate in his name as stockholder on November 4, 1929. In March, 1934, petitioners first learned of this disposition of the shares by the widow and in June, 1934, brought suit against respondent in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, seeking recovery of damages for the wrongful transfer of the shares. In addition to defenses on the merits respondent set up the Ohio four-year statute of limitations. After a trial on the merits the trial court gave judgment for petitioners, which the Cuyahoga County Court of Appeals reversed. The state Supreme Court denied petitioners' motion to require the court of appeals to certify its record to the Supreme Court for review because of 'probable error' in the case, after which the Court of Common Pleas entered 'final judgment against appellees (petitioners here) and in favor of appellant (respondent here)' upon the mandate of the Court of Appeals stating 'the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas is reversed for reasons stated in opinion on file and final judgment is hereby rendered for appel- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 223, 233]\n\u00a0\n lant, no error appearing in the record.' The opinion of the appellate court was not filed but copies were furnished counsel and it appears of record.\n The state court of appeals held that upon the tender for transfer of the certificates of stock by the executrix it was the duty of respondent to issue a new certificate showing on its face the respective interests of the life tenant and of the petitioners as remaindermen; that the transfer of the shares by respondent to the broker without the endorsement of the certificate by petitioners was unauthorized and wrongful; that the unlawful disposition of the stock by the life tenant did not terminate the life interest or accelerate the rights of the remaindermen, but that the refusal of respondent after demand by petitioner to recognize and reestablish petitioners' rights in the stock, or other stock of equal par value, was a conversion of it entitling petitioners to damages to the extent of the value of their interest in the stock or to a decree of restitution directing respondent to issue a new certificate for the ninety- two shares in such manner as would protect the respective interests of all parties.\n Construing the relevant provisions of the Ohio Uniform Stock Transfer Act (Ohio G.C.,  8673-1 to 22), the court held that as a prerequisite to recovery for conversion of petitioners' interest in the stock it was necessary that respondent repudiate petitioners' title and that the petitioners should allege and prove that respondent had refused to recognize petitioners' right in the stock and to issue an appropriate certificate for it. As petitioner had failed to allege or prove any demand on respondent or any refusal by it in advance of suit to recognize petitioners' rights or to issue an appropriate certificate, the court directed judgment for respondent in conformity to its mandate.\n On June 18, 1937, following the denial of petitioners' motion by the state Supreme Court, in January, 1937, \n\n[311 \nU.S. 223, 234]\n\u00a0\n petitioners made demand on respondent, the sufficiency of which is not questioned, to restore to petitioners their rights in the shares, and on July 14, 1937, petitioners brought the present suit in the federal district court for Northern Ohio. The bill of complaint, after alleging the facts already mentioned which the state court had found to establish the wrongful transfer of the stock by respondent and after reciting the course and results of the litigation in the state courts and the demand on respondent, set up petitioners' right to relief according to the decisions of the state courts and prayed judgment that respondent issue to petitioners a certificate for the ninety-two shares of stock and for back dividends with interest, and damages, and generally for other relief.\n The trial court found that the cause of action did not accrue until the demand made upon respondent; that suit was not barred by the prior adjudication in the state court since that suit, in which no demand was alleged or proved, was on a different cause of action from that now asserted; that it was not barred by limitations or laches and that the remainder interests had not been accelerated by the wrongful disposition and transfer of the stock. It accordingly decreed that respondent procure by purchase or otherwise nine-two shares of its common stock, issue a certificate for it to a trustee, which was directed to hold the stock during the lifetime of the widow for the benefit of respondent and upon her death to make distribution of it to the remaindermen as directed by the will.\n The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit dismissed the appeal of petitioners raising questions not now material and on the appeal of the respondent, reversed the decree of the district court, 108 F.2d 347. It held contrary to the ruling of the state court that demand upon respondent was not prerequisite to the accrual of petitioners' cause of action and that petitioners' right of re- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 223, 235]\n\u00a0\n covery was barred by limitations and laches. We granted certiorari, \n310 \nU.S. 618\n, 60 S.Ct. 979, upon a petition which set up that the Court of Appeals had erroneously failed to apply the Ohio law with respect to the necessity for a demand as defined by the state court of appeals in the litigation between the present parties and that the court below had erroneously applied the Ohio rule of limitations and of laches, all questions of public importance concerning the interrelation of state and federal courts.\n The court below thought that demand was not an essential part of the cause of action where the suit was brought by remaindermen not entitled to possession of the stock certificate, consequently that the district court had erred in following the ruling of the state court of appeals and that both had misconstrued and misapplied an earlier decision of the court below in American Steel Foundries v. Hunt, 6 Cir., 79 F.2d 558, where demand was held to be prerequisite to a suit brought by one who had acquired shares by purchase but had failed to present the endorsed certificate to the corporation for transfer before bringing suit. It cited decisions of similar purport by the Ohio Supreme Court but recognized that the only Ohio case passing upon the question whether demand is prerequisite to suit in the case of a remainderman is the decision of the state court of appeals in West v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., supra. It held that it was not bound to follow the decision of an intermediate appellate court of the state and so was free to adopt and apply what it considered to be the better rule that demand is unnecessary and consequently is not a part of the petitioners' cause of action. From this it concluded that the cause of action which it thought had accrued in 1927 when the stock certificate was issued to the life tenant, was barred by the four-year statute of limitations applicable to causes of action 'for an injury to the rights of the plaintiff not arising on contract ...' \n\n[311 \nU.S. 223, 236]\n\u00a0\n s 11224 Ohio G.C., or by laches if demand were necessary.\n Since the equitable relief sought in this suit is predicated upon petitioners' legal rights growing out of respondent's unlawful transfer of the stock to the assignee of the life tenant, the state 'laws' which, by  34 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, c. 20, 28 U.S.C.,  725, 28 U.S.C.A.  725, are made the 'rules of decision in trials at common law' define the nature and extent of petitioners' right. See Russell v. Todd, \n309 \nU.S. 280, 289\n, 60 S.Ct. 527, 532. And the rules of decision established by judicial decisions of state courts are 'laws' as well as those prescribed by statute. Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, supra, \n304 \nU.S. 78\n, 58 S.Ct. 822, 114 A.L.R. 1487. True, as was intimated in the Erie Railroad case, the highest court of the state is the final arbiter of what is state law. When it has spoken, its pronouncement is to be accepted by federal courts as defining state law unless it has later given clear and persuasive indication that its pronouncement will be modified, limited or restricted. See Wichita Royalty Co. v. City National Bank of Wichita Falls, \n306 \nU.S. 103, 107\n, 59 S.Ct. 420, 421. But the obvious purpose of  34 of the Judiciary Act is to avoid the maintenance within a state of two divergent or conflicting systems of law, one to be applied in the state courts, the other to be availed of in the federal courts, only in case of diversity of citizenship. That object would be thwarted if the federal courts were free to choose their own rules of decision whenever the highest court of the state has not spoken.\n A state is not without law save as its highest court has declared it. There are many rules of decision commonly accepted and acted upon by the bar and inferior courts which are nevertheless laws of the state although the highest court of the state has never passed upon them. In those circumstances a federal court is not free to reject the state rule merely because it has not received the sanction of the highest state court, even though it \n\n[311 \nU.S. 223, 237]\n\u00a0\n thinks the rule is unsound in principle or that another is preferable. State law is to be applied in the federal as well as the state courts and it is the duty of the former in every case to ascertain from all the available data what the state law is and apply it rather than to prescribe a different rule, however superior it may appear from the viewpoint of 'general law' and however much the state rule may have departed from prior decisions of the federal courts. See Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, supra, \n304 \nU.S. 78\n, 58 S.Ct. 822, 114 A.L.R. 1487; Russell v. Todd, supra, \n309 \nU.S. 293\n, 60 S.Ct. 533.\n Where an intermediate appellate state court rests its considered judgment upon the rule of law which it announces, that is a datum for ascertaining state law which is not to be disregarded by a federal court unless it is convinced by other persuasive data that the highest court of the state would decide otherwise. Six Companies of California v. Joint Highway District, \n311 \nU.S. 180\n, 61 S.Ct. 186, decided this day; Fidelity Union Trust Co. v. Field, \n311 \nU.S. 169\n, 61 S.Ct. 176, decided this day. Cf. Graham v. White-Phillips Co., \n296 \nU.S. 27\n, 56 S.Ct. 21, 102 A.L.R. 24; Wichita Royalty Co. v. City National Bank, supra, 306 S.Ct. 107, 59 S.Ct. 421; Russell v. Todd, supra. This is the more so where, as in this case, the highest court has refused to review the lower court's decision rendered in one phase of the very litigation which is now prosecuted by the same parties before the federal court. True, some other court of appeals of Ohio may in some other case arrive at a different conclusion and the Supreme Court of Ohio, notwithstanding its refusal to review the state decision against the petitioner may hold itself free to modify or reject the ruling thus announced. Village of Brewster v. Hill, 128 Ohio St. 343, 353, 190 N.E. 766. 1 Even though it is arguable \n\n[311 \nU.S. 223, 238]\n\u00a0\n that the Supreme Court of Ohio will at some later time modify the rule of the West case, whether that will ever happen remains a matter of conjecture. In the meantime the state law applicable to these parties and in this case has been authoritatively declared by the highest state court in which a decision could be had. If the present suit had been brought in the Cuyahoga county court no reason is advanced for supposing that the Cuyahoga court of appeals would depart from its previous ruling or that the Supreme Court of the state would grant the review which it withheld before. We think that the law thus announced and applied is the law of the state applicable in the same case and to the same parties in the federal court and that the federal court is not free to apply a different rule however desirable it may believe it to be, and even though it may think that the state Supreme Court may establish a different rule in some future litigation.\n Whether the state court of appeals in the first suit defined the cause of action as arising out of the failure of respondent to describe correctly the interests of the parties, in the certificate issued to the widow in 1927, or out of the wrongful transfer in 1929, is immaterial to the question of the period of limitation. In either case, since the cause of action under the Ohio law did not arise until demand which was either on June 2, 1934, when the suit was brought in the state court, or June 18, 1937, when the formal demand was made, the statute of limitations did not begin to run until one or the other of those dates. See Keithler v. Foster, 22 Ohio St. 27. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 223, 239]\n\u00a0\n It is unnecessary to decide whether, as petitioners contend, the suit was on contract or statutory liability to which the six-year statute applies,  11222, Ohio G.C., or 'for the recovery of personal property, or for taking or detaining it,' in which case the cause of action is not deemed to accrue 'until the wrongdoer is discovered ...'  11224, Ohio G.C., see Cleveland & M. Railroad Co. v. Robbins, 35 Ohio St. 483, 502, or whether as the court below held the cause of action was 'for an injury to the rights of the plaintiff not arising on contract ...', in which case the statute runs from the date of the injury when demand is not required.  11224, Ohio G.C. For in any event since under Ohio law no cause of action arose until demand was made, the four-year period would run either from the date of the first suit, or from that of the formal demand, and had not expired on July 14, 1937, when the present suit was commenced in the district court.\n The court below also held that if demand were to be deemed a prerequisite to suit petitioners were barred by their 'unnecessary delay' in making it, citing Keither v. Foster, supra, for the proposition that demand must be made within four years after the cause arose (1927 or 1929), the time limited by the statute for bringing an action if no demand were necessary. But the Supreme Court in that case thought it correct to apply the rule relied upon by the circuit court of appeals only when 'no cause for delay can be shown.' Cf. Stearns v. Hibben Dry Goods Co., 11 Ohio Cir. Ct.R.,N.S., 553, affirmed, 84 Ohio St. 470, 95 N.E. 1157. Here no special circumstances are shown for limiting the time of demand or shortening the statutory period after demand. \n2\n Both the state court and the district court \n\n[311 \nU.S. 223, 240]\n\u00a0\n in this case have ruled that petitioners are not estopped by their consent to distribution which both courts interpreted as a consent only to a lawful distribution by a lawful procedure. The district court also found that the evidence relied upon to show lack of diligence on the part of petitioners in prosecuting inquiries which would have disclosed the unlawful transfer failed of its purpose and was insufficient to establish either estoppel or laches. At most the evidence shows that in 1930 one of the petitioners became suspicious that the life tenant had suffered losses in the stock market and made inquiry of one corporation whose stock was included in the estate only to learn that the stock certificate had been properly issued to the widow as life tenant of the estate and that he made no further inquiries. The record is barren of any \n\n[311 \nU.S. 223, 241]\n\u00a0\n evidence to suggest that petitioners had any ground for suspicion that respondent had issued the certificate to the life tenant in any improper or unlawful form before March, 1934, when they discovered the misappropriation of the stock. They brought suit in the state court the following June. We think there was no want of diligence on the part of petitioners in presenting and prosecuting their demand and that the findings of the trial court are supported by the evidence and should not have been disturbed.\n The judgment will be reversed, but as other points involving questions of state law argued here were not passed upon by the Court of Appeals the cause will be remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS.\n I concur in the opinion of the court in so far as it holds that the Circuit Court of Appeals should have treated the decision of the Cuyahoga County Court of Appeals, under the circumstances of this case, as expressing the law of Ohio with respect to the necessity of a demand prior to institution of suit. I do not, however, agree that the judgment should be reversed.\n I am unable to say that the court below erred in holding that, under Ohio law, the four-year period of limitations applied to petitioners' cause of action, and that delay of demand for more than four years after the cause of action accrued barred the suit. Both holdings seem to me to be supported by decisions of the Ohio courts; Keithler v. Foster, 22 Ohio St. 27; Douglas v. Corry, 46 Ohio St. 349, 21 N.E. 440, 15 Am.St.Rep. 604; Townsend v. Eichelberger, 51 Ohio St. 213, 38 N.E. 207; Stearns v. Hibben Dry Goods Co., 11 Ohio Cir.Ct.R., N.S., 553, 31 Ohio Cir.Ct.R. 270, affirmed, 84 Ohio St. 470, 95 N.E. 1157. There is here \n\n[311 \nU.S. 223, 242]\n\u00a0\n no place for any presumption of demand, as in Keithler v. Foster, for here the suit in the state court was dismissed on the express ground that no demand had in fact been made; and in the present suit in the United States District Court the averment of the complaint is that demand was made June 18, 1937, at least eight years after the cause of action accrued. In such circumstances, as the other cited cases show, a demand made at a date beyond the period of limitations, does not toll the statute. In the Douglas case the averment was that demand was made nine years after the cause of action accrued and suit was brought within four years thereafter. In the Stearns case it was alleged demand was made four years and nine months after accrual of cause of action, and suit begun within four years thereafter. The statute of limitations was held a bar in both.\n Though the action was in equity, an action at law might have been maintained (Stearns v. Hibben Dry Goods Co., supra; Russell v. Todd, \n309 \nU.S. 280, 289\n, 60 S.Ct. 527, 532), and the statute governing such an action is applicable.\n Not only have petitioners failed to show 'special circumstances' justifying their delay in making demand (Keithler v. Foster, supra), but the court below has held they were guilty of laches, an independent ground of decision, which, though the question be a close one, we ought not, under our settled practice, to reexamine.\n For these reasons I think that, despite the erroneous view of the Circuit Court of Appeals as to the law of Ohio on the point decided by the State Court of Appeals, the judgment should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Article IV,  6 of the Ohio Constitution provides that: 'Judgments of the courts of appeals shall be final in all cases, except cases involving questions arising under the constitution of the United States or of this state ... and cases of public or great general interest in which the supreme court may direct any court of appeals to certify its record to that court ... and whenever the judges of a court of appeals find that a judgment upon which they have agreed is in conflict with a judgment pronounced upon the same question by any other court of appeals of the state, the judges shall certify the record of the case to the supreme court for review and final determination.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] In Keithler v. Foster, 22 Ohio St. 27, the demand on a sheriff for moneys collected on an execution sale in 1855 was not made until 1867. The Supreme Court in holding that the suit brought on the sheriff's bond in 1868 was not barred by the ten year statute of limitations said that where 'the statute begins to run, in cases like this, from the time of demand, it would be but reasonable to hold, in the absence of other special circumstances, where no demand is shown to have been made within the statutory period for bringing the action, that, for the purpose of setting the statute in operation, a demand will be presumed at the expiration of that period, from which time the statute will begin to run.'\n In Douglas v. Corry, 46 Ohio St. 349, 21 N.E. 440, 15 Am.St.Rep. 604; Townsend v. Eichelberger, 51 Ohio St. 213, 38 N.E. 207, on which respondent relies, no suit was brought until after the expiration of the additional limitation period after the demand was made or presumed as in Keithler v. Foster, supra.\n Here, even if demand were presumed at the end of a four year period, which began to run either in 1927 or 1929, the state court action was timely when begun on June 2, 1934. It was dismissed in February, 1937. The present action was begun in July, 1937.  11233 of the Ohio G.C. provides: 'In an action commenced, or attempted to be commenced, if in due time a judgment for the plaintiff be reversed, or if the plaintiff fails otherwise than upon the merits, and the time limited for the commencement of such action at the date of reversal or failure has expired, the plaintiff ... may commence a new action within one year after such date ....' \n\n\n\n\n","147":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWESTERN UNION TELEGRAPH CO. v. NESTER(1940)\nNo. 597\nArgued: Decided: April 22, 1940\n\n\n\n\n[309 \nU.S. 582, 583]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Francis Raymond Stark, of New York City, Oscar Lawler, of Los Angeles, Cal., and Francis R. Kirkham, of San Francisco, Cal., for petitioner.\n Mr. Earl C. Demoss, of Los Angeles, Cal., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondents, Nester and Charles, are partners in mining operations near Aramecina, Republic of Honduras. September 1, 1937, at Los Angeles, California, petitioner, the Telegraph Company, in the ordinary course of business, received from Nester one hundred and fifty dollars for transmission by unrepeated message and delivery to Charles at Aramecina. It failed so to do.\n In a 'Complaint for damages for breach of duty' filed against petitioner in the District Court, Southern District, California, respondents claimed the failure to deliver resulted from gross negligence and that as a direct consequence they suffered specified losses amounting to $7,600. For that sum they asked judgment.\n Petitioner denied liability and as an affirmative defense alleged-\n'The money order referred to in the plaintiff's complaint was delivered to and accepted by the defendants subject to the terms of the standard money order contract of The Western Union Telegraph Company, a copy of which is hereto annexed.' \n\n[309 \nU.S. 582, 584]\n\u00a0\n It is not now denied that this standard form had been duly filed with the Federal Communications Commission and was treated by the parties as a statement of the contract between them. Certain of the conditions contained therein are printed below. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[309 \nU.S. 582, 585]\n\u00a0\n The point for determination here arises out of the following condition: 'In any event, the company shall not be liable for damages for delay, non-payment or underpayment of this money order, whether by reason of negligence on the part of its agents or servants or otherwise, beyond the sum of five hundred dollars, at which amount the right to have this money order promptly and correctly transmitted and promptly and fully paid is hereby valued, unless a greater value is stated in writing on the face of this application and an additional sum paid or agreed to be paid based on such value equal to one-tenth of one per cent thereof.'\n\n The cause was tried by the court without a jury upon the pleadings and evidence. D.C., 25 F.Supp. 478, 481. It found as matter of fact: 'That it is not true that by reason of the failure of the defendant, Western Union Telegraph Company, to transmit and to deliver and to pay promptly said money order as aforesaid, the plaintiffs have suffered damages in the sum of Seventy-six hundred ($7,600.00) Dollars; the court finds, however, that by reason of such failure, the plaintiffs have suffered and sustained damages, loss and injury in the sum of Five Hundred ($500.00) Dollars.'\n Evidently it was not intended by this finding to declare actual damages had been shown, as respondents' \n\n[309 \nU.S. 582, 586]\n\u00a0\n counsel suggest. After pointing out the lack of any evidence of actual loss resulting from the alleged negligence, the court's opinion asserts- 'So that, assuming that the action is in tort, there is no substantial proof of any of the special damages claimed. However, the plaintiffs are not without redress.'\n The court found as matter of law 'That the condition on the application for the transmission of the money order filed by The Western Union Telegraph Company with the Federal Communications Commission limiting its liabilities to five hundred ($500) dollars is a valid undertaking. That Paul Nester and Juan Charles, copartners plaintiff are entitled to recover the amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00) against the Western Union Telegraph Company ... without prejudice to their right to sue for and recover the one hundred and fifty ($150) dollars' accepted for transmission.\n The condition relative to liability for $500, quoted above, was construed by the trial court as 'a provision for liquidated damages, which entitles the sender to recovery of the minimum amount of five hundred dollars in the absence of any proof or without any offer of proof.' And it said, 'Hence, although we are unable to award to the plaintiffs the special damages they ask, they are entitled, under the facts alleged and proved, to the sum stipulated as liquidated damages in the contract. ... Here the plaintiffs, under the facts alleged in the complaint and proved at the trial, have shown themselves entitled to recovery, even though they were unable to prove the damages they sought.'\n The judgment against petitioner was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 9 Cir., 106 F.2d 587, 589. The opinion there declares: 'Appellant contends that the provision in the money order blank was a part of the tariff filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission, and as such limited the \n\n[309 \nU.S. 582, 587]\n\u00a0\n damages recoverable to the actual damage, not exceeding $500, and that without actual damage there could be no recovery. The question presented is one of interpretation of the provision, not of validity thereof.'\n Also:\n'Here, the provision in question has a limitation of liability clause- 'the company shall not be liable for damages ... beyond the sum of five hundred dollars'. The provision also contained a clause by which it was agreed that 'the right to have this money order promptly and correctly transmitted and promptly and fully paid is hereby valued' at $500. Although appellant contends that the clause means that such right is valued at not 'beyond the sum of' $500, the clause does not so state. It states that such right is valued at $500.\n\n'When Nester delivered the $150 to appellant, he had the right to have the money transmitted without unreasonable delay. (Western U. Teleg. Co. v. Crovo, \n220 \nU.S. 364\n, 31 S.Ct. 399) and delivered to Charles. Moore v. New York Cotton Exchange, \n270 \nU.S. 593\n, 46 S.Ct. 367, 45 A.L.R. 1370. Because of appellant's acts, that right was destroyed, and Nester is entitled to recover its value, which the parties agreed was $500.'\n\n By its petition for certiorari the Telegraph Company presents a single question: 'Does the limitation of liability provision in petitioner's money order tariff-which is substantially the same as that in its telegraph tariff-constitute a liquidated damage provision which would automatically make petitioner liable for damages in the fixed sum of $500, in case of default in service, regardless of whether or not the sender had sustained any actual damage, or is the provision rather one which fixes a maximum limit within which damages may be proved?'\n We think the provision in question was not intended to prescribe a definite liability (liquidated damages), but is a limitation upon the maximum permissible recovery for \n\n[309 \nU.S. 582, 588]\n\u00a0\n actual loss or damage properly alleged and shown by evidence. The courts below erred in ruling otherwise.\n Considering what has been ruled in Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Esteve Bros. & Co., 1921, \n256 \nU.S. 566\n, 41 S.Ct. 584; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Czizek, 1924, \n264 \nU.S. 281\n, 44 S.Ct. 328; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Priester, 1928, \n276 \nU.S. 252\n, 48 S.Ct. 234, the validity of the condition before us is not open to serious doubt; and viewed in the light of its history and evident purpose it must be interpreted as imposing a limitation upon the amount which may be recovered. See, Unrepeated Message Case, 44 I.C.C. 670, 675, and Limitations of Liability in Transmitting Telegrams, 61 I.C.C. 541, 550.\n The interpretation of the condition approved below would permit a recovery of five hundred dollars irrespective of the sum deposited for transmission and without requiring the sender to show any loss whatsoever. A mere failure to transmit a small sum deposited with the company might impose a heavy and utterly unreasonable burden upon the common carrier although the patron had suffered no loss. This does not harmonize with the declared purpose of the statute to impose just and reasonable rates.\n The precise question here involved has been ruled upon by two intermediate courts. Miazza v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 1935, 50 Ga. App. 521, 178 S.E. 764; and Wernick v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 1937, 290 Ill.App. 569, 573, 574, 9 N.E.2d 72, 74. In the first the Court of Appeals of Georgia sustained a demurrer to a complaint which definitely sought to recover five hundred dollars as liquidated damages for failure properly to transmit a message. The opinion in the second cause well said: 'Although this particular clause has been a part of the rules, regulations, classifications, and tariffs of the tele- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 582, 589]\n\u00a0\n graph company since 1921, it has never been interpreted as a liquidated damage provision, and no cases are cited which would justify such an interpretation. Reading the agreement as a whole, as it must be read under the fundamental rules of construction, and taking into consideration the historical reasons for changing the legal relationship between telegraph companies and their patrons through federal legislation, and the effect thereof as stated by the court in Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Esteve Bros. & Co. and the Priester Case, supra, we think the court was unwarranted in interpreting the language employed as a liquidated damage clause. In so doing, it evidently failed to consider the intent, purpose, and meaning of the entire clause, and considered only the words 'at which amount the right ... is hereby valued.' The fair interpretation of the provision as a whole must necessarily give effect to the plainly expressed clauses which precede and follow the so-called liquidated damage provision, stating that 'in any event, the Company shall not be liable for damages for delay, nonpayment or underpayment of this money order, whether by reason of negligence on the part of its agents, servants, or otherwise, beyond the sum of $500 ..., unless a greater value is stated in writing on the face of this application and an additional sum paid or agreed to be paid, based on such value, equal to one-tenth of 1 per cent thereof.' The provision, when read in its entirety, was clearly intended to fix, not a definite liability, but a maximum liability or agreed valuation upon which the rate to be paid for the shipment or carriage is to be collected.'\n The challenged judgment must be reversed. The cause will be remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in harmony with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Money Orders Are Subject to the Following Conditions:\n Domestic orders will be canceled and refund made to the sender if payment cannot be effected within 72 hours after receipt at paying office ( Ellis Island, N.Y., excepted). Orders payable at Ellis Island will be canceled after the expiration of five days.\n In the case of a Foreign Order the Foreign equivalent of the sum named in the order will be paid at the rate of exchange established by the Company or its agents on the date of the transfer.\n In the case of a Foreign Order the equivalent, in the currency of the country of payment, of the sum named will be purchased promptly; and if for any reason payment cannot be effected, refund will be made by the Company and will be accepted by the depositor on the basis of the market value of such foreign currency in American funds, at New York, on the date when notice of cancelation is received there by the Company from abroad.\n When the Company has no office at destination authorized to pay money, it shall not be liable for any default beyond its own lines, but shall be the agent of the sender, without liability, and without further notice, to contract on the sender's behalf with any other telegraph or cable line, bank or other medium, for the further transmission and final payment of this order.\n In any event, the company shall not be liable for damages for delay, nonpayment or underpayment of this money order, whether by reason of negligence on the part of its agents or servants or otherwise, beyond the sum of five hundred dollars, at which amount the right to have this money order promptly and correctly transmitted and promptly and fully paid is hereby valued, unless a greater value is stated in writing on the face of this application and an additional sum paid or agreed to be paid based on such value equal to one-tenth of one per cent thereof.\n In the event that the company accepts a check, draft or other negotiable instrument tendered in payment of a money order, its obligation to effect payment of the money order, shall be conditional and shall cease and determine in case such check, draft or other negotiable instrument shall for any reason become uncollectible, and in any event the sender of this money order hereby agrees to hold the telegraph company harmless from any loss or damage incurred by reason or on account of its having so accepted any check, draft or negotiable instrument tendered in payment of this order.\n All messages included in money orders are subject to the following terms-\n The company shall not be liable for mistakes or delays in the transmission or delivery, or for non-delivery, of any message received for transmission at the unrepeated-message rate beyond the sum of five hundred dollars; nor for mistakes or delays in the transmission or delivery, or for non-delivery, of any message received for transmission at the repeatedmessage rate beyond the sum of five thousand dollars, unless specially valued; nor in any case for delays arising from unavoidable interruption in the working of its lines; nor for errors in cipher or obscure messages. \n\n\n\n\n","148":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWHITE v. STATE OF TEXAS(1940)\nNo. 87\nArgued: Decided: May 27, 1940\n\n\n\n Messrs. F.S.K. Whittaker and Carter Wesley, both of Houston, Tex., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Lloyd W. Davidson and William J. Fanning, both of Austin, Tex ., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner was convicted of rape and sentenced to death in the District Court of Montgomery County, Texas. The State's appellate criminal court of last resort affirmed and denied rehearing. \n1\n We declined to grant certiorari to review the State court's action. February 29, 1940, petitioner sought rehearing of his petition for certiorari, alleging that his conviction and sentence resulted from proceedings in which the State had utilized an alleged confession in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. March 25, 1940, we granted certiorari, and reversed the judgment of the state court \n\n[310 \nU.S. 530, 531]\n\u00a0\n \n309 \nU.S. 631\n, 60 S.Ct. 706, upon authority of Chambers v. Florida, \n309 \nU.S. 227\n, 60 S.Ct. 472, and Canty v. Alabama, \n309 \nU.S. 629\n, 60 S.Ct. 612. The case is before us now on the State's petition for rehearing. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n From the first offer of the alleged confession in evidence at the trial, petitioner has challenged the State's right to utilize it consistently with rights guaranteed him by the Federal Constitution. \n3\n In affirming the conviction and sentence of death, the court below necessarily determined that use of the confession did not constitute a denial of that due process which the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees.\n The State suggests that there is evidence that petitioner denied ever having made or signed the confession which purported to be signed by his mark. Therefore, it insists \n\n[310 \nU.S. 530, 532]\n\u00a0\n that petitioner is barred from urging that the prosecution's use of the confession could have deprived him of due process at his trial. But regardless of petitioner's testimony on this question, the State insisted and offered testimony to establish that the confession was signed by him and upon this evidence the confession was submitted to the jury for the purpose of obtaining his conviction. Since, therefore, the confession was presented by the State to the jury as that of petitioner, we must determine whether the record shows that, if signed at all, the confession was obtained and used in such manner that petitioner's trial fell short of that procedural due process guaranteed by the Constitution.\n Petitioner is an illiterate farmhand who was engaged, at the time of his arrest, upon a plantation about ten miles from Livingston, Texas. On the day following the crime with which he has been charged, he was called from the field in which he was picking cotton and was taken to the house of the brother-in-law of the prosecutrix, the victim of the crime, where fifteen or sixteen negroes of the vicinity were at the time in custody without warrants or the filing of charges. Taken to the county court house, and thence to the Polk County jail, petitioner was kept there six or seven days. According to his testimony, armed Texas Rangers on several successive nights took him handcuffed from the jail 'up in the woods somewhere', whipped him, asked him each time about a confession and warned him not to speak to any one about the nightly trips tot he woods. During the period of his arrest up to and including the signing of the alleged confession, petitioner had no lawyer, no charges were filed against him and he was out of touch with friends or relatives.\n There were denials that petitioner was ever physically mistreated or abused. But the Rangers and a local peace officer, identified by petitioner as the officers who took \n\n[310 \nU.S. 530, 533]\n\u00a0\n him on the night trips to the woods and there whipped him, did not specifically deny that he was taken out of jail, at night, and interrogated in the woods. This local peace officer wasn't sure 'how many times' the prisoner was removed from jail, and one Ranger re-stated his testimony given at the first trial that he 'took him out so many times' the exact number could not be recalled. The prisoner was taken out of jail, driven 'out on the road' and then 'out off of the road', as this Ranger testified, in order that the officers could talk to him and because the jail was crowded. In jail, the Sheriff put petitioner by himself and 'kept watching him and talking to him.'\n Before carrying petitioner to Beaumont, where the alleged confession was taken, the Sheriff talked about an hour and a half with him. The Rangers who had been taking petitioner to the woods at night knew the county attorney was going to Beaumont to get a statement; they, too, went there and were in and out of the eighth floor room of the jail in Beaumont, with the elevator locked, where petitioner was interrogated from approximately 11:00 P.M. to 3:00 or 3:30 A.M. The alleged confession was reduced to writing after 2 A.M. Immediately before it was taken down, the prisoner was repeatedly asked by the private prosecutor whether he was ready to confess. Petitioner then began to cry, and the typing of the confession, upon which the State's case substantially rested, was completed by the county attorney about daylight. Two citizens of Beaumont signed it as witnesses.\n'Due process of law, preserved for all by our Constitution, commands that no such practice as that disclosed by this record shall send any accused to his death.'4\n\n The State's petition for rehearing is denied.\n Petition denied. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 128 S.W.2d 51. A prior conviction was reversed. 135 Tex.Cr.R. 210, 117 S.W.2d 450. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Petitioner's original petition for certiorari was denied November 13, 1939. On February 29, 1940, after our decision in the Chambers case, petitioner filed a petition for rehearing of his original petition, assigning the additional ground that his conviction was attributable to the use by the State of a confession obtained by coercion and intimidation. March 2, 1940, the Attorney General of Texas was notified of the pendency of the petition for rehearing and he has informed the Clerk of this Court that he notified the State's Appellate Criminal Attorney. Information of pendency of the petition for rehearing of the petition for certiorari was also communicated to the Montgomery County District Court Clerk, the District Attorney, the Governor and the State Board of Pardons and Paroles. The State's petition for rehearing of our judgment of March 25, 1940, reversing the State court's judgment, alleged that the State had not received adequate notice and sought further opportunity to present the State's views. We therefore heard oral arguments upon the State's petition for rehearing. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] In addition to alleging that the confession relied on by the State was coerced and involuntary, both petitioner's amended motion for a new trial and his bill of exceptions to the court below set out that he 'was not permitted to talk to an attorney to advise him but was kept incommunicado, was not permitted to use a telephone, was kept in the woods by Rangers a great portion of the time and was denied every right that even this defendant is entitled to under the Constitution of Texas and the Constitution of the United States.' \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Chambers v.

Gilchrist, all of New York City, for appellants.[ Whitney v. State Tax Commission of New York \n309 \nU.S. 530\n (1940) ]\n\n\n[309 \nU.S. 530, 534]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Mortimer M. Kassell, of Albany, N.Y., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Cornelius Vanderbilt died in 1899. By his will he established a trust to issue a designated annual income to his wife. Upon her death, Mrs. Vanderbilt was also \n\n[309 \nU.S. 530, 535]\n\u00a0\n given the power to dispose of this fund among four of their children, in such proportions as she might choose. In default of her exercise of this discretionary power, the fund was to go to the children equally. Mrs. Vanderbilt died in 1934, and by her will availed herself of the power. The taxing authorities of New York included the value of this trust fund in her gross estate, and on this basis computed Mrs. Vanderbilt's estate tax. The Court of Appeals of New York, finding that the applicable New York legislation had been properly construed by the Tax Commission, sustained its validity. In re Vanderbilt's Estate, 281 N.Y. 297, 22 N.E.2d 379. The result of this decision is to reduce the amount available for distribution among the beneficiaries of Mrs. Vanderbilt's independent property below what it would have been had the tax been assessed on the basis of that property without the inclusion of the trust fund which came from her husband. These beneficiaries, and the executors of the will, claim that the exaction thus sanctioned by New York violates the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\n The contested statute, New York Laws of 1932, ch. 320, derives meaning as an incident in the history of New York's present system of death taxes. That system had its beginning in 1885. The original act taxed individual economic benefits derived upon death rather than the total amount of the estate. Laws of 1885, ch. 483. Under this legislation, the transmission of property subject to powers of appointment, either general or special, was attributed to the estate of the donor.

The administrative awkwardness incident to this treatment of appointive property led to an amendment whereby all property passing under powers of appointment was attributed to the do- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 530, 536]\n\u00a0\n nee, not to the donor. Laws of 1897, ch. 284. This was the New York law when Cornelius Vanderbilt died. In 1930, experience with the legacy tax in New York and elsewhere led to a shift in the basis for imposing death duties. Acting upon the results of an inquiry into the defects and inadequacies of a taxing system born of other times and calculated to meet different needs, New York in 1930 supplanted her system which taxed the individual legatee's privilege of succession by one which measured the levy by the size of the total estate. Laws of 1930, ch. 710. Under this legislation, property subject to a power of appointment-whether general or special-is included in the donor's gross estate. If the power is general, its later exercise sweeps the appointive property into the donee's gross estate also.\n As is apt to happen in extensive legislative readjustments dealing with complex problems, the effect of the change in 1930 upon some of the more specialized situations coming within the general policy was overlooked. Powers created between 1885 and 1897 had been taxable at the donor's death. Special powers created after 1897 and exercised before 1930 had been taxed at the donee's death. Powers created and exercised after 1930 were included in the donor's estate. But powers created after 1897 and not exercised before 1930 were outside the legislative framework. Thus an unintended immunity from the incidence of taxation had been given to special powers of appointment created after 1897 but not exercised before the passage of the 1930 legislation. When experience disclosed this omission, the Legislature removed it in 1932. The amendment of that year, which is copied in the margin,* included in the donee's gross \n\n[309 \nU.S. 530, 537]\n\u00a0\n estate appointive property which was not taxable at the donor's death but would have been taxable under the superseded statutory provision of 1897. It is under this amendment that New York has imposed the tax here assailed. This brings us to a consideration of appellants' claims.\n As against this attempt by the State to devise a harmonious taxing system, appellants urge that New York exacts an unjustifiably heavier estate tax from the beneficiaries of Mrs. Vanderbilt's unrestricted property because in the accounting of her estate property was included of which she was not the 'beneficial owner'. Attacking the 1932 Act from another point of view, they claim that New York had no authority to draw a taxing \n\n[309 \nU.S. 530, 538]\n\u00a0\n line between special powers created prior to 1930 and those established thereafter.\n Large concepts like 'property' and 'ownership' call for close analysis, especially when tax legislation is under scrutiny. Mrs. Vanderbilt, to be sure, had, in the conventional use of that term, no 'beneficial interest' in the property which she transferred through the exercise of her power of appointment. She could not, that is to say, use the corpus of the trust herself or appoint it to her estate; nor could she have applied it to her creditors. These qualifications upon Mrs. Vanderbilt's power over the appointive property had a significance during her lifetime which death transmuted. For when the end comes, the power that property gives, no matter how absolutely it may have been held, also comes to an end-except in so far as the power to determine its succession and enjoyment may be projected beyond the grave. But the exercise of this power is precisely the privilege which the state confers and upon which it seizes for the imposition of a tax. It is not the decedent's enjoyment of the property-the 'beneficial interest'-which is the occasion for the tax, nor even the acquisition of such enjoyment by the individual beneficiaries. Presumably the policy behind estate tax legislation like that of New York is the diversion to the purposes of the community of a portion of the total current of wealth released by death.\n In making this diversion, the state is not confined to that kind of wealth which was, in colloquial language, 'owned' by a decedent before death, nor even to that over which he had an unrestricted power of testamentary disposition. It is enough that one person acquires economic interests in property through the death of another person, even though such acquisition is in part the automatic consequence of death or related to the decedent merely because of his power to designate to whom and in \n\n[309 \nU.S. 530, 539]\n\u00a0\n what proportions among a restricted class the benefits shall fall.\n The books are replete with recognition of these general principles. Thus the full value of property may be taxed as part of a decedent's gross estate even though held by him merely as a tenant by the entirety, Tyler v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 497\n, 50 S.Ct. 356, 69 A.L.R. 758; likewise the full value of property in which the decedent was only a joint tenant may be taxed to his estate, United States v. Jacobs, \n306 \nU.S. 363\n, 59 S.Ct. 551. In neither of these instances was there an exact equation between the 'beneficial interest' owned by the decedent just before his death and that by which the tax was measured. Again, this Court found no difficulty in sustaining a tax on the transfer of property conveyed in trust by a decedent during his life, although he had divested himself of all beneficial interest in the corpus and had only reserved the power to change beneficiaries, excluding, however, himself and his estate from the range of choice. Porter v. Commissioner, \n288 \nU.S. 436\n, 53 S.Ct. 451. The attempt to differentiate the tie that binds these cases by treating the inter vivos transfers in these decisions as mere substitutions for testamentary dispositions, disregards the emphasis in these cases on the practical effect of death in bringing about a shift in economic interest, and the power of the legislature to fasten on that shift as the occasion for a tax. This broader base is emphasized, for instance, by the fact that in the Porter case the decedent had divested himself of all 'beneficial interest' in the trust property prior to the passage of the taxing act by which the trust was included in the value of his gross estate.\n A person may by his death bring into being greater interests in property than he himself has ever enjoyed, and the state may turn advantages thus realized into a source of revenue, as illustrated by earlier cases dealing \n\n[309 \nU.S. 530, 540]\n\u00a0\n with special powers of appointment that also came here from New York. Orr v. Gilman, \n183 \nU.S. 278\n, 22 S.Ct. 213; Chanler v. kelsey, \n205 \nU.S. 466\n, 27 S.Ct. 550. In these cases, to be sure, a legacy tax was assailed-a tax, that is, measured by the specific interests which the beneficiaries of the power received. Here, the grievance is asserted more particularly by those succeeding to Mrs. Vanderbilt's free property. But if death may be made the occasion for taxing property in which the decedent had no 'beneficial interest', then the measurement of that tax by the decedent's total wealth-disposing power is merely an exercise of legislative discretion in determining what the state shall take in return for allowing the transfer. The adoption of this measure may, of course, in the case of a graduated tax, burden individual beneficiaries beyond what they would bear if the same tax rate were applied to the value of the unrestricted property of the decedent and the property over which he had but a restricted control were excluded. There is nothing in the Fourteenth Amendment to prevent legislatures from devising death duties having this effect, nor to authorize courts to deny them the right to do so.\n The circumstances of the present case illustrate the practical considerations which may induce a legislature to treat restricted and unrestricted property as a taxing unit. The potential interests of the beneficiaries of Mrs. Vanderbilt's free property are intertwined with their interests in the appointive property. The dispositions which she was free to make under her power of appointment served to enhance her freedom with respect to her own property. How Mrs. Vanderbilt would have distributed her individual property if she had possessed no control over that left by her husband is speculative. But it is certainly within the area of legislative judgment to assume that special powers of appointment are ordinarily designed for ends similar to those in the present case- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 530, 541]\n\u00a0\n namely, to enlarge the donee's range of bounty, however narrowly restricted the enlargement may be, to a circle of beneficiaries closely related to, if not identical with, those whom the donee would be naturally disposed to favor. To the extent that this is true, there is compensation for those who may succeed to the donee's individual property, and who must pay a larger tax, because the appointive property is included in the gross estate. The legislature can hardly particularize the instances and draw up a tariff of compensations, and it is certainly not the province of courts to make the attempt. It suffices that the legislature has seen fit to frame a general enactment drawn on lines not offensive to experience and aimed at curing a revealed inequality in the state's taxing system.\n Appellants vainly seek to draw strength from Schlesinger v. Wisconsin, \n270 \nU.S. 230\n, 46 S.Ct. 260, 43 A.L.R. 1224; Hoeper v. Tax Commission, \n284 \nU.S. 206\n, 52 S.Ct. 120, 78 A.L.R. 346; and Heiner v. Donnan, \n285 \nU.S. 312\n, 52 S.Ct. 358. The differences of opinion to which these cases gave rise are not here relevant.\n But there remains the claim of appellants that in drawing the line between special powers created before 1930 and those having a later origin, New York ran afoul of the Equal Protection Clause. The brief summary we have given of the history of this legislation seems a sufficient answer to the charge of proscribed discrimination. To have continued the complete immunity from taxation which the 1930 legislation had unintentionally conferred upon special powers of appointment created before its passage was deemed by New York to have resulted in substantial inequality. The correction of such inequality is not a denial of the equality commanded by the Fourteenth Amendment. In the age-old but increasingly difficult task of tapping new sources of revenue, nothing may more legitimately attract the attention of financial statesmen than opportunities to reach property which has \n\n[309 \nU.S. 530, 542]\n\u00a0\n enjoyed immunity from tax burdens borne by others similarly situated. Watson v. State Comptroller, \n254 \nU.S. 122\n, 41 S.Ct. 43; Welch v. Henry, \n305 \nU.S. 134\n, 59 S.Ct. 121, 118 A.L.R. 1142\n\n\n Acceptance of Binney v. Long, \n299 \nU.S. 280\n, 57 S.Ct. 206, would not constrain us to hold differently. In the circumstances confronting the New York Legislature, as the Court of Appeals pointed out, the discrimination affecting special powers was not based upon what was deemed in the Binney case to be a date 'arbitrarily selected but is a logical solution by the Legislature of a problem which it was required to meet'. In re Vanderbilt's Estate, 281 N.Y. 297, at page 317, 22 N.E.2d 379, 391. All special powers, whether created before or after 1930, are taxed in New York. In one case, they are taxed to the donor's estate; in the other-since the same treatment would be manifestly impracticable-to the donee's. Differences in circumstances beget appropriate differences in law. The Equal Protection Clause was not designed to compel uniformity in the face of difference. Madden, Jr. v. Kentucky, \n309 \nU.S. 83\n, 60 S.Ct. 406, 84 L.Ed. --, 125 A.L.R. 1383.\n The judgment below is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS is of opinion that the instant case is indistinguishable in principle from Binney v. Long, \n299 \nU.S. 280\n, 57 S.Ct. 206, and that, accordingly, the judgment should be reversed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS did not participate in the decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] The amendment provided that there should be included in the decedent's gross estate interests of which the following was part of the enumeration of defined categories:\n'7-a. To the extent of any property passing under a power of appointment exercised by the decedent (a) by will, or (b) by deed executed in contemplation of, or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after, his death, except in case of a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth ... provided that the transfer of such property is not or was not subject to a death tax in the estate of the grantor of such power but would have been so taxable except for a statute providing that the tax on the transfer of such property should be imposed in the estate of the grantee of such power in the event of the exercise thereof.' \n\n The legislative history of this measure was thus summarized in the opinion of Surrogate Foley: 'An explanatory memorandum of the State Tax Commission prepared at the time of the drafting and introduction of the legislative bill has been submitted to the surrogate by consent of the parties. It is illuminative of the reasons which led to the enactment of new subdivision 7-a. The State Tax Commission pointed out that the existing law in 1932, prior to the enactment of the subdivision, permitted the fund to escape taxation in both the estate of the grantor and the estate of the grantee of the power. It was stated in reference to the measure: 'This bill provides that property transferred by the exercise of a special or limited power of appointment shall be included in the decedent's gross estate for the purpose of the present estate tax in the event that it is not taxable or has not been taxed in the estate of the grantor of the power and thus insures that one death tax will be imposed upon such property.\" Matter of Vanderbilt's Estate, 163 Misc., 667, 676, 297 N.Y.S. 554, 565. \n\n\n\n\n","150":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWILSON & CO. v.

Between November 5, 1933, and \n\n[311 \nU.S. 104, 105]\n\u00a0\n January 6, 1936, they exported to foreign countries large quantities of hog products with respect to which they paid processing taxes under Section 9(a) and floor stock taxes under Section 16(a) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, 48 Stat. 31, 35, 40, 7 U.S.C.A.  609(a), 616(a). Subsequent to exportation petitioners filed claims for refunds under Section 17(a). 48 Stat. 31, 40, 7 U.S.C.A.  617(a). The Commissioner of Internal Revenue denied all of the claims and suit in the Court of Claims followed. The United States thereupon moved to dismiss the petitions on the ground that the Court of Claims was without jurisdiction because of certain provisions of Title VII of the Revenue Act of 1936, 49 Stat. 1648, 1747-1755, 7 U.S.C.A.  644 et seq. The Court of Claims dismissed the actions for want of jurisdiction, on the ground, however, that Section 601( e) of Title IV of the Revenue Act of 1936, 49 Stat. 1648, 1740, 7 U.S.C.A .  641(e), prevented judicial review of the Commissioner's action. 30 F. Supp. 672. To resolve the conflict with Cudahy Bros. Co. v. LaBudde, 7 Cir ., 92 F.2d 937, and Neuss, Hesslein & Co., Inc., v. United States, D.C., 30 F.Supp. 595, we granted certiorari. \n309 \nU.S. 651\n, 60 S.Ct. 888, 84 L.Ed . --.\n The single question presented is whether the Court of Claims was without jurisdiction of petitioners' suits. We hold that it was.\n Title VII conditions payment of refunds upon proof that the claimant actually bore the burden of the tax sought to be refunded or that he unconditionally repaid it to his vendee who bore the burden. Since petitioners do not allege satisfaction of these conditions it is plain that they do not claim under Title VII. Indeed, they disown any attempt to bring their claims within its provisions.\n Title IV, 7 U.S.C.A.  616, 641-643, provides for refunds to exporters of products upon which processing or floor stock taxes have been paid. It is true that Section 17(a) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act provided for these refunds before the Act was held unconstitutional in United States v. Butler, \n297 \nU.S. 1\n, 56 S.Ct. 312, 102 A.L.R. 914. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 104, 106]\n\u00a0\n Whether petitioners could still establish refund claims under that section if the act had never been invalidated is a question we need not consider. For whatever the effect of that decision on Section 17(a), Congress expressly made it a part of Title IV by reenacting it in Section 601(a), 49 Stat. 1648, 1739.1 It follows that petitioners' claims, purportedly based on Section 17(a), must be governed by Title IV and the limitations it imposes.\n Section 601(e) of Title IV provides:\n'The determination of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue with respect to any refund under this section shall be final and no court shall have jurisdiction to review such determination.'\n\n Petitioners contend that Congress intended to commit to the final determination of the Commissioner only 'such matters as findings of fact, computations, and the like'. Quite apart from the fact that in Section 601( d) 2 Congress uses virtually the quoted words in limiting review by administrative officers, we fail to see how the argument can aid petitioners here because the record does not show why their claims were denied. Since the record is silent on this point, such decisions as United States v. Williams, \n278 \nU.S. 255\n, 49 S.Ct. 97, and Silberschein v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 221\n, 45 S.Ct. 69, are plainly distinguishable.\n We hold that upon this record the determination of the Commissioner is final.

Union Central Life Ins. Co., \n304 \nU.S. 502\n, 58 S.Ct. 1025. As revealed in that case, the debtor is a farmer who filed a petition under  75 of the Bankruptcy Act and later amended it under  75, sub. s, asking to be adjudged a bankrupt. \n1\n This Court held that the 200 acre tract was subject to the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court and that  75, sub. n, extending the period of redemption was constitutional. The present record does not disclose all that has transpired in this proceeding. For example, it does not appear whether the debtor asked for an appraisal under  75, sub. s, which it is the duty of the court to make on such request and in which event the three-year stay provided for in  75, sub. s(2), may start to run only after such appraisal has been made. John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Bartels, \n308 \nU.S. 180\n, 60 S.Ct. 221; Borchard v. California Bank, \n310 \nU.S. 311\n, 60 S.Ct. 957. But such problem is not sharply presented by the record before us. The narrow issue presented by this petition for certiorari and which moved us to grant it is whether under  75, sub. s(3), the debtor must be accorded \n\n[311 \nU.S. 273, 276]\n\u00a0\n an opportunity on his request, to redeem the property at the reappraised value or at a value fixed by the court before the court may order a public sale.\n On July 22, 1938, respondent filed a petition praying that the proceeding be dismissed or, in the alternative, that an immediate sale be had, and alleging, inter alia, that the debtor's financial condition was beyond all reasonable hope of rehabilitation, that he had failed to comply with the order of the court requiring two-fifths of the crops to be delivered to the trustee, that he had made no offer of composition, and that he had failed to pay taxes and insurance and had made no payment on principal since 1925 and none on interest since 1930. The debtor's motion to dismiss the petition was denied. On October 5, 1938, the debtor filed both an answer to the petition, and a cross petition under  75, sub. s(3), to have the land appraised or a date set for hearing and after hearing evidence to have its value fixed, to be allowed to redeem at that value, and to be discharged from liability on account of any deficiency. Respondent answered alleging that the debtor was not entitled to redeem at such value and that by the terms of  75, sub. s(3), its request for a sale took precedence over any such right of the debtor. The court held a hearing at which evidence was adduced. It found, inter alia, that the amount owed by the debtor to respondent was $15,903.68, that the value of the property was $6,000, that there was no evidence upon which might be based a reasonable hope or expectation of the debtor's financial rehabilitation, that there was no evidence of his ability to effect a refinancing of the property at that value, and that he had failed and refused to obey orders of the court. Accordingly it ordered that the property be sold 'at public sale to the highest bidder and for cash, without any relief whatever from valuation and appraisement laws'; that respondent be allowed to purchase at the sale \n\n[311 \nU.S. 273, 277]\n\u00a0\n and to 'utilize and be given credit for all or any part of the indebtedness of (the) debtor'; and that the debtor be barred from all equity of redemption in the property if it be not redeemed by him 'within the time and in the manner allowed and provided' by  75, sub.  (3).2 On appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals that order was affirmed, (In re Wright, 7 Cir., 108 F.2d 361), the court stating that the facts not only authorized the entry of the order but made such action imperative. We granted certiorari because of the importance of the problem to the orderly administration of the Act. \n310 \nU.S. 618\n, 60 S.Ct. 1078.\n We think that the denial of an opportunity for the debtor to redeem at the value fixed by the court before ordering a public sale was error.\n The provision in  75, sub.  (3), that at the end of three years, or prior thereto, the debtor may pay into court the amount of the appraisal of the property, is followed by two provisos. \n3\n The first states that 'upon request of \n\n[311 \nU.S. 273, 278]\n\u00a0\n any secured or unsecured creditor, or upon request of the debtor, the court shall cause a reappraisal of the debtor's property, or in its discretion set a date for hearing, and after such hearing, fix the value of the property, ... and the debtor shall then pay the value so arrived at into court ....' The second provides that 'upon request in writing by any secured creditor or creditors, the court shall order the property upon which such secured creditors have a lien to be sold at public auction.'\n True, the granting of a request for a public sale is mandatory. But so is the granting of a request for a valuation at which the debtor may redeem. Yet a reconciliation of these seemingly inconsistent remedies is not difficult if the purpose and function of the Act are not obscured. This Act provided a procedure to ffectuate a broad program of rehabilitation of distressed farmers faced with the disaster of forced sales and an oppressive burden of debt. Wright v. Union Central Life Ins. Co., supra; John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Bartels, supra; Kalb v. Feuerstein, \n308 \nU.S. 433\n, 60 S.Ct. 343. Safeguards were provided to protect the rights of secured creditors, throughout the proceedings, to the extent of the value of the property. John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Bartels, supra, 308 U.S. at pages 186, 187, 60 S. Ct. at page 224; Borchard v. California Bank, supra, 310 U.S. at page 317, 60 S.Ct. at page 960. There is no constitutional claim of the creditor to more than that. And so long as that right is protected the creditor certainly is in no position to insist that doubts or ambiguities in the \n\n[311 \nU.S. 273, 279]\n\u00a0\n Act be resolved in its favor and against the debtor. Rather, the Act must be liberally construed to give the debtor the full measure of the relief afforded by Congress (John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Bartels, supra; Kalb v. Feuerstein, supra), lest its benefits be frittered away by narrow formalistic interpretations which disregard the spirit and the letter of the Act.\n Equal protection to debtor and creditor alike can be afforded only by holding that the debtor's request for redemption pursuant to the procedure prescribed in the first proviso of  75, sub.  (3), cannot be defeated by a request of a secured creditor for a public sale under the second proviso. Certainly equal protection of debtor and creditor would not be obtained if the contrary view were followed. Then the debtor's rights under the first proviso would be either dependent on the outcome of his race of diligence with a creditor, for which customarily he would be poorly equipped (Cf. Kalb v. Feuerstein, supra); or they would be defeasible at the instance of a creditor. Under our construction, however, the debtor will be given the benefit of an express mandate of the Act. And the creditor will not be deprived of the assurance that the value of the property will be devoted to the payment of its claim. For, as indicated in Wright v. Vinton Branch of Mountain Trust Bank, \n300 \nU.S. 440, 468\n, 57 S.Ct. 556, 564, 112 A.L.R. 1455, if the debtor did redeem pursuant to that procedure, he would not get the property at less than its actual value. In that case this Court, in sustaining the constitutionality of  75, sub. s, emphasized that the Act preserved the right of the mortgagee to realize upon the security by a judicial sale. By our construction the exercise of this right is merely deferred or postponed until the other conditions and requirements of the Act, prescribed for the protection of the debtor, have been met. It is eventually denied the creditor only in case he is paid the full amount of what he can constitutionally claim. \n\n[311 \nU.S. 273, 280]\n\u00a0\n Respondent, however, places great reliance on that part of  75 sub .  (3), which provides that if the debtor 'at any time fails to comply with the provisions of this section, or with any orders of the court made pursuant to this section, or is unable to refinance himself within three years, the court may order the appointment of a trustee, and order the property sold or otherwise disposed of as provided for in this Act (title).' This provision is somewhat ambiguous. And no significant light is thrown on its meaning by the Committee Reports. \n4\n To be sure it was relied on by this Court in Wright v. Vinton Branch, supra, 300 U.S. pages 460-462, 57 S. Ct. pages 560, 561, 112 A.L.R. 1455, for the conclusion that the three-year stay provided for in  75, sub.  (2), is not an 'absolute one' but that 'the court may terminate the stay and order a sale earlier.' 300 U.S. page 461, 57 S.Ct. page 561, 112 A.L.R. 1455. But there is nothing in that opinion or in the Act which says that that power of the court may be utilized so as to wipe out the clear and express right of the debtor under  75, sub.  (3), to redeem at the reappraised value or at the value fixed by the court. Nor can the existence of that power be fairly implied. The power of the court to 'order the property sold or otherwise disposed of as provided for in this Act (title)' cannot be taken to mean a discretionary power to terminate the proceedings through the exclusive device of a public sale. Congress has provided that certain contumacious conduct on the part of the debtor or his inability to refinance himself within three years may be an appropriate basis for a termination of the proceedings or for an acceleration thereof. We cannot infer, however, that Congress intended that such facts should have any further legal significance under the Act. To hold that they empowered the court to deprive the debtor of his express and fundamental statutory right to redeem \n\n[311 \nU.S. 273, 281]\n\u00a0\n at the reappraised value or at the value fixed by the court would be to imply a power of forfeiture wholly incompatible with the broad design of the Act to aid and protect farmer-debtors who were victims of the general economic depression. Wright v. Vinton Branch, supra, 300 U.S. page 466, 57 S.Ct. page 563, 112 A.L.R. 1455. Such an important remedial right cannot be lost by mere implication. And to hold that the court has the discretion to deny or to grant the debtor's right to redeem at the reappraised value or at the value fixed by the court, dependent on general equitable considerations, would be to rewrite the Act, so as to vest in the court a power which Congress did not plainly delegate. This discretionary power of the court is exhausted when the court terminates the proceedings or accelerates their termination. Such termination can be effected only pursuant to the precise procedure which Congress has provided. And so we return to our reconciliation of the two apparently conflicting provisos of  75, sub.  (3).\n We hold that the debtor's cross petition should have been granted; that he was entitled to have the property reappraised or the value fixed at a hearing; that the value having been determined at a hearing in conformity with his request, he was then entitled to have a reasonable time, fixed by the court, in which to redeem at that value; and that if he did so redeem, the land should be turned over to him free and clear of encumbrances and his discharge granted. Only in case the debtor failed to redeem within a reasonable time would the court be authorized to order a public sale.\n Some question has been raised as to the propriety of certain provisions of the public sale order, particularly those which give the creditor the right to utilize all of its indebtedness in bidding for the property.\n The majority of the Court is of opinion that except for the modification we have indicated the order for sale should stand with the privilege of the respondent mort- \n\n[311 \nU.S. 273, 282]\n\u00a0\n gagee to purchase at the sale and to receive credit for the indebtedness of the debtor in satisfaction of the purchase price and with the privilege of the debtor to redeem within ninety days upon payment of the sales price and interest thereon, as provided by  75, sub.  (3), of the Act.\n To the extent indicated, we modify the judgment; and we remand the cause to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. It is so ordered.\n Modified and remanded. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of March 3, 1933, c. 204, 47 Stat. 1467, 1470; Act of June 28, 1934, c. 869, 48 Stat. 1289; Act of August 28, 1935, c. 792, 49 Stat. 942, 943.

CO.(1940)\nNo. 156\nArgued: Decided: January 29, 1940\n\n\n\n\n[309 \nU.S. 18, 19]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Robert Van Pelt and Ernest B. Perry, both of Lincoln, Neb. for petitioner.\n Mr. Clay C. Rogers, of Kansas City, Mo., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In this action, brought in the state court of Nebraska and removed to the federal court, petitioners sought to recover damages upon the ground that the respondent company had built dikes in the Missouri River and, using large boats with paddles and pumps to produce artificial erosion, had washed away a part of petitioners' land. Respondent alleged in defense that the work was done pursuant to a contract with the United States Government, and under the direction of the Secretary of War and the supervision of the Chief of Engineers of the United States, for the purpose of improving the navigation of the Missouri River, as authorized by an Act of Congress. Petitioners in reply alleged that the contract did not contemplate the taking of their land without just \n\n[309 \nU.S. 18, 20]\n\u00a0\n compensation and that the acts of the contractor resulted in the destruction of petitioners' property in violation of their rights under the Fifth Amendment of the Federal Constitution, U.S.C.A.\n Petitioners had judgment which the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. 8 Cir., 103 F.2d 589. Certiorari was granted because of alleged conflict with applicable decisions of this Court. October 9, 1939. \n308 \nU.S. 538\n, 60 S.Ct. 89, 84 L.Ed. --. The Government has been permitted to appear as amicus curiae.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals found that the evidence established 'that two dikes built in the river above, and one dike built opposite, their (petitioners') land had diverted the channel or the current of the river from the Iowa shore to the Nebraska shore' and that as a result the 'accretion land' of petitioners 'to the extent of perhaps 95 acres had been eroded and carried away'. (103 F.2d 591.) There was evidence tending to show that in extending the dike opposite petitioners' land, the contractor, 'apparently to keep open an adequate channel for navigation between the end of the dike and the shore', had accelerated the erosion 'by using the paddle wheels of its steamboats to increase the action of the current'. But there was no evidence, as the Court of Appeals said, that this 'paddle washing' had done 'anything more than hasten the inevitable'. The Court of Appeals also found it to be undisputed 'that the work which the contractor had done in the river bed was all authorized and directed by the Government of the United States for the purpose of improving the navigation of this navigable river'. It is also conceded that the work thus authorized and directed by the governmental officers was performed pursuant to the Act of Congress of January 21, 1927, 44 Stat. 1010, 1013\n\n\n In that view, it is clear that if this authority to carry out the project was validly conferred, that is, if what was done was within the constitutional power of Congress, \n\n[309 \nU.S. 18, 21]\n\u00a0\n there is no liability on the part of the contractor for executing its will. See Den ex dem. Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Company, 18 How. 272, 283; Lamar v. Browne, \n92 \nU.S. 187\n, 199; The Paqueta Habana, \n189 \nU.S. 453, 465\n, 23 S.Ct. 593, 594. Where an agent or officer of the Government purporting to act on its behalf has been held to be liable for his conduct causing injury to another, the ground of liability has been found to be either that he exceeded his authority or that it was not validly conferred. Philadelphia Company v. Stimson, \n223 \nU.S. 605, 619\n, 620 S., 32 S.Ct. 340, 344. See United States v. Lee, \n106 \nU.S. 196, 220\n, 221 S., 1 S.Ct. 240, 260, 261; Noble v. Union River Logging R.R. Co., \n147 \nU.S. 165, 171\n, 172 S., 13 S.Ct. 271, 272, 273; Tindal v. Wesley, \n167 \nU.S. 204, 222\n, 17 S.Ct. 770, 777; Scranton v.

McAnnulty, \n187 \nU.S. 94, 108\n, 110 S., 23 S.Ct. 33, 38, 39.\n Petitioners present the question whether the building of the dikes and the erosion of their land, because of the consequent diversion of the current of the river, constituted a taking of their property for which compensation must be made. We do not find it necessary to pass upon that question, for if the authorized action in this instance does constitute a taking of property for which there must be just compensation under the Fifth Amendment, the Government has impliedly promised to pay that compensation and has afforded a remedy for its recovery by a suit in the Court of Claims. 28 U.S.C.  250, 28 U.S.C.A.  250. United States v. Great Falls Manufacturing Co., \n112 \nU.S. 645, 656\n, 657 S., 5 S.Ct. 306, 310, 311; Great Falls Manufacturing Co. v. Garland, Attorney General, \n124 \nU.S. 581, 600\n, 8 S.Ct. 631, 638; United States v. Lynah, \n188 \nU.S. 445, 465\n, 466 S., 23 S.Ct. 349, 355; Tempel v. United States, \n248 \nU.S. 121, 129\n, 130 S., 39 S.Ct. 56, 58, 59; Hurley v. Kincaid, \n285 \nU.S. 95, 104\n, 105 S., 52 S.Ct. 267, 269. 'The Fifth Amendment does not entitle him (the owner) to be paid in advance of the taking' and the statute affords a plain and adequate remedy. Hurley v. Kincaid, supra. It follows that as the Government in such a case promises just compensation and provides a complete \n\n[309 \nU.S. 18, 22]\n\u00a0\n remedy, action which constitutes the taking of property is within its constitutional power and there is no ground for holding its agent liable who is simply acting under the authority thus validly conferred. The action of the agent is 'the act of the government'. United States v. Lynah, supra (\n188 \nU.S. 445\n, 23 S.Ct. 355).\n This principle has been applied under the statute providing compensation for the use by the Government of patented inventions without license of the owner. Act of June 25, 1910, 36 Stat. 851, c. 423, 35 U.S.C. A.  68. In Crozier v. Fried. Krupp, etc., \n224 \nU.S. 290, 305\n, 32 S.Ct. 488, 491, the Court said: 'The adoption by the United States of the wrongful act of an officer is, of course, an adoption of the act when and as committed, and causes such act of the officer to be, in virtue of the statute, a rightful appropriation by the government, for which compensation is provided'. In view of later decisions limiting the scope of that statute (Cramp & Sons Ship & Engine Bldg. Co. v. Curtis Turbine Co ., \n246 \nU.S. 28\n, 38 S.Ct. 271; Marconi Wireless Telegraph Co. v. Simon, \n246 \nU.S. 46\n, 38 S.Ct. 275), Congress amended the statute so as to insure complete compensation by the Government and thus it operated to relieve the contractor from liability of every kind 'for the infringement of patents in manufacturing anything for the government'. The provision for the recovery from the United States of 'entire' compensation 'emphasize(d) the exclusive and comprehensive character of the remedy provided'. Richmond Screw Anchor Co. v. United States, \n275 \nU.S. 331, 343\n, 48 S.Ct. 194, 196, 197.\n So, in the case of a taking by the Government of private property for public use such as petitioners allege here, it cannot be doubted that the remedy to obtain compensation from the Government is as comprehensive as the requirement of the Constitution, and hence it excludes liability of the Government's representatives lawfully acting on its behalf in relation to the taking.\n The Government contends that in this instance there has been no taking of petitioners' lands within the mean- \n\n[309 \nU.S. 18, 23]\n\u00a0\n ing of the Fifth Amendment. The Circuit Court of Appeals took that view, holding that petitioners had sustained merely 'consequential damages from the deflection of waters by reason of structures lawfully constructed in aid of navigation'. Petitioners, as we have said, combat this ruling. We do not undertake to review it or the authorities cited by the parties and the Government in that relation, for petitioners' claim, resting upon the theory that there has been a 'taking', has been found untenable, and there is no contention, or basis for one, that if the contractor was acting for the Government in prosecuting its work in aid of navigation without the taking of property, the contractor would be subject to the asserted liability.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals in reversing that of the District Court is affirmed but upon the grounds stated in this opinion.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n"}}
