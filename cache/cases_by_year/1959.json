Thereafter, because of the same conspiracy, they were indicted, tried and convicted in a Federal District Court for violating 18 U.S.C. 371 by conspiring to violate 18 U.S.C. 1362, which forbids the injury or destruction of communications facilities \"operated or controlled by the United States.\" Held: Their federal prosecution was not barred under the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment by their earlier conviction in the State Court. United States v. Lanza, \n260 \nU.S. 377\n. Pp. 187-196.\n\n 247 F.2d 410, affirmed.\n\nCharles A. Bellows argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioners.\n\nLeonard B. Sand argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Anderson, Beatrice Rosenberg and Carl H. Imlay.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nDuring a strike against the Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Company, the petitioners and one McLeod were solicited in Chicago, Illinois, by a union official, Shelby, to dynamite facilities of the telephone company located in the States of Mississippi, Tennessee, and Louisiana. The four men met in Chicago where Shelby gave the petitioners and McLeod the plans of the facilities to \n\n[359 \nU.S. 187, 188]\n\u00a0\n be dynamited and instructed them as to the method to be used. After Shelby left Chicago the petitioners told McLeod that they would not go through with the plan. McLeod, however, obtained dynamite and went to Mississippi to destroy telephone company facilities located there. The petitioners thereupon disclosed the plot to the telephone company and the Chicago police.\n\nThe petitioners, with Shelby and McLeod, were subsequently indicted by the State of Illinois for violating an Illinois statute making it a crime to conspire to injure or destroy the property of another.\n1\n The indictment describes the property as \"communication facilities belonging to the Southern Bell Telephone & Telegraph Company\" and \"belonging to the American Telephone and Telegraph Company.\" The petitioners entered pleas of guilty to the indictment and were each sentenced to three months' imprisonment.\n\nThereafter indictments were returned in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi against the petitioners and Shelby, and also against one Perry who pointed out to McLeod the property to be dynamited. This indictment does not refer to the facilities as belonging to the telephone companies, but charges the offense of violating 18 U.S.C. 371\n2\n by conspiring \n\n[359 \nU.S. 187, 189]\n\u00a0\n to destroy, contrary to 18 U.S.C. 1362,\n3\n \"certain works, property and material known as coaxial repeater stations and micro-wave towers . . . located in the States of Mississippi, Tennessee and Louisiana . . . which were essential and integral parts of systems and means of communication operated and controlled by the United States.\" McLeod confessed to his part in the conspiracy and testified on the federal trial to petitioners' acts of participation in the conspiracy. These same acts were the basis of the Illinois convictions. The Government also introduced proof that the Strategic Air Command, the Civil Aeronautics Administration, the Navy and other federal agencies have the exclusive use of some of the circuits within the coaxial cables carried by the repeater stations and micro-wave towers that were to be destroyed. The federal jury found the four defendants guilty as charged. On appeal the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the convictions of Shelby and Perry for error in the admission of evidence, but affirmed the convictions of the petitioners, 247 F.2d 410. We granted certiorari limited to consideration of the claim that the federal prosecutions, based on the same acts as were the prior state convictions, placed petitioners twice in jeopardy contrary to the Fifth Amendment, \n355 \nU.S. 902\n.\n\nIn Bartkus v. Illinois, ante, p. 121, also decided today, the order of the prosecutions was the reverse of the order in this case. Here the federal prosecution came after the Illinois convictions. Thus this case squarely raises the question whether a federal prosecution of defendants already prosecuted for the same acts by a State subjects \n\n[359 \nU.S. 187, 190]\n\u00a0\n those defendants \"for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb\" in violation of the Fifth Amendment.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nWe do not write on a clean slate in deciding this question. As early as 1820 in Houston v. Moore, 5 Wheat. 1, it was recognized that this issue would arise from the concurrent application of state and federal laws.\n5\n During the following three decades a number of state courts reached differing conclusions as to whether a state prosecution would bar a subsequent federal prosecution of the same person for the same acts.\n6\n Against this background this Court thoroughly considered the question in three cases between 1847 and 1852. In Fox v. Ohio, 5 How. 410, the petitioner had been convicted of passing a counterfeit coin of the United States within the State of Ohio in violation of a state statute. She contended that the Fifth Amendment prohibited successive state and federal prosecution for the same acts, and therefore that a prosecution under the Ohio statute would prevent federal authorities from prosecuting the same act under the federal counterfeiting laws. Thus, the argument continued, the Court should declare the Ohio statute unconstitutional under the \n\n[359 \nU.S. 187, 191]\n\u00a0\n Supremacy Clause in order to preserve the effectiveness of federal law enforcement. Houston v. Moore and some of the leading state authorities bearing on whether the Fifth Amendment applied to successive state and federal prosecutions were argued to the Court. All members of the Court agreed that the Fifth Amendment would not prohibit a federal prosecution even though based on the same act of passing the counterfeit coin that resulted in the state prosecution. There was a division, however, as to what disposition of the case was required by this conclusion. The majority reasoned that since the Ohio prosecution would not render the Federal Government powerless to enforce its counterfeit laws there was no basis for declaring the Ohio statute unconstitutional under the Supremacy Clause. Mr. Justice McLean, dissenting, thought that since \"the punishment under the State law would be no bar to a prosecution under the law of Congress,\" 5 How., at 439, this undesirable result should be avoided by declaring the state statute unconstitutional, for, he said, \"Nothing can be more repugnant . . . than two punishments for the same act,\" id., at 440. Three years later, in United States v. Marigold, 9 How. 560, a unanimous Court affirmed a conviction under the federal counterfeiting statute that was discussed in Fox. The Court, in holding that a state and a federal statute could both apply to the same conduct, accepted the conclusion of Fox that \"the same act might . . . constitute an offense against both the State and Federal governments, and might draw to its commission the penalties denounced by either . . . .\" 9 How., at 569.\n\nThe third case, Moore v. Illinois, 14 How. 13, gave clear expression to the emerging principle that the Fifth Amendment did not apply to a federal prosecution subsequent to a state prosecution of the same person for the same acts. That case involved a conviction of Moore \n\n[359 \nU.S. 187, 192]\n\u00a0\n under an Illinois statute for harboring an escaped slave. A federal statute outlawed the same act as an interference with the rights of the owner of the slave. Moore urged that the Illinois statute was void \"as it subjects the delinquent to a double punishment for a single offense,\" 14 How., at 19. The Court rejected this argument, saying:\n\n\"Every citizen of the United States is also a citizen of a State or territory. He may be said to owe allegiance to two sovereigns, and may be liable to punishment for an infraction of the laws of either. The same act may be an offence or transgression of the laws of both. . . . That either or both may (if they see fit) punish such an offender, cannot be doubted. Yet it cannot be truly averred that the offender has been twice punished for the same offence; but only that by one act he has committed two offences, for each of which he is justly punishable. He could not plead the punishment by one in bar to a conviction by the other; consequently, this court has decided, in the case of Fox v. The State of Ohio, . . . that a State may punish the offence of uttering or passing false coin, as a cheat or fraud practiced on its citizens; and, in the case of the United States v. Marigold. . . . that Congress, in the proper exercise of its authority, may punish the same act as an offence against the United States.\" 14 How., at 20.\n\n\n Justice McLean again dissented on the ground of his dissent in Fox, namely, that the state law should be declared invalid for the very reason that \"the conviction and punishment under the State law would be no bar to a prosecution under the law of Congress.\" Id., at 21.\n\nThe reasoning of the Court in these three cases was subsequently accepted by this Court, in dictum, in the following \n\n[359 \nU.S. 187, 193]\n\u00a0\n cases: United States v. Cruikshank, \n92 \nU.S. 542, 550\n; Coleman v. Tennessee, \n97 \nU.S. 509, 518\n; Ex parte Siebold, \n100 \nU.S. 371, 389\n; United States v. Arjona, \n120 \nU.S. 479, 487\n; Cross v. North Carolina, \n132 \nU.S. 131, 139\n; In re Loney, \n134 \nU.S. 372, 375\n; Pettibone v. United States, \n148 \nU.S. 197, 209\n; Crossley v. California, \n168 \nU.S. 640, 641\n; Sexton v. California, \n189 \nU.S. 319, 322\n-323; Matter of Heff, \n197 \nU.S. 488, 507\n; Grafton v. United States, \n206 \nU.S. 333, 353\n-354; Southern R. Co. v. Railroad Comm'n of Indiana, \n236 \nU.S. 439, 445\n; and McKelvey v. United States, \n260 \nU.S. 353, 358\n-359. Typical of the statements adopting the principle is that of Chief Justice Taney, on circuit, in United States v. Amy, 24 Fed. Cas. No. 14,445 (C. C. D. Va. 1859), at p. 811, that \"from the nature of our government, the same act may be an offence against the laws of the United States and also of a state, and be punishable in both.\"\n\nCulminating this development was United States v. Lanza, \n260 \nU.S. 377\n, where the issue was directly presented to this Court. Lanza was convicted by the State of Washington for \"manufacturing, transporting, and having in possession\" a quantity of liquor in violation of a state statute. He was subsequently convicted in a Federal District Court of violating the Volstead Act, 41 Stat. 305, for performing the same acts with regard to the same liquor. The Court held that the prior state conviction did not bar the federal prosecution. It pointed out that the State could constitutionally make Lanza's acts criminal under its original powers reserved by the Tenth Amendment, and the Federal Government could constitutionally prohibit the acts under the Eighteenth Amendment. Thus this case presented the situation hypothesized in Fox v. Ohio and other early cases; two sovereigns had, within their constitutional authority, prohibited the same acts, and each was punishing a breach of its prohibition. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 187, 194]\n\u00a0\n A unanimous Court, in an opinion by Chief Justice Taft, held:\n\n  \"We have here two sovereignties, deriving power from different sources, capable of dealing with the same subject-matter within the same territory. . . . Each government in determining what shall be an offense against its peace and dignity is exercising its own sovereignty, not that of the other.\n\n\n \"It follows that an act denounced as a crime by both national and state sovereignties is an offense against the peace and dignity of both and may be punished by each. The Fifth Amendment, like all the other guaranties in the first eight amendments, applies only to proceedings by the Federal Government, . . . and the double jeopardy therein forbidden is a second prosecution under authority of the Federal Government after a first trial for the same offense under the same authority.\" \n260 \nU.S., at 382\n.\n\n\n The Lanza principle has been accepted without question in Hebert v. Louisiana, \n272 \nU.S. 312\n, also a Volstead Act case, and in the following cases in this Court arising under other statutes: Westfall v. United States, \n274 \nU.S. 256, 258\n; Puerto Rico v. The Shell Co., \n302 \nU.S. 253, 264\n-266; Jerome v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 101, 105\n; Screws v. United States, \n325 \nU.S. 91, 108\n. And see California v. Zook, \n336 \nU.S. 725, 752\n-753, 758 (dissenting opinion). Similarly, Lanza has been considered in many cases in the Courts of Appeals to have established the general principle that a federal prosecution is not barred by a prior state prosecution of the same person for the same acts.\n7\n\u00a0\n\n[359 \nU.S. 187, 195]\n\u00a0\n\n\nPetitioner asks us to overrule Lanza. We decline to do so. No consideration or persuasive reason not presented to the Court in the prior cases is advanced why we should depart from its firmly established principle. On the contrary, undesirable consequences would follow if Lanza were overruled. The basic dilemma was recognized over a century ago in Fox v. Ohio. As was there pointed out, if the States are free to prosecute criminal acts violating their laws, and the resultant state prosecutions bar federal prosecutions based on the same acts, federal law enforcement must necessarily be hindered. For example, the petitioners in this case insist that their Illinois convictions resulting in three months' prison sentences should bar this federal prosecution which could result in a sentence of up to five years. Such a disparity will very often arise when, as in this case, the defendants' acts impinge more seriously on a federal interest than on a state interest. But no one would suggest that, in order to maintain the effectiveness of federal law enforcement, it is desirable completely to displace state power to prosecute crimes based on acts which might also violate federal law. This would bring about a marked change in the distribution of powers to administer criminal justice, for the States under our federal system have the principal responsibility for defining and prosecuting crimes. See Screws v. United States, \n325 \nU.S. 91, 109\n; Jerome v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 101, 104\n-105. Thus, unless the federal authorities could somehow insure that there would be no state prosecutions for particular acts that also constitute federal offenses, the efficiency of federal law enforcement must suffer if the Double Jeopardy Clause prevents successive state and federal prosecutions. Needless to say, it would be highly impractical for the federal authorities to attempt to keep informed of all state prosecutions which might bear on federal offenses. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 187, 196]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe conclusion is therefore compelled that the prior Illinois conviction of the petitioners did not bar the instant federal prosecution.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 38 Smith-Hurd Ill. Stat. Ann. (1957 Supp.) 139 provides in pertinent part: \"If any two or more persons conspire or agree together . . . with the fraudulent or malicious intent wrongfully and wickedly to injure the . . . property of another . . . they shall be deemed guilty of a conspiracy . . . .\" The statute applies to conspiracies within Illinois to destroy property outside the State. See People v. Buckminster, 282 Ill. 177, 118 N. E. 497.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 18 U.S.C. 371 provides in pertinent part: \"If two or more persons conspire . . . to commit any offense against the United States . . . and one or more of such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The relevant part of 18 U.S.C. 1362 is as follows: \"Whoever willfully or maliciously injures or destroys any of the . . . property . . . of any . . . telephone, or cable, line, station, or system, or other means of communication, operated or controlled by the United States . . . .\" is guilty of a crime.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides: \"nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb . . . .\" The circumstances of this case do not require us to consider the suggestion in the Government's brief that \"no state prosecution can preclude the federal government from enforcing federal law.\" For example, there is nothing in this record to indicate any federal participation in the Illinois prosecution.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Justice Johnson, in another case at the same Term, recognized the related problem of the scope to be given the plea of autrefois acquit when based on an acquittal by the courts of another country. United States v. Furlong, 5 Wheat. 184, 197.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Compare, e. g., Mattison v. State, 3 Mo. *421, and Hendrick v. Commonwealth, 5 Leigh (Va) 707, with e. g., State v. Randall, 2 Aikens (Vt.) 89, and Harlan v. People, 1 Douglass' Rep. (Mich.) 207.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] See, e. g., Rios v. United States, 256 F.2d 173 (C. A. 9th Cir. 1958); Smith v. United States, 243 F.2d 877 (C. A. 6th Cir. 1957); Jolley v. United States, 232 F.2d 83 (C. A. 5th Cir. 1956); United States v. Levine, 129 F.2d 745 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1942).\n\nBy MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN.\n\nThe Government, in its brief and on oral argument in this case, urged that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed on an alternative ground to that upon which the Court rests the decision. The Government argued that it was unnecessary to delimit the application of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to successive state and federal prosecutions of the same acts beyond holding that the clause does not apply when those prosecutions, as in this case, are under statutes which require different evidence for a conviction and which protect different interests. The contention is that in this case additional evidence is necessary to convict under the federal statute, namely, proof that federal property was knowingly to be destroyed, and that the two statutes are designed to protect different interests, the state statute to protect \"the sanctity of privately-owned property\" and the federal statute to prevent injury to \"means of communication, operated or controlled by the United States.\" The gist of the argument is that two prosecutions are not \"for the same offense\" within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment when they are based upon the violation of two statutes designed to vindicate different governmental interests and requiring different evidence to support convictions. Although the Court considered that it was unnecessary to discuss this suggested ground for decision, I consider its implications to be so disturbing as to require comment.\n1\n I cannot escape \n\n[359 \nU.S. 187, 197]\n\u00a0\n the fact that this reasoning would apply equally if each of two successive federal prosecutions based on the same acts was brought under a different federal statute, and each statute was designed to protect a different federal interest. Indeed, the Government supports its argument by citing Blockburger v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 299\n; Gore v. United States, \n357 \nU.S. 386\n; and Pinkerton v. United States, \n328 \nU.S. 640\n, cases which involved only federal prosecutions, and Hoag v. New Jersey, \n356 \nU.S. 464\n, which involved successive prosecutions by the same State. The argument then obviously is that the mere fact that there are two statutes which vindicate different interests and require different evidence of itself means that the Fifth Amendment does not prohibit successive prosecutions of the same acts under the respective statutes.\n\nHowever, whatever the case under the Fourteenth Amendment as to successive state prosecutions, Hoag v. New Jersey, supra, or under the Fifth Amendment as to consecutive federal sentences imposed upon one trial, e. g., Gore v. United States, supra, I think it clear that successive federal prosecutions of the same person based on the same acts are prohibited by the Fifth Amendment even though brought under federal statutes requiring different evidence and protecting different federal interests. It is true that this Court has said: \"where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\" Blockburger v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 299, 304\n. But, so far as appears, neither this \"same evidence\" \n\n[359 \nU.S. 187, 198]\n\u00a0\n test nor a \"separate interests\" test has been sanctioned by this Court under the Fifth Amendment except in cases in which consecutive sentences were imposed on conviction of several offenses at one trial.\n2\n The accused, although punished separately and cumulatively for various aspects of a single transaction, is subject to only one prosecution and one trial. If the Government attempted multiple prosecutions of the same offenses, an entirely different constitutional issue would be presented, cf. Hoag v. New Jersey, \n356 \nU.S., at 467\n. The basis of the Fifth Amendment protection against double jeopardy is that a person shall not be harassed by successive trials; that an accused shall not have to marshal \n\n[359 \nU.S. 187, 199]\n\u00a0\n the resources and energies necessary for his defense more than once for the same alleged criminal acts. \"The underlying idea . . . is that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity . . . .\" Green v. United States, \n355 \nU.S. 184, 187\n. In short, \"The prohibition is not against being twice punished, but against being twice put in jeopardy. . . .\" United States v. Ball, \n163 \nU.S. 662, 669\n.\n\nObviously separate prosecutions of the same criminal conduct can be far more effectively used by a prosecutor to harass an accused than can the imposition of consecutive sentences for various aspects of that conduct. It is always within the discretion of the trial judge whether to impose consecutive or concurrent sentences, whereas, unless the Fifth Amendment applies, it would be solely within the prosecutor's discretion to bring successive prosecutions based on the same acts, thereby requiring the accused to defend himself more than once. Furthermore, separate prosecutions, unlike multiple punishments based on one trial, raise the possibility of an accused acquitted by one jury being subsequently convicted by another for essentially the same conduct.\n3\n See Hoag v. New Jersey, supra; cf. Ciucci v. Illinois, \n356 \nU.S. 571\n. Thus to permit \n\n[359 \nU.S. 187, 200]\n\u00a0\n the Government statutorily to multiply the number of offenses resulting from the same acts, and to allow successive prosecutions of the several offenses, rather than merely the imposition of consecutive sentences after one trial of those offenses, would enable the Government to \"wear the accused out by a multitude of cases with accumulated trials.\" Palko v. Connecticut, \n302 \nU.S. 319, 328\n. Repetitive harassment in such a manner goes to the heart of the Fifth Amendment protection.\n4\n This protection cannot be thwarted either by the \"same evidence\" test or because the conduct offends different federal statutes protecting different federal interests. The prime consideration is the protection of the accused from the harassment of successive prosecutions, and not the justification for or policy behind the statutes violated by the accused. If the same acts violate different federal statutes protecting separate federal interests those interests can be adequately protected at a single trial by the imposition of separate sentences for each statute violated. See, e. g., Bell v. United States, \n349 \nU.S. 81, 82\n-83; Gore v. United States, \n357 \nU.S. 386\n. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 187, 201]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe holding of the Court in In re Nielsen, \n131 \nU.S. 176\n, establishes the governing principle. The defendant in that case, a Mormon with more than one wife, had been convicted of violating a congressional statute, applicable to the territory of Utah, which prohibited males from cohabiting with more than one woman. Subsequently he was prosecuted and convicted of adultery in violation of another congressional statute, the second prosecution being based on the same acts as the prior conviction. Despite the fact that it was necessary to prove a fact in the second prosecution not necessary for the first conviction, i. e., that the defendant was married to another woman, and that a different federal interest was protected by each statute, the Court held that the second prosecution unconstitutionally put the defendant twice in jeopardy for the same offense.\n\nIn short, though the Court in Gore has found no violence to the guarantee against double jeopardy when the same acts are made to do service for several convictions at one trial, I think not mere violence to, but virtual extinction of, the guarantee results if the Federal Government may try people over and over again for the same criminal conduct just because each trial is based on a different federal statute protecting a separate federal interest.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"It cannot be suggested that in cases where the author is the mere instrument of the Court he must forego expression of his own convictions.\" \n\n[359 \nU.S. 187, 197]\n\u00a0\n Wheeling Steel Corp. v. Glander, \n337 \nU.S. 562, 576\n (separate opinion). See also Helvering v. Davis, \n301 \nU.S. 619, 639\n 640.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Gavieres v. United States, \n220 \nU.S. 338\n, upheld a prosecution for insulting a public officer despite a prior prosecution for indecent behavior in public based on essentially the same acts. However, that decision was an interpretation of a congressional statute against double jeopardy applicable to the Philippine Islands, a territory \"with long-established legal procedures that were alien to the common law.\" Green v. United States, \n355 \nU.S. 184, 197\n. It has not been considered an authoritative interpretation of the constitutional provision. Green v. United States, supra; see Hoag v. New Jersey, \n356 \nU.S. 464, 478\n, n. 3 (dissenting opinion). Flemister v. United States, \n207 \nU.S. 372\n, decided under the same statute, involved two prosecutions of two different assaults on two police officers at two different times, although in \"one continuing attempt to defy the law.\" Burton v. United States, \n202 \nU.S. 344\n, was decided on a demurrer, the Court holding that the pleadings did not necessarily show that a count in a second indictment alleging the receipt of a bribe from a corporation charged the same offense as a count in a prior indictment alleging the receipt of a bribe from a named person who was an officer of the corporation. In United States v. Adams, \n281 \nU.S. 202\n, the defendant had attempted to conceal an embezzlement by making false entries in bank books and, at a later date, by falsifying a report. A federal statute prohibited both such falsifications. Although both falsifications were attempts to conceal the same embezzlement, the statute outlawed the falsifications themselves, and thus the Court held that since they were made at different times and in different circumstances each could be prosecuted separately.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment applies in the same manner to a prosecution following a prior conviction as it does to a prosecution following a prior acquittal. See Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163, 169, 172; United States v. Ball, \n163 \nU.S. 662, 669\n. This is consistent with the fact that, although autrefois acquit and autrefois convict were separate pleas in bar in the English law, they have historically been given the same scope. See 4 Black-stone commentaries *335-336; 2 Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown (8th ed. 1824), pp. 515-529.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The doctrine of collateral estoppel may not provide adequate protection. Of course, it will be of no help to an accused who has been previously convicted. But even if he has previously been acquitted, the doctrine may be of little help because in many cases it cannot be ascertained whether the controlling factual issues in the second prosecution were necessarily resolved in the prior trial. See Hoag v. New Jersey, \n356 \nU.S. 464, 471\n-472; United States v. Dockery, 49 F. Supp. 907; United States v. Halbrook, 36 F. Supp. 345. Furthermore, the protection of an essentially procedural concept such as collateral estoppel, see Hoag v. New Jersey, supra, at 471, is less substantial than the constitutional protection of the Double Jeopardy Clause. For example, a second trial that placed the accused in double jeopardy could be collaterally attacked, whereas query whether the failure to apply collateral estoppel could be challenged by a post-conviction motion for relief. See Sunal v. Large, \n332 \nU.S. 174, 178\n-179.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS concur, dissenting.\n\nPetitioners, Abbate and Falcone, were convicted in an Illinois State Court of conspiracy to blow up certain property located in Mississippi and adjoining States. After receiving prison sentences in Illinois they were indicted and convicted of the same conspiracy in the Federal District Court of Mississippi and again sentenced to prison. The Court now affirms their second sentences over the contention that the federal conviction violates the double jeopardy provision of the Fifth Amendment. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 187, 202]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn support of its affirmance, the Court points to United States v. Lanza, \n260 \nU.S. 377\n. In that case, this Court sustained Lanza's conviction for handling liquor contrary to federal law, after Lanza had been convicted under state law of handling the same liquor at the same time and place. Some writers have explained Lanza as justified by the broad language of the Prohibition Amendment which was then in effect and which gave the States and the Federal Government concurrent power to control liquor traffic.\n1\n The Court's opinion, in Lanza, however, seemed rather to rely on dicta in a number of past cases in this Court. These had assumed that identical conduct of an accused might be prosecuted twice, once by a State and once by the Federal Government, because the \"offense\" punished by each is in some, meaningful, sense different. The legal logic used to prove one thing to be two is too subtle for me to grasp. See, generally, Bartkus v. Illinois, ante, p. 150 (dissenting opinion).\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[359 \nU.S. 187, 203]\n\u00a0\n\n\nI am also not convinced that a State and the Nation can be considered two wholly separate sovereignties for the purpose of allowing them to do together what, generally, neither can do separately.\n3\n In the first place, I cannot conceive that our States are more distinct from the Federal Government than are foreign nations from each other.\n4\n And it has been recognized that most free countries have accepted a prior conviction elsewhere as a bar to a second trial in their jurisdiction.\n5\n In the second place, I believe the Bill of Rights' safeguard against double jeopardy was intended to establish a broad national policy against federal courts trying or punishing a man a second time after acquittal or conviction in any court. It is just as much an affront to human dignity and just as dangerous to human freedom for a man to be punished twice for the same offense, once by a State and once by the United States, as it would be for one of these two Governments to throw him in prison twice for the offense. Perhaps a belief that this is true was responsible for the fact that a proposed amendment to the Double Jeopardy Clause was rejected in our First Congress while the Bill of Rights was being considered. If that amendment had been \n\n[359 \nU.S. 187, 204]\n\u00a0\n adopted the Clause apparently would have barred double prosecutions for \"the same offense\" only if brought under \"any law of the United States.\" 1 Annals of Cong., 753 (1789).\n6\n I fear that this limitation on the scope of the Double Jeopardy Clause, which Congress refused to accept, is about to be firmly established as the constitutional rule by the Court's holding in this case and in Bartkus v. Illinois, ante, p. 121.\n\nI would reverse both convictions.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U.S. Const., Amend. XVIII. See, e. g., Note 55, Col. L. Rev. 83, 89, n. 38. Lanza is severely criticized in Grant, The Lanza Rule of Successive Prosecutions, 32 Col. L. Rev. 1309; Grant, Successive Prosecutions by State and Nation: Common Law and British Empire Comparisons, 4 U. C. L. A. L. Rev. 1.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Court today seems to rely on the argument, also made in Lanza, \n260 \nU.S., at 385\n, that failure to allow federal prosecutions after state trials might endanger federal law. States, the argument runs, might establish minor punishments for conduct which violates United States statutes. Criminals could then plead guilty in state courts and be safe from federal justice. Whatever the merits of the argument in the context of the Eighteenth Amendment, it can have no validity here. As we pointed out in Bartkus v. Illinois, ante, p. 150 (dissenting opinion), if Congress has power to make certain conduct a federal crime, it also has power to protect the national interest. It can take exclusive jurisdiction over the crime or, if it wishes to allow the States concurrent power, it can define the offense and set minimum penalties which would be applicable in both state and federal courts. In addition, should the state trial prove to be a \n\n[359 \nU.S. 187, 203]\n\u00a0\n sham, it might be that no jeopardy could be shown and that a subsequent federal trial would be constitutional. See, e. g., Edwards v. Commonwealth, 233 Ky. 356, 25 S. W. 2d 746. Cf. United States v. Mason, \n213 \nU.S. 115, 125\n. It therefore appears that federal laws can easily be safeguarded without requiring defendants to undergo double prosecutions.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Almost all of the States have constitutional provisions similar to the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Federal Constitution. See Brock v. North Carolina, \n344 \nU.S. 424, 429\n, 435 (dissenting opinion).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Cf. Testa v.

AMERICAN CAN CO.(1959)\nNo. 40\nArgued: December 9, 1958Decided: January 12, 1959\n\n\n\n\n In 1949, while a Territory, Alaska enacted a statute which levied a tax at the rate of 1% on all real and personal property. In 1953 the tax statute was repealed; but the repeal was expressly declared not applicable to \"any taxes which have been levied and assessed by any municipality, school or public utility district [under the repealed statute] or which are levied and assessed during the current fiscal year of such municipality, school or public utility district.\" Alaska has a general law saving rights accrued under a statute that is repealed. After repeal of the tax statute, Alaska instituted suits to collect taxes which had accrued thereunder and remained unpaid. Held: Liability for such taxes survived the repeal. Pp. 224-227.\n\n (a) The exception in the repealing statute applies only to taxes payable to a municipality, a school district or a public utility district, and it does not interfere with the collection of unpaid taxes which accrued prior to repeal. Pp. 225-226.\n\n\n (b) Judicial notice is taken of the legislative history of the repealing statute, including the original bill which, though not in the Journals, was in the possession of the Secretary of State and was certified by him.

With him on the brief were David J. Pree, Assistant Attorney General, and Jack O'Hair Asher, Special Assistant Attorney General.\n\nW. C. Arnold argued the cause for respondents. With him on the brief were H. L. Faulkner and R. E. Robertson.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nAlaska, while a Territory, enacted a law which levied a tax at the rate of 1 percent on all real and personal property. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 224, 225]\n\u00a0\n L. 1949, c. 10, 3. The tax was challenged in litigation without success.\n1\n Some paid the tax voluntarily; others became delinquent. In 1953 the tax statute was repealed. L. 1953, c. 22. Thereafter petitioner instituted the present suits to collect taxes owing for the years 1949 to 1952, inclusive. The District Court granted a motion to dismiss, holding that no liability for these taxes had survived the repeal. 137 F. Supp. 181. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 246 F.2d 493. The case is here by a petition for writ of certiorari which was granted in view of the fiscal importance of the question to Alaska. \n356 \nU.S. 926\n.\n\nAlaska has a general law, saving rights accrued under a statute that is repealed.\n2\n The lower courts, however, held that this case was governed not by that provision but by 2 (a) of the repealing Act which reads as follows:\n\n  \"Section 1 of this Act\n3\n shall not be applicable to:\n\n\n  \"(a) any taxes which have been levied and assessed by any municipality, school or public utility district under the provisions of Chapter 10, Session \n\n[358 \nU.S. 224, 226]\n\u00a0\n Laws of Alaska 1949, as amended, or which are levied and assessed during the current fiscal year of such municipality, school or public utility district.\"\n\n\n It was held that this specific enactment qualifies the general repeal law and that the purpose of the 1953 Act was to wipe out any and all liabilities to pay taxes under the repealed law that had accrued prior to the date of repeal. Support for that conclusion was found in the title of the 1953 Act which includes the words \"excepting from repeal certain taxes,\" no qualifications whatsoever being indicated.\n\nWe take a different view. Section 2 (a) of the 1953 Act, as we read it, has nothing to do with any taxes other than those payable to a municipality, a school or public utility district, none of which is here involved. If it had done no more than save all accrued taxes in those categories, the case would be in quite a different posture. Section 2 (a), however, does not do that. It was protective of municipal, school, or public utility taxes in a much broader way. It saved first, those taxes that had been \"levied and assessed\" and second, those to be \"levied and assessed during the current fiscal year.\" This was to make sure, as the dissent below said, that municipalities and school and public utility districts (though not the Territory itself) would have the right to levy and collect the old taxes for the current year 1953, whether before or after the repealing Act had taken effect. So construed, 2 (a) carves no exception from the general saving statute and does not interfere with the collection of unpaid taxes which accrued prior to repeal.\n\nWe are reinforced in this conclusion by the legislative history of the bill\n4\n that became the repealing Act, a history \n\n[358 \nU.S. 224, 227]\n\u00a0\n of which we take judicial notice. See United States v. American Trucking Assns., \n310 \nU.S. 534, 547\n. And see Wigmore on Evidence (3d ed. 1940) 2577. The bill as introduced \"cancelled, repealed and abrogated, and declared null and void\" \"all accrued and unpaid taxes\" under the 1949 Act. That provision was deleted, however, by a House Committee, and it never became part of the law. The bill passed the House without it. The present 2 (a) was added in the Senate; and the House agreed. If we adopted the construction taken below, we would be reading into the Act by implication what the Legislature seemingly rejected.\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and, as there are other questions which were raised by the appeal (246 F.2d 493, 495) but not reached by that court, the cause is remanded to it for proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER and MR.

Pp. 186-198.\n\n2. \nWhile a proceeding to assess damages for the condemnation of land for an airport was pending in a Pennsylvania state court, the landowners, properly invoking jurisdiction on the ground of diversity of citizenship, sued in a Federal District Court for a judgment of ouster, on the ground that the taking was for private use and therefore contrary to state law. There was no federal constitutional question involved; the state law on the point was clear and well settled; the case turned on the purely factual question whether the taking was for private rather than public use; and under state procedure the issue of the validity of the taking could be litigated in a separate suit. However, the District Court dismissed the suit on the ground that it should not interfere with the administration of the affairs of a political subdivision acting under color of state law in a condemnation proceeding. Held: No exceptional circumstances justifying abstention appear in this case, and the District Court should have adjudicated the claim. Pp. 186-198.\n\n (a) The doctrine of abstention, under which a district court may decline to exercise or postpone the exercise of its jurisdiction, is an extraordinary and narrow exception to the duty of a district court to adjudicate a controversy properly before it.

P. 189.\n\n\n (d) Adjudication of the issues in this case by the District Court would present no hazard of disrupting federal-state relations, since the District Court would be acting toward the pending state condemnation proceeding in the same manner as would a state court. Pp. 189-191.\n\n\n (e) The fact that this case concerns the exercise of a State's power of eminent domain did not justify the District Court in abstaining from exercising its jurisdiction. Pp. 191-196.\n\n\n (f) This case illustrates the unnecessary delay and expense that results from refusal of the District Court to exercise its properly invoked jurisdiction. Pp. 196-197.\n\n\n (g) Refusal to exercise jurisdiction could not be justified on the ground that the state court had assumed jurisdiction over the res, since the pending state proceeding was simply an in personam suit to determine the amount the State should pay for the property. P. 197.\n\n\n (h) A decision by the District Court holding that the taking was invalid would not be barred by 28 U.S.C. 2283, which provides that a federal court may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a state court except as expressly authorized by Act of Congress or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction or to protect or effectuate its judgments, since respondents do not seek an injunction in this case.

Schmidt argued the cause for respondents. With him on the brief were Don Rose and John L. Laubach, Jr.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case presents the question whether a District Court may abstain from exercising its properly invoked diversity \n\n[360 \nU.S. 185, 187]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction in a state eminent domain case in which the exercise of that jurisdiction would not entail the possibility of a premature and perhaps unnecessary decision of a serious federal constitutional question, would not create the hazard of unsettling some delicate balance in the area of federal-state relationships, and would not even require the District Court to guess at the resolution of uncertain and difficult issues of state law. We hold that in such circumstances a District Court cannot refuse to discharge the responsibility, imposed by Congress under 28 U.S.C. 1332 and 1441, to render prompt justice in cases where its diversity jurisdiction has been properly invoked.\n\nThe Board of County Commissioners of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, invoked the applicable eminent domain statutes of the State to appropriate certain property of respondents, citizens of Wisconsin, for the alleged purpose of improving and enlarging the Greater Pittsburgh Airport. The Board adopted the required resolution of taking, and thereafter petitioned the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County for appointment of a Board of Viewers to assess damages for the taking. A Board of Viewers was convened and awarded the respondents $52,644 in compensation for their property. Both parties appealed this award to the Common Pleas Court pursuant to the state procedure, and that proceeding is now pending. Subsequent to the time when the County obtained possession respondents learned that their property had been leased to Martin W. Wise, Inc., allegedly for its private business use. The applicable Pennsylvania substantive law is clear: \"It is settled law in Pennsylvania that private property cannot be taken for a private use under the power of eminent domain.\" Philadelphia Clay Co. v. York Clay Co., 241 Pa. 305, 308, 88 A. 487; see also Winger v. Aires, 371 Pa. 242, 89 A. 2d 521; Lance's Appeal, 55 Pa. 16. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 185, 188]\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn the basis of this settled law respondents brought suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, alleging that \"at the time of the taking the only definite plan and purpose of the County with regard to said land was that the same would be leased to defendant Martin W. Wise, Inc. for the benefit of the said lessee and for no public use,\" and seeking a judgment of ouster against the County and Martin W. Wise, Inc., damages, and, in the alternative, an injunction restraining the County from proceeding further in the pending state court damage proceeding.\n1\n The District Court, although recognizing that its diversity jurisdiction had been properly invoked, dismissed the suit on the ground that it \"should not interfere with the administration of the affairs of a political subdivision acting under color of State law in a condemnation proceeding.\" 154 F. Supp. 628, 629. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that a challenge to the validity of a taking such as respondents make in this case may, and perhaps must, be brought in an independent suit different from the Board of Viewers proceeding to assess damages, and that such an independent suit based on diversity of citizenship could therefore be maintained in the District Court. 256 F.2d 241. We granted certiorari because of the important question presented as to whether the District Court had discretion to abstain from the exercise of jurisdiction in the circumstances of this case. \n358 \nU.S. 872\n.\n\nThe doctrine of abstention, under which a District Court may decline to exercise or postpone the exercise of its jurisdiction, is an extraordinary and narrow exception to the duty of a District Court to adjudicate a controversy properly before it. Abdication of the obligation to decide cases can be justified under this doctrine only \n\n[360 \nU.S. 185, 189]\n\u00a0\n in the exceptional circumstances where the order to the parties to repair to the state court would clearly serve an important countervailing interest. Since no exceptional circumstances justifying abstention appear in this case we think that the Court of Appeals was correct in holding that the District Court should have adjudicated the respondents' claim.\n\nThis Court has sanctioned a federal court's postponement of the exercise of its jurisdiction in cases presenting a federal constitutional issue which might be mooted or presented in a different posture by a state court determination of pertinent state law. See, e. g., City of Meridian v. Southern Bell Tel. & Tel. Co., \n358 \nU.S. 639\n; Government Employees Organizing Comm. v. Windsor, \n353 \nU.S. 364\n; Leiter Minerals, Inc., v. United States, \n352 \nU.S. 220\n; Albertson v. Millard, \n345 \nU.S. 242\n; Shipman v. DuPre, \n339 \nU.S. 321\n; Stainback v. Mo Hock Ke Lok Po, \n336 \nU.S. 368\n; American Federation of Labor v. Watson, \n327 \nU.S. 582\n; Alabama State Federation of Labor v. McAdory, \n325 \nU.S. 450\n; Spector Motor Service, Inc., v. McLaughlin, \n323 \nU.S. 101\n; Chicago v. Fieldcrest Dairies, Inc., \n316 \nU.S. 168\n; Railroad Comm'n of Texas v. Pullman Co., \n312 \nU.S. 496\n. But there are no federal constitutional questions raised in this case.\n\nThis Court has also upheld an abstention on grounds of comity with the States when the exercise of jurisdiction by the federal court would disrupt a state administrative process, Burford v. Sun Oil Co., \n319 \nU.S. 315\n; Pennsylvania v. Williams, \n294 \nU.S. 176\n, interfere with the collection of state taxes, Toomer v. Witsell, \n334 \nU.S. 385, 392\n; Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v. Huffman, \n319 \nU.S. 293\n, or otherwise create needless friction by unnecessarily enjoining state officials from executing domestic policies, Alabama Public Service Comm'n v. Southern R. Co., \n341 \nU.S. 341\n; Hawks v. Hamill, \n288 \nU.S. 52\n. But adjudication of the issues in this case by the District Court would \n\n[360 \nU.S. 185, 190]\n\u00a0\n present no hazard of disrupting federal-state relations. The respondents did not ask the District Court to apply paramount federal law to prohibit state officials from carrying out state domestic policies, nor do they seek the obvious irritant to state-federal relations of an injunction against state officials. The only question for decision is the purely factual question whether the County expropriated the respondents' land for private rather than for public use. The District Court would simply be acting as would a court of the State in applying to the facts of this case the settled state policy that a County may not take a private citizen's land under the State's power of eminent domain except for public use.\n\nIt is true that a decision by the District Court returning the land to respondents on the ground that the taking was invalid would interfere with the proceeding to assess damages now pending in the state court in the sense that the damage proceeding would be mooted since the County would no longer have the land. But this interference, if properly called interference at all, cannot justify abstention since exactly the same suit to contest the validity of the taking could be brought in a state court different from the one in which the damage proceeding is now pending. It is perfectly clear under Pennsylvania law that the respondents could have challenged the validity of the taking, on the ground that it was not for public purposes, in a suit brought in a Court of Common Pleas independent of the damage proceedings pending on appeal from the Board of Viewers. The Court of Appeals' opinion instructs us as to the state procedure which would have applied if respondents had chosen the state forum: \"These [Pennsylvania] authorities establish the propriety, if not the necessity, of testing the validity of a condemnation in a proceeding in the Pennsylvania courts independent of that in which compensation is awarded.\" 256 F.2d, at 243. Again the Court of Appeals stated: \n\n[360 \nU.S. 185, 191]\n\u00a0\n \"the question involved before the federal court need not, and perhaps cannot, be raised in the pending state action . . . .\" Ibid. We, of course, usually accept state law as found by the Court of Appeals, see Propper v. Clark, \n337 \nU.S. 472\n; The Tungus v. Skovgaard, \n358 \nU.S. 588, 596\n, and we have no hesitancy in doing so here where there is no indication that its conclusion as to the state law is not correct.\n2\n The issues of validity and damage are triable separately not because federal jurisdiction has been invoked, but because they are triable separately under the Pennsylvania law. Respondents, it bears repetition, could have brought this very suit in a state court different from the one in which the damage proceeding is pending and an adjudication of that validity suit by the state court would have the same effect on the pending damage proceeding as will the federal court adjudication. Instead of bringing such a suit in the state court, respondents exercised their right under 28 U.S.C. 1332 to institute the equivalent suit in the District Court based on diversity of citizenship. Certainly considerations of comity are satisfied if the District Court acts toward the pending state damage proceeding in the same manner as would a state court.\n\nIt is suggested, however, that abstention is justified on grounds of avoiding the hazard of friction in federal-state relations any time a District Court is called on to adjudicate a case involving the State's power of eminent domain, even though, as in this case, the District Court would simply be applying state law in the same manner as would a state court. But the fact that a case concerns \n\n[360 \nU.S. 185, 192]\n\u00a0\n a State's power of eminent domain no more justifies abstention than the fact that it involves any other issue related to sovereignty. Surely eminent domain is no more mystically involved with \"sovereign prerogative\" than a State's power to regulate fishing in its waters, Toomer v. Witsell, \n334 \nU.S. 385\n, its power to regulate intrastate trucking rates, Public Utilities Comm'n of California v. United States, \n355 \nU.S. 534\n, a city's power to issue certain bonds without a referendum, Meredith v. Winter Haven, \n320 \nU.S. 228\n, its power to license motor vehicles, Chicago v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co., \n357 \nU.S. 77\n, and a host of other governmental activities carried on by the States and their subdivisions which have been brought into question in the Federal District Courts despite suggestions that those courts should have stayed their hand pending prior state court determination of state law.\n\nFurthermore, the federal courts have been adjudicating cases involving issues of state eminent domain law for many years, without any suggestion that there was entailed a hazard of friction in federal-state relations. A host of cases, many in this Court, have approved the decision by a federal court of precisely the same kind of state eminent domain question which the District Court was asked to decide in this case. This Court approved such a decision as early as 1878,\n3\n in Boom Co. v. Patterson, \n\n[360 \nU.S. 185, 193]\n\u00a0\n \n98 \nU.S. 403\n. There the petitioner, a private corporation authorized to utilize the State's power of eminent domain, moved in a state court to condemn respondent's land. Both parties appealed from an award by Commissioners, as provided by the relevant state statute, to a state court for a trial de novo. At this point, respondent removed the case to a federal court on the basis of diversity of citizenship. This Court, while recognizing that eminent domain is \"an exercise by the State of its sovereign right . . . and with its exercise the United States . . . has no right to interfere . . .,\" held that the removal was proper and that the federal court correctly adjudicated the issues involved. The Court concluded: \"But notwithstanding the right is one that appertains to sovereignty, when the sovereign power attaches conditions to its exercise, the inquiry whether the conditions have been observed is a proper matter for judicial cognizance. If that inquiry take the form of a proceeding before the courts between parties, . . . there is a controversy which is subject to the ordinary incidents of a civil suit, and its determination derogates in no respect from the sovereignty of the State.\" \n98 \nU.S., at 406\n. This rationale was subsequently applied by this Court to uphold adjudication of state eminent domain proceedings involving suits between diverse parties in the federal courts even though the procedures available would not be the same as those provided \n\n[360 \nU.S. 185, 194]\n\u00a0\n by the state practice, Searl v.

This Court has approved of the practice many times. East Tennessee, Va. & Ga. R. Co. v. Southern Telegraph Co., \n112 \nU.S. 306\n; Clinton v. Missouri P. R. Co., \n122 \nU.S. 469\n; Upshur County v.

Trial of state eminent domain cases has become a common practice in the federal courts.\n4\n Indeed, Rule 71A of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \n\n[360 \nU.S. 185, 195]\n\u00a0\n adopted by the Court in 1951, provides a detailed procedure for use in eminent domain cases in the Federal District Courts and specifically provides, in subsection (k), \"The practice as herein prescribed governs in actions involving the exercise of the power of eminent domain under the law of a state, provided that if the state law makes provision for trial of any issue by jury, or for trial of the issue of compensation by jury or commission or both, that provision shall be followed.\" This Rule makes perfectly clear, as do the Notes of the Advisory Committee on Rules pertaining to it,\n5\n that this Court, when it adopted the Rule, intended that state eminent domain cases, including those which raised questions of authority to take land, would be tried in the Federal District Courts if jurisdiction was properly invoked. This was confirmed by this Court's opinion in Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v. Stude, \n346 \nU.S. 574\n. Although holding that the respondent could not remove a state condemnation case to the Federal District Court on diversity grounds because he was the plaintiff in the state proceeding, the Court clearly recognized that the defendant in such a proceeding could remove in accordance with 1441 and obtain a federal adjudication of the issues involved.\n\nThere is no suggestion that the state eminent domain proceedings tried in the federal courts, both before and after promulgation of the Rule 71A procedures, have resulted in misapplication of state law, inconvenience, or friction with the States. Rule 71A was adopted only after a thorough investigation of eminent domain practice in the federal courts,\n6\n and its provision for trying state \n\n[360 \nU.S. 185, 196]\n\u00a0\n eminent domain cases in the District Courts necessarily reflects a conclusion that this practice is unobjectionable.\n\nAside from the complete absence of any possibility that a District Court adjudication in this case would necessitate decision of a federal constitutional issue or conflict with state policy, the state law that the District Court was asked to apply is clear and certain. All that was necessary for the District Court to dispose of this case was to determine whether, as a matter of fact, the respondents' property was taken for the private use of Martin W. Wise, Inc. The propriety of a federal adjudication in this case follows a fortiori from the established principle that Federal District Courts should apply settled state law without abstaining from the exercise of jurisdiction even though this course would require decision of difficult federal constitutional questions. Chicago v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co., \n357 \nU.S. 77\n; Public Utilities Comm'n of California v. United States, \n355 \nU.S. 534\n; Toomer v. Witsell, \n334 \nU.S. 385\n.\n\nThe undesirability of a refusal to exercise jurisdiction in the absence of exceptional circumstances which clearly justify an abstention is demonstrated by the facts of this case. Respondents have consumed considerable time and expense in pursuing their claim that their property has been unlawfully taken. To order them out of the federal court would accomplish nothing except to require still another lawsuit, with added delay and expense for all parties. This would be a particular hardship for the respondents, who, besides incurring the added expense, would also suffer a further prolonged unlawful denial of the possession of their property if ultimately they prevail against the County and its lessee. It exacts a severe penalty from citizens for their attempt to exercise rights of access to the federal courts granted them by Congress to deny them \"that promptness of decision \n\n[360 \nU.S. 185, 197]\n\u00a0\n which in all judicial actions is one of the elements of justice.\" Forsyth v. Hammond, \n166 \nU.S. 506, 513\n.\n\nTwo other contentions raised by the County can be disposed of quickly. The County argues that the Board of Viewers has established jurisdiction over the land in question and thus the rule applies that when one court has assumed jurisdiction over a res, no other court will undertake to enter a judgment which might be incompatible with the disposition ultimately to be made by the first court. The short answer to this contention is that the Board of Viewers under Pennsylvania law does not have in rem jurisdiction over property. This is apparent from the fact that an independent proceeding lies to question the validity of the taking of property which is the subject of a Board of Viewers' proceeding. The \"damage\" proceeding is simply an in personam suit to determine what the State must pay for property it appropriates; it does not require or contemplate control of the res by the Board of Viewers.\n\nThe County also urges that a decision by the District Court holding the taking to be invalid would be barred by 28 U.S.C. 2283. That section provides:\n\n\"A court of the United States may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a State court except as expressly authorized by Act of Congress, or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments.\"\n\n\n The County's theory is that a holding that the taking was invalid and an order reconveying the land to respondents would be res judicata on the parties in the Board of Viewers' proceedings. Since the County would no longer have the land, that proceeding to determine the compensation due for the taking of the land would be mooted. But it has been firmly established under the language of \n\n[360 \nU.S. 185, 198]\n\u00a0\n 2283, which has, in substance, been in force since first enacted in 5 of the Act of March 2, 1793,\n7\n that a federal suit is not barred merely because a holding in the case might be res judicata on the same parties litigating the same issue in a state court and thereby moot the state proceeding. Kline v. Burke Construction Co., \n260 \nU.S. 226\n, settled the governing principle. In that case diversity jurisdiction had been invoked to adjudicate an alleged breach of contract. The defendant in the federal court proceeding had initiated a suit in a state court to adjudicate the same issue. The Court of Appeals ruled that the Federal District Court should have issued a requested injunction to stay the state court proceedings. This Court held that a statute similar to present 2283 barred the injunction, but that the District Court could adjudicate the breach of contract issue even though its holding would be decisive of the state case. The Court stated that \"the rule . . . has become generally established that where the action first brought is in personam and seeks only a personal judgment, another action for the same cause in another jurisdiction is not precluded.\" \n260 \nU.S., at 230\n. Congress in enacting 2283 expressed no intention to modify this firmly established principle. Thus there is no reason to expand the plain wording of 2283 which bars only injunctions designed to stay state court proceedings. The respondents' suit in the District Court was for a judgment of ouster. They abandoned the claim for an injunction against the state court and against the County. It follows that 2283 would not bar the relief requested in the District Court.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The prayer for injunctive relief was expressly abandoned in oral argument before this Court.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Court of Appeals' conclusion as to the Pennsylvania law is amply supported by Pennsylvania authorities. E. g., Spann v. Joint Boards of School Directors, 381 Pa. 338, 113 A. 2d 281; Pioneer Coal Co. v. Cherrytree & D. R. Co., 272 Pa. 43, 116 A. 45; Philadelphia Clay Co. v. York Clay Co., 241 Pa. 305, 88 A. 487. See also 14 Standard Pa. Practice, c. 71, 230, 231, 233, 235.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The basis for federal court adjudication of state eminent domain proceedings was established even before this. In Suydam v. Broadnax, 14 Pet. 67; Union Bank v. Jolly's Adm'rs, 18 How. 503; and Hyde v. Stone, 20 How. 170, this Court held that the federal courts would decide diversity cases even though they involved issues, such as the validity of a will, which were peculiarly within the State's competence to regulate. The principles were clearly settled in Gaines v. Fuentes, \n92 \nU.S. 10\n. That case concerned a suit \"to annul [a will] . . . as a muniment of title, and to limit the operation of the decree admitting it to probate.\" \n92 \nU.S., at 20\n. The case, originally brought in a state court, was removed to a federal court on the basis of diversity \n\n[360 \nU.S. 185, 193]\n\u00a0\n of citizenship. This Court upheld the removal on the ground that, although the State had authority to establish the substantive law relevant to the validity of wills and the procedure by which wills were to be contested, if, under the scheme developed by the State, a controversy arose between citizens of different States, the federal courts would adjudicate that controversy. These principles were further articulated in Chicot County v. Sherwood, \n148 \nU.S. 529\n. This Court has often upheld federal court determinations of state law concerning wills, e. g., Ellis v. Davis, \n109 \nU.S. 485\n; Hess v. Reynolds, \n113 \nU.S. 73\n, even when the State itself claimed the decedent's property by escheat, McClellan v. Carland, \n217 \nU.S. 268\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] E. g., Wabash R. Co. v. Duncan, 170 F.2d 38; Franzen v. Chicago, M. & St. P. R. Co., 278 F. 370; In re Bensel, 206 F. 369; Broadmoor Land Co. v.

For a discussion of its origin and history, see Toucey v. New York Life Ins. Co., \n314 \nU.S. 118\n. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 185, 199]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK, MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, and MR. JUSTICE HARLAN join, dissenting.\n\nThe Court says that under the peculiar facts of this case the trial judge has abused his discretion in abstaining from trying the issue involved here, which is presently pending in a previously filed state case between the same parties. I see nothing in the facts that reveals any clear abuse of discretion. In fact, the disruption of the State's processes by the refusal of the Court in the circumstances of this case to permit the application of modern businesslike procedures in the administration of the federal diversity jurisdiction requires my dissent.\n\nAllegheny County, a subdivision of the State of Pennsylvania, took action under its state law to acquire property owned by respondents which was allegedly necessary for the enlargement of its Greater Pittsburgh Airport. The respondents made no effort to remove that action to the federal court. If that had been done, the entire case would have been subject to trial in the federal court. Instead, however, the respondents appeared in the state case and contested the issue of damages for the taking, but raised no objection whatever to its validity. Both parties appealed from an award of $52,644 in damages and demanded a trial de novo in the State's Court of Common Pleas. The County thereupon entered upon the property and began its improvement. A year later respondents filed this suit in the federal court attacking the validity of the County's taking in the state suit.\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[360 \nU.S. 185, 200]\n\u00a0\n The Court requires the County to litigate that sole issue in the federal court while the state court holds in abeyance the original case involving the taking as well as the damages therefor.\n\nThus the state suit is split; the validity of the taking being involved in the federal court as well as the state proceeding, while the amount of damages remains for the state court alone. Admittedly the federal court cannot obtain jurisdiction over the latter. As a result, the County now has two lawsuits on its hands, one, involving half of its state case, will be tried in the federal court, while the remainder pends in the state court. If it finally prevails in the federal court, after two or three more years of delay incident to trial and appeal, still it must go back to its state case and try the issue of damages. If the County loses in the federal court, it must nevertheless go back to the state court and start all over again with a new action or an amendment of the old one. This is true because the plans, as shown in the record, indicate clearly that the County will be obliged to take respondents' property because it is situated adjacent to the old entrance to the airport and would be necessary for the proposed enlargement. The latter course would inevitably lead to greater damages, as well as additional years of delay, all of which would be occasioned by the action today.\n\nThe Court describes this needless merry-go-round of technical procedures as preventing \"added expense [and] . . . further prolonged unlawful denial of the possession of their [respondents'] property. . . .\" Obviously just the opposite is true. The respondents, by not removing the case to the federal court, but rather by waiting a year before filing the present suit, have now delayed the \n\n[360 \nU.S. 185, 201]\n\u00a0\n County for over three years,\n2\n and bid fair to extend that period for at least two more under the ruling of this Court. On the other hand, if the Court required respondents to proceed in the state suit, all of the issues between the parties would be settled in the one suit, even if respondents persisted - as the Court holds is their right - in filing a separate suit in the state court over the validity of the taking. That suit could easily be consolidated with the original case, and the validity of the taking as well as the damages therefor could be settled at one trial. This, of course, cannot be done when one of the cases is in the federal court and the other in the state. This points up the fallacy of the Court's conclusion that \"considerations of comity are satisfied if the [Federal] District Court acts toward the pending state damage proceeding in the same manner as would a state court.\" It is, indeed, a poor way to administer justice, especially where a subdivision of the State is involved.\n\nIn short, I say that under the peculiar facts of this case the \"exceptional circumstances\" of which the majority speaks are present. An \"order to the parties to repair to the state court would clearly serve an important countervailing interest,\" namely, the orderly and businesslike administration of justice, as well as the comity due Pennsylvania's courts.\n\nAs to the latter consideration, the Court bottoms its decision to make the County split its case between the two jurisdictions on the proposition that respondents \"abandoned the claim for an injunction against the state \n\n[360 \nU.S. 185, 202]\n\u00a0\n court and against the County.\" But the reality of the situation is that the state court, which has already abstained for three years at the urging of respondents may now decide that it should proceed to hear and determine both the issues of validity and damages which are and have been pending in the state case. If it did so, there would result an unseemly race between the forums and a head-on collision between the state and federal courts. The latter would be moving by way of ejectment and the former by way of condemnation over the same property and involving the same parties. Still, since, as the majority says, \"the plain wording of 2283 . . . bars . . . injunctions,\" this unseemly spectacle could not be stopped and would result in \"needless friction with state policies.\" Railroad Comm'n v. Pullman Co., \n312 \nU.S. 496, 500\n (1941). In view of these circumstances, peculiar to this case, there is nothing here to show that the trial court clearly abused its discretion and I would therefore reverse the Court of Appeals and reinstate the judgment of the trial judge.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The grounds are obviously frivolous. Respondents urge that the County's leasing to its contractor of a strip 75' x 150' out of the 8 acres condemned amounts to an abandonment of its taking for \"public use.\" The record shows that the lease was made in order to permit the contractor to use this small strip for storage and \n\n[360 \nU.S. 185, 200]\n\u00a0\n concentration of supplies of the contractor in the performance of his duties under the contract with the County for the improvement and enlargement of the Greater Pittsburgh Airport.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The record does not reveal whether the County has proceeded with its improvements or not. If it has not, the respondents' action in filing this suit, and which the Court approves, has delayed a much-needed improvement for over three years. If it has proceeded to complete the improvement, the County has still been delayed in obtaining final title to the property for all these years, all because of this frivolous action of the respondents. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 185, 203]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","4":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nALLIED STORES OF OHIO v. BOWERS(1959)\nNo. 10\nArgued: November 12, 1958Decided: February 24, 1959\n\n\n\n\n Appellant, an Ohio corporation owning and operating department stores in Ohio and maintaining there private warehouses where it stores stocks of merchandise to be sold in its stores, challenged in the Ohio courts the validity of an ad valorem state tax on the contents of its warehouses. It claimed that it was denied the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment because Ohio exempted from such taxation merchandise belonging to non-residents \"if held in a storage warehouse for storage only.\" The trial court sustained the tax. The State Supreme Court held that appellant lacked standing to raise this constitutional question and affirmed the judgment. Held:\n\n 1. Appellant had standing to prosecute its constitutional claim. Pp. 525-526.\n\n\n 2. The exemption from taxation of merchandise belonging to a non-resident when \"held in a storage warehouse for storage only\" did not deny to appellant, a resident of the State, the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Wheeling Steel Corp. v. Glander, \n337 \nU.S. 562\n, distinguished. Pp. 526-530.\n\n\n 166 Ohio St. 116, 140 N. E. 2d 411, affirmed.\n\nCarlton S. Dargusch, Sr. argued the cause for appellant. With him on the brief were Carlton S. Dargusch, Jr. and Jack H. Bertsch.\n\nWilliam Saxbe, Attorney General of Ohio, and John M. Tobin, Assistant Attorney General, argued the cause and filed a brief for appellee.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe principal question presented is whether an Ohio statute that exempts from ad valorem taxation \"merchandise or agricultural products belonging to a nonresident \n\n[358 \nU.S. 522, 523]\n\u00a0\n . . . if held in a storage warehouse for storage only\" denies to appellant, a resident of the State, the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution.\n\nThe facts are stipulated. So far as pertinent, they are that appellant, Allied Stores of Ohio, Inc., an Ohio corporation, owns and operates a department store in each of four Ohio cities. It also maintains in each of those cities a private warehouse where it stores stocks of merchandise of the kinds sold in its stores. As needed, merchandise is transferred from the warehouse to the store, and when merchandise is sold by sample in the store - usually a heavy or bulky article - it is delivered from the warehouse directly to the customer.\n\nTitle 57, Page's Ohio Rev. Code Ann., 1953, 5709.01, provides, inter alia, that \"All personal property located and used in business in this state [shall be] subject to taxation, regardless of the residence of the owners thereof. . . .\" (Emphasis added.) During the tax year involved another Ohio statute, Title 57, Page's Ohio Rev. Code Ann., 1953, 5701.08 (A), provided, in pertinent part, that:\n\n \"As used in Title LVII of the Revised Code:\n\n\n \"(A) Personal property is `used' within the meaning of `used in business' . . . when stored or kept on hand as material, parts, products, or merchandise; but merchandise or agricultural products belonging to a nonresident of this state is not used in business in this state if held in a storage warehouse for storage only. . . .\"\n1\n (We have added the italics, and, as was done by the Supreme Court of Ohio, we will refer to the italicized portion as the \"proviso.\") \n\n[358 \nU.S. 522, 524]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Acting under those statutes, appellee, as Tax Commissioner of Ohio, proposed the assessment of an ad valorem tax against appellant based on the average value of the merchandise that it had stored in its four Ohio warehouses during the tax year ending January 31, 1954.\n2\n Appellant petitioned the Board of Tax Appeals of Ohio for a redetermination, contending that the property stored in its four warehouses in the tax year involved was \"merchandise . . . held in a storage warehouse for storage only,\" within the meaning of 5701.08 (A), and that because the section exempted nonresidents,\n3\n but taxed residents, on stocks of merchandise so held, it denied to appellant, a resident of Ohio, the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution. The Board of Tax Appeals upheld the tax, and so did the Court of Appeals of Cuyahoga County. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Ohio held that appellant \n\n[358 \nU.S. 522, 525]\n\u00a0\n lacked standing to raise the constitutional question presented and affirmed the judgment 166 Ohio St. 116, 140 N. E. 2d 411. The case comes here on Allied's appeal.\n\nThe first and preliminary question thus is whether the Supreme Court of Ohio correctly held that appellant lacked standing to prosecute the constitutional question sought to be presented. It is settled that \"[w]hether a pleading sets up a sufficient right of action or defense, grounded on the Constitution or a law of the United States, is necessarily a question of federal law; and where a case coming from a state court presents that question, this Court must determine for itself the sufficiency of the allegations displaying the right or defense, and is not concluded by the view taken of them by the state court.\" First National Bank v. Anderson, \n269 \nU.S. 341, 346\n; Staub v. City of Baxley, \n355 \nU.S. 313, 318\n.\n\nIn reaching its conclusion, the Ohio court said \"In our opinion, it is not necessary to consider the constitutional question raised by the taxpayer in the instant case because, if its contention with regard to that question is sound, it necessarily leads to the conclusion that the entire proviso in subdivision (A) of Section 5701.08, which read, `but merchandise or agricultural products belonging to a nonresident of this state is not used in business in this state if held in a storage warehouse for storage only,' was void and should be stricken. That being so, it is apparent that any of taxpayer's `merchandise . . . held in a storage warehouse for storage only' would be taxable because described by the preceding words remaining in the statute and reading, `stored . . . as . . . merchandise.'\" But the court did not hold that the proviso was invalid, nor did it strike it from the statute. Instead, it held that the proviso expressed the valid legislative purpose to exempt the merchandise and agricultural products of nonresidents when held in a storage warehouse for storage only and that the court was powerless to strike it. In \n\n[358 \nU.S. 522, 526]\n\u00a0\n this, the court was following its prior decisions on the question. General Cigar Co. v. Peck, 159 Ohio St. 152, 111 N. E. 2d 265 (1953), and B. F. Goodrich Co. v. Peck, 161 Ohio St. 202, 118 N. E. 2d 525 (1954), had so held. In the latter case the court had answered a contention that the proviso was invalid for undue preference of nonresidents by saying \"such an argument should be addressed to the General Assembly and not to this court.\" 161 Ohio St., at 210, 118 N. E. 2d, at 530. Those interpretations, for present purposes, became a part of the proviso. Wheeling Steel Corp. v. Glander, \n337 \nU.S. 562, 566\n. The proviso is the basis of appellant's claim of denial of the equal protection of the laws. With the proviso thus validly remaining in the statute it is quite immaterial that appellant's claim necessarily would fall if it were out. It follows that appellant does have standing to prosecute its constitutional claim.\n\nThis brings us to the merits. Does the proviso exempting \"merchandise or agricultural products belonging to a nonresident . . . if held in a storage warehouse for storage only\" deny to appellant, a resident of the State, the equal protection of the laws within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment? The applicable principles have been often stated and are entirely familiar. The States have a very wide discretion in the laying of their taxes. When dealing with their proper domestic concerns, and not trenching upon the prerogatives of the National Government or violating the guaranties of the Federal Constitution, the States have the attribute of sovereign powers in devising their fiscal systems to ensure revenue and foster their local interests. Of course, the States, in the exercise of their taxing power, are subject to the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. But that clause imposes no iron rule of equality, prohibiting the flexibility and variety that are appropriate to reasonable schemes of state taxation. The \n\n[358 \nU.S. 522, 527]\n\u00a0\n State may impose different specific taxes upon different trades and professions and may vary the rate of excise upon various products. It is not required to resort to close distinctions or to maintain a precise, scientific uniformity with reference to composition, use or value. Bell's Gap R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n134 \nU.S. 232, 237\n; Magoun v. Illinois Trust & Savings Bank, \n170 \nU.S. 283, 293\n; Southwestern Oil Co. v. Texas, \n217 \nU.S. 114, 121\n; Brown-Forman Co. v. Kentucky, \n217 \nU.S. 563, 573\n; Sunday Lake Iron Co. v. Wakefield, \n247 \nU.S. 350, 353\n; Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co., \n260 \nU.S. 245, 255\n; Oliver Iron Mining Co. v. Lord, \n262 \nU.S. 172, 179\n; Stebbins v. Riley, \n268 \nU.S. 137, 142\n; Ohio Oil Co. v. Conway, \n281 \nU.S. 146, 159\n; State Board of Tax Comm'rs v. Jackson, \n283 \nU.S. 527, 537\n. \"To hold otherwise would be to subject the essential taxing power of the State to an intolerable supervision, hostile to the basic principles of our Government and wholly beyond the protection which the general clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was intended to assure.\" Ohio Oil Co. v. Conway, supra, \n281 \nU.S., at 159\n.\n\nBut there is a point beyond which the State cannot go without violating the Equal Protection Clause. The State must proceed upon a rational basis and may not resort to a classification that is palpably arbitrary. The rule often has been stated to be that the classification \"must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation.\" Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia, \n253 \nU.S. 412, 415\n; Louisville Gas & Electric Co. v. Coleman, \n277 \nU.S. 32, 37\n; AirWay Electric Appliance Corp. v. Day, \n266 \nU.S. 71, 85\n; Schlesinger v. Wisconsin, \n270 \nU.S. 230, 240\n; Ohio Oil Co. v. Conway, \n281 \nU.S. 146, 160\n. \"If the selection or classification is neither capricious nor arbitrary, and rests upon some reasonable consideration of difference or policy, there is no denial of the equal protection of the law.\" Brown-Forman \n\n[358 \nU.S. 522, 528]\n\u00a0\n Co. v. Kentucky, \n217 \nU.S. 563, 573\n. State Board of Tax Comm'rs v. Jackson, \n283 \nU.S. 527, 537\n. That a statute may discriminate in favor of a certain class does not render it arbitrary if the discrimination is founded upon a reasonable distinction, or difference in state policy. American Sugar Ref. Co. v. Louisiana, \n179 \nU.S. 89\n; Stebbins v. Riley, \n268 \nU.S. 137, 142\n.\n\nComing directly to the concrete problem now before us, it has repeatedly been held and appears to be entirely settled that a statute which encourages the location within the State of needed and useful industries by exempting them, though not also others, from its taxes is not arbitrary and does not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Bell's Gap R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, supra, \n134 \nU.S., at 237\n; Ohio Oil Co. v. Conway, \n281 \nU.S., at 159\n; Williams v. Baltimore, \n289 \nU.S. 36\n; Colgate v. Harvey, \n296 \nU.S. 404, 439\n (dissenting opinion). Similarly, it has long been settled that a classification, though discriminatory, is not arbitrary nor violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment if any state of facts reasonably can be conceived that would sustain it. Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., \n220 \nU.S. 61, 78\n; Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, \n223 \nU.S. 59\n; Rast v. Van Deman & Lewis Co., \n240 \nU.S. 342, 357\n; State Board of Tax Comm'rs v. Jackson, \n283 \nU.S., at 537\n.\n\nIn the light of the law thus well settled, how stands appellant's case? We cannot assume that state legislative enactments were adopted arbitrarily or without good reason to further some legitimate policy of the State. What were the special reasons, motives or policies of the Ohio Legislature for adopting the questioned proviso we do not know with certainty, nor is it important that we should, Southwestern Oil Co. v. Texas, \n217 \nU.S. 114, 126\n, for a state legislature need not explicitly declare its purpose. But it is obvious that it may reasonably have \n\n[358 \nU.S. 522, 529]\n\u00a0\n been the purpose and policy of the State Legislature, in adopting the proviso, to encourage the construction or leasing and operation of warehouses in Ohio by nonresidents with the attendant benefits to the State's economy, or to stimulate the market for merchandise and agricultural products produced in Ohio by enabling nonresidents to purchase and hold them in the State for storage only, free from taxes, in anticipation of future needs. Other similar purposes reasonably may be conceived. Therefore, we cannot say that the discrimination of the proviso which exempted only the \"merchandise or agricultural products belonging to a nonresident . . . if held in a storage warehouse for storage only\" was not founded upon a reasonable distinction, or difference in state policy, or that no state of facts reasonably can be conceived to sustain it. For those reasons, it cannot be said, in the light of the settled law as shown by the cases cited, that the questioned proviso was invidious or palpably arbitrary and denied appellant the equal protection of the laws within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nAppellant heavily relies on Wheeling Steel Corp. v. Glander, \n337 \nU.S. 562\n. We think that case is not apposite. There Ohio statutes exempted from taxation certain accounts receivable owned by residents of the State but taxed those owned by nonresidents. The statutes, on their face admittedly discriminatory against nonresidents, themselves declared their purpose. That purpose was to proffer to other States a scheme of \"reciprocity\" for taxing accounts receivable.\n4\n Ohio argued that \n\n[358 \nU.S. 522, 530]\n\u00a0\n the reciprocal character of its statutes eliminated the discriminatory effects against nonresidents, but this Court held that it did not. Having themselves specifically declared their purpose, the Ohio statutes left no room to conceive of any other purpose for their existence. And the declared purpose having been found arbitrarily discriminatory against nonresidents, the Court could hardly escape the conclusion that \"the inequality [was] not because of the slightest difference in Ohio's relation to the decisive transaction, but solely because of the different residence of the owner.\" \n337 \nU.S., at 572\n. As we have shown, that is not the situation here. Here the discrimination against residents is not invidious nor palpably arbitrary because, as shown, it rests not upon the \"different residence of the owner,\" but upon a state of facts that reasonably can be conceived to constitute a distinction, or difference in state policy, which the State is not prohibited from separately classifying for purposes of taxation by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE STEWART took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The unitalicized portion of the statute was enacted in 1931, 114 Ohio Laws 714, 716. The italicized clause was added by the Ohio Legislature at its next session in 1933, 115 Ohio Laws 548, 553. In \n\n[358 \nU.S. 522, 524]\n\u00a0\n September 1955 the section was amended by deleting the italicized clause and inserting the following: \"and merchandise or agricultural products shipped from outside of this state and held in this state in a warehouse or a place of storage for storage only and for shipment outside of this state are not used in business in this state.\" 126 Ohio Laws 78.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Ohio taxing date is January 1, Title 57, Page's Ohio Rev. Code Ann., 1953, 5711.03. Why the assessment involved was for the year ended January 31, instead of January 1, 1954, is not explained in the record or the briefs. A merchant's personal property is valued for tax purposes \"by taking the amount in value on hand, as nearly as possible, in each month of the next preceding year in which he has been engaged in business, adding together such amounts, and dividing the aggregate amount by the number of months that he has been in business during such year.\" Title 57, Page's Ohio Rev. Code Ann., 1953, 5711.15.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The Supreme Court of Ohio has held that a foreign corporation, although authorized to do and doing a local business in Ohio, is a nonresident within the meaning of the proviso here in question. B. F. Goodrich Co. v. Peck, 161 Ohio St. 202, 204, 118 N. E. 2d 525, 527.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The stated purpose was to proffer to other States a right to tax accounts receivable owned by residents of Ohio that derived from sales of Ohio goods negotiated and consummated in such other States in exchange for a claimed Ohio right to tax the accounts receivable owned by residents of other States that derived from sales of their goods negotiated and consummated in Ohio. \"The effect,\" this Court said, \"[was] that intangibles of nonresident owners [were] assigned \n\n[358 \nU.S. 522, 530]\n\u00a0\n a situs within the taxing reach of Ohio while those of its residents [were] assigned a situs without. [Thus], [t]he exempted intangibles of residents [were] offered up to the taxing power of other states which may embrace this doctrine of a tax situs separate from residence, [but] no other state [ever] sought to take advantage of the `reciprocity' proffer.\" Wheeling Steel Corp. v. Glander, supra, at 573-574.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom MR. JUSTICE HARLAN joins, concurring.\n\nWe hold today that Ohio's ad valorem tax law does not violate the Equal Protection Clause in subjecting the property of Ohio corporations to a tax not applied to \n\n[358 \nU.S. 522, 531]\n\u00a0\n identical property of non-Ohio corporations. Yet in Wheeling Steel Corp. v. Glander, \n337 \nU.S. 562\n,\n1\n the Court struck down, as violating the Equal Protection Clause, another provision of Ohio's ad valorem tax law which subjected the property of non-Ohio corporations to a tax not applied to identical property of Ohio corporations.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nThe question presented in the two cases, if stated generally, and as I shall show, somewhat superficially, is: Measured by the demands of the Equal Protection Clause, is a State constitutionally permitted separately to classify domestic and foreign corporations for the purposes of payment of or exemption from an ad valorem tax? In both cases the distinction complained of as denying equal protection of the laws is that the incidence of the tax in fact turns on \"the different residence of the owner.\" With due respect to my Brethren's view, I think that if this were all that the matter was, Wheeling and this case would be indistinguishable.\n3\n Therefore, while I agree with my Brethren that the classification is valid in this case, I \n\n[358 \nU.S. 522, 532]\n\u00a0\n cannot reach that conclusion without developing the ground on which Wheeling is distinguishable.\n\nWhy is the \"different residence of the owner\" a constitutionally valid basis for Ohio's freeing the property of the foreign corporation from the tax in this case and an invalid basis for its freeing the property of the domestic corporation from the tax involved in the Wheeling case?\n\nI think that the answer lies in remembering that our Constitution is an instrument of federalism. The Constitution furnishes the structure for the operation of the States with respect to the National Government and with respect to each other. The maintenance of the principles of federalism is a foremost consideration in interpreting any of the pertinent constitutional provisions under which this Court examines state action. Because there are 49 States and much of the Nation's commercial activity is carried on by enterprises having contacts with more States than one, a common and continuing problem of constitutional interpretation has been that of adjusting the demands of individual States to regulate and tax these enterprises in light of the multistate nature of our federation. While the most ready examples of the Court's function in this field are furnished by the innumerable cases in which the Court has examined state taxation and regulation under the Commerce and Due Process Clauses, still the Equal Protection Clause, among its other roles, operates to maintain this principle of federalism.\n\nViewing the Equal Protection Clause as an instrument of federalism, the distinction between Wheeling and this case seems to me to be apparent. My Brethren's opinion today demonstrates that in dealing with as practical and complex a matter as taxation, the utmost latitude, under the Equal Protection Clause, must be afforded a State in defining categories of classification. But in the case of \n\n[358 \nU.S. 522, 533]\n\u00a0\n an ad valorem property tax, Wheeling teaches that a distinction which burdens the property of nonresidents but not like property of residents is outside the constitutional pale. But this is not because no rational ground can be conceived for a classification which discriminates against nonresidents solely because they are nonresidents: could not such a ground be found in the State's benign and beneficent desire to favor its own residents, to increase their prosperity at the expense of outlanders, to protect them from, and give them an advantage over, \"foreign\" competition? These bases of legislative distinction are adopted in the national policies of too many countries, including from time to time our own, to say that, absolutely considered, they are arbitrary or irrational. The proper analysis, it seems to me, is that Wheeling applied the Equal Protection Clause to give effect to its role to protect our federalism by denying Ohio the power constitutionally to discriminate in favor of its own residents against the residents of other state members of our federation. On the other hand, in the present case, Ohio's classification based on residence operates against Ohio residents and clearly presents no state action disruptive of the federal pattern. There is, therefore, no reason to judge the state action mechanically by the same principles as state efforts to favor residents. As my Brethren's opinion makes clear, a rational basis can be found for this exercise by Ohio of the latitude permitted it to define classifications under the Equal Protection Clause. One could, in fact, be found in the concept that it is proper that those who are bound to a State by the tie of residence and accordingly the more permanently receive its benefits are proper persons to bear the primary share of its costs. Accordingly, in this context, it is proper to say that any relief forthcoming must be obtained from the State Legislature.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] To the same effect as the Wheeling case are Southern R. Co. v. Greene, \n216 \nU.S. 400\n, and Hanover Fire Ins. Co. v. Harding, \n272 \nU.S. 494\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Court distinguished ad valorem property taxes, levied on a foreign corporation permitted to do a local business, from an original entry privilege tax on a foreign corporation. \n337 \nU.S., at 571\n-572. \"A corporation which is allowed to come into a state and there carry on its business may claim, as an individual may claim, the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment against a subsequent application to it of state law.\" Connecticut General Life Ins. Co. v. Johnson, \n303 \nU.S. 77, 79\n-80.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The statute in Wheeling \"discriminated\" against nonresidents in the same way that the present statute \"discriminates\" against residents. What my Brethren describe as the forbidden purpose of the distinction in Wheeling seems to me clearly to be only a rejected argument made by the State to show that there was no discrimination in fact. \n337 \nU.S., at 572\n-574. I see no indication in Wheeling that the Court's condemnation of the tax was based solely on its rejection of the \"reciprocity\" argument. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 522, 534]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","5":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nANONYMOUS v. BAKER(1959)\nNo. 378\nArgued: March 25, 1959Decided: June 15, 1959\n\n\n\n\n Appellants, who are licensed private detectives and private investigators, but not attorneys, were convicted of contempt for refusal to answer pertinent questions put to them as witnesses summoned before a New York judge who, pursuant to court order, was conducting a non-adversary, non-prosecutorial, preliminary fact-finding inquiry, analogous to a grand jury proceeding, into alleged unethical practices of attorneys and others acting in concert with them. Appellants did not plead the state privilege against self-incrimination but based their refusal to testify solely on the fact that their counsel was required to remain outside the hearing room while they were being interrogated, though the judge had expressed his readiness to suspend the questioning whenever appellants wished to consult with counsel. It was customary for such proceedings to be kept secret, like grand jury proceedings, and this practice was sanctioned by New York statute and by the court order authorizing the inquiry. Held:\n\n 1. Since the validity under the Federal Constitution of the state statute pertaining to such proceedings was not \"drawn into question\" or passed upon by the state courts in this case, this Court lacks jurisdiction of this appeal under 28 U.S.C. 1257 (2); but certiorari is granted. P. 290.\n\n\n 2. Petitioner's conviction of contempt for refusal to testify in these circumstances did not offend the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In re Groban, \n352 \nU.S. 330\n. Pp. 290-298.\n\n\n  (a) The requirement of the authorizing court order that the inquiry be private and the exclusion of counsel for the witnesses from the hearing room were not procedural innovations, but were in accordance with established state policy. Pp. 290-294.\n\n\n  (b) To declare such a policy unconstitutional would necessitate ignoring weighty considerations supporting it and would require going far beyond anything indicated by this Court's past \"right to counsel\" decisions under the Fourteenth Amendment. Pp. 294-296. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 287, 288]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n (c) Notwithstanding an informal statement made by a staff assistant, the record in this case does not warrant a conclusion that appellants were being questioned not merely as witnesses but with an eye to their future prosecution. Pp. 296-298.\n\n\n 4 N. Y. 2d 1034, 1035, 152 N. E. 2d 651, affirmed.\n\nRaphael H. Weissman argued the cause and filed a brief for appellants.\n\nDenis M. Hurley argued the cause for appellee. With him on the brief were Michael A. Castaldi and Michael Caputo.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nAppellants have been convicted of contempt for refusal to answer pertinent questions put to them as witnesses summoned in a state judicial Inquiry into alleged improper practices at the local bar. The sole issue before us is whether this conviction offended the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution by reason of the fact that the justice in charge of the Inquiry had required counsel retained by appellants to remain outside the hearing room while they were being interrogated, even though he expressed his readiness to suspend the course of questioning whenever appellants wished to consult with counsel. No claim is made that appellants were not fully represented by counsel in the contempt proceedings themselves or that such proceedings were otherwise lacking in due process.\n\nOn January 21, 1957, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Second Department, acting pursuant to 90 of the State Judiciary Law, 29 N. Y. Laws Ann. 90 (McKinney 1948), and in response to a petition of the Brooklyn Bar Association charging \"ambulance chasing\" and related unethical \n\n[360 \nU.S. 287, 289]\n\u00a0\n practices among segments of the Kings County Bar,\n1\n ordered an investigation into these alleged conditions by an Additional Special Term of the Supreme Court, Mr. Justice Arkwright presiding.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nAppellants, licensed private detectives and investigators, but not attorneys, appeared before the Special Term pursuant to witness subpoenas, accompanied by counsel. The presiding justice, acting upon the authority of an appellate decision made during the course of this same Inquiry, Matter of M. Anonymous v. Arkwright, 5 App. Div. 2d 790, 170 N. Y. S. 2d 535, leave to appeal denied, 4 N. Y. 2d 676, 173 N. Y. S. 2d 1025, 149 N. E. 2d 538, informed appellants that their counsel would not be allowed in the hearing room while they were being questioned, but that they would be free to consult with him at any time during their interrogation. Solely because of that limitation upon the participation of counsel, appellants thereafter refused to answer all manner of questions put to them. Their conviction for contempt, carrying a sentence of 30 days' imprisonment, followed.\n3\n The Appellate Division affirmed, 6 App. Div. 2d 719, 176 N. Y. S. 2d 227, and the New York Court of Appeals, finding that \n\n[360 \nU.S. 287, 290]\n\u00a0\n \"no substantial constitutional question is involved,\" dismissed ensuing appeals. 4 N. Y. 2d 1034, 1035, 152 N. E. 2d 651, 177 N. Y. S. 2d 687. Appellants, proceeding under 28 U.S.C. 1257 (2),\n4\n then appealed to this Court, and we postponed further consideration of jurisdiction to a hearing on the merits. \n358 \nU.S. 891\n.\n\nDealing first with the question of our jurisdiction, we think it clear that this appeal must be dismissed. It is predicated on the ground that the state courts held valid under the Federal Constitution 90 (10) of New York's Judiciary Law (see Note 6, infra), said to be the basis of the Special Term procedure here attacked. However, it appears that the federal constitutionality of 90 (10) was never \"drawn in question\" or passed upon in the state courts; the Appellate Division, from whose decision the Court of Appeals denied leave to appeal, simply relied on the earlier cases of Matter of M. Anonymous v. Arkwright, supra, and Matter of S. Anonymous v. Arkwright, 5 App. Div. 2d 792, 170 N. Y. S. 2d 538, which in turn appear not to have involved such an adjudication. In these circumstances we must hold that we lack jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1257 (2). Nevertheless, treating the appeal as a petition for writ of certiorari, we grant the writ. 28 U.S.C. 2103.\n\nWe turn to the merits. An understanding of the nature of the proceedings before the Special Term is first necessary. In New York the traditional powers of the courts \n\n[360 \nU.S. 287, 291]\n\u00a0\n over the admission, discipline, and removal of members of the bar is placed by law in the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court. N. Y. Judiciary Law 90. When the Appellate Division is apprised of conditions calling for general inquiry it usually appoints, as here, a Justice of the Supreme Court, sitting at Special Term, to make a preliminary investigation. The duties of such a justice are purely investigatory and advisory, culminating in one or more reports to the Appellate Division upon which future action may then be based. In the words of Mr. Justice Cardozo, then Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals, the proceedings at Special Term thus simply constitute a \"preliminary inquisition, without adversary parties, neither ending in any decree nor establishing any right . . . a quasi-administrative remedy whereby the court is given information that may move it to other acts thereafter . . . .\" People ex rel. Karlin v. Culkin, 248 N. Y. 465, 479, 162 N. E. 487, 492.\n\nCustomarily the proceedings at Special Term are conducted in private, for reasons which Mr. Justice Cardozo explained in the Karlin case as follows (248 N. Y., at 478-479, 162 N. E., at 492):\n\n \"The argument is pressed that in conceding to the court a power of inquisition we put into its hands a weapon whereby the fair fame of a lawyer, however innocent of wrong, is at the mercy of the tongue of ignorance or malice. Reputation in such a calling is a plant of tender growth, and its bloom, once lost, is not easily restored. The mere summons to appear at such a hearing and make report as to one's conduct, may become a slur and a reproach. Dangers are indeed here, but not without a remedy. The remedy is to make the inquisition a secret one in its preliminary stages. This has been done in the first judicial \n\n[360 \nU.S. 287, 292]\n\u00a0\n department, at least in many instances, by the order of the justice presiding at the hearing. It has been done in the second judicial department . . . by order of the Appellate Division directing the inquiry. A preliminary inquisition . . . is not a sitting of a court within the fair intendment of section 4 of the Judiciary Law whereby sittings of a court are required to be public. . . . The closest analogue is an inquisition by the grand jury for the discovery of crime.\"\n\n\n By analogy to grand jury proceedings counsel are not permitted to attend the examination of witnesses called in such an investigation, cf. People ex rel. McDonald v. Keeler, 99 N. Y. 463, 485, 2 N. E. 615, 626-627,\n5\n although the New York courts have held that the Special Term may in its discretion permit such attendance where it appears that the witness himself is a target of the inquiry. See Matter of M. Anonymous v. Arkwright, supra, 5 App. Div. 2d, at 791, 170 N. Y. S. 2d, at 538.\n\nThese practices have received legislative approval, evidenced by 90 (10) of the State Judiciary Law, quoted in the margin,\n6\n and by the Legislature's refusal in 1958 \n\n[360 \nU.S. 287, 293]\n\u00a0\n to amend the State Civil Rights Law, 8 N. Y. Laws Ann. 1-242 (McKinney 1948), so as to require that counsel be allowed to attend the interrogation of witnesses in proceedings of this character.\n7\n\u00a0\n\n[360 \nU.S. 287, 294]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThus, what we have here in the Appellate Division's order that the Inquiry be private\n8\n and in the Special Term's exclusion of counsel from the hearing room is not a procedural innovation by a particular court or judge in a particular case, but an expression of established state policy. We are now asked to declare that policy unconstitutional.\n\nTo do so would not only necessitate our ignoring the weighty considerations which support New York's policy, but would require us to limit state power in this area of investigation far beyond anything indicated by this Court's past \"right to counsel\" decisions under the Fourteenth Amendment. Although we have held that in state criminal proceedings, which these are not, Matter of M. Anonymous v. Arkwright, supra, a defendant has an unqualified right to be represented at trial by retained counsel, Chandler v. Fretag, \n348 \nU.S. 3\n, we have not extended that right to the investigation stages of such proceedings. See Cicenia v. LaGay, \n357 \nU.S. 504\n; see also Crooker v. California, \n357 \nU.S. 433\n. Again, while it has been decided that there is a constitutional right to counsel in a criminal contempt proceeding, growing out of a state investigation, conducted before a judge sitting as \n\n[360 \nU.S. 287, 295]\n\u00a0\n a \"One Man Grand Jury,\" In re Oliver, \n333 \nU.S. 257\n,\n9\n we have held that a witness examined in a state investigation conducted in private is not constitutionally entitled to the assistance of counsel while being interrogated. In re Groban, \n352 \nU.S. 330\n.\n\nIn the Groban case we upheld the constitutionality of an Ohio statute\n10\n which, as construed by the Ohio courts, authorized the Fire Marshal to exclude from the hearing room counsel representing those summoned to testify before him in an investigation into the causes of a fire. We there said (at 332-333):\n\n \"The fact that appellants were under a legal duty to speak and that their testimony might provide a basis for criminal charges against them does not mean that they had a constitutional right to the assistance of their counsel. Appellants here are witnesses from whom information was sought as to the cause of the fire. A witness before a grand jury cannot insist, as a matter of constitutional right, on being represented by his counsel, nor can a witness before other investigatory bodies. There is no more reason to allow the presence of counsel before a Fire Marshal trying in the public interest to determine the cause of a fire. Obviously in these situations evidence obtained may possibly lay a witness open to criminal charges. When such charges are made in a criminal proceeding, he then may demand the presence of his counsel for his defense. Until then his protection is the privilege against self-incrimination.\" (Footnotes omitted.)\n\n\n The Groban case is controlling here and requires rejection of appellants' constitutional claims. As did Ohio in Groban, New York has a privilege against self-incrimination \n\n[360 \nU.S. 287, 296]\n\u00a0\n N. Y. Const., Art. I, 6, which was freely exercised by other witnesses in this investigation,\n11\n and was fully available to these appellants. Moreover, the circumstance that this investigation was conducted by an experienced judge, rather than an administrative official, and the fact that appellants throughout their interrogation were freely given the right to consult counsel, notwithstanding his exclusion from the hearing room, make the constitutional claim here far less tenable than that found wanting in Groban.\n\nAppellants seek to escape from Groban by arguing that they were summoned before the Special Term not as mere witnesses but with an eye to their future prosecution. This contention rests upon an informal \"off the record\" conversation which appellants and their counsel had with an assistant on the Inquiry's staff some four months before appellants were actually examined. In response to counsel's inquiry as to \"what was wanted of his clients in this matter,\" the assistant made the replies set forth in the margin.\n12\n\u00a0\n\n[360 \nU.S. 287, 297]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe think that the role in which these appellants were summoned to the Inquiry is to be judged by the actions of the Special Term, not by the statements of a subordinate staff member, evidently motivated by nothing more than a desire to avoid a plea of self-incrimination which would have blocked the Inquiry from obtaining possibly helpful information. The record shows that the Special Term, aware of the claims as to this occurrence, which it caused to be fully explored in the presence of appellants and their counsel, repeatedly assured appellants that they were \n\n[360 \nU.S. 287, 298]\n\u00a0\n before the Inquiry solely as witnesses.\n13\n That they might later be faced with criminal charges, adds nothing to their present constitutional claim. In re Groban, supra, at 332-333.\n\nThe final order of the Court of Appeals of the State of New York must be\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The petition of the Bar Association alleged, among other things: \"That such practices result in the following: unfair agreements of retainer; maintenance by lawyers of some system of obtaining prompt information of accidents; congestion of court calendars by unworthy causes which are never intended to be brought to trial; a false conception by lawyers engaged in this practice that the relationship between attorney and client is a commercial transaction in which the interest of the client plays an unimportant part; impairment of public confidence in the Courts; and delay in the administration of justice.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Upon Mr. Justice Arkwright's retirement on December 31, 1958, the Appellate Division designated Mr. Justice Edward G. Baker of the New York Supreme Court as his successor.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Each appellant was enlarged on bail after serving two days of his sentence.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] \"Final judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had, may be reviewed by the Supreme Court as follows:\n\n.  .   .  .  .\n\n\"(2) By appeal, where is drawn in question the validity of a statute of any state on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties or laws of the United States, and the decision is in favor of its validity.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] In investigations of this kind New York has deemed \"the presence of lawyers . . . not conducive to the economical and thorough ascertainment of the facts.\" In re Groban, \n352 \nU.S. 330, 335\n, 336 (concurring opinion). In an interim report, release of which was authorized by the Appellate Division, Mr. Justice Arkwright stated that from March of 1957 to June of 1958 the Inquiry issued 4,875 \"request\" subpoenas, 2,150 witness and duces tecum subpoenas, and examined the records of approximately 5,000 insurance companies. During the same period the Inquiry's staff examined informally about 2,500 persons, and from May of 1957 to June of 1958 some 726 witnesses were interrogated before the Special Term itself.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] \"Any statute or rule to the contrary notwithstanding, all papers, records and documents upon the application or examination of any person for admission as an attorney and counsellor at law and upon any complaint, inquiry, investigation or proceeding relating to the \n\n[360 \nU.S. 287, 293]\n\u00a0\n conduct or discipline of an attorney or attorneys, shall be sealed and be deemed private and confidential. However, upon good cause being shown, the justices of the appellate division having jurisdiction are empowered, in their discretion, by written order, to permit to be divulged all or any part of such papers, records and documents. In the discretion of the presiding or acting presiding justice of said appellate division, such order may be made either without notice to the persons or attorneys to be affected thereby or upon such notice to them as he may direct. In furtherance of the purpose of this subdivision, said justices are also empowered, in their discretion, from time to time to make such rules as they may deem necessary. Without regard to the foregoing, in the event that charges are sustained by the justices of the appellate division having jurisdiction in any complaint, investigation or proceeding relating to the conduct or discipline of any attorney, the records and documents in relation thereto shall be deemed public records.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] A proposed bill would have added to the Civil Rights Law a new 12-a, providing as follows: \"Right of representation by counsel of persons called as witnesses in certain inquiries and investigations. Any person called as a witness by or before any . . . judicial investigating committee, . . . or before any judge, . . . authorized or directed to conduct any inquiry or investigation, whose testimony may tend to involve himself or any other person in any subsequent criminal or quasi-criminal prosecution or in any subsequent disciplinary proceeding for professional misconduct, . . . or the revocation or suspension of any license to engage in a profession, trade or business, shall have the right to be accompanied by his counsel who shall be entitled on behalf of his client to (a) object to the jurisdiction of the . . . inquiry . . . and to argue briefly thereon; (b) to confer privately with his client to advise him of his legal rights whenever his client requests such a conference; (c) to object to procedures deemed by him to violate his client's legal rights; and (d) question the witness on his behalf, at the conclusion of his direct testimony, on any matter relevant to the subject of the inquiry or investigation, subject to such reasonable limitations as may be imposed by the officer presiding at such inquiry or investigation.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] The Appellate Division's order establishing the Special Term provided \"that, for the purpose of protecting the reputation of innocent persons, the said inquiry and investigation shall be conducted in private, pursuant to the provisions of the Judiciary Law (Section 90, Subdivision 10); that all the facts, testimony and information adduced, and all papers relating to this inquiry and investigation, except this order, shall be sealed and be deemed confidential; and that none of such facts, testimony and information and none of the papers and proceedings herein, except this order, shall be made public or otherwise divulged until the further order of this court; and . . . that upon the conclusion of said inquiry and investigation the said Justice shall make and file with this court his report setting forth his proceedings, his findings and his recommendations.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] See p. 288, supra; Note 13, infra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Page's Ohio Rev. Code, 1954, 3737.13.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] In the interim report already mentioned, Note 5, supra, Mr. Justice Arkwright stated:\n\n\"We have been scrupulous in apprising all attorneys of the stated purposes of the Inquiry as laid down by the Appellate Division, and witnesses, whenever required, have been advised of their constitutional rights.\n\n\n\"As many as 30 persons sworn as witnesses before the Additional Special Term have, as is their unquestioned right, invoked their constitutional privilege against self-incrimination, including 11 attorneys and 10 doctors. Faced with this roadblock, Counsel for the Inquiry has been forced to develop and to present independent evidence of the facts.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] \". . . I indicated that we did not intend to pussyfoot with them, we were not trying to trap them in any manner, but that testimony and evidence had come before us in the course of our investigation that someone in the employ of the Gotham Claims Service [appellants' partnership] had, with some frequency, obtained statements from defendants [in pending or prospective negligence \n\n[360 \nU.S. 287, 297]\n\u00a0\n actions], holding themselves out to be from defendant's [insurance] carrier and also holding themselves out to be from other agencies, and in one instance the district attorney's office. That our investigation had disclosed that these statements had been tampered with, and that it was relative to this that we wished to speak to them to find out if these statements were actually taken by the Gotham Claims Service, for what attorneys these statements were taken, and whether the tampering was done by them or their employees or at the direction of some attorney.\n\n\"I told Mr. Zangara [appellants' counsel] that the interests of the Judicial Inquiry was primarily directed at the attorneys that they had done business with, that if they cooperated fully I felt that the Court would take that into consideration if something unethical had been done.\n\n\n\"I further stated that in my opinion there was prima facie evidence in the event that the clients decided to plead the Fifth Amendment, to refer this matter to the district attorney.\n\n\n\"I stated it was my opinion, I did not indicate that that would be done, I did not indicate that it was even being considered at the time. I was merely giving my opinion for which they had asked. I made it quite clear that this was all off the record, that they were asking what amounted to a favor, and I was being very frank and honest with them. And I was thanked for indicating to them what the picture was.\n\n.  .  .  .  .\n\n\n\n\"In fact, I remember indicating that any final action on the matter would have to be on the part of your Honor [the Justice in charge of the Inquiry] and that the Appellate Division would finally rule as to what would actually be done.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] The record shows that when appellants persisted in their recalcitrance despite the court's directions to answer, it called in counsel, informed him that it considered appellants' refusals contemptuous and directed him and appellants to reappear two days thereafter. At that time, the court heard argument by counsel why appellants should not be held in contempt. It then again told counsel that each appellant was \"here merely as a witness, not as a defendant, not as a respondent. You understand what I am talking about. You can explain that to him.\" The court next explained the procedure it would follow as to each appellant:\n\n\"We are going to ask him some of the questions that were asked before and if he wishes to consult you, we will give him every opportunity to do so at any time during the questioning or any time that I direct.\n\n\n\". . . if you will retire from the courtroom we will call . . . [him] to the stand.\"\n\n\n Appellants continued in refusing to answer. The court held them in contempt and recalled counsel for a hearing on the contention that their corridor conversation with the staff assistant established their status as defendants. It then heard argument by counsel on punishment, and imposed the challenged sentence.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN concur, dissenting.\n\nIn re Groban, \n352 \nU.S. 330\n, decided two years ago, upheld as constitutional the action of a state fire marshal in compelling persons suspected of burning a building to testify about the fire in secret and without benefit of the presence of their counsel. Four of us dissented on the ground that such secret inquisitions violated the Due \n\n[360 \nU.S. 287, 299]\n\u00a0\n Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In this case the Court upholds the action of a state judge in compelling testimony from persons suspected of getting statements of defendants in negligence cases under false pretenses and later \"tampering\" with these statements.\n*\n I think it violates due process for a judge no less than for a fire marshal to compel testimony to be given incommunicado. In fact it was Star Chamber judges who helped to make closed-door court proceedings so obnoxious in this country that the Bill of Rights guarantees public trials and the assistance of counsel. And secretly compelled testimony does not lose its highly dangerous potentialities merely because it represents only a \"preliminary inquisition . . . whereby the court is given information that may move it to other acts thereafter.\" Nor does this record justify a holding that this inquisition adopted the mantle of secrecy and barred counsel from the room out of tender solicitude for the reputation of the defendants in this contempt case. Doubtless the defendants' lawyer and the defendants themselves are at least as capable and perhaps as much interested in saving their reputations as the judge who is sending them to jail.\n\nThe naked, stark issue here is whether a judge, who must actually try cases in public - or any other government official for that matter - can consistently with due process compel persons to testify and perhaps to lay the groundwork for their later conviction of crime, in secret chambers, where counsel for the State can be present but where counsel for the suspect cannot. In upholding such secret inquisitions the Court once again retreats from what I conceive to be its highest duty, that of maintaining \n\n[360 \nU.S. 287, 300]\n\u00a0\n unimpaired the rights and liberties guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment and the Bill of Rights. Cf. Bartkus v. Illinois, \n359 \nU.S. 121\n; Frank v. Maryland, \n359 \nU.S. 360\n; Barenblatt v. United States, ante, p. 109; Uphaus v. Wyman, ante, p. 72. Here as in Groban my answer would be that no public official can constitutionally exercise such a dangerous power over any individual. I would therefore reverse this conviction.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Despite the judge's repeated statements that these persons were \"witnesses\" not defendants, the statement of a member of the judge's inquiry staff, set out in note 12 of the Court's opinion, makes it clear that they were suspected and under investigation for criminal conduct. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 287, 301]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","6":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nARROYO v.

Pp. 420-427.\n\n (a) On the record in this case, it is clear that what petitioner received were checks \"paid to a trust fund\" within the meaning of 302 (c) (5); and, therefore, the receipt of such checks was not a violation of 302 (b).

JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nSection 302 (b) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 provides: \"(b) It shall be unlawful for any representative of any employees who are employed in an industry affecting commerce to receive or accept, or to agree to receive or accept, from the employer of such employees any money or other thing of value.\" Under 302 (c) of the Act this broad prohibition is made inapplicable in five situations, one being, \"with respect to money or other thing of value paid to a trust fund established by such representative, for the sole and exclusive benefit of the employees of such employer . . .\" provided that the trust fund meets certain standards specified in that subsection.\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[359 \nU.S. 419, 421]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe petitioner, a representative of employees in an industry affecting commerce, was convicted in the United States District Court for Puerto Rico of violating 302 (b) of the Act by receiving $15,000 from two of their employers.\n2\n The judgment of conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. 256 F.2d 549. Certiorari was granted because the case presents an important question as to the scope of this provision of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947. \n358 \nU.S. 812\n.\n\nThe facts are substantially undisputed. In 1953 the petitioner was president of a union which represented the employees of two affiliated corporations. In that capacity he negotiated a collective bargaining agreement with the employers. This agreement provided for the establishment of a welfare fund, which, it is unquestioned, met the requisite criteria of 302 (c) (5) of the Act. It was agreed that the petitioner would be the union representative on the joint committee which was to administer \n\n[359 \nU.S. 419, 422]\n\u00a0\n the fund.\n3\n After the agreement was signed, the petitioner told the employers' representative that there was to be a union meeting that evening, and that he wanted to exhibit the welfare fund checks to the union members. Accordingly, the petitioner was given two checks for $7,500. Attached vouchers identified the checks as the employers' contributions to the welfare fund.\n\nInstead of subsequently depositing the checks in the existing welfare fund bank account, however, the petitioner used them to open an account in the name of the fund in another bank. A few days thereafter, he gave the bank a purported resolution from the union's board of directors authorizing withdrawals from this account upon his signature alone. As soon as the employers learned what had happened, they attempted to secure performance of the agreement for joint administration of the fund. Over a period of several months, however, the petitioner used the money for his own personal purposes and, after transferring the funds to another account, for nonwelfare union purposes as well.\n\nThe Government does not maintain that embezzlement by an employee representative from an employer-financed welfare fund would violate the federal statute under which the petitioner was convicted.\n4\n It contends, however, that \n\n[359 \nU.S. 419, 423]\n\u00a0\n in this case the jury could properly find that the petitioner when he accepted the two checks intended to use the funds for his personal purposes, and that he was therefore guilty not of embezzlement, but of conduct amounting to larceny by trick. We agree that the evidence could properly support an inference that the petitioner's purpose from the outset was to appropriate the two checks for his own use. We cannot agree, however, that this conduct violated 302 (b) of the Act.\n\nSection 302 (b) is a reciprocal of 302 (a), applicable to employers, which provides that \"(a) It shall be unlawful for any employer to pay or deliver, or to agree to pay or deliver, any money or other thing of value to any representative of any of his employees who are employed in an industry affecting commerce.\" The good faith of the employers in delivering the two checks to the petitioner - their intent that the money go to the welfare fund created by the collective bargaining agreement - was not questioned throughout the trial and is not questioned here.\n5\n The sole purpose of the delivery of the checks, therefore, was to make a lawful payment. What the petitioner received were checks \"paid to a trust fund.\" The transaction, therefore, was within the precise language of 302 (c), and thus was not a violation of 302 (b).\n\nThis is not to say that the statute requires mutuality of guilt for the conviction of either the employer or the representative of employees. An employer might be guilty under subsection (a) if he paid money to a representative \n\n[359 \nU.S. 419, 424]\n\u00a0\n of employees even though the latter had no intention of accepting. Cf. Lunsford v. United States, 200 F.2d 237; Schneider v. United States, 192 F.2d 498. A representative might be guilty if he coerced payments from an innocent and unwilling employer. Cf. United States v. Waldin, 149 F. Supp. 912, aff'd 253 F.2d 551. Both would be guilty if the payment were ostensibly made for one of the lawful purposes specified in 302 (c) if both knew that such a purpose was merely a sham.\n\nThe present case, however, is not an analogue to any of those situations. The checks were drawn by the employers and delivered to the petitioner as payment to a union welfare fund. Their receipt by him, therefore, was not a violation of the federal statute, whether his intent to misappropriate existed at the time of receipt or was formed later.\n\nWe construe a criminal statute. \"It is the legislature, not the Court, which is to define a crime, and ordain its punishment.\" United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76, 95; United States v. Halseth, \n342 \nU.S. 277\n; Krichman v. United States, \n256 \nU.S. 363\n. We are mindful, of course, that, \"though penal laws are to be construed strictly, they are not to be construed so strictly as to defeat the obvious intention of the legislature.\" United States v. Wiltberger, supra, at 95. As Mr. Justice Holmes put it, \"We agree to all the generalities about not supplying criminal laws with what they omit, but there is no canon against using common sense in construing laws as saying what they obviously mean.\" Roschen v. Ward, \n279 \nU.S. 337, 339\n.\n\nAn examination of the legislative history confirms that a literal construction of this statute does no violence to common sense. When Congress enacted 302 its purpose was not to assist the States in punishing criminal conduct traditionally within their jurisdiction, but to deal with \n\n[359 \nU.S. 419, 425]\n\u00a0\n problems peculiar to collective bargaining. The provision was enacted as part of a comprehensive revision of federal labor policy in the light of experience acquired during the years following passage of the Wagner Act, and was aimed at practices which Congress considered inimical to the integrity of the collective bargaining process.\n\nThroughout the debates in the Seventy-ninth and Eightieth Congresses there was not the slightest indication that 302 was intended to duplicate state criminal laws.\n6\n Those members of Congress who supported the amendment were concerned with corruption of collective bargaining through bribery of employee representatives \n\n[359 \nU.S. 419, 426]\n\u00a0\n by employers,\n7\n with extortion by employee representatives,\n8\n and with the possible abuse by union officers of the power which they might achieve if welfare funds were left to their sole control. Congressional attention was focussed particularly upon the latter problem because of the demands which had then recently been made by a large international union for the establishment of a welfare fund to be financed by employers' contributions and administered exclusively by union officials. See United States v. Ryan, \n350 \nU.S. 299\n.\n\nCongress believed that if welfare funds were established which did not define with specificity the benefits payable thereunder, a substantial danger existed that such funds might be employed to perpetuate control of union officers, for political purposes, or even for personal gain. See 92 Cong. Rec. 4892-4894, 4899, 5181, 5345-5346; S. Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., at 52; 93 Cong. Rec. 4678, 4746-4747. To remove these dangers, specific standards were established to assure that welfare funds would be established only for purposes which Congress considered proper and expended only for the purposes for which they were established. See Cox, Some Aspects of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, 61 Harv. L. Rev. 274, 290. Continuing compliance with these standards in the \n\n[359 \nU.S. 419, 427]\n\u00a0\n administration of welfare funds was made explicitly enforceable in federal district courts by civil proceedings under 302 (e).\n9\n The legislative history is devoid of any suggestion that defalcating trustees were to be held accountable under federal law, except by way of the injunctive remedy provided in that subsection.\n\nWithout doubt the petitioner's conduct was reprehensible and immoral. It can be assumed also that he offended local criminal law. But, for the reasons stated, we hold that he did not criminally violate 302 (b) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The relevant text of 302 (c), as it appears in 29 U.S.C. 186 (c) is as follows: \"(c) The provisions of this section shall not be applicable . . . (5) with respect to money or other thing of value paid to a trust fund established by such representative, for the sole and exclusive benefit of the employees of such employer, and their families and dependents (or of such employees, families, and dependents jointly with the employees of other employers making similar payments, and their families and dependents): Provided, That (A) such payments are held in trust for the purpose of paying, either from principal or income or both, for the benefit of employees, their families and dependents, for medical or hospital care, pensions on retirement or death of employees, compensation for injuries or illness resulting from occupational activity or insurance to provide any of the foregoing, or unemployment benefits or life insurance, disability and sickness insurance, or accident insurance; (B) the detailed basis on which such payments are to be made is specified in a written agreement with the employer, and employees and employers are equally represented in the administration of such fund, together with such neutral persons as the representatives of the employers and the representatives of the employees may agree upon and in the event the employer and employee groups deadlock on the administration of such fund and there are no neutral persons empowered to break such deadlock, such agreement provides that \n\n[359 \nU.S. 419, 421]\n\u00a0\n the two groups shall agree on an impartial umpire to decide such dispute, or in event of their failure to agree within a reasonable length of time, an impartial umpire to decide such dispute shall, on petition of either group, be appointed by the district court of the United States for the district where the trust fund has its principal office, and shall also contain provisions for an annual audit of the trust fund, a statement of the results of which shall be available for inspection by interested persons at the principal office of the trust fund and at such other places as may be designated in such written agreement; and (C) such payments as are intended to be used for the purpose of providing pensions or annuities for employees are made to a separate trust which provides that the funds held therein cannot be used for any purpose other than paying such pensions or annuities.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Sentence was imposed under authority of 302 (d) of the Act, which provides: \"(d) Any person who willfully violates any of the provisions of this section shall, upon conviction thereof, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a fine of not more than $10,000 or to imprisonment for not more than one year, or both. . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The fund was to be identical in amount and purpose to a welfare fund which had been created in 1952 under a previous collective bargaining agreement. The petitioner had also been the union representative on the committee which administered that fund.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Compare S. 3974, 109 (a), 85th Cong., 2d Sess., the so-called Kennedy-Ives bill, which would have provided criminal penalties of up to five years' imprisonment and a fine of $10,000 for \"Any person who embezzles, steals, or unlawfully and willfully abstracts or converts to his own use or the use of another any of the moneys, funds, securities, property, or other assets of an organization which is exempt from taxation under section 501 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 of which he is an officer or by whom he is employed directly or indirectly . . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] In argument to the trial court, government counsel made the following statement: \"The employer in this case, I would like to say, complied with the law. The employer set up a welfare fund in accordance with the law, and in accordance with the testimony by Mr. Goyco and other documentary evidence, the letter to the Banco de Ponce, the employer did all it could to make compliance with the law, because there could be a lawful welfare fund, so that's as far as the employer is concerned.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Section 302 had its origin in an amendment to the Case bill, H. R. 4908, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., proposed by Senator Byrd, 92 Cong. Rec. 4809, which prohibited payment by an employer, or receipt by a representative, of any money or other thing of value unless the payment was for wages or for union dues withheld by the employer under a checkoff agreement. After several modifications, including one substantially similar to subsection (c) (5) which was proposed by Senators Taft and Ball, the amendment was agreed to by the Senate, 92 Cong. Rec. 5521-5522, and the Case bill passed. 92 Cong. Rec. 5739. The House accepted the Senate amendments, 92 Cong. Rec. 5946, but the President vetoed the bill, 92 Cong. Rec. 6674-6678, and it failed of passage over his veto. 92 Cong. Rec. 6678.\n\nIn the Eightieth Congress the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare reported out an original bill, S. 1126, containing no reference to payments by an employer to a representative other than that which had been contained in 8 (2) of the Wagner Act. A minority of the Committee, including Senators Taft and Ball, filed their \"Supplemental Views\" in which they stated their intention to offer from the floor \"an amendment reinserting in the bill a provision regarding so-called welfare funds similar to the section in the Case bill approved by the Senate at the last session.\" S. Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 52. The amendment was adopted by the Senate, 93 Cong. Rec. 4754, accepted by the Conference Committee, H. R. Rep. No. 510, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 24-25, 67, and enacted as 302 of the Labor Management Relations Act.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] In explaining the necessity for adoption of the amendment which he offered to the Case bill, Senator Byrd stated: \"My amendment would prevent an employer from paying a royalty to the representative of a union. He would be clearly liable, under the provisions of this amendment, if he paid a royalty or other money to the representative of a labor union, the purpose of which was to bribe that representative.\" 92 Cong. Rec. 4893. See also 92 Cong. Rec. 5428; 93 Cong. Rec. 4678.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Senator Taft, in speaking for the amendment to S. 1126 which had previously been proposed on the floor of the Senate by Senator Ball, stated that it was intended to deal with \"extortion or a case where the union representative is shaking down the employer.\" 93 Cong. Rec. 4746.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] \"(e) The district courts of the United States and the United States courts of the Territories and possessions shall have jurisdiction, for cause shown, and subject to the provisions of section 381 of Title 28 (relating to notice to opposite party) to restrain violations of this section, without regard to the provisions of section 17 of Title 15 and section 52 of this title, and the provisions of sections 101-110 and 113-115 of this title.\" 29 U.S.C. 186 (e).\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK, with whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER join, dissenting.\n\nThe Court sets petitioner free. In so doing, it assumes that he violated local criminal law, but holds that he did not offend 302 (b) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947. It is admitted that the petitioner, as a representative of employees who are employed in an industry affecting commerce, accepted two checks for $7,500 each from employers. Instead of subsequently depositing these checks in the existing welfare fund bank account, withdrawals from which required the joint signatures of the petitioner and a representative of the employers, he deposited the checks in another bank. Six days thereafter he presented to the latter bank a spurious resolution authorizing withdrawals from this account upon petitioner's \n\n[359 \nU.S. 419, 428]\n\u00a0\n signature alone. Admittedly petitioner used the money in this account for his own personal purposes. Several months thereafter the balance in the account was transferred to another account in another bank and the funds therefrom were likewise used for nonwelfare purposes. The theory of the Court seems to be that since the employers issued the two checks in good faith, with the intent that the money go to the welfare fund of the union, the receipt of the checks was therefore for the sole purpose of completing this lawful payment. Hence, the Court reasons, \"[w]hat the petitioner received were checks `paid to a trust fund.' The transaction, therefore, was within the precise language of 302 (c), and thus was not a violation of 302 (b).\" The Court further states that this conclusion would follow \"whether his [petitioner's] intent to misappropriate existed at the time of receipt or was formed later.\"\n\nIt is true that the employers had written on the vouchers attached to the checks, \"Covering: Welfare fund for the year 1953, in accordance with contract signed on Feb. 21, 1953.\" The Court says that by these tags you shall know the nature of this fund. I think the Court has reached the wrong result by a failure to distinguish between the lawful fund set up under the collective bargaining agreement, and the spurious fund set up by petitioner.\n\nIt is well that we review the uncontradicted evidence. The bargaining agreement provided that each employer should establish a $15,000 welfare fund which \"shall be used to furnish and provide the workers of the Employer covered by this Agreement and the members of their direct family\" with certain welfare benefits. It further provided that the fund should be administered by a committee appointed by mutual agreement. This committee was composed of the petitioner and the representative of the employers. The evidence showed that the fund was to be identical in amount and purpose to a welfare fund \n\n[359 \nU.S. 419, 429]\n\u00a0\n which had been created in 1952 in a previous collective bargaining agreement. An existing bank account at the Banco de Ponce contained the balance left over from the 1952 welfare fund. In previous years the employer contributions to the welfare fund had been deposited directly by the employers into this welfare account. It was a joint account authorizing withdrawal of funds only on the joint signature of the employer representative as well as the petitioner.\n\nIt appears, however, that after the signing of the 1953 agreement the petitioner requested the employers to issue the checks and give them to him on the ruse that he would like to exhibit them to the union meeting which was to be held that evening. The employers issued and delivered the checks to the petitioner for deposit in the existing trust fund. The checks were made payable, however, to the union, rather than to the welfare fund; and, as I have stated, the petitioner opened up a new bank account in the National City Bank instead of depositing the checks in the old trust fund account. This new account was in the name of the union, and, while it was labeled as a welfare fund, withdrawals therefrom could be made on the signature of the petitioner alone. After so establishing the account under his exclusive control, petitioner then withdrew large sums of money for his personal use.\n\nThe indictment charged petitioner with receiving the $15,000 for his own use and specifically charged \"nor was such sum of money received as a payment to a trust fund.\" As the Court says, the evidence properly supports \"an inference that the petitioner's purpose from the outset was to appropriate the two checks for his own use.\" The fact of the matter is that the evidence shows that the petitioner's action in so receiving the checks was contrary to the agreement between the parties and in no wise complied with provisions of 302 (c) (5). In the light of the circumstances, as the jury found, there was no payment \n\n[359 \nU.S. 419, 430]\n\u00a0\n to a trust fund as specifically required by the provisions of the Act.\n\nI am sure that the Court agrees that the petitioner's conduct came within the \"broad prohibition\" of 302 (b). The only question, therefore, is whether he may properly be exculpated by the provisions of subsection (c) (5), which is quoted in full in the margin.\n1\n Two conclusions, \n\n[359 \nU.S. 419, 431]\n\u00a0\n implicitly drawn by the jury, emerge as indisputable when the evidence is compared with this subsection. In the first place, the statutory exception applies only when the money or other thing of value is \"paid to a trust fund,\" and it is clear that insofar as a lawful fund was in existence the checks were not \"paid\" to it. They were made out payable to the union. Neither the checks nor the money from them ever came near the bona fide trust fund account at the Banco de Ponce. From the moment they were received by petitioner, he had complete control over them.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nSecondly, even a casual reading of the subsection shows, as I am sure the Court itself would agree, that the spurious fund established by the petitioner in the National City Bank failed to comply with the statute in almost every respect. Since the checks were deposited in a union account and subject to the control of petitioner, the payments were not held in trust, as required by the subsection. Moreover, the fund which he created by depositing the checks was not subject to the administration of both the employees and the employers, but was subject to the sole control of the petitioner. As the judge instructed the jury, \"a plan does not exist, lawfully exist, until it meets all those requirements\" of the subsection. Since the sole purpose of the exception as set out in the Act was to permit the creation of a bona fide trust fund, it is obvious that the purposes of the Act were not complied with here because petitioner established no trust fund whatsoever. On the contrary, the checks were made \n\n[359 \nU.S. 419, 432]\n\u00a0\n payable to, and deposited in the name of, the union of which the petitioner was the President. His was the only authorized signature permitting withdrawals from the fund. In fact, the receipt of the checks by the petitioner as trust fund moneys was merely a sham. It does not matter what the intent of the employers was in delivering the checks since, as the Court itself says, the statute does not require mutuality of guilt.\n3\n The petitioner, by receiving the checks from the employers and through artifice and deceit, has deprived the employees of their benefits and stands guilty under 302 (b) of the Act.\n\nMoreover, the legislative history shows that that was the specific intent of the Congress. I need only quote one statement of the managers of the bill in the Senate:\n\n \"[U]nless we make sure that such [trust] funds, when they are established, are really trust funds . . . for the benefit to employees specified in the agreement, there is very grave danger that the funds will be used for the personal gain of union leaders . . . .\" 93 Cong. Rec. 4678.\n\n\n Furthermore, the Court itself recognizes this to be the purpose of the Congress in enacting the subsection. As the Court says:\n\n \"Congress believed that if welfare funds were established which did not define with specificity the benefits payable thereunder, a substantial danger existed that such funds might be employed to perpetuate control of union officers, for political purposes, or even for personal gain . . . . To remove these dangers, specific standards were established to assure that welfare funds would be established only for purposes which Congress considered proper and expended only for purposes for which they were established.\" \n\n[359 \nU.S. 419, 433]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Unfortunately, the Court has converted the \"substantial danger\" into an immunity bath. Section 302 (b) is in all practical effect repealed. All that labor racketeers, or, for that matter, employers as well, need do is to negotiate an agreement containing a qualifying \"welfare fund\" and then make sure that the vouchers on the employer checks contain some kind of notation that the money is paid for that fund. Although the Court says, \"Both would be guilty if the payment were ostensibly made for one of the lawful purposes specified in 302 (c) if both knew that such a purpose was merely a sham,\" it is clear that the injection of this subtle and elusive mental element of duplicity is enough to make successful prosecution next to impossible.\n\nNor is the fact that the petitioner might be prosecuted under state law any answer to the problem. In a long line of cases coming to this Court involving industrial controversies where the State exercised authority, it has been held that the area involved had been pre-empted by the National Labor Relations Act and the Labor Management Relations Act. See Weber v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., \n348 \nU.S. 468\n (1955). It is a strange contradiction here for the Court to force employees to go to the state courts for redress of this most important sanction of the Labor Management Relations Act. Petitioner argues, and the Court sustains him, that he can only be prosecuted for embezzlement, a felony under the laws of Puerto Rico;\n4\n that he cannot be convicted of this misdemeanor under the Taft-Hartley law.\n5\n The opinion today may make this common, but it does not make it sense. I would affirm.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"(c) The provisions of this section shall not be applicable . . . (5) with respect to money or other thing of value paid to a trust fund established by such representative, for the sole and exclusive benefit of the employees of such employer, and their families and dependents (or of such employees, families, and dependents jointly with the employees of other employers making similar payments, and their families and dependents): Provided, That (A) such payments are held in trust for the purpose of paying, either form principal or income or both, for the benefit of employees, their families and dependents, for medical or hospital care, pensions on retirement or death of employees, compensation for injuries or illness resulting from occupational activity or insurance to provide any of the foregoing, or unemployment benefits or life insurance, disability and sickness insurance, or accident insurance; (B) the detailed basis on which such payments are to be made is specified in a written agreement with the employer, and employees and employers are equally represented in the administration of such fund, together with such neutral persons as the representatives of the employers and the representatives of the employees may agree upon and in the event the employer and employee groups deadlock on the administration of such fund and there are no neutral persons empowered to break such deadlock, such agreement provides that the two groups shall agree on an impartial umpire to decide such dispute, or in the event of their failure to agree within a reasonable length of time, an impartial umpire to decide such dispute shall, on petition of either group, be appointed by the district court of the United States for the district where the trust fund has its principal office, and shall also contain provisions for an annual audit of the trust fund, a statement of the results of which shall be available for inspection by interested persons at the principal office of the trust fund and at such other places as may be designated in such written agreement; and (C) such payments as are intended to be used for the purpose of \n\n[359 \nU.S. 419, 431]\n\u00a0\n providing pensions or annuities for employees are made to a separate trust which provides that the funds held therein cannot be used for any purpose other than paying such pensions or annuities.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] If the voucher had said \"in payment of 1952 federal income taxes,\" and petitioner had put the checks in a bank account labeled \"United States Treasury,\" query: would the companies' income taxes have been \"paid\"?\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] We in nowise intimate or suggest that these employers violated the Act.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Laws of Puerto Rico Ann., Tit. 33, 1721, 1731, 1683.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Petitioner's argument in this regard also shows that this is not an instance where, even in the absence of bad faith, a man is sent to jail for an inadvertent failure to comply with rigid bookkeeping requirements.

CO. v. PUB. SERV. COMM'N(1959)\nNo. 518\nArgued: Decided: June 22, 1959\n\n\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Together with No. 536, Tennessee Gas Transmission Co. v. Public Service Commission of New York et al., also on certiorari to the same Court.\n\n Four independent producers applied to the Federal Power Commission under 7 (e) of the Natural Gas Act for a certificate of convenience and necessity authorizing the sale to an interstate pipeline company of an enormous quantity of natural gas from wells in the Gulf of Mexico off the shore of Louisiana at a much higher rate than the pipeline company was then paying for gas. The pipeline company intervened, as did some of its distributor customers and other interested parties, the latter urging a lower rate. After twice refusing to issue the certificate on the ground that the record was insufficient to support a finding that public convenience and necessity required the sale at the proposed rate, the Commission was told that the producers would not dedicate the gas to the interstate market unless a permanent certificate was granted unconditionally and at the rate proposed. Upon rehearing, but without additional evidence, the Commission then issued such a certificate. Held:\n\n 1. The facts that the producers limited their application to a firm price agreed upon between them and the pipeline company, refused to accept certification at a lower price, and threatened to cancel the contract and withhold the gas from interstate commerce did not deprive the Commission of jurisdiction. Pp. 387-388.\n\n\n 2. The order of the Commission granting the certificates was in error, and it must be vacated and the case remanded to the Commission for further proceedings. Pp. 382, 388-394.\n\n\n  (a) In view of the framework in which the Commission is authorized and directed to act and the inordinate delay presently existing in proceedings under 5 to review rates initially certificated, the initial certificating of a proposal under 7 (e) as being \n\n[360 \nU.S. 378, 379]\n\u00a0\n required by public convenience and necessity is crucial and a permanent certificate should not be issued unless the proposed rate has been shown to be in the public interest. Pp. 388-391.\n\n\n  (b) When the price proposed in an application under 7 (e) is not in keeping with the public interest because it is out of line or because its approval might trigger general price rises or an increase in the applicant's existing rates, the Commission, in the exercise of its discretion, may attach such conditions as it may deem necessary. P. 391.\n\n\n  (c) In granting such conditional certificates, the Commission does not determine initial prices nor does it overturn those agreed upon by the parties. Rather it so conditions the certificates that the consuming public may be protected while the justness and reasonableness of the prices fixed by the parties are being determined under other sections of the Act. Pp. 391-392.\n\n\n  (d) If unconditional certificates are issued where the rate is not clearly shown to be required by the public convenience and necessity, relief is limited to 5 proceedings, and full protection of the public interest is not afforded. P. 392.\n\n\n  (e) The record contains insufficient evidence to support a finding of public convenience and necessity prerequisite to the issuance of permanent certificates. Pp. 392-394.\n\n\n 257 F.2d 717, affirmed on different grounds.\n\nDavid T. Searls argued the cause for petitioners in No. 518. With him on a brief for petitioners were Roy W. Johns, Charles B.

Kadane and Bertram D. Moll.\n\nWillard W. Gatchell, Howard E. Wahrenbrock and William W. Ross filed a brief for the Federal Power Commission as amicus curiae.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis proceeding tests the jurisdiction, as well as the discretion, of the Federal Power Commission in the certificating of the sale of natural gas under 7 (e) of the Natural Gas Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 821, 56 Stat. 84, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 717 et seq.\n1\n The Commission has issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity to petitioners, producers of natural gas,\n2\n to sell to petitioner Tennessee Gas Transmission Co. 1.67 trillion cubic feet of natural gas at an initial price of 22.4 cents per MCF, \n\n[360 \nU.S. 378, 381]\n\u00a0\n including a tax of 1 cent per MCF. Continental Oil Co., 17 F. P. C. 880. In the same proceeding and on the same evidence it had twice refused to issue such an unconditional certificate because of insufficient evidence or testimony \"on which to base a finding that the public convenience and necessity requires the sale of these volumes of gas at the particular rate level here proposed.\" On the second occasion it proposed to petitioners that the certificates be conditioned upon an initial price of 18 cents per MCF (including the 1-cent tax), to be increased to 22.4 cents per MCF (including the 1-cent tax) after the first 24-hour delivery period, the latter rate to be subjected to the \"just and reasonable\" provisions of 4 of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 717c. The petitioners refused this proposal, and Tennessee advised the Commission that unless the certificates were issued without such conditions, CATCO would not dedicate its gas to the interstate market. Upon rehearing, after argument but without additional evidence, the Commission issued the certificates declaring \"important as is the issue of price, that as far as the public is concerned, the precise charge that is made initially is less important than the assurance of this great supply of gas\" for interstate markets. 17 F. P. C., at 881.\n\nThe respondents, other than the Public Service Commission of the State of New York, are public utilities in New York and New Jersey. They buy gas from petitioner Tennessee for distribution in those States. They and the New York Commission oppose the issuance of the certificates on the ground that their issuance will increase the price of gas to consumers in those States, of whom there are over a million, using Tennessee's gas. Upon the issuance of the certificates the respondents filed petitions for review with the Court of Appeals. It held that \"Congress has not given the Commission power to inquire into the issue of public convenience and necessity where, as \n\n[360 \nU.S. 378, 382]\n\u00a0\n here, the applicant circumscribes the scope of that inquiry by attaching a condition to its application requiring the Commission to forego the consideration of an element which may be necessary in the formulation of its judgment.\" Public Service Comm'n of N. Y. v. Federal Power Comm'n, 257 F.2d 717, 723. Concluding that the Commission had no jurisdiction to conduct such \"a limited inquiry,\" ibid., it vacated the order granting the certificates and remanded the case to the Commission. The importance in the administration of the Act of the questions thus posed required the granting of certiorari, \n358 \nU.S. 926\n (1959). We have concluded that the Court of Appeals was in error in deciding that the Commission had no jurisdiction. However, for reasons hereafter developed we hold that the order of the Commission in granting the certificates was in error and we, therefore, affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\nThe natural gas involved here is of a Miocene sand located below seabed out in the Gulf of Mexico some 15 to 25 miles offshore from Cameron and Vermilion Parishes, Louisiana. The petitioners in No. 518 are each independent natural gas producers. They jointly own oil and gas leases (25% to each company) which they obtained from Louisiana covering large acreages of the Continental Shelf off the Louisiana coast. Jurisdiction over the Continental Shelf is claimed by the United States and the question is now in litigation. The Congress has continued existing leases in effect pending the outcome of the controversy over the title. 67 Stat. 462, 43 U.S.C. (Supp. I, 1954) 1331-1343. The four companies' joint venture has resulted in the discovery of huge fields of natural gas and they have dedicated some 1.75 trillion cubic feet of gas from 95,000 acres of their leases to the petitioner Tennessee Gas Transmission Company, a natural gas company subject to the jurisdiction of the \n\n[360 \nU.S. 378, 383]\n\u00a0\n Commission.\n3\n The latter is the petitioner in No. 536 which has been consolidated with No. 518.\n\nThe four contracts dedicating the gas to Tennessee run from each of the petitioner producers. The contracts call for an initial price of 22.4 cents per MCF for the gas, including 1-cent tax, with escalator clauses calling for periodic increases in specific amounts.\n4\n In addition, they provide for Tennessee to receive the gas at platforms on the well sites out some 15 to 25 miles in the Gulf. This requires it to build approximately 107 miles of pipeline from its nearest existing pipeline point to the offshore platforms at wellhead. The estimated cost was $16,315,412. It further appears that the necessity for the certificates was based on an application of Tennessee, Docket G-11107, in which Tennessee requested certification to enlarge and extend its facilities. This program included the building of a pipeline from southeast Louisiana to Portland, Tennessee, which would carry a large proportion of the gas from these leases. Its cost was estimated at $85,000,000. In addition the contracts provide that Tennessee give free carriage from the wells to the shore of all condensate or distillate in the gas for the account of producers who have the option to separate it from the gas at shore stations. We need not discuss the contract provisions more minutely, though respondents do claim that \n\n[360 \nU.S. 378, 384]\n\u00a0\n other requirements place a greater burden on Tennessee and in practical effect increase the stated price of the gas to it.\n\nThe Presiding Examiner on March 29, 1957, found that the sales were required by the public convenience and necessity. Continental Oil Co., 17 F. P. C. 563. While he found that the proposed price was higher than any price Tennessee was then paying, he pointed to other prices currently paid for onshore sales \"for smaller reserves and smaller future potentials.\" Id., at 571. The average weighted cost of gas to Tennessee he found would be increased, if the contract price was certificated, by .97 cent per MCF.\n5\n However, he said that no showing had been made that this would lead to an increase in Tennessee's rates to jurisdictional customers or result in an increase in the price governing its other purchases. He refused to condition the certificates on the acceptance of a lower price by the parties on the ground that no \"showing of imprudence or of abuse of discretion by management,\" ibid., had been made that indicated the proposed price could not be accepted temporarily as consistent with the public convenience and necessity, pending review in a 5 (a) proceeding. However, he did condition \n\n[360 \nU.S. 378, 385]\n\u00a0\n his recommendation on the approval of Tennessee's application in Docket G-11107 above mentioned.\n\nThe Commission, as we have indicated, took three strikes at the recommendations of the Examiner. On April 22 it reversed his finding on public convenience and necessity because the evidence was insufficient as to price. It said:\n\n\"The importance of this issue in certificating this sale cannot easily be overemphasized. This is the largest reserve ever committed to one sale. This is the first sale from the newly developed offshore fields from which large proportions of future gas supplies will be taken. This is the highest price level at which the sale of gas to Tennessee Gas has been proposed.\n\n\n \"These factors make it abundantly evident that, in the public interest, this crucial sale should not be permanently certificated unless the rate level has been shown to be in the public interest.\" Id., at 575.\n\n\n The Commission granted petitioners temporary certificates and remanded the proceeding to the Examiner \"to determine at what rates the public convenience and necessity requires these sales\" of natural gas to Tennessee under a permanent certificate. Id., at 576. The producers immediately moved for modification, asserting that they could not present sufficient evidence \"within any reasonable period in the future\" to meet the necessities of the remand and, further, could not \"afford to commence construction until at least the initial rate [question] is resolved.\" The Commission on May 20, however, reiterated its belief that \"the record does not contain sufficient evidence on which to base a finding that the public convenience and necessity requires the sale of the gas at that particular rate level.\" 17 F. P. C. 732, 733-734. In an \n\n[360 \nU.S. 378, 386]\n\u00a0\n effort to ameliorate the situation represented by the producers, the Commission did grant the certificates but conditioned them upon the producers' acceptance of an initial price of 17 cents per MCF (plus the 1-cent tax), which was the highest price theretofore paid by Tennessee in the Southwest. It also agreed that one day after the commencement of deliveries of gas the 17-cent price would be escalated to 21.4 cents (plus 1 cent for taxes), the increase to be collected under bond, subject to proof and refund under the provisions of 4 of the Act. This time Tennessee sought rehearing advising the Commission that the producers would not accept the 17-cent initial price order of May 20 and that \"the contracts will be terminated\" with the consequent \"loss of natural gas supplies\" required for Tennessee's customers. The Commission, after oral argument, did not withdraw its previous findings in the matter but predicated its third order on \"the primary consideration that the public served through the Tennessee Gas system is greatly in need of increased supplies of natural gas. . . . In view of these circumstances and the fact that the record does not show that the 21.4-cent [plus 1 cent for taxes] rate is necessarily excessive, we agree with the presiding examiner that this certificate proceeding . . . should not assume the character of a rate proceeding under Section 5 (a).\" 17 F. P. C. 880, 881. Asserting that it was of the opinion that it would be able \"to adequately protect the public interest with respect to the matter of price,\" ibid., it ordered the certificates issued and directed that since the price \"is higher than Tennessee Gas is paying under any other contract, it should be subject to prompt investigation under Section 5 (a) as to its reasonableness.\" Id., at 882.\n\nWe note that the Commission did not seek certiorari here but has filed a brief amicus curiae.\n6\n It does not urge \n\n[360 \nU.S. 378, 387]\n\u00a0\n reversal of the judgment but attacks the ground upon which the Court of Appeals bottomed its remand, namely, lack of Commission jurisdiction to consider the limited proposal of petitioners. The Commission's brief suggests that the Court not reach the issue tendered by petitioners, i. e., must the Commission, in a 7 proceeding, decide whether the proposed initial rate is just and reasonable? Instead, the Commission says, if the judgment must be affirmed it would be better to base the affirmance on the ground that its order \"was not supported by sufficient evidence, and hence constituted an abuse of discretion in the circumstances of the particular case . . . .\" Brief for the Federal Power Commission, p. 31. Petitioners oppose such a disposition, contending the evidence was quite substantial.\n\n  I. JURISDICTION OF THE COMMISSION.\n\n\n The Court of Appeals thought that the Commission had no jurisdiction to consider petitioners' proposal because it was limited to a firm price agreed upon by the parties applicant. Their refusal to accept certification at a lower price, even to the extent of canceling their contracts and withholding the gas from interstate commerce, the court held, resulted in the Commission's losing jurisdiction. We do not believe that this follows. No sales, intrastate or interstate, of gas had ever been made from the leases involved here. The contracts under which the petitioners proposed to sell the gas in the interstate market were all conditioned on the issuance of certificates of public convenience and necessity. A failure by either party to secure such certificates rendered the contracts subject to termination. Certainly the filing of the application for a certificate did not constitute a dedication to the interstate market of the gas recoverable under these leases. Nor is there doubt that the producers were at liberty to refuse conditional certificates proposed by \n\n[360 \nU.S. 378, 388]\n\u00a0\n the Commission's second order. While the refusal might have been couched in more diplomatic language, it had no effect on the Commission's power to act on the rehearing requested. Even though the Commission did march up the hill only to march down again upon reaching the summit we cannot say that this about-face deprived it of jurisdiction. We find nothing illegal in the petitioners' rejection of the alternative price proposed by the Commission and their standing firm on their own.\n\n  II. THE VALIDITY OF THE ORDER.\n\n\n The purpose of the Natural Gas Act was to underwrite just and reasonable rates to the consumers of natural gas. Federal Power Comm'n v. Hope Natural Gas Co., \n320 \nU.S. 591\n (1944). As the original 7 (c) provided, it was \"the intention of Congress that natural gas shall be sold in interstate commerce for resale for ultimate public consumption for domestic, commercial, industrial, or any other use at the lowest possible reasonable rate consistent with the maintenance of adequate service in the public interest.\" 52 Stat. 825.\n7\n The Act was so framed as to afford consumers a complete, permanent and effective bond of protection from excessive rates and charges. The heart of the Act is found in those provisions requiring initially that any \"proposed service, sale, operation, construction, extension, or acquisition . . . will be required by the present or future public convenience and necessity,\" 7 (e), 15 U.S.C. 717f (e), and that all rates and charges \"made, demanded, or received\" shall be \"just and reasonable,\" 4, 15 U.S.C. 717c. The Act prohibits such movements unless and until the Commission \n\n[360 \nU.S. 378, 389]\n\u00a0\n issues a certificate of public convenience and necessity therefor, 7 (c), 15 U.S.C. 717f (c). Section 7 (e) vests in the Commission control over the conditions under which gas may be initially dedicated to interstate use. Moreover, once so dedicated there can be no withdrawal of that supply from continued interstate movement without Commission approval. The gas operator, although to this extent a captive subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, is not without remedy to protect himself. He may, unless otherwise bound by contract, United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., \n350 \nU.S. 332\n (1956), file new rate schedules with the Commission. This rate becomes effective upon its filing, subject to the 5-month suspension provision of 4 and the posting of a bond, where required. This not only gives the natural gas company opportunity to increase its rates where justified but likewise guarantees that the consumer may recover refunds for moneys paid under excessive increases. The overriding intent of the Congress to give full protective coverage to the consumer as to price is further emphasized in 5 of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 717d, which authorizes the Commission sua sponte, or otherwise, to institute an investigation into existing rates and charges and to fix them at a just and reasonable level. Under this section, however, the rate found by the Commission to be just and reasonable becomes effective prospectively only. Gas purchasers, therefore, have no protection from excessive charges collected during the pendency of a 5 proceeding.\n\nIn view of this framework in which the Commission is authorized and directed to act, the initial certificating of a proposal under 7 (e) of the Act as being required by the public convenience and necessity becomes crucial. This is true because the delay incident to determination in 5 proceedings through which initial certificated rates are reviewable appears nigh interminable. Although \n\n[360 \nU.S. 378, 390]\n\u00a0\n Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Wisconsin, \n347 \nU.S. 672\n, was decided in 1954, cases instituted under 5 are still in the investigative stage. This long delay, without the protection of refund, as is possible in a 4 proceeding, would provide a windfall for the natural gas company with a consequent squall for the consumers. This the Congress did not intend. Moreover, the fact that the Commission was not given the power to suspend initial rates under 7 makes it the more important, as the Commission itself says, that \"this crucial sale should not be permanently certificated unless the rate level has been shown to be in the public interest.\" 17 F. P. C. 563, 575.\n\nThis is especially true where, as here, the initial price will set a pattern in an area where enormous reserves of gas appear to be present. We note that in petitioners' proof a map of the Continental Shelf area off of the coast of Louisiana shows that the leases here involved cover but 17 out of a blocked-out area covering some 900 blocks of 5,000 acres each. The potential of this vast acreage, in light of discoveries already made as shown by the record, is stupendous. The Commission has found that the transaction here covers the largest reserve ever committed to interstate commerce in a single sale. Indications are that it is but a puff in comparison to the enormous potentials present under the seabed of the Gulf. The price certificated will in effect become the floor for future contracts in the area. This has been proven by conditions in southern Louisiana where prices have now vaulted from 17 cents to over 23 cents per MCF. New price plateaus will thus be created as new contracts are made and unless controlled will result in \"exploitation\" at the expense of the consumer, who eventually pays for the increases in his monthly bill.\n\nIt is true that the Act does not require a determination of just and reasonable rates in a 7 proceeding as it does in one under either 4 or 5. Nor do we hold that a \n\n[360 \nU.S. 378, 391]\n\u00a0\n \"just and reasonable\" rate hearing is a prerequisite to the issuance of producer certificates. What we do say is that the inordinate delay presently existing in the processing of 5 proceedings requires a most careful scrutiny and responsible reaction to initial price proposals of producers under 7. Their proposals must be supported by evidence showing their necessity to \"the present or future public convenience and necessity\" before permanent certificates are issued. This is not to say that rates are the only factor bearing on the public convenience and necessity, for 7 (e) requires the Commission to evaluate all factors bearing on the public interest. The fact that prices have leaped from one plateau to the higher levels of another, as is indicated here, does make price a consideration of prime importance. This is the more important during this formative period when the ground rules of producer regulation are being evolved. Where the application on its face or on presentation of evidence signals the existence of a situation that probably would not be in the public interest, a permanent certificate should not be issued.\n\nThere is, of course, available in such a situation, a method by which the applicant and the Commission can arrive at a rate that is in keeping with the public convenience and necessity. The Congress, in 7 (e), has authorized the Commission to condition certificates in such manner as the public convenience and necessity may require. Where the proposed price is not in keeping with the public interest because it is out of line or because its approval might result in a triggering of general price rises or an increase in the applicant's existing rates by reason of \"favored nation\" clauses or otherwise, the Commission in the exercise of its discretion might attach such conditions as it believes necessary.\n\nThis is not an encroachment upon the initial rate-making privileges allowed natural gas companies under the \n\n[360 \nU.S. 378, 392]\n\u00a0\n Act, United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., supra, but merely the exercise of that duty imposed on the Commission to protect the public interest in determining whether the issuance of the certificate is required by the public convenience and necessity, which is the Act's standard in 7 applications. In granting such conditional certificates, the Commission does not determine initial prices nor does it overturn those agreed upon by the parties. Rather, it so conditions the certificate that the consuming public may be protected while the justness and reasonableness of the price fixed by the parties is being determined under other sections of the Act. Section 7 procedures in such situations thus act to hold the line awaiting adjudication of a just and reasonable rate. Thus the purpose of the Congress \"to create a comprehensive and effective regulatory scheme,\" Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. v. Public Service Comm'n of Indiana, \n332 \nU.S. 507, 520\n (1947), is given full recognition. And 7 is given only that scope necessary for \"a single statutory scheme under which all rates are established initially by the natural gas companies, by contract or otherwise, and all rates are subject to being modified by the Commission . . . .\" United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., supra, at 341. On the other hand, if unconditional certificates are issued where the rate is not clearly shown to be required by the public convenience and necessity, relief is limited to 5 proceedings, and, as we have indicated, full protection of the public interest is not afforded.\n\nOur examination of the record here indicates that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of public convenience and necessity prerequisite to the issuance of the permanent certificates. The witnesses tendered developed little more information than was included in the printed contracts. As the proposed contract price was higher than any paid by Tennessee, including offshore \n\n[360 \nU.S. 378, 393]\n\u00a0\n production in the West Delta area of Louisiana, it is surprising that evidence, if available, was not introduced as to the relative costs of production in the two submerged areas. Moreover the record indicates that the proposed price was some 70% higher than the weighted average cost of gas to Tennessee; still no effort was made to give the \"reason why.\" More damaging, was the evidence that this price was greatly in excess of that which Tennessee pays from any lease in southern Louisiana. Likewise the $16,000,000 pipeline to the producers' wells was unsupported by evidence of practice or custom. Respondents contend - and it stands undenied - that this alone would add 2 cents per MCF to the cost of the gas. Again the free movement of distillates retained by the producers was \"shrugged off\" as being de minimis, without any supporting data whatever. Nor was the evidence as to whether the certification of this price would \"trigger\" increases in leases with \"favored nation\" clauses convincing, and the claim that it would not lead to an increase in rates by Tennessee was not only unsupported but has already proven unfounded.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nNor do we find any support whatever in the record for the conclusory finding on which the order was based that \"the public served through the Tennessee Gas system is greatly in need of increased supplies of natural gas.\" 17 F. P. C. 880, 881. Admittedly any such need was wrapped up in the Commission's action in Docket G-11107, where Tennessee was asking for permission to enlarge its facilities. However, the two dockets were not consolidated and the Presiding Examiner conditioned his approval here on the granting of the application in Docket G-11107, no part of which record is here. Neither is \n\n[360 \nU.S. 378, 394]\n\u00a0\n there evidence supporting the finding that the producers \"would seek to dispose of their gas elsewhere than to Tennessee Gas and the interstate market,\" ibid. While the Commission says that statements were made in argument, apparently by counsel, that this was the case, we find no such testimony. Since some 90% of all commercial gas moves into the interstate market, the sale of such vast quantities as available here would hardly be profitable except interstate.\n\nThese considerations require an affirmance of the judgment with instructions that the applications be remanded to the Commission for further proceedings.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 7 (e), 15 U.S.C. 717f (e), provides:\n\n\"(e) Except in the cases governed by the provisos contained in subsection (c) of this section, a certificate shall be issued to any qualified applicant therefor, authorizing the whole or any part of the operation, sale, service, construction, extension, or acquisition covered by the application, if it is found that the applicant is able and willing properly to do the acts and to perform the service proposed and to conform to the provisions of the Act and the requirements, rules, and regulations of the Commission thereunder, and that the proposed service, sale, operation, construction, extension, or acquisition, to the extent authorized by the certificate, is or will be required by the present or future public convenience and necessity; otherwise such application shall be denied. The Commission shall have the power to attach to the issuance of the certificate and to the exercise of the rights granted thereunder such reasonable terms and conditions as the public convenience and necessity may require.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] These are the Atlantic Refining Company, Cities Service Production Company, Continental Oil Company, and Tidewater Oil Company, all petitioners in No. 518 and sometimes known as CATCO.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Tennessee operates a pipeline system extending from gas fields in Texas and Louisiana through Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and into Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Connecticut. It serves some 80 distributing companies which in turn serve millions of consumers in the various States which its pipeline traverses.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] These increases were later limited to 2 cents per MCF. The escalator clauses apparently were inserted in lieu of \"favored nation\" clauses, but by letter, not a part of the contracts, \"favored nation\" clauses were to be substituted at a later date on certain contingencies.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The exact finding is as follows:\n\n\"Including the gas which Tennessee proposes to purchase under these contracts, some 240,000 M. c. f. per day (14.73 p. s. i. a.), it is estimated that the weighted average cost of all gas to Tennessee in 1958 will be some 13.70 cents per M. c. f., as compared with 12.73 cents if the gas here proposed to be purchased is excluded.\" 17 F. P. C. 563, 570.\n\n\n Thus is the .97-cent figure derived. It is, however, a misleading figure, for the estimate for 1958 includes the 22.4-cent gas for only two months of 1958, November and December. There is no indication in the record as to what the cost increase would be if the weighted average were calculated by including the 22.4-cent gas for the full year.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The brief is not signed by the Solicitor General but by both the General Counsel and the Solicitor of the Federal Power Commission.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The 1942 amendments to 7, 56 Stat. 83, were not intended to change this declaration of purpose. See Hearings, House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee, on H. R. 5249, 77th Cong., 1st Sess. 18-19; H. R. Rep. No. 1290, 77th Cong., 1st Sess.; S. Rep. No. 948, 77th Cong., 2d Sess.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Tennessee has subsequently filed an application with the F. P. C. requesting higher rates designed to produce some $19,000,000 additional annual revenue. Tennessee Gas Transmission Co., Docket G-17166.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER joins, concurring.\n\nI agree with the judgment of the Court on the ground that the findings upon which the Commission based its conclusion that the public convenience and necessity required the issuance to petitioners of unconditional final certificates find no support in the record. There is no evidence supporting what appear to be the crucial findings that (1) \"the public served through the Tennessee Gas system is greatly in need of increased supplies of natural gas,\" particularly insofar as this finding implies that this need is immediate and cannot be satisfied from Tennessee's existing reserves, and that (2) there was serious danger that producer petitioners' gas would be permanently lost to the interstate market unless an unconditional certificate were granted on their terms. This makes it unnecessary to consider at this stage any of the other questions sought to be presented by the parties. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 378, 395]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","8":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBAKER v.

Case argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\nThis action was commenced by the petitioners against the respondent railroad in a Texas State District Court, under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, 35 Stat. 65, as amended, 45 U.S.C. 51-60, to recover damages for the death of petitioners' decedent, Claude Baker, allegedly caused by the negligence of the respondent. Baker had been hired as a workman by W. H. Nichols & Co., Inc., which was engaged in work along the main line right of way of the respondent under a contract with it. The work consisted of \"grouting,\" or pumping sand and cement into the roadbed to strengthen and stabilize it. Baker was struck and killed by a train while engaged at this job. It was petitioners' contention in the trial court that Baker was killed while he was \"employed\" by respondent, within the meaning of 1 of the Act. Evidence on the question was introduced by the parties, and a special issue for the jury's determination was framed, but the judge declined to submit the issue to \n\n[359 \nU.S. 227, 228]\n\u00a0\n the jury, holding as a matter of law that Baker was not in such a relationship to the railroad at the time of his death as to entitle him to the protection of the Act. The Court of Civil Appeals affirmed the trial court's judgment for the respondent, 309 S. W. 2d 92, and the Texas Supreme Court refused an application for a writ of error. We granted certiorari, \n358 \nU.S. 878\n, to investigate whether such an issue is properly one for determination by the jury.\n\nThe Federal Employers' Liability Act does not use the terms \"employee\" and \"employed\" in any special sense, Robinson v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., \n237 \nU.S. 84, 94\n, so that the familiar general legal problems as to whose \"employee\" or \"servant\" a worker is at a given time present themselves as matters of federal law under the Act. See Linstead v. Chesapeake & Ohio R. Co., \n276 \nU.S. 28, 33\n-34. It has been well said of the question that \"[e]ach case must be decided on its peculiar facts and ordinarily no one feature of the relationship is determinative.\" Cimorelli v. New York Central R. Co., 148 F.2d 575, 577. Although we find no decision of this Court that has discussed the matter, we think it perfectly plain that the question, like that of fault or of causation under the Act, contains factual elements such as to make it one for the jury under appropriate instructions as to the various relevant factors under law. See Restatement, Agency 2d, 220, comment c; 227, comment a. Only if reasonable men could not reach differing conclusions on the issue may the question be taken from the jury. See Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v. Bond, \n240 \nU.S. 449\n. Here the petitioners introduced evidence tending to prove that the grouting work was part of the maintenance task of the railroad; that the road furnished the material to be pumped into the roadbed; and that a supervisor, admittedly in the employ of the railroad, in the daily course of the work exercised directive control over the details of the job performed \n\n[359 \nU.S. 227, 229]\n\u00a0\n by the individual workmen, including the precise point where the mixture should be pumped, when they should move to the next point, and the consistency of the mixture. The railroad introduced evidence tending to controvert this and further evidence tending to show that an employment relationship did not exist between it and Baker at the time of the accident. An issue for determination by the jury was presented. \"The very essence of . . . [the jury's] function is to select from among conflicting inferences and conclusions that which it considers most reasonable.\" Tennant v. Peoria & Pekin Union R.

UNITED STATES(1959)\nNo. 35\nArgued: November 18, 1958Decided: June 8, 1959\n\n\n\n\n Summoned to testify before a Subcommittee of the House of Representatives Committee on Un-American Activities, which was investigating alleged Communist infiltration into the field of education, petitioner, formerly a graduate student and teaching fellow at the University of Michigan, refused to answer questions as to whether he was then or had ever been a member of the Communist Party. He disclaimed reliance upon the privilege against self-incrimination, but objected generally to the right of the Subcommittee to inquire into his \"political\" and \"religious\" beliefs or any \"other personal or private affairs\" or \"associational activities\" upon grounds set forth in a previously prepared memorandum, which was based on the First, Ninth, and Tenth Amendments, the prohibition against bills of attainder and the doctrine of separation of powers. For such refusal, he was convicted of a violation of 2 U.S.C. 192, which makes it a misdemeanor for any person summoned as a witness by either House of Congress or a committee thereof to refuse to answer any question pertinent to the question under inquiry. He was fined and sentenced to imprisonment for six months. Held: Petitioner's conviction is sustained. Pp. 111-134.\n\n 1. In the light of the Committee's history and the repeated extensions of its life, as well as the successive appropriations by the House of Representatives for the conduct of its activities, its legislative authority and that of the Subcommittee to conduct the inquiry under consideration here is unassailable; and House Rule XI, 83d Congress, which defines the Committee's authority, cannot be said to be constitutionally infirm on the score of vagueness. Watkins v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 178\n, distinguished. Pp. 116-123.\n\n\n  (a) Rule XI has a \"persuasive gloss of legislative history\" which shows beyond doubt that, in pursuance of its legislative concerns in the domain of \"national security,\" the House of Representatives has clothed the Committee with pervasive authority to investigate Communist activities in this country. Pp. 117-121. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 110]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n  (b) In the light of the legislative history, Rule XI cannot be construed so as to exclude the field of education from the Committee's compulsory authority. Pp. 121-123.\n\n\n 2. The record in this case refutes petitioner's contention that he was not adequately apprised of the pertinency of the Subcommittee's questions to the subject matter of the inquiry. Watkins v. United States, supra, distinguished. Pp. 123-125.\n\n\n 3. On the record in this case, the balance between the individual and the governmental interests here at stake must be struck in favor of the latter, and, therefore, the provisions of the First Amendment were not transgressed by the Subcommittee's inquiry into petitioner's past or present membership in the Communist Party. Pp. 125-134.\n\n\n  (a) Where First Amendment rights are asserted to bar governmental interrogation, resolution of the issue always involves a balancing by the courts of the competing private and public interests at stake in the particular circumstances shown. Pp. 126-127.\n\n\n  (b) The investigation here involved was related to a valid legislative purpose, since Congress has wide power to legislate in the field of Communist activity in this Country and to conduct appropriate investigations in aid thereof. Pp. 127-129.\n\n\n  (c) Investigatory power in this domain is not to be denied Congress solely because the field of education is involved, and the record in this case does not indicate any attempt by the Committee to inquire into the content of academic lectures or discussions, but only to investigate the extent to which the Communist Party had succeeded in infiltrating into our educational institutions persons and groups committed to furthering the Party's alleged objective of violent overthrow of the Government. Sweezy v. New Hampshire, \n354 \nU.S. 234\n, distinguished. Pp. 129-132.\n\n\n  (d) On the record in this case, it cannot be said that the true objective of the Committee and of the Congress was purely \"exposure,\" rather than furtherance of a valid legislative purpose.

Fuchs and Leo A. Huard for the American Association of University Professors, and by Nathan Witt and John M. Coe for the National Lawyers Guild.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nOnce more the Court is required to resolve the conflicting constitutional claims of congressional power and of an individual's right to resist its exercise. The congressional power in question concerns the internal process of Congress in moving within its legislative domain; it involves the utilization of its committees to secure \"testimony needed to enable it efficiently to exercise a legislative function belonging to it under the Constitution.\" McGrain v. Daugherty, \n273 \nU.S. 135, 160\n. The power of inquiry has been employed by Congress throughout our history, over the whole range of the national interests concerning which Congress might legislate or decide upon due investigation not to legislate; it has similarly been utilized in determining what to appropriate from the national purse, or whether to appropriate. The scope of the power of inquiry, in short, is as penetrating and far-reaching as the potential power to enact and appropriate under the Constitution.\n\nBroad as it is, the power is not, however, without limitations. Since Congress may only investigate into those areas in which it may potentially legislate or appropriate, \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 112]\n\u00a0\n it cannot inquire into matters which are within the exclusive province of one of the other branches of the Government. Lacking the judicial power given to the Judiciary, it cannot inquire into matters that are exclusively the concern of the Judiciary. Neither can it supplant the Executive in what exclusively belongs to the Executive. And the Congress, in common with all branches of the Government, must exercise its powers subject to the limitations placed by the Constitution on governmental action, more particularly in the context of this case the relevant limitations of the Bill of Rights.\n\nThe congressional power of inquiry, its range and scope, and an individual's duty in relation to it, must be viewed in proper perspective. McGrain v. Daugherty, supra; Landis, Constitutional Limitations on the Congressional Power of Investigation, 40 Harv. L. Rev. 153, 214; Black, Inside a Senate Investigation, 172 Harpers Monthly 275 (February 1936). The power and the right of resistance to it are to be judged in the concrete, not on the basis of abstractions. In the present case congressional efforts to learn the extent of a nation-wide, indeed world-wide, problem have brought one of its investigating committees into the field of education. Of course, broadly viewed, inquiries cannot be made into the teaching that is pursued in any of our educational institutions. When academic teaching-freedom and its corollary learning-freedom, so essential to the well-being of the Nation, are claimed, this Court will always be on the alert against intrusion by Congress into this constitutionally protected domain. But this does not mean that the Congress is precluded from interrogating a witness merely because he is a teacher. An educational institution is not a constitutional sanctuary from inquiry into matters that may otherwise be within the constitutional legislative domain merely for the reason that inquiry is made of someone within its walls. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 113]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the setting of this framework of constitutional history, practice and legal precedents, we turn to the particularities of this case.\n\nWe here review petitioner's conviction under 2 U.S.C. 192\n1\n for contempt of Congress, arising from his refusal to answer certain questions put to him by a Subcommittee of the House Committee on Un-American Activities during the course of an inquiry concerning alleged Communist infiltration into the field of education.\n\nThe case is before us for the second time. Petitioner's conviction was originally affirmed in 1957 by a unanimous panel of the Court of Appeals, 100 U.S. App. D.C. 13, 240 F.2d 875. This Court granted certiorari, \n354 \nU.S. 930\n, vacated the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remanded the case to that court for further consideration in light of Watkins v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 178\n, which had reversed a contempt of Congress conviction, and which was decided after the Court of Appeals' decision here had issued. Thereafter the Court of Appeals, sitting en banc, reaffirmed the conviction by a divided court. 102 U.S. App. D.C. 217, 252 F.2d 129. We again granted certiorari, \n356 \nU.S. 929\n, to consider petitioner's statutory and constitutional challenges to his conviction, and particularly his claim that the judgment below cannot stand under our decision in the Watkins case.\n\nPursuant to a subpoena, and accompanied by counsel, petitioner on June 28, 1954, appeared as a witness before \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 114]\n\u00a0\n this congressional Subcommittee. After answering a few preliminary questions and testifying that he had been a graduate student and teaching fellow at the University of Michigan from 1947 to 1950 and an instructor in psychology at Vassar College from 1950 to shortly before his appearance before the Subcommittee, petitioner objected generally to the right of the Subcommittee to inquire into his \"political\" and \"religious\" beliefs or any \"other personal and private affairs\" or \"associational activities,\" upon grounds set forth in a previously prepared memorandum which he was allowed to file with the Subcommittee.\n2\n Thereafter petitioner specifically declined to answer each of the following five questions:\n\n \"Are you now a member of the Communist Party? [Count One.]\n\n\n \"Have you ever been a member of the Communist Party? [Count Two.]\n\n\n \"Now, you have stated that you knew Francis Crowley. Did you know Francis Crowley as a member of the Communist Party? [Count Three.]\n\n\n \"Were you ever a member of the Haldane Club of the Communist Party while at the University of Michigan? [Count Four.]\n\n\n \"Were you a member while a student of the University of Michigan Council of Arts, Sciences, and Professions?\" [Count Five.]\n\n\n In each instance the grounds of refusal were those set forth in the prepared statement. Petitioner expressly disclaimed reliance upon \"the Fifth Amendment.\"\n3\n\u00a0\n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 115]\n\u00a0\n\n\nFollowing receipt of the Subcommittee's report of these occurrences the House duly certified the matter to the District of Columbia United States Attorney for contempt proceedings. An indictment in five Counts, each embracing one of petitioner's several refusals to answer, ensued. With the consent of both sides the case was tried to the court without a jury, and upon conviction under all Counts a general sentence of six months' imprisonment and a fine of $250 was imposed.\n\nSince this sentence was less than the maximum punishment authorized by the statute for conviction under any one Count,\n4\n the judgment below must be upheld if the conviction upon any of the Counts is sustainable. See Claassen v. United States, \n142 \nU.S. 140, 147\n; Roviaro v. United States, \n353 \nU.S. 53\n; Whitfield v. Ohio, \n297 \nU.S. 431\n. As we conceive the ultimate issue in this case to be whether petitioner could properly be convicted of contempt for refusing to answer questions relating to his participation in or knowledge of alleged Communist Party activities at educational institutions in this country, we find it unnecessary to consider the validity of his conviction under the Third and Fifth Counts, the only ones involving questions which on their face do not directly relate to such participation or knowledge.\n\nPetitioner's various contentions resolve themselves into three propositions: First, the compelling of testimony by the Subcommittee was neither legislatively authorized nor constitutionally permissible because of the vagueness of Rule XI of the House of Representatives, Eighty-third Congress, the charter of authority of the parent Committee.\n5\n Second, petitioner was not adequately apprised of the pertinency of the Subcommittee's questions to the \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 116]\n\u00a0\n subject matter of the inquiry. Third, the questions petitioner refused to answer infringed rights protected by the First Amendment.\n\n SUBCOMMITTEE'S AUTHORITY TO COMPEL TESTIMONY.\n\n\n At the outset it should be noted that Rule XI authorized this Subcommittee to compel testimony within the framework of the investigative authority conferred on the Un-American Activities Committee.\n6\n Petitioner contends that Watkins v. United States, supra, nevertheless held the grant of this power in all circumstances ineffective because of the vagueness of Rule XI in delineating the Committee jurisdiction to which its exercise was to be appurtenant. This view of Watkins was accepted by two of the dissenting judges below. 102 U.S. App. D.C., at 124, 252 F.2d, at 136.\n\nThe Watkins case cannot properly be read as standing for such a proposition. A principal contention in Watkins was that the refusals to answer were justified because the requirement of 2 U.S.C. 192 that the questions asked be \"pertinent to the question under inquiry\" had not been satisfied. \n354 \nU.S., at 208\n-209. This Court reversed the conviction solely on that ground, holding that Watkins had not been adequately apprised of the subject matter of the Subcommittee's investigation or the pertinency \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 117]\n\u00a0\n thereto of the questions he refused to answer. Id., at 206-209, 214-215; and see the concurring opinion in that case, id., at 216. In so deciding the Court drew upon Rule XI only as one of the facets in the total mise en scene in its search for the \"question under inquiry\" in that particular investigation. Id., at 209-215. The Court, in other words, was not dealing with Rule XI at large, and indeed in effect stated that no such issue was before it, id., at 209. That the vagueness of Rule XI was not alone determinative is also shown by the Court's further statement that aside from the Rule \"the remarks of the chairman or members of the committee, or even the nature of the proceedings themselves, might sometimes make the topic [under inquiry] clear.\" Ibid. In short, while Watkins was critical of Rule XI, it did not involve the broad and inflexible holding petitioner now attributes to it.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nPetitioner also contends, independently of Watkins, that the vagueness of Rule XI deprived the Subcommittee of the right to compel testimony in this investigation into Communist activity. We cannot agree with this contention, which in its furthest reach would mean that the House Un-American Activities Committee under its existing authority has no right to compel testimony in any circumstances. Granting the vagueness of the Rule, we may not read it in isolation from its long history in the House of Representatives. Just as legislation is often given meaning by the gloss of legislative reports, administrative interpretation, and long usage, so the proper meaning of an authorization to a congressional committee is not to be derived alone from its abstract terms unrelated to the definite content furnished them by the course of congressional actions. The Rule comes to us with a \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 118]\n\u00a0\n \"persuasive gloss of legislative history,\" United States v. Witkovich, \n353 \nU.S. 194, 199\n, which shows beyond doubt that in pursuance of its legislative concerns in the domain of \"national security\" the House has clothed the Un-American Activities Committee with pervasive authority to investigate Communist activities in this country.\n\nThe essence of that history can be briefly stated. The Un-American Activities Committee, originally known as the Dies Committee, was first established by the House in 1938.\n8\n The Committee was principally a consequence of concern over the activities of the German-American Bund, whose members were suspected of allegiance to Hitler Germany, and of the Communist Party, supposed by many to be under the domination of the Soviet Union.\n9\n From the beginning, without interruption to the present time, and with the undoubted knowledge and approval of the House, the Committee has devoted a major part of its energies to the investigation of Communist activities.\n10\n More particularly, in 1947 the Committee announced \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 119]\n\u00a0\n a wide-range program in this field,\n11\n pursuant to which during the years 1948 to 1952 it conducted diverse inquiries into such alleged Communist activities as espionage; efforts to learn atom bomb secrets; infiltration into labor, farmer, veteran, professional, youth, and motion picture groups; and in addition held a number of hearings upon various legislative proposals to curb Communist activities.\n12\n\u00a0\n\nIn the context of these unremitting pursuits, the House has steadily continued the life of the Committee at the \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 120]\n\u00a0\n commencement of each new Congress;\n13\n it has never narrowed the powers of the Committee, whose authority has remained throughout identical with that contained in Rule XI; and it has continuingly supported the Committee's activities with substantial appropriations.\n14\n Beyond this, the Committee was raised to the level of a standing committee of the House in 1945, it having been but a special committee prior to that time.\n15\n\u00a0\n\nIn light of this long and illuminating history it can hardly be seriously argued that the investigation of Communist activities generally, and the attendant use of \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 121]\n\u00a0\n compulsory process, was beyond the purview of the Committee's intended authority under Rule XI.\n\nWe are urged, however, to construe Rule XI so as at least to exclude the field of education from the Committee's compulsory authority. Two of the four dissenting judges below relied entirely, the other two alternatively, on this ground. 102 U.S. App. D.C., at 224, 226, 252 F.2d, at 136, 138. The contention is premised on the course we took in United States v. Rumely, \n345 \nU.S. 41\n, where in order to avoid constitutional issues we construed narrowly the authority of the congressional committee there involved. We cannot follow that route here, for this is not a case where Rule XI has to \"speak for itself, since Congress put no gloss upon it at the time of its passage,\" nor one where the subsequent history of the Rule has the \"infirmity of post litem motam, self-serving declarations.\" See United States v. Rumely, supra, at 44-45, 48.\n\nTo the contrary, the legislative gloss on Rule XI is again compelling. Not only is there no indication that the House ever viewed the field of education as being outside the Committee's authority under Rule XI, but the legislative history affirmatively evinces House approval of this phase of the Committee's work. During the first year of its activities, 1938, the Committee heard testimony on alleged Communist activities at Brooklyn College, N. Y.\n16\n The following year it conducted similar hearings relating to the American Student Union and the Teachers Union.\n17\n The field of \"Communist influences in education\" was one of the items contained in the Committee's \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 122]\n\u00a0\n 1947 program.\n18\n Other investigations including education took place in 1952 and 1953.\n19\n And in 1953, after the Committee had instituted the investigation involved in this case, the desirability of investigating Communism in education was specifically discussed during consideration of its appropriation for that year, which after controversial debate was approved.\n20\n\u00a0\n\nIn this framework of the Committee's history we must conclude that its legislative authority to conduct the inquiry presently under consideration is unassailable, and that independently of whatever bearing the broad scope of Rule XI may have on the issue of \"pertinency\" in a given investigation into Communist activities, as in Watkins, the Rule cannot be said to be constitutionally \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 123]\n\u00a0\n infirm on the score of vagueness. The constitutional permissibility of that authority otherwise is a matter to be discussed later.\n\n    PERTINENCY CLAIM.\n\n\n Undeniably a conviction for contempt under 2 U.S.C. 192 cannot stand unless the questions asked are pertinent to the subject matter of the investigation. Watkins v. United States, supra, at 214-215. But the factors which led us to rest decision on this ground in Watkins were very different from those involved here.\n\nIn Watkins the petitioner had made specific objection to the Subcommittee's questions on the ground of pertinency; the question under inquiry had not been disclosed in any illuminating manner; and the questions asked the petitioner were not only amorphous on their face, but in some instances clearly foreign to the alleged subject matter of the investigation - \"Communism in labor.\" Id., at 185, 209-215.\n\nIn contrast, petitioner in the case before us raised no objections on the ground of pertinency at the time any of the questions were put to him. It is true that the memorandum which petitioner brought with him to the Subcommittee hearing contained the statement, \"to ask me whether I am or have been a member of the Communist Party may have dire consequences. I might wish to . . . challenge the pertinency of the question to the investigation,\" and at another point quoted from this Court's opinion in Jones v. Securities & Exchange Comm'n, \n298 \nU.S. 1\n, language relating to a witness' right to be informed of the pertinency of questions asked him by an administrative agency.\n21\n These statements cannot, \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 124]\n\u00a0\n however, be accepted as the equivalent of a pertinency objection. At best they constituted but a contemplated objection to questions still unasked, and buried as they were in the context of petitioner's general challenge to the power of the Subcommittee they can hardly be considered adequate, within the meaning of what was said in Watkins, supra, at 214-215, to trigger what would have been the Subcommittee's reciprocal obligation had it been faced with a pertinency objection.\n\nWe need not, however, rest decision on petitioner's failure to object on this score, for here \"pertinency\" was made to appear \"with undisputable clarity.\" Id., at 214. First of all, it goes without saying that the scope of the Committee's authority was for the House, not a witness, to determine, subject to the ultimate reviewing responsibility of this Court. What we deal with here is whether petitioner was sufficiently apprised of \"the topic under inquiry\" thus authorized \"and the connective reasoning whereby the precise questions asked relate[d] to it.\" Id., at 215. In light of his prepared memorandum of constitutional objections there can be no doubt that this petitioner was well aware of the Subcommittee's authority and purpose to question him as it did. See p. 123, supra. In addition the other sources of this information which we recognized in Watkins, supra, at 209-215, leave no room for a \"pertinency\" objection on this record. The subject matter of the inquiry had been identified at the commencement of the investigation as Communist infiltration into the field of education.\n22\n Just prior to petitioner's appearance before the Subcommittee, the scope of the day's hearings had been announced as \"in the main communism in education and the experiences and background in the party by Francis X. T. Crowley. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 125]\n\u00a0\n It will deal with activities in Michigan, Boston, and in some small degree, New York.\" Petitioner had heard the Subcommittee interrogate the witness Crowley along the same lines as he, petitioner, was evidently to be questioned, and had listened to Crowley's testimony identifying him as a former member of an alleged Communist student organization at the University of Michigan while they both were in attendance there.\n23\n Further, petitioner had stood mute in the face of the Chairman's statement as to why he had been called as a witness by the Subcommittee.\n24\n And, lastly, unlike Watkins, id., at 182-185, petitioner refused to answer questions as to his own Communist Party affiliations, whose pertinency of course was clear beyond doubt.\n\nPetitioner's contentions on this aspect of the case cannot be sustained.\n\n   CONSTITUTIONAL CONTENTIONS.\n\n\n Our function, at this point, is purely one of constitutional adjudication in the particular case and upon the particular record before us, not to pass judgment upon the general wisdom or efficacy of the activities of this Committee in a vexing and complicated field. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 126]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe precise constitutional issue confronting us is whether the Subcommittee's inquiry into petitioner's past or present membership in the Communist Party\n25\n transgressed the provisions of the First Amendment,\n26\n which of course reach and limit congressional investigations. Watkins, supra, at 197.\n\nThe Court's past cases establish sure guides to decision. Undeniably, the First Amendment in some circumstances protects an individual from being compelled to disclose his associational relationships. However, the protections of the First Amendment, unlike a proper claim of the privilege against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment, do not afford a witness the right to resist inquiry in all circumstances. Where First Amendment rights are asserted to bar governmental interrogation resolution of the issue always involves a balancing by the courts of the competing private and public interests at stake in the particular circumstances shown. These principles were recognized in the Watkins case, where, in speaking of the First Amendment in relation to congressional inquiries, we said (at p. 198): \"It is manifest that despite the adverse effects which follow upon compelled disclosure of private matters, not all such inquiries are barred. . . . The critical element is the existence of, \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 127]\n\u00a0\n and the weight to be ascribed to, the interest of the Congress in demanding disclosures from an unwilling witness.\" See also American Communications Assn. v. Douds, \n339 \nU.S. 382, 399\n-400; United States v. Rumely, supra, at 43-44. More recently in National Association for the Advancement of Colored People v. Alabama, \n357 \nU.S. 449, 463\n-466, we applied the same principles in judging state action claimed to infringe rights of association assured by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and stated that the \"`subordinating interest of the State must be compelling'\" in order to overcome the individual constitutional rights at stake. See Sweezy v. New Hampshire, \n354 \nU.S. 234, 255\n, 265 (concurring opinion). In light of these principles we now consider petitioner's First Amendment claims.\n\nThe first question is whether this investigation was related to a valid legislative purpose, for Congress may not constitutionally require an individual to disclose his political relationships or other private affairs except in relation to such a purpose. See Watkins v. United States, supra, at 198.\n\nThat Congress has wide power to legislate in the field of Communist activity in this Country, and to conduct appropriate investigations in aid thereof, is hardly debatable. The existence of such power has never been questioned by this Court, and it is sufficient to say, without particularization, that Congress has enacted or considered in this field a wide range of legislative measures, not a few of which have stemmed from recommendations of the very Committee whose actions have been drawn in question here.\n27\n In the last analysis this power rests on \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 128]\n\u00a0\n the right of self-preservation, \"the ultimate value of any society,\" Dennis v. United States, \n341 \nU.S. 494, 509\n. Justification for its exercise in turn rests on the long and widely accepted view that the tenets of the Communist Party include the ultimate overthrow of the Government of the United States by force and violence, a view which has been given formal expression by the Congress.\n28\n\u00a0\n\nOn these premises, this Court in its constitutional adjudications has consistently refused to view the Communist Party as an ordinary political party, and has upheld federal legislation aimed at the Communist problem which in a different context would certainly have raised constitutional issues of the gravest character. See, e. g., Carlson v. Landon, \n342 \nU.S. 524\n; Galvan v. Press, \n347 \nU.S. 522\n. On the same premises this Court has upheld under the Fourteenth Amendment state legislation requiring those occupying or seeking public office to disclaim knowing membership in any organization advocating overthrow of the Government by force and violence, which legislation none can avoid seeing was aimed at membership in the Communist Party. See Gerende v. Board of Supervisors, \n341 \nU.S. 56\n; Garner v. Board of Public Works, \n341 \nU.S. 716\n. See also Beilan v. Board of Public Education, \n357 \nU.S. 399\n; Lerner v. Casey, \n357 \nU.S. 468\n; Adler v. Board of Education, \n342 \nU.S. 485\n. Similarly, in other areas, this Court has recognized the close nexus between the Communist Party and violent overthrow of government. See Dennis v. United States, supra; American Communications Assn. v. Douds, supra. To suggest that because the Communist Party may also sponsor peaceable political reforms the constitutional issues before us should now be judged as if that Party were just an ordinary political \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 129]\n\u00a0\n party from the standpoint of national security, is to ask this Court to blind itself to world affairs which have determined the whole course of our national policy since the close of World War II, affairs to which Judge Learned Hand gave vivid expression in his opinion in United States v. Dennis, 183 F.2d 201, 213, and to the vast burdens which these conditions have entailed for the entire Nation.\n\nWe think that investigatory power in this domain is not to be denied Congress solely because the field of education is involved. Nothing in the prevailing opinions in Sweezy v. New Hampshire, supra, stands for a contrary view. The vice existing there was that the questioning of Sweezy, who had not been shown ever to have been connected with the Communist Party, as to the contents of a lecture he had given at the University of New Hampshire, and as to his connections with the Progressive Party, then on the ballot as a normal political party in some 26 States, was too far removed from the premises on which the constitutionality of the State's investigation had to depend to withstand attack under the Fourteenth Amendment. See the concurring opinion in Sweezy, supra, at 261, 265, 266, n. 3. This is a very different thing from inquiring into the extent to which the Communist Party has succeeded in infiltrating into our universities, or elsewhere, persons and groups committed to furthering the objective of overthrow. See Note 20, supra. Indeed we do not understand petitioner here to suggest that Congress in no circumstances may inquire into Communist activity in the field of education.\n29\n\u00a0\n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 130]\n\u00a0\n Rather, his position is in effect that this particular investigation was aimed not at the revolutionary aspects but at the theoretical classroom discussion of communism.\n\nIn our opinion this position rests on a too constricted view of the nature of the investigatory process, and is not supported by a fair assessment of the record before us. An investigation of advocacy of or preparation for overthrow certainly embraces the right to identify a witness as a member of the Communist Party, see Barsky v. United States, 83 U.S. App. D.C. 127, 167 F.2d 241, and to inquire into the various manifestations of the Party's tenets. The strict requirements of a prosecution under the Smith Act,\n30\n see Dennis v. United States, supra, and Yates v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 298\n, are not the measure of the permissible scope of a congressional investigation into \"overthrow,\" for of necessity the investigatory process must proceed step by step. Nor can it fairly be concluded that this investigation was directed at controlling what is being taught at our universities rather than at overthrow. The statement of the Subcommittee Chairman at the opening of the investigation evinces no such intention.\n31\n and so far as this record reveals \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 131]\n\u00a0\n nothing thereafter transpired which would justify our holding that the thrust of the investigation later changed. The record discloses considerable testimony concerning the foreign domination and revolutionary \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 132]\n\u00a0\n purposes and efforts of the Communist Party.\n32\n That there was also testimony on the abstract philosophical level does not detract from the dominant theme of this investigation - Communist infiltration furthering the alleged ultimate purpose of overthrow. And certainly the conclusion would not be justified that the questioning of petitioner would have exceeded permissible bounds had he not shut off the Subcommittee at the threshold.\n\nNor can we accept the further contention that this investigation should not be deemed to have been in furtherance of a legislative purpose because the true objective of the Committee and of the Congress was purely \"exposure.\" So long as Congress acts in pursuance of its constitutional power, the Judiciary lacks authority to intervene on the basis of the motives which spurred the exercise of that power. Arizona v. California, \n283 \nU.S. 423, 455\n, and cases there cited. \"It is, of course, true,\" as was said in McCray v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 27, 55\n, \"that if there be no authority in the judiciary to restrain a lawful exercise of power by another department of the government, where a wrong motive or purpose has impelled to the exertion of the power, that abuses of a power conferred may be temporarily effectual. The \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 133]\n\u00a0\n remedy for this, however, lies, not in the abuse by the judicial authority of its functions, but in the people, upon whom, after all, under our institutions, reliance must be placed for the correction of abuses committed in the exercise of a lawful power.\" These principles of course apply as well to committee investigations into the need for legislation as to the enactments which such investigations may produce. Cf. Tenney v. Brandhove, \n341 \nU.S. 367, 377\n-378. Thus, in stating in the Watkins case, p. 200, that \"there is no congressional power to expose for the sake of exposure,\" we at the same time declined to inquire into the \"motives of committee members,\" and recognized that their \"motives alone would not vitiate an investigation which had been instituted by a House of Congress if that assembly's legislative purpose is being served.\" Having scrutinized this record we cannot say that the unanimous panel of the Court of Appeals which first considered this case was wrong in concluding that \"the primary purposes of the inquiry were in aid of legislative processes.\" 240 F.2d, at 881.\n33\n Certainly this is not a case like Kilbourn v. Thompson, \n103 \nU.S. 168, 192\n, where \"the House of Representatives not only exceeded the limit of its own authority, but assumed a power which could only be properly exercised by another branch of the government, because it was in its nature clearly judicial.\" See McGrain v. Daugherty, \n273 \nU.S. 135, 171\n. The constitutional legislative power of Congress in this instance is beyond question. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 134]\n\u00a0\n\n\nFinally, the record is barren of other factors which in themselves might sometimes lead to the conclusion that the individual interests at stake were not subordinate to those of the state. There is no indication in this record that the Subcommittee was attempting to pillory witnesses. Nor did petitioner's appearance as a witness follow from indiscriminate dragnet procedures, lacking in probable cause for belief that he possessed information which might be helpful to the Subcommittee.\n34\n And the relevancy of the questions put to him by the Subcommittee is not open to doubt.\n\nWe conclude that the balance between the individual and the governmental interests here at stake must be struck in favor of the latter, and that therefore the provisions of the First Amendment have not been offended.\n\nWe hold that petitioner's conviction for contempt of Congress discloses no infirmity, and that the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"Every person who having been summoned as a witness by the authority of either House of Congress to give testimony or to produce papers upon any matter under inquiry before either House, or any joint committee established by a joint or concurrent resolution of the two Houses of Congress, or any committee of either House of Congress, willfully makes default, or who, having appeared, refuses to answer any question pertinent to the question under inquiry, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000 nor less than $100 and imprisonment in a common jail for not less than one month nor more than twelve months.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] In the words of the panel of the Court of Appeals which first heard the case this memorandum \"can best be described as a lengthy legal brief attacking the jurisdiction of the committee to ask appellant any questions or to conduct any inquiry at all, based on the First, Ninth and Tenth Amendments, the prohibition against bills of attainder, and the doctrine of separation of powers.\" 100 U.S. App. D.C., at 17, n. 4, 240 F.2d, at 879, n. 4.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] We take this to mean the privilege against self-incrimination.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See Note 1, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] H.

References to the Rule throughout this opinion are intended to signify that paragraph.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] \"The Committee on Un-American Activities, as a whole or by subcommittee, is authorized to make from time to time investigations of (1) the extent, character, and objects of un-American propaganda activities in the United States, (2) the diffusion within the United States of subversive and un-American propaganda that is instigated from foreign countries or of a domestic origin and attacks the principle of the form of government as guaranteed by our Constitution, and (3) all other questions in relation thereto that would aid Congress in any necessary remedial legislation.\" H.

We are interested instead in finding out who the Communists are and what they are doing to further the Communist conspiracy.

In opening this hearing, it is well to make clear to you and others just what the nature of this investigation is.\n\n\n\"From time to time, the committee has investigated Communists and Communist activities within the entertainment, newspaper, and labor fields, and also within the professions and the Government. In no instance has the work of the committee taken on the character of an investigation of entertainment organizations, newspapers, labor unions, the professions, or the Government, as such, and it is not \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 131]\n\u00a0\n now the purpose of this committee to investigate education or educational institutions, as such. . . .\n\n.   .  .   .   .\n\n\n\n\"The purpose of the committee in investigating Communists and Communist activities within the field of education is no greater and no less than its purpose in investigating Communists and Communist activities within the field of labor or any other field.\n\n\n\"The committee is charged by the Congress with the responsibility of investigating the extent, character, and objects of un-American propaganda activities in the United States, the diffusion within the United States of subversive and un-American propaganda that is instigated from foreign countries or of a domestic origin and attacks the principle of the form of government as guaranteed by our Constitution and all other questions in relation thereto that would aid Congress in any necessary remedial legislation.\n\n\n\"It has been fully established in testimony before congressional committees and before the courts of our land that the Communist Party of the United States is part of an international conspiracy which is being used as a tool or weapon by a foreign power to promote its own foreign policy and which has for its object the overthrow of the governments of all non-Communist countries, resorting to the use of force and violence, if necessary. . . . Communism and Communist activities cannot be investigated in a vacuum. The investigation must, of necessity, relate to individuals and, therefore, this morning the committee is calling you [one, Davis] as a person known by this committee to have been at one time a member of the Communist Party.\n\n.  .   .  .  .\n\n\n\n\"The committee is equally concerned with the opportunities that the Communist Party has to wield its influence upon members of the teaching profession and students through Communists who are members of the teaching profession. Therefore, the objective of this investigation is to ascertain the character, extent and objects of Communist Party activities when such activities are carried on by members of the teaching profession who are subject to the directives and discipline of the Communist Party.\" The full statement is printed as the Appendix to the original Court of Appeals opinion, 100 U.S. App. D.C. 22-24, 240 F.2d 884-886.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 32\n] Thus, early in the investigation one of the witnesses, Hicks, testified in response to a question as to \"the general purpose of the Communist Party in endeavoring to organize a cell or unit among the teaching profession\" at the various universities that contrary to his original view:\n\n\". . . it is very obvious to me that the popular front [Communist protection of democracy against Fascism] was simply a dodge that happened in those particular years to serve the foreign policy of the Soviet Union; so it seems to me that the party, in organizing branches in the colleges, had two purposes. One was to carry out the existing line which they wanted to make a show of advancing, and then, of course, the other was to try to have a corps of disciplined revolutionaries whom they could use for other purposes when the time came.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 33\n] We agree with the Court of Appeals that the one sentence appearing in the Committee's report for 1954, upon which petitioner largely predicates his exposure argument, bears little significance when read in the context of the full report and in light of the entire record. This sentence reads: \"The 1954 hearings were set up by the committee in order to demonstrate to the people of Michigan the fields of concentration of the Communist Party in the Michigan area, and the identity of those individuals responsible for its success.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 34\n] See p. 124 and Note 24, supra.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS concur, dissenting.\n\nOn May 28, 1954, petitioner Lloyd Barenblatt, then 31 years old, and a teacher of psychology at Vassar College, was summoned to appear before a Subcommittee of the House Committee on Un-American Activities. After service of the summons, but before Barenblatt appeared on June 28, his four-year contract with Vassar expired and was not renewed. He, therefore, came to the Committee as a private citizen without a job. Earlier that day, the Committee's interest in Barenblatt had been aroused by the testimony of an ex-Communist named Crowley. When Crowley had first appeared before the Un-American Activities Committee he had steadfastly \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 135]\n\u00a0\n refused to admit or deny Communist affiliations or to identify others as Communists. After the House reported this refusal to the United States Attorney for prosecution, Crowley \"voluntarily\" returned and asked to testify. He was sworn in and interrogated, but not before he was made aware by various Committee members of Committee policy to \"make an appropriate recommendation\" to protect any witness who \"fully cooperates with the committee.\" He then talked at length, identifying by name, address and occupation, whenever possible, people he claimed had been Communists. One of these was Barenblatt, who, according to Crowley, had been a Communist during 1947-1950 while a graduate student and teaching fellow at the University of Michigan. Though Crowley testified in great detail about the small group of Communists who had been at Michigan at that time and though the Committee was very satisfied with his testimony, it sought repetition of much of the information from Barenblatt. Barenblatt, however, refused to answer their questions and filed a long statement outlining his constitutional objections. He asserted that the Committee was violating the Constitution by abridging freedom of speech, thought, press, and association, and by conducting legislative trials of known or suspected Communists which trespassed on the exclusive power of the judiciary. He argued that however he answered questions relating to membership in the Communist Party his position in society and his ability to earn a living would be seriously jeopardized; that he would, in effect, be subjected to a bill of attainder despite the twice-expressed constitutional mandate against such legislative punishments.\n1\n This would occur, he pointed out, even \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 136]\n\u00a0\n if he did no more than invoke the protection of clearly applicable provisions of the Bill of Rights as a reason for refusing to answer.\n\nHe repeated these, and other objections, in the District Court as a reason for dismissing an indictment for contempt of Congress. His position, however, was rejected at the trial and in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit over the strong dissents of Chief Judge Edgerton and Judges Bazelon, Fahy and Washington. The Court today affirms, and thereby sanctions the use of the contempt power to enforce questioning by congressional committees in the realm of speech and association. I cannot agree with this disposition of the case for I believe that the resolution establishing the House Un-American Activities Committee and the questions that Committee asked Barenblatt violate the Constitution in several respects. (1) Rule XI creating the Committee authorizes such a sweeping, unlimited, all-inclusive and undiscriminating compulsory examination of witnesses in the field of speech, press, petition and assembly that it violates the procedural requirements of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. (2) Compelling an answer to the questions asked Barenblatt abridges freedom of speech and association in contravention of the First Amendment. (3) The Committee proceedings were part of a legislative program to stigmatize and punish by public identification and exposure all witnesses considered by the Committee to be guilty of Communist affiliations, as well as all witnesses who refused to answer Committee questions on constitutional grounds; the Committee was thus improperly seeking to try, convict, and punish suspects, a task which the Constitution expressly denies to Congress and grants exclusively \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 137]\n\u00a0\n to the courts, to be exercised by them only after indictment and in full compliance with all the safeguards provided by the Bill of Rights.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nIt goes without saying that a law to be valid must be clear enough to make its commands understandable. For obvious reasons, the standard of certainty required in criminal statutes is more exacting than in noncriminal statutes.\n2\n This is simply because it would be unthinkable to convict a man for violating a law he could not understand. This Court has recognized that the stricter standard is as much required in criminal contempt cases as in all other criminal cases,\n3\n and has emphasized that the \"vice of vagueness\" is especially pernicious where legislative power over an area involving speech, press, petition and assembly is involved.\n4\n In this area the statement that a statute is void if it \"attempts to cover so much that it effectively covers nothing,\" see Musser v. Utah, \n333 \nU.S. 95, 97\n, takes on double significance. For a statute broad enough to support infringement of speech, writings, thoughts and public assemblies, against the unequivocal command of the First Amendment necessarily leaves all persons to guess just what the law really means to cover, and fear of a wrong guess inevitably leads people to forego the very rights the Constitution sought to protect above all others.\n5\n Vagueness becomes \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 138]\n\u00a0\n even more intolerable in this area if one accepts, as the Court today does, a balancing test to decide if First Amendment rights shall be protected. It is difficult at best to make a man guess - at the penalty of imprisonment - whether a court will consider the State's need for certain information superior to society's interest in unfettered freedom. It is unconscionable to make him choose between the right to keep silent and the need to speak when the statute supposedly establishing the \"state's interest\" is too vague to give him guidance. Cf. Scull v. Virginia, \n359 \nU.S. 344\n.\n\nMeasured by the foregoing standards, Rule XI cannot support any conviction for refusal to testify. In substance it authorizes the Committee to compel witnesses to give evidence about all \"un-American propaganda,\" whether instigated in this country or abroad.\n6\n The word \"propaganda\" seems to mean anything that people say, write, think or associate together about. The term \"un-American\" is equally vague. As was said in Watkins v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 178, 202\n, \"Who can define [its] meaning . . . ? What is that single, solitary `principle of the form of government as guaranteed by our Constitution'?\" I think it clear that the boundaries of the Committee are, to say the least, \"nebulous.\" Indeed, \"It would be difficult to imagine a less explicit authorizing resolution.\" Ibid. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 139]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Court - while not denying the vagueness of Rule XI - nevertheless defends its application here because the questions asked concerned communism, a subject of investigation which had been reported to the House by the Committee on numerous occasions. If the issue were merely whether Congress intended to allow an investigation of communism, or even of communism in education, it may well be that we could hold the data cited by the Court sufficient to support a finding of intent. But that is expressly not the issue. On the Court's own test, the issue is whether Barenblatt can know with sufficient certainty, at the time of his interrogation, that there is so compelling a need for his replies that infringement of his rights of free association is justified. The record does not disclose where Barenblatt can find what that need is. There is certainly no clear congressional statement of it in Rule XI. Perhaps if Barenblatt had had time to read all the reports of the Committee to the House, and in addition had examined the appropriations made to the Committee he, like the Court, could have discerned an intent by Congress to allow an investigation of communism in education. Even so he would be hard put to decide what the need for this investigation is since Congress expressed it neither when it enacted Rule XI nor when it acquiesced in the Committee's assertions of power. Yet it is knowledge of this need - what is wanted from him and why it is wanted - that a witness must have if he is to be in a position to comply with the Court's rule that he balance individual rights against the requirements of the State. I cannot see how that knowledge can exist under Rule XI.\n\nBut even if Barenblatt could evaluate the importance to the Government of the information sought, Rule XI would still be too broad to support his conviction. For we are dealing here with governmental procedures which the Court itself admits reach to the very fringes of congressional \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 140]\n\u00a0\n power. In such cases more is required of legislatures than a vague delegation to be filled in later by mute acquiescence.\n7\n If Congress wants ideas investigated, if it even wants them investigated in the field of education, it must be prepared to say so expressly and unequivocally. And it is not enough that a court through exhaustive research can establish, even conclusively, that Congress wished to allow the investigation. I can find no such unequivocal statement here.\n\nFor all these reasons, I would hold that Rule XI is too broad to be meaningful and cannot support petitioner's conviction.\n8\n\u00a0\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nThe First Amendment says in no equivocal language that Congress shall pass no law abridging freedom of speech, press, assembly or petition.\n9\n The activities of \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 141]\n\u00a0\n this Committee, authorized by Congress, do precisely that, through exposure, obloquy and public scorn. See Watkins v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 178, 197\n-198. The Court does not really deny this fact but relies on a combination of three reasons for permitting the infringement: (A) The notion that despite the First Amendment's command Congress can abridge speech and association if this Court decides that the governmental interest in abridging speech is greater than an individual's interest in exercising that freedom, (B) the Government's right to \"preserve itself,\" (C) the fact that the Committee is only after Communists or suspected Communists in this investigation.\n\n(A) I do not agree that laws directly abridging First Amendment freedoms can be justified by a congressional or judicial balancing process. There are, of course, cases suggesting that a law which primarily regulates conduct but which might also indirectly affect speech can be upheld if the effect on speech is minor in relation to the need for control of the conduct. With these cases I agree. Typical of them are Cantwell v. Connecticut, \n310 \nU.S. 296\n, and Schneider v. Irvington, \n308 \nU.S. 147\n. Both of these involved the right of a city to control its streets. In Cantwell, a man had been convicted of breach of the peace for playing a phonograph on the street. He defended on the ground that he was disseminating religious views and could not, therefore, be stopped. We upheld his defense, but in so doing we pointed out that the city did have substantial power over conduct on the streets even where this power might to some extent affect speech. A State, we said, might \"by general and non-discriminatory legislation \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 142]\n\u00a0\n regulate the times, the places, and the manner of soliciting upon its streets and holding meetings thereon.\" \n310 \nU.S., at 304\n. But even such laws governing conduct, we emphasized, must be tested, though only by a balancing process, if they indirectly affect ideas. On one side of the balance, we pointed out, is the interest of the United States in seeing that its fundamental law protecting freedom of communication is not abridged; on the other the obvious interest of the State to regulate conduct within its boundaries. In Cantwell we held that the need to control the streets could not justify the restriction made on speech. We stressed the fact that where a man had a right to be on a street, \"he had a right peacefully to impart his views to others.\" \n310 \nU.S., at 308\n. Similar views were expressed in Schneider, which concerned ordinances prohibiting the distribution of handbills to prevent littering. We forbade application of such ordinances when they affected literature designed to spread ideas. There were other ways, we said, to protect the city from littering which would not sacrifice the right of the people to be informed. In so holding, we, of course, found it necessary to \"weigh the circumstances.\" \n308 \nU.S., at 161\n. But we did not in Schneider, any more than in Cantwell, even remotely suggest that a law directly aimed at curtailing speech and political persuasion could be saved through a balancing process. Neither these cases, nor any others, can be read as allowing legislative bodies to pass laws abridging freedom of speech, press and association merely because of hostility to views peacefully expressed in a place where the speaker had a right to be. Rule XI, on its face and as here applied, since it attempts inquiry into beliefs, not action - ideas and associations, not conduct - does just that.\n10\n\u00a0\n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 143]\n\u00a0\n\n\nTo apply the Court's balancing test under such circumstances is to read the First Amendment to say \"Congress shall pass no law abridging freedom of speech, press, assembly and petition, unless Congress and the Supreme Court reach the joint conclusion that on balance the interest of the Government in stifling these freedoms is greater than the interest of the people in having them exercised.\" This is closely akin to the notion that neither the First Amendment nor any other provision of the Bill of Rights should be enforced unless the Court believes it is reasonable to do so. Not only does this violate the genius of our written Constitution, but it runs expressly counter to the injunction to Court and Congress made by Madison when he introduced the Bill of Rights. \"If they [the first ten amendments] are incorporated into the Constitution, independent tribunals of justice will consider themselves in a peculiar manner the guardians of those rights; they will be an impenetrable bulwark against every assumption of power in the Legislative or Executive; they will be naturally led to resist every encroachment upon rights expressly stipulated for in the Constitution by the declaration of rights.\"\n11\n Unless we return to this view of our judicial function, unless we once again accept the notion that the Bill of Rights means what it \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 144]\n\u00a0\n says and that this Court must enforce that meaning, I am of the opinion that our great charter of liberty will be more honored in the breach than in the observance.\n\nBut even assuming what I cannot assume, that some balancing is proper in this case, I feel that the Court after stating the test ignores it completely. At most it balances the right of the Government to preserve itself, against Barenblatt's right to refrain from revealing Communist affiliations. Such a balance, however, mistakes the factors to be weighed. In the first place, it completely leaves out the real interest in Barenblatt's silence, the interest of the people as a whole in being able to join organizations, advocate causes and make political \"mistakes\" without later being subjected to governmental penalties for having dared to think for themselves. It is this right, the right to err politically, which keeps us strong as a Nation. For no number of laws against communism can have as much effect as the personal conviction which comes from having heard its arguments and rejected them, or from having once accepted its tenets and later recognized their worthlessness. Instead, the obloquy which results from investigations such as this not only stifles \"mistakes\" but prevents all but the most courageous from hazarding any views which might at some later time become disfavored. This result, whose importance cannot be overestimated, is doubly crucial when it affects the universities, on which we must largely rely for the experimentation and development of new ideas essential to our country's welfare. It is these interests of society, rather than Barenblatt's own right to silence, which I think the Court should put on the balance against the demands of the Government, if any balancing process is to be tolerated. Instead they are not mentioned, while on the other side the demands of the Government are vastly overstated and called \"self preservation.\" It is admitted that this Committee can only seek \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 145]\n\u00a0\n information for the purpose of suggesting laws, and that Congress' power to make laws in the realm of speech and association is quite limited, even on the Court's test. Its interest in making such laws in the field of education, primarily a state function, is clearly narrower still. Yet the Court styles this attenuated interest self-preservation and allows it to overcome the need our country has to let us all think, speak, and associate politically as we like and without fear of reprisal. Such a result reduces \"balancing\" to a mere play on words and is completely inconsistent with the rules this Court has previously given for applying a \"balancing test,\" where it is proper: \"[T]he courts should be astute to examine the effect of the challenged legislation. Mere legislative preferences or beliefs . . . may well support regulation directed at other personal activities, but be insufficient to justify such as diminishes the exercise of rights so vital to the maintenance of democratic institutions.\" Schneider v. Irvington, \n308 \nU.S. 147, 161\n. (Italics supplied.)\n\n(B) Moreover, I cannot agree with the Court's notion that First Amendment freedoms must be abridged in order to \"preserve\" our country. That notion rests on the unarticulated premise that this Nation's security hangs upon its power to punish people because of what they think, speak or write about, or because of those with whom they associate for political purposes. The Government, in its brief, virtually admits this position when it speaks of the \"communication of unlawful ideas.\" I challenge this premise, and deny that ideas can be proscribed under our Constitution. I agree that despotic governments cannot exist without stifling the voice of opposition to their oppressive practices. The First Amendment means to me, however, that the only constitutional way our Government can preserve itself is to leave its people the fullest possible freedom to praise, criticize or discuss, as they see fit, all governmental policies and to suggest, if they desire, \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 146]\n\u00a0\n that even its most fundamental postulates are bad and should be changed; \"Therein lies the security of the Republic, the very foundation of constitutional government.\"\n12\n On that premise this land was created, and on that premise it has grown to greatness. Our Constitution assumes that the common sense of the people and their attachment to our country will enable them, after free discussion, to withstand ideas that are wrong. To say that our patriotism must be protected against false ideas by means other than these is, I think, to make a baseless charge. Unless we can rely on these qualities - if, in short, we begin to punish speech - we cannot honestly proclaim ourselves to be a free Nation and we have lost what the Founders of this land risked their lives and their sacred honor to defend.\n\n(C) The Court implies, however, that the ordinary rules and requirements of the Constitution do not apply because the Committee is merely after Communists and they do not constitute a political party but only a criminal gang. \"[T]he long and widely accepted view,\" the Court says, is \"that the tenets of the Communist Party include the ultimate overthrow of the Government of the United States by force and violence.\"\n13\n This justifies the \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 147]\n\u00a0\n investigation undertaken. By accepting this charge and allowing it to support treatment of the Communist Party and its members which would violate the Constitution if applied to other groups, the Court, in effect, declares that Party outlawed. It has been only a few years since there was a practically unanimous feeling throughout the country and in our courts that this could not be done in our free land. Of course it has always been recognized that members of the Party who, either individually or in combination, commit acts in violation of valid laws can be prosecuted. But the Party as a whole and innocent members of it could not be attainted merely because it had some illegal aims and because some of its members were lawbreakers. Thus in De Jonge v. Oregon, \n299 \nU.S. 353, 357\n (1937), on stipulated facts that the Communist Party advocated criminal syndicalism - \"crime, physical violence, sabotage or any unlawful acts or methods as a means of accomplishing or effecting industrial or political change or revolution\" - a unanimous Court, speaking through Chief Justice Hughes, held that a Communist addressing a Communist rally could be found guilty of no offense so long as no violence or crime was urged at the meeting. The Court absolutely refused to concede that either De Jonge or the Communist Party forfeited the protections of the First and Fourteenth Amendments because one of the Party's purposes was to effect a violent change of government. See also Herndon v. Lowry, \n301 \nU.S. 242\n.\n\nLater, in 1948, when various bills were proposed in the House and Senate to handicap or outlaw the Communist Party, leaders of the Bar who had been asked to give their views rose up to contest the constitutionality of the measures. The late Charles Evans Hughes, Jr., questioned the validity under both the First and Fifth Amendments of one of these bills, which in effect outlawed the Party. The late John W. Davis attacked it \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 148]\n\u00a0\n as lacking an ascertainable standard of guilt under many of this Court's cases.\n14\n And the Attorney General of the United States not only indicated that such a measure would be unconstitutional but declared it to be unwise even if valid. He buttressed his position by citing a statement by J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the declaration of this Court in West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette, \n319 \nU.S. 624, 642\n, that:\n\n\"If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.\"\n15\n\u00a0\n\n\n Even the proponent of the bill disclaimed any aim to outlaw the Communist Party and pointed out the \"disadvantages\" of such a move by stating that \"the Communist Party was illegal and outlawed in Russia when it took over control of the Soviet Union.\"\n16\n Again, when the \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 149]\n\u00a0\n Attorney General testified on a proposal to bar the Communist Party from the ballot he said, \"an organized group, whether you call it political or not, could hardly be barred from the ballot without jeopardizing the constitutional guarantees of all other political groups and parties.\"\n17\n\u00a0\n\nAll these statements indicate quite clearly that no matter how often or how quickly we repeat the claim that the Communist Party is not a political party, we cannot outlaw it, as a group, without endangering the liberty of all of us. The reason is not hard to find, for mixed among those aims of communism which are illegal are perfectly normal political and social goals. And muddled with its revolutionary tenets is a drive to achieve power through the ballot, if it can be done. These things necessarily make it a political party whatever other, illegal, aims it may have. Cf. Gerende v. Board of Supervisors, \n341 \nU.S. 56\n. Significantly until recently the Communist Party was on the ballot in many States. When that was so, many Communists undoubtedly hoped to accomplish \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 150]\n\u00a0\n its lawful goals through support of Communist candidates. Even now some such may still remain.\n18\n To attribute to them, and to those who have left the Party, the taint of the group is to ignore both our traditions that guilt like belief is \"personal and not a matter of mere association\" and the obvious fact that \"men adhering to a political party or other organization notoriously do not subscribe unqualifiedly to all of its platforms or asserted principles.\" Schneiderman v. United States, \n320 \nU.S. 118, 136\n. See also Dennis v. United States, \n341 \nU.S. 494, 579\n, 581 (dissenting opinions).\n\nThe fact is that once we allow any group which has some political aims or ideas to be driven from the ballot and from the battle for men's minds because some of its members are bad and some of its tenets are illegal, no group is safe. Today we deal with Communists or suspected Communists. In 1920, instead, the New York Assembly suspended duly elected legislators on the ground that, being Socialists, they were disloyal to the country's principles.\n19\n In the 1830's the Masons were hunted as outlaws and subversives, and abolitionists were considered revolutionaries of the most dangerous kind in both North and South.\n20\n Earlier still, at the time of the universally \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 151]\n\u00a0\n unlamented alien and sedition laws, Thomas Jefferson's party was attacked and its members were derisively called \"Jacobins.\" Fisher Ames described the party as a \"French faction\" guilty of \"subversion\" and \"officered, regimented and formed to subordination.\" Its members, he claimed, intended to \"take arms against the laws as soon as they dare.\"\n21\n History should teach us then, that in times of high emotional excitement minority parties and groups which advocate extremely unpopular social or governmental innovations will always be typed as criminal gangs and attempts will always be made to drive them out.\n22\n It was knowledge of this fact, and of its great dangers, that caused the Founders of our land to enact the First Amendment as a guarantee that neither Congress nor the people would do anything to hinder or destroy the capacity of individuals and groups to seek converts and votes for any cause, however radical or unpalatable their principles might seem under the accepted notions of the time. Whatever the States were left free to do, the First Amendment sought to leave Congress devoid of any kind or quality of power to direct any type of national laws against the freedom of individuals to think what they please, advocate whatever policy they choose, and join with others to bring about the social, religious, political and governmental changes which seem best to them.\n23\n Today's holding, in my judgment, marks \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 152]\n\u00a0\n another major step in the progressively increasing retreat from the safeguards of the First Amendment.\n\nIt is, sadly, no answer to say that this Court will not allow the trend to overwhelm us; that today's holding will be strictly confined to \"Communists,\" as the Court's language implies. This decision can no more be contained than could the holding in American Communications Assn. v. Douds, \n339 \nU.S. 382\n. In that case the Court sustained as an exercise of the commerce power an Act which required labor union officials to take an oath that they were not members of the Communist Party. The Court rejected the idea that the Douds holding meant that the Party and all its members could be attainted because of their Communist beliefs. It went to great lengths to explain that the Act held valid \"touches only a relative handful of persons, leaving the great majority of persons of the identified affiliations and beliefs completely free from restraint.\" \"[W]hile this Court sits,\" the Court proclaimed, no wholesale proscription of Communists or their Party can occur. \n339 \nU.S., at 404\n, 410. I dissented and said:\n\n \"Under such circumstances, restrictions imposed on proscribed groups are seldom static, even though the rate of expansion may not move in geometric progression from discrimination to arm-band to ghetto and worse. Thus I cannot regard the Court's holding as one which merely bars Communists from holding union office and nothing more. For its reasoning would apply just as forcibly to statutes barring Communists and their respective sympathizers from election to political office, mere membership \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 153]\n\u00a0\n in unions, and in fact from getting or holding any job whereby they could earn a living.\" \n339 \nU.S., at 449\n.\n\n\n My prediction was all too accurate. Today, Communists or suspected Communists have been denied an opportunity to work as government employees, lawyers, doctors, teachers, pharmacists, veterinarians, subway conductors, industrial workers and in just about any other job. See Speiser v. Randall, \n357 \nU.S. 513, 531\n (concurring opinion). Cf. Barsky v. Board of Regents, \n347 \nU.S. 442, 456\n, 467, 472 (dissenting opinions). In today's holding they are singled out and, as a class, are subjected to inquisitions which the Court suggests would be unconstitutional but for the fact of \"Communism.\" Nevertheless, this Court still sits!\n24\n\u00a0\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nFinally, I think Barenblatt's conviction violates the Constitution because the chief aim, purpose and practice of the House Un-American Activities Committee, as disclosed by its many reports, is to try witnesses and punish them because they are or have been Communists or because they refuse to admit or deny Communist affiliations. The punishment imposed is generally punishment by humiliation and public shame. There is nothing strange or novel about this kind of punishment. It is in \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 154]\n\u00a0\n fact one of the oldest forms of governmental punishment known to mankind; branding, the pillory, ostracism and subjection to public hatred being but a few examples of it.\n25\n Nor is there anything strange about a court's reviewing the power of a congressional committee to inflict punishment. In 1880 this Court nullified the action of the House of Representatives in sentencing a witness to jail for failing to answer questions of a congressional committee. Kilbourn v. Thompson, \n103 \nU.S. 168\n. The Court held that the Committee in its investigation of the Jay Cooke bankruptcy was seeking to exercise judicial power, and this, it emphatically said, no committee could do. It seems to me that the proof that the Un-American Activities Committee is here undertaking a purely judicial function is overwhelming, far stronger, in fact, than it was in the Jay Cooke investigation which, moreover, concerned only business transactions, not freedom of association.\n\nThe Un-American Activities Committee was created in 1938. It immediately conceived of its function on a grand scale as one of ferreting out \"subversives\" and especially of having them removed from government jobs.\n26\n It made many reports to the House urging removal \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 155]\n\u00a0\n of such employees.\n27\n Finally, at the instigation of the Committee, the House put a rider on an appropriation bill to bar three government workers from collecting their salaries.\n28\n The House action was based on Committee findings that each of the three employees was a member of, or associated with, organizations deemed undesirable and that the \"views and philosophies\" of these workers \"as expressed in various statements and writings constitute subversive activity within the definition adopted by your committee, and that [they are], therefore, unfit for the present to continue in Government employment.\"\n29\n The Senate and the President agreed \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 156]\n\u00a0\n to the rider, though not without protest. We held that statute void as a bill of attainder in United States v. Lovett, \n328 \nU.S. 303\n (1946), stating that its \"effect was to inflict punishment without the safeguards of a judicial trial\" and that this \"cannot be done either by a State or by the United States.\" \n328 \nU.S., at 316\n-317.\n\nEven after our Lovett holding, however, the Committee continued to view itself as the \"only agency of government that has the power of exposure,\" and to work unceasingly and sincerely to identify and expose all suspected Communists and \"subversives\" in order to eliminate them from virtually all fields of employment.\n30\n How well it has succeeded in its declared program of \"pitiless publicity and exposure\" is a matter of public record. It is enough to cite the experience of a man who masqueraded as a Communist for the F. B. I. and who reported to this same Committee that since 1952 when his \"membership\" became known he has been unable to hold any job.\n31\n To \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 157]\n\u00a0\n accomplish this kind of result, the Committee has called witnesses who are suspected of Communist affiliation, has subjected them to severe questioning and has insisted that each tell the name of every person he has ever known at any time to have been a Communist, and, if possible, to give the addresses and occupations of the people named. These names are then indexed, published, and reported to Congress, and often to the press.\n32\n The same technique is employed to cripple the job opportunities of those who strongly criticize the Committee or take other actions it deems undesirable.\n33\n Thus, in 1949, the Committee \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 158]\n\u00a0\n reported that it had indexed and printed some 335,000 names of people who had signed \"Communist\" petitions of one kind or another.\n34\n All this the Committee did and does to punish by exposure the many phases of \"un-American\" activities that it reports cannot be reached by legislation, by administrative action, or by any other agency of Government, which, of course, includes the courts.\n\nThe same intent to expose and punish is manifest in the Committee's investigation which led to Barenblatt's conviction. The declared purpose of the investigation was to identify to the people of Michigan the individuals responsible for the, alleged, Communist success there.\n35\n The Committee claimed that its investigation \"uncovered\" members of the Communist Party holding positions in the school systems in Michigan; that most of the teachers subpoenaed before the Committee refused to answer questions on the ground that to do so might result in \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 159]\n\u00a0\n self-incrimination, and that most of these teachers had lost their jobs. It then stated that \"the Committee on Un-American Activities approves of this action. . . .\"\n36\n Similarly, as a result of its Michigan investigation, the Committee called upon American labor unions to amend their constitutions, if necessary, in order to deny membership to any Communist Party member.\n37\n This would, of course, prevent many workers from getting or holding the only kind of jobs their particular skills qualified them for. The Court, today, barely mentions these statements, which, especially when read in the context of past reports by the Committee, show unmistakably what the Committee was doing. I cannot understand why these reports are deemed relevant to a determination of a congressional intent to investigate communism in education, but irrelevant to any finding of congressional intent to bring about exposure for its own sake or for the purposes of punishment.\n\nI do not question the Committee's patriotism and sincerity in doing all this.\n38\n I merely feel that it cannot be done by Congress under our Constitution. For, even assuming that the Federal Government can compel witnesses to testify as to Communist affiliations in order to subject them to ridicule and social and economic retaliation, I cannot agree that this is a legislative function. Such publicity is clearly punishment, and the Constitution \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 160]\n\u00a0\n allows only one way in which people can be convicted and punished. As we said in Lovett, \"Those who wrote our Constitution well knew the danger inherent in special legislative acts which take away the life, liberty or property of particular named persons because the legislature thinks them guilty of conduct which deserves punishment. They intended to safeguard the people of this country from punishment without trial by duly constituted courts.\" \n328 \nU.S., at 317\n. (Italics added.) Thus if communism is to be made a crime, and Communists are to be subjected to \"pains and penalties,\" I would still hold this conviction bad, for the crime of communism, like all others, can be punished only by court and jury after a trial with all judicial safeguards.\n\nIt is no answer to all this to suggest that legislative committees should be allowed to punish if they grant the accused some rules of courtesy or allow him counsel. For the Constitution proscribes all bills of attainder by State or Nation, not merely those which lack counsel or courtesy. It does this because the Founders believed that punishment was too serious a matter to be entrusted to any group other than an independent judiciary and a jury of twelve men acting on previously passed, unambiguous laws, with all the procedural safeguards they put in the Constitution as essential to a fair trial - safeguards which included the right to counsel, compulsory process for witnesses, specific indictments, confrontation of accusers, as well as protection against self-incrimination, double jeopardy and cruel and unusual punishment - in short, due process of law. Cf. Chambers v. Florida, \n309 \nU.S. 227\n. They believed this because not long before worthy men had been deprived of their liberties, and indeed their lives, through parliamentary trials without these safeguards. The memory of one of these, John Lilburne - banished and disgraced by a parliamentary \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 161]\n\u00a0\n committee on penalty of death if he returned to his country - was particularly vivid when our Constitution was written. His attack on trials by such committees and his warning that \"what is done unto any one, may be done unto every one\"\n39\n were part of the history of the times \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 162]\n\u00a0\n which moved those who wrote our Constitution to determine that no such arbitrary punishments should ever occur here. It is the protection from arbitrary punishments through the right to a judicial trial with all these safeguards which over the years has distinguished America from lands where drumhead courts and other similar \"tribunals\" deprive the weak and the unorthodox of life, liberty and property without due process of law. It is this same right which is denied to Barenblatt, because the Court today fails to see what is here for all to see - that exposure and punishment is the aim of this Committee and the reason for its existence. To deny this is to ignore the Committee's own claims and the reports it has issued ever since it was established. I cannot believe that the nature of our judicial office requires us to be so blind, and must conclude that the Un-American Activities Committee's \"identification\" and \"exposure\" of Communists and suspected Communists, like the activities of the Committee in Kilbourn v. Thompson, amount to an encroachment on the judiciary which bodes ill for the liberties of the people of this land.\n\nUltimately all the questions in this case really boil down to one - whether we as a people will try fearfully and futilely to preserve democracy by adopting totalitarian methods, or whether in accordance with our traditions and our Constitution we will have the confidence and courage to be free.\n\nI would reverse this conviction. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 109, 163]\n\u00a0\n\n\n  APPENDIX TO OPINION OF MR.

Thompson, \n103 \nU.S. 168\n, which held that legislative committees could not make roving inquiries into the private business affairs of witnesses. The Court, in Kilbourn, held that the courts must be careful to insure that, on balance, Congress did not unjustifiably encroach on an individual's private business affairs. Needless to say, an individual's right to silence in such matters is quite a different thing from the public's interest in freedom of speech and the test applicable to one has little, if anything, to do with the test applicable to the other.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] 1 Annals of Cong. 439 (1789).

JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, MR. JUSTICE CLARK, and MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER join.\n\nWe are called upon in this case to weigh in a particular context two considerations of high importance \n\n[360 \nU.S. 564, 565]\n\u00a0\n which now and again come into sharp conflict - on the one hand, the protection of the individual citizen against pecuniary damage caused by oppressive or malicious action on the part of officials of the Federal Government; and on the other, the protection of the public interest by shielding responsible governmental officers against the harassment and inevitable hazards of vindictive or ill-founded damage suits brought on account of action taken in the exercise of their official responsibilities.\n\nThis is a libel suit, brought in the District Court of the District of Columbia by respondents, former employees of the Office of Rent Stabilization. The alleged libel was contained in a press release issued by the office on February 5, 1953, at the direction of petitioner, then its Acting Director.\n1\n The circumstances which gave rise to the issuance of the release follow.\n\nIn 1950 the statutory existence of the Office of Housing Expediter, the predecessor agency of the Office of Rent Stabilization, was about to expire. Respondent Madigan, then Deputy Director in charge of personnel and fiscal matters, and respondent Matteo, chief of the personnel branch, suggested to the Housing Expediter a plan designed to utilize some $2,600,000 of agency funds earmarked in the agency's appropriation for the fiscal year 1950 exclusively for terminal-leave payments. The effect of the plan would have been to obviate the possibility that the agency might have to make large terminal-leave payments during the next fiscal year out of general agency funds, should the life of the agency be extended by Congress. In essence, the mechanics of the plan were that agency employees would be discharged, paid accrued annual leave out of the $2,600,000 earmarked for terminal-leave payments, rehired immediately as temporary employees, \n\n[360 \nU.S. 564, 566]\n\u00a0\n and restored to permanent status should the agency's life in fact be extended.\n\nPetitioner, at the time General Manager of the agency, opposed respondents' plan on the ground that it violated the spirit of the Thomas Amendment, 64 Stat. 768,\n2\n and expressed his opposition to the Housing Expediter. The Expediter decided against general adoption of the plan, but at respondent Matteo's request gave permission for its use in connection with approximately fifty employees, including both respondents, on a voluntary basis.\n3\n Thereafter the life of the agency was in fact extended.\n\nSome two and a half years later, on January 28, 1953, the Office of Rent Stabilization received a letter from Senator John J. Williams of Delaware, inquiring about the terminal-leave payments made under the plan in 1950. Respondent Madigan drafted a reply to the letter, which he did not attempt to bring to the attention of petitioner, and then prepared a reply which he sent to petitioner's office for his signature as Acting Director of the agency. Petitioner was out of the office, and a secretary signed the submitted letter, which was then delivered by Madigan to Senator Williams on the morning of February 3, 1953.\n\nOn February 4, 1953, Senator Williams delivered a speech on the floor of the Senate strongly criticizing the \n\n[360 \nU.S. 564, 567]\n\u00a0\n plan, stating that \"to say the least it is an unjustifiable raid on the Federal Treasury, and heads of every agency in the Government who have condoned this practice should be called to task.\" The letter above referred to was ordered printed in the Congressional Record. Other Senators joined in the attack on the plan.\n4\n Their comments were widely reported in the press on February 5, 1953, and petitioner, in his capacity as Acting Director of the agency, received a large number of inquiries from newspapers and other news media as to the agency's position on the matter.\n\nOn that day petitioner served upon respondents letters expressing his intention to suspend them from duty, and at the same time ordered issuance by the office of the press release which is the subject of this litigation, and the text of which appears in the margin.\n5\n\u00a0\n\n[360 \nU.S. 564, 568]\n\u00a0\n\n\nRespondents sued, charging that the press release, in itself and as coupled with the contemporaneous news reports of senatorial reaction to the plan, defamed them to their injury, and alleging that its publication and terms had been actuated by malice on the part of petitioner. Petitioner defended, inter alia, on the ground that the issuance of the press release was protected by either a qualified or an absolute privilege. The trial court overruled these contentions, and instructed the jury to return a verdict for respondents if it found the release defamatory. The jury found for respondents.\n\nPetitioner appealed, raising only the issue of absolute privilege. The judgment of the trial court was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, which held that \"in explaining his decision [to suspend respondents] to the general public [petitioner] . . . went entirely outside his line of duty\" and that thus the absolute privilege, assumed otherwise to be available, did not attach. 100 U.S. App. D.C. 319, 244 F.2d 767. We granted certiorari, vacated the Court of Appeals' judgment, and remanded the case \"with directions to pass upon petitioner's claim of a qualified \n\n[360 \nU.S. 564, 569]\n\u00a0\n privilege.\" \n355 \nU.S. 171, 173\n. On remand the Court of Appeals held that the press release was protected by a qualified privilege, but that there was evidence from which a jury could reasonably conclude that petitioner had acted maliciously, or had spoken with lack of reasonable grounds for believing that his statement was true, and that either conclusion would defeat the qualified privilege. Accordingly it remanded the case to the District Court for retrial. 103 U.S. App. D.C. 176, 256 F.2d 890. At this point petitioner again sought, and we again granted certiorari, \n358 \nU.S. 917\n, to determine whether in the circumstances of this case petitioner's claim of absolute privilege should have stood as a bar to maintenance of the suit despite the allegations of malice made in the complaint.\n\nThe law of privilege as a defense by officers of government to civil damage suits for defamation and kindred torts has in large part been of judicial making, although the Constitution itself gives an absolute privilege to members of both Houses of Congress in respect to any speech, debate, vote, report, or action done in session.\n6\n This Court early held that judges of courts of superior or general authority are absolutely privileged as respects civil suits to recover for actions taken by them in the exercise of their judicial functions, irrespective of the motives with which those acts are alleged to have been performed, Bradley v. Fisher, 13 Wall. 335, and that a like immunity extends to other officers of government whose duties are related to the judicial process. Yaselli v. Goff, 12 F.2d 396, aff'd per curiam, \n275 \nU.S. 503\n, involving a Special Assistant to the Attorney General.\n7\n Nor has the privilege been confined to officers of the legislative and judicial \n\n[360 \nU.S. 564, 570]\n\u00a0\n branches of the Government and executive officers of the kind involved in Yaselli. In Spalding v. Vilas, \n161 \nU.S. 483\n, petitioner brought suit against the Postmaster General, alleging that the latter had maliciously circulated widely among postmasters, past and present, information which he knew to be false and which was intended to deceive the postmasters to the detriment of the plaintiff. This Court sustained a plea by the Postmaster General of absolute privilege, stating that (498-499):\n\n\"In exercising the functions of his office, the head of an Executive Department, keeping within the limits of his authority, should not be under an apprehension that the motives that control his official conduct may, at any time, become the subject of inquiry in a civil suit for damages. It would seriously cripple the proper and effective administration of public affairs as entrusted to the executive branch of the government, if he were subjected to any such restraint. He may have legal authority to act, but he may have such large discretion in the premises that it will not always be his absolute duty to exercise the authority with which he is invested. But if he acts, having authority, his conduct cannot be made the foundation of a suit against him personally for damages, even if the circumstances show that he is not disagreeably impressed by the fact that his action injuriously affects the claims of particular individuals.\"\n8\n\u00a0\n\n[360 \nU.S. 564, 571]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The reasons for the recognition of the privilege have been often stated. It has been thought important that officials of government should be free to exercise their duties unembarrassed by the fear of damage suits in respect of acts done in the course of those duties - suits which would consume time and energies which would otherwise be devoted to governmental service and the threat of which might appreciably inhibit the fearless, vigorous, and effective administration of policies of government. The matter has been admirably expressed by Judge Learned Hand:\n\n \"It does indeed go without saying that an official, who is in fact guilty of using his powers to vent his spleen upon others, or for any other personal motive not connected with the public good, should not escape liability for the injuries he may so cause; and, if it were possible in practice to confine such complaints to the guilty, it would be monstrous to deny recovery. The justification for doing so is that it is impossible to know whether the claim is well founded until the case has been tried, and that to submit all officials, the innocent as well as the guilty, to the burden of a trial and to the inevitable danger of its outcome, would dampen the ardor of all but the most resolute, or the most irresponsible, in the unflinching discharge of their duties. Again and again the public interest calls for action which may turn out to be founded on a mistake, in the face of which an official may later find himself hard put to it to satisfy a jury of his good faith. There must indeed be means of punishing public officers who have been truant to their duties; but that is quite another matter from exposing such as have been honestly mistaken to suit by anyone who has suffered from their errors. As is so often the case, the answer must be found in a balance between the evils inevitable in either alternative. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 564, 572]\n\u00a0\n In this instance it has been though in the end better to leave unredressed the wrongs done by dishonest officers than to subject those who try to do their duty to the constant dread of retaliation. . . .\n\n\n \"The decisions have, indeed, always imposed as a limitation upon the immunity that the official's act must have been within the scope of his powers; and it can be argued that official powers, since they exist only for the public good, never cover occasions where the public good is not their aim, and hence that to exercise a power dishonestly is necessarily to overstep its bounds. A moment's reflection shows, however, that cannot be the meaning of the limitation without defeating the whole doctrine. What is meant by saying that the officer must be acting within his power cannot be more than that the occasion must be such as would have justified the act, if he had been using his power for any of the purposes on whose account it was vested in him. . . .\" Gregoire v. Biddle, 177 F.2d 579, 581.\n\n\n We do not think that the principle announced in Vilas can properly be restricted to executive officers of cabinet rank, and in fact it never has been so restricted by the lower federal courts.\n9\n The privilege is not a badge or emolument of exalted office, but an expression of a policy \n\n[360 \nU.S. 564, 573]\n\u00a0\n designed to aid in the effective functioning of government. The complexities and magnitude of governmental activity have become so great that there must of necessity be a delegation and redelegation of authority as to many functions, and we cannot say that these functions become less important simply because they are exercised by officers of lower rank in the executive hierarchy.\n10\n\u00a0\n\nTo be sure, the occasions upon which the acts of the head of an executive department will be protected by the privilege are doubtless far broader than in the case of an officer with less sweeping functions. But that is because the higher the post, the broader the range of responsibilities and duties, and the wider the scope of discretion, it entails. It is not the title of his office but the duties with which the particular officer sought to be made to respond in damages is entrusted - the relation of the act complained of to \"matters committed by law to his control or supervision,\" Spalding v. Vilas, supra, \n\n[360 \nU.S. 564, 574]\n\u00a0\n at 498 - which must provide the guide in delineating the scope of the rule which clothes the official acts of the executive officer with immunity from civil defamation suits.\n\nJudged by these standards, we hold that petitioner's plea of absolute privilege in defense of the alleged libel published at his direction must be sustained. The question is a close one, but we cannot say that it was not an appropriate exercise of the discretion with which an executive officer of petitioner's rank is necessarily clothed to publish the press release here at issue in the circumstances disclosed by this record. Petitioner was the Acting Director of an important agency of government,\n11\n and was clothed by redelegation with \"all powers, duties, and functions conferred on the President by Title II of the Housing and Rent Act of 1947 . . . .\"\n12\n The integrity of the internal operations of the agency which he headed, and thus his own integrity in his public capacity, had been directly and severely challenged in charges made on the floor of the Senate and given wide publicity; and without his knowledge correspondence which could reasonably be read as impliedly defending a position very different from that which he had from the beginning taken in the matter had been sent to a Senator over his signature and incorporated in the Congressional Record. The issuance of press releases was standard agency practice, as it has become with many governmental agencies in these times. We think that under these circumstances a publicly expressed statement of the position of the agency head, announcing personnel action which he planned to take in reference to the charges so widely disseminated to \n\n[360 \nU.S. 564, 575]\n\u00a0\n the public, was an appropriate exercise of the discretion which an officer of that rank must possess if the public service is to function effectively. It would be an unduly restrictive view of the scope of the duties of a policy-making executive official to hold that a public statement of agency policy in respect to matters of wide public interest and concern is not action in the line of duty. That petitioner was not required by law or by direction of his superiors to speak out cannot be controlling in the case of an official of policy-making rank, for the same considerations which underlie the recognition of the privilege as to acts done in connection with a mandatory duty apply with equal force to discretionary acts at those levels of government where the concept of duty encompasses the sound exercise of discretionary authority.\n13\n\u00a0\n\nThe fact that the action here taken was within the outer perimeter of petitioner's line of duty is enough to render the privilege applicable, despite the allegations of malice in the complaint, for as this Court has said of legislative privilege:\n\n  \"The claim of an unworthy purpose does not  destroy the privilege. Legislators are immune from  deterrents to the uninhibited discharge of their legislative  duty, not for their private indulgence but for  the public good. One must not expect uncommon  courage even in legislators. The privilege would be  of little value if they could be subjected to the cost  and inconvenience and distractions of a trial upon  a conclusion of the pleader, or to the hazard of a judgment  against them based upon a jury's speculation  as to motives.\" Tenney v. Brandhove, \n341 \nU.S. 367\n,  377. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 564, 576]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n We are told that we should forbear from sanctioning any such rule of absolute privilege lest it open the door to wholesale oppression and abuses on the part of unscrupulous government officials. It is perhaps enough to say that fears of this sort have not been realized within the wide area of government where a judicially formulated absolute privilege of broad scope has long existed. It seems to us wholly chimerical to suggest that what hangs in the balance here is the maintenance of high standards of conduct among those in the public service. To be sure, as with any rule of law which attempts to reconcile fundamentally antagonistic social policies, there may be occasional instances of actual injustice which will go unredressed, but we think that price a necessary one to pay for the greater good. And there are of course other sanctions than civil tort suits available to deter the executive official who may be prone to exercise his functions in an unworthy and irresponsible manner. We think that we should not be deterred from establishing the rule which we announce today by any such remote forebodings.\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Petitioner was appointed Acting Director of the agency effective February 9, 1953. On February 5 he occupied that position by designation of the retiring Director, who was absent from the city.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] This statute, part of the General Appropriation Act of 1951, provided that:\n\n\"No part of the funds of, or available for expenditure by any corporation or agency included in this Act, including the government of the District of Columbia, shall be available to pay for annual leave accumulated by any civilian officer or employee during the calendar year 1950 and unused at the close of business on June 30, 1951 . . . .\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The General Accounting Office subsequently ruled that the payments were illegal, and respondents were required to return them.

As far back as December 1791, Attorney General Randolph, through President Washington, without success had urged Congress to provide a clerk. President Madison, when it became evident that residence at Washington had greatly increased the Attorney General's labor, in 1816 urged that he be supplied with `the usual appurtenances to a public office.' A bill to provide offices and a clerk came to the Senate floor on January 10, 1817. . . . Thirty years had passed since the federal government was first organized. Now, Congress provided offices in the Treasury and a clerk at $1,000 a year, with an additional small contingent fund of $500 for such essentials as stationery, fuel, and `a boy to attend the menial duties.'\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] The record indicates that in 1950 the Office of Housing Expediter had some 2,500 employees.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] 61 Stat. 193. See 16 Fed. Reg. 7630.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] Compare United States v. Macdaniel, 7 Pet. 1, 14; United States v. Birdsall, \n233 \nU.S. 223, 230\n-231.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, concurring.\n\nI concur in the reversal of this judgment but briefly summarize my reasons because they are not altogether the same as those stated in the opinion of MR. JUSTICE HARLAN.\n\nThe petitioner Barr, while acting as Director of the Office of Rent Stabilization, a United States Government Agency, issued a press release in which he gave reasons why he intended to suspend the respondents Matteo and Madigan, who were also officers of the Agency. There is some indication in the record that there was an affirmative duty on Mr. Barr to give press releases like this, but however that may be it is clear that his action was forbidden neither by an Act of Congress nor by any governmental rule duly promulgated and in force. It is also clear that \n\n[360 \nU.S. 564, 577]\n\u00a0\n the subject matter discussed in the release was germane to the proper functioning of the Rent Stabilization Agency and Mr. Barr's duties in relation to it. In fact, at the time the release was issued congressional inquiries were being made into the operations of the Agency and the controversy upon which the threatened suspensions were based, and the press release revealed that Barr had requested an opportunity to testify before a Congressional Committee with respect to the whole dispute.\n\nThe effective functioning of a free government like ours depends largely on the force of an informed public opinion. This calls for the widest possible understanding of the quality of government service rendered by all elective or appointed public officials or employees. Such an informed understanding depends, of course, on the freedom people have to applaud or to criticize the way public employees do their jobs, from the least to the most important.\n\nMr. Barr was peculiarly well qualified to inform Congress and the public about the Rent Stabilization Agency. Subjecting him to libel suits for criticizing the way the Agency or its employees perform their duties would certainly act as a restraint upon him. So far as I am concerned, if federal employees are to be subjected to such restraints in reporting their views about how to run the government better, the restraint will have to be imposed expressly by Congress and not by the general libel laws of the States or of the District of Columbia.\n*\n How far the Congress itself could go in barring federal officials and employees from discussing public matters consistently with the First Amendment is a question we need not reach in this case. It is enough for me here that the press release was neither unauthorized nor plainly \n\n[360 \nU.S. 564, 578]\n\u00a0\n beyond the scope of Mr. Barr's official business, but instead related more or less to general matters committed by law to his control and supervision. See Spalding v. Vilas, \n161 \nU.S. 483, 493\n, 498-499.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] This case concerns District of Columbia law. In a companion case, Howard v. Lyons, post. p. 593, the Court rejects an attempt to hold a federal employee liable under the libel law of Massachusetts.\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS joins, dissenting.\n\nThe principal opinion in this case purports to launch the Court on a balancing process in order to reconcile the interest of the public in obtaining fearless executive performance and the interest of the individual in having redress for defamation. Even accepting for the moment that these are the proper interests to be balanced, the ultimate disposition is not the result of a balance. On the one hand, the principal opinion sets up a vague standard under which no government employee can tell with any certainty whether he will receive absolute immunity for his acts. On the other hand, it has not given even the slightest consideration to the interest of the individual who is defamed. It is a complete annihilation of his interest.\n\nI could understand it - though I could not agree - if the Court adopted a broad absolute privilege for certain classes of government officials, or indeed for the entire executive, by broadly extending Spalding v. Vilas, \n161 \nU.S. 483\n. At least that result would yield certainly by allowing government officials to know in advance whether they might issue absolutely privileged statements. But the opinion's test sets no standard to guide executive conduct. As the Government acknowledged on oral argument, Congress, when it creates executive agencies, almost never expressly authorizes the new agency to issue press releases as part of its functions. Nor does it decree which employees of the new agency will have such duties and which will not. By necessity, therefore, the decision will require a de novo appraisal of almost every charge of \n\n[360 \nU.S. 564, 579]\n\u00a0\n defamation by a government official. The records will probably be no more satisfactory than the one now before us - with little more than bald assertions that a specific official has the power to do what resulted in the defamation. The principal opinion cannot even say that Barr's position authorized the press release; the most it can and does say is that it cannot say that the release was not an appropriate exercise of discretion by Barr in this precise situation, ante, p. 574. This creates a presumption that the challenged action is within the officer's scope of duty unless the plaintiff can prove otherwise. Since it has been admitted that, as in this case, these duties are rarely enumerated, an executive assertion on the official's behalf may place an impossible burden of proof on the plaintiff seeking to avoid the defense of absolute privilege. By this unusual approach, the traditional rule that it is the defendant who must sustain his affirmative defense of privilege - and not the plaintiff who must negate that defense - is apparently disregarded.\n1\n\u00a0\n\n\nI.\n\n\nThe history of the privileges conferred upon the three branches of Government is a story of uneven development. Absolute legislative privilege dates back to at least 1399.\n2\n This privilege is given to Congress in the United States Constitution\n3\n and to State Legislatures in the Constitutions of almost all of the States of the Union.\n4\n The absolute \n\n[360 \nU.S. 564, 580]\n\u00a0\n immunity arising out of judicial proceedings existed at least as early as 1608 in England.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nBut what of the executive privilege? Apparently, the earliest English case presenting the problem of immunity outside the legislative and judicial branches of government is Sutton v. Johnstone, 1 T. R. 493, decided in 1786. There, the plaintiff, captain of a warship, sued the commander-in-chief of his squadron for charging plaintiff, maliciously and without probable cause, with disobedience of orders and putting him under arrest and forcing him to face a court-martial. The Court of Exchequer took jurisdiction of the case but was reversed, 1 T. R. 510, on the ground that purely military matters were not within the cognizance of the civil courts.\n6\n During \n\n[360 \nU.S. 564, 581]\n\u00a0\n the next century several other military cases were decided.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nIn Chatterton v. Secretary of State for India, 1895. 2 Q. B. 189, the defendant had been apprised that his action with respect to the plaintiff would be made the subject of a parliamentary inquiry. In the communication alleged to be libelous, the defendant told his Under Secretary what answer should be made if the question were asked him in Parliament. The court affirmed dismissal of the complaint relying on Fraser on The Law of Libel and Slander (1st ed.), p. 95, where the author, with no citations, observed, after relating the history of the military cases:\n\n\"For reasons of public policy the same protection would, no doubt, be given to anything in the nature of an act of state, e. g., to every communication relating to state matters made by one minister to another, or to the Crown.\"\n8\n\u00a0\n\n[360 \nU.S. 564, 582]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n This was the actual birth of executive privilege in England.\n\nSuch was the state of English law when, the next year, this Court decided Spalding v. Vilas, supra. In granting the Postmaster General absolute immunity for \"matters committed by law to his control or supervision,\" this Court relied exclusively on the judicial privilege cases and the English military cases. Thus, leaving aside the military cases, which are unique, the executive privilege in defamation actions would appear to be a judicial creature of less than 65 years' existence. Yet, without statute, this relatively new privilege is being extended to open the possibility of absolute privilege for innumerable government officials.\n\nIt may be assumed, arguendo, that a government employee should have absolute immunity when according to his duty he makes internal reports to his superior or to another upon his superior's order. Cf. Taylor v. Glotfelty, 201 F.2d 51; Farr v. Valentine, 38 App. D.C. 413; DeArnaud v. Ainsworth, 24 App. D.C. 167. This might be a practical necessity of government that would find its justification in the need for a free flow of information within every executive department. It may not be unreasonable to assume that if a maliciously false libel is uttered in an internal report, it will be recognized as such and discredited without further dissemination.\n\nSpalding v. Vilas, supra, presents another situation in which absolute privilege may be justified. There the Court was dealing with the Postmaster General - a Cabinet officer personally responsible to the President of the United States for the operation of one of the major departments of government. Cf. Glass v. Ickes, 73 App. D.C. 3, 117 F.2d 273; Mellon v. Brewer, 57 App. D.C. 126, 18 F.2d 168. The importance of their positions in government as policy makers for the Chief Executive and the fact that they have the expressed trust and \n\n[360 \nU.S. 564, 583]\n\u00a0\n confidence of the President who appointed them and to whom they are personally and directly responsible suggest that the absolute protection partakes of presidential immunity. Perhaps the Spalding v. Vilas rationale would require the extension of such absolute immunity to other government officials who are appointed by the President and are directly responsible to him in policy matters even though they do not hold Cabinet positions.\n9\n But this extension is not now before us, since it is clear that petitioner Barr was not appointed by the President nor was he directly responsible to the President. Barr was exercising powers originally delegated by the President to the Director of Economic Stabilization who redelegated them to the Director of Rent Stabilization.\n10\n And it is not contended that petitioner was under any order to issue a statement in this matter.\n\nI would not extend Spalding v. Vilas to cover public statements of lesser officials. Releases to the public from the executive branch of government imply far greater dangers to the individual claiming to have been defamed than do internal libels. First, of course, a public statement - especially one arguably libelous - is normally intended \n\n[360 \nU.S. 564, 584]\n\u00a0\n for and reaches a larger audience than an internally communicated report. Even if the release can later be shown libelous, it is most unusual for a libeled person to obtain the same hearing that was available for the original press release. Second, a release is communicated to a public in no position to evaluate its accuracy; where the report is made internally, the superior is usually in a position to do so. If the report is false, the superior can undo much of the harm of the report by countermanding it or halting its spread.\n\nGiving officials below cabinet or equivalent rank qualified privilege for statements to the public would in no way hamper the internal operation of the executive department of government, nor would it unduly subordinate the interest of the individual in obtaining redress for the public defamation uttered against him. Cf. Colpoys v. Gates, 73 App. D.C. 193, 118 F.2d 16.\n\n\nII.\n\n\nThe foregoing discussion accepted for the purpose of argument the majority's statement of the interests involved here. But as so often happens in balancing cases, the wrong interests are being balanced. Cf. Barenblatt v. United States, ante, p. 134 (dissenting opinion). This is not a case where the only interest is in plaintiff's obtaining redress of a wrong. The public interest in limiting libel suits against officers in order that the public might be adequately informed is paralleled by another interest of equal importance: that of preserving the opportunity to criticize the administration of our Government and the action of its officials without being subjected to unfair - and absolutely privileged - retorts. If it is important to permit government officials absolute freedom to say anything they wish in the name of public information, it is at least as important to preserve and \n\n[360 \nU.S. 564, 585]\n\u00a0\n foster public discussion concerning our Government and its operation.\n\nIt is clear that public discussion of the action of the Government and its officials is accorded no more than qualified privilege. In most States, even that privilege is further restricted to situations in which the speaker is accurate as to his facts and where the claimed defamation results from conclusions or opinions based on those facts. Only in a minority of States is a public critic of Government even qualifiedly privileged where his facts are wrong.\n11\n Thus, at best, a public critic of the Government has a qualified privilege. Yet here the Court has given some amorphous group of officials - who have the most direct and personal contact with the public - an absolute privilege when their agency or their action is criticized. In this situation, it will take a brave person to criticize government officials knowing that in reply they may libel him with immunity in the name of defending the agency and their own position. This extension of Spalding v. Vilas can only have the added effect of deterring the desirable public discussion of all aspects of our Government and the conduct of its officials. It will sanctify the powerful and silence debate. This is a much more serious danger than the possibility that a government official might occasionally be called upon to defend his actions and to respond in damages for a malicious defamation.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nThe principal opinion, while attempting to balance what it thinks are the factors to be weighed, has not effectuated the goal for which it originally strove. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 564, 586]\n\u00a0\n Rather, its result has been an uncertain standard whose effect can unfold only on a case-to-case basis, and which does not provide a guide for executive conduct. But more important, the opinion has set out the wrong interests and by its extension of absolute privilege in this case has seriously weakened another great public interest - honest and open discussion and criticism of our Government.\n\nI would affirm.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See, e. g., Restatement, Torts, 613, and Prosser, Torts (2d ed. 1955), 629 and cases cited.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See Veeder, Absolute Immunity in Defamation: Legislative and Executive Proceedings, 10 Col.

For the development of this privilege in the United States, see Bradley v. Fisher, 13 Wall. 335.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] This conclusion was justified on the following basis:\n\n\"Commanders, in a day of battle, must act upon delicate suspicions; upon the evidence of their own eye; they must give desperate commands; they must require instantaneous obedience. In case of a general misbehaviors, they may be forced to suspend several officers, and put others in their places.\n\n\n\"A military tribunal is capable of feeling all these circumstances, and understanding that the first, second, and third part of a soldier is obedience. But what condition will a commander be in, if, upon the exercising of his authority, he is liable to be tried by a common law judicature?\n\n.   .  .   .  .\n\n\n\n\"The person unjustly accused is not without his remedy. He has the properest among military men. Reparation is done to him by \n\n[360 \nU.S. 564, 581]\n\u00a0\n an acquittal. And he who accused him unjustly is blasted for ever, and dismissed the service.\" 1 T. R., at 549-550. The House of Lords affirmed. 1 Bro. P. C. 76.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] In Home v. Bentinck, 2 B. & B. 130 (1820), the court upheld a privilege asserted by the defendant against producing in court the document alleged to contain the libel. This effectively foreclosed the action. See also Dickson v. The Earl of Wilton, 1 F. & F. 419 (1859); Keighly v. Bell, 4 F. & F. 763 (1866); Dawkins v. Lord F. Paulet, L. R. 5 Q. B. 94 (1869); Grant v. Secretary of State for India, L. R. 2 C. P. D. 445 (1877). Though this last case was a suit against a civil officer, it arose out of a military situation.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] In 1895 the Secretary of State for India was an important figure in the Government and was a member of the Cabinet. The Statesman's Year-Book (1895) 10.\n\nThroughout these years, suits were brought against members of the executive branches of the British Government but were dismissed on the theory that the officer had acted solely as an agent for the Government and therefore was not personally liable. E. g., Macbeath v. Haldimand, 1 T. R. 172 (1786); Gidley v. Lord Palmerston, 3 B. & B. 275 (1822).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] This might well, for example, include Barr's superior in 1953 - the Director of Economic Stabilization.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Barr's position as Deputy Director was such, on the date of the libel, that he recognized that he was not then entitled to suspend or fire the respondents and could not do so until several days later. (The Government asserted on oral argument that the full powers of the Director would devolve upon anyone who - by virtue of his superiors' leaving town - was in fact the highest ranking member of the agency at the moment. It was in this light that Barr was \"Acting\" Director on the date of the libel.) Even after Barr officially became Acting Director on February 9, 1953, the Government admitted that the Director of Economic Stabilization \"could have\" directed Barr either to make or not to make press releases. When Barr took action against respondents, they appealed the decision to the Director of Economic Stabilization and ultimately were reinstated.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] An extensive compilation of which States adhere to each view may be found in Noel, Defamation of Public Officers and Candidates, 49 Col. L. Rev. 875, 896-897, n. 102-106.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, dissenting.\n*\n\u00a0\n\nI think it is demonstrable that the solution of MR. JUSTICE HARLAN'S opinion to the question whether an absolute privilege should be allowed in these cases is not justified by the considerations offered to support it, and unnecessarily deprives the individual citizen of all redress against malicious defamation. Surely the opinion must recognize the existence of the deep-rooted policy of the common law generally to provide redress against defamation. But the opinion in sweeping terms extinguishes that remedy, if the defamation is committed by a federal official, by erecting the barrier of an absolute privilege. In my view, only a qualified privilege is necessary here, and that is all I would afford the officials. A qualified privilege would be the most the law would allow private citizens under comparable circumstances.\n1\n It would protect the government officer unless it appeared on trial that his communication was (a) defamatory, (b) untrue, and (c) \"malicious.\"\n2\n We write on almost a clean slate here, \n\n[360 \nU.S. 564, 587]\n\u00a0\n and even if Spalding v. Vilas, \n161 \nU.S. 483\n, allows a Cabinet officer the defense of an absolute privilege in defamation suits,\n3\n I see no warrant for extending its doctrine to the extent done - apparently to include every official having some color of discretion to utter communications to Congress or the public. As Judge Magruder pointed out below, 250 F.2d 912, 915, present applications of the doctrine of absolute privilege of public officials are narrowly confined,\n4\n and I think in the light of the considerations involved very rightly so. But MR. JUSTICE HARLAN'S approach seems to clothe with immunity the most obscure subforeman on an arsenal production line who has been delegated authority to hire and fire and who maliciously defames one he discharges. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 564, 588]\n\u00a0\n\n\nA qualified privilege, as I have described, would, in giving the official protection against the consequences of his honest mistakes, give him all the protection he could properly claim. As is quoted, if that were all that there were to the matter, it would be indeed \"monstrous\" to grant the absolute defense and preclude all examination of the matter at the suit of a citizen claiming legal injury. But what more is involved? The opinion's position is simply that there are certain societal interests in relieving federal officials from judicial inquiry into their motives that outweigh all interest in affording relief. There is adopted Judge Learned Hand's statement of this added factor that is said to make an absolute privilege imperative: \"it is impossible to know whether the claim is well founded until the case has been tried, and that to submit all officials, the innocent as well as the guilty, to the burden of a trial and to the inevitable danger of its outcome, would dampen the ardor of all but the most resolute, or the most irresponsible, in the unflinching discharge of their duties.\" Gregoire v. Biddle, 177 F.2d 579, 581. In the first place, Professors Harper and James have, I think, squarely met and refuted that argument on its own terms: \"Where the charge is one of honest mistake we exempt the officer because we deem that an actual holding of liability would have worse consequences than the possibility of an actual mistake (which under the circumstances we are willing to condone). But it is stretching the argument pretty far to say that the mere inquiry into malice would have worse consequences than the possibility of actual malice (which we would not, for a minute, condone). Since the danger that official power will be abused is greatest where motives are improper, the balance here may well swing the other way.\" Harper and James, Torts (1956), p. 1645. And in the second place, the courts should be wary of any argument based on the fear that subjecting government \n\n[360 \nU.S. 564, 589]\n\u00a0\n officers to the nuisance of litigation and the uncertainties of its outcome may put an undue burden on the conduct of the public business. Such a burden is hardly one peculiar to public officers; citizens generally go through life subject to the risk that they may, though in the right, be subject to litigation and the possibility of a miscarriage of justice. It is one of the goals of a well-operating legal system to keep the burden of litigation and the risks of such miscarriages to a minimum; in this area, which is governed by federal law, proof of malice outside of the bare fact of the making of the statement should be forthcoming,\n5\n and summary judgment practice offers protection to the defendant; but the way to minimizing the burdens of litigation does not generally lie through the abolition of a right of redress for an admitted wrong. The method has too much of the flavor of throwing out the baby with the bath - today's sweeping solution insures that government officials of high and low rank will not be involved in litigation over their allegedly defamatory statements, but it achieves this at the cost of letting the citizen who is defamed even with the worst motives go without remedy.\n\nThere is an even more basic objection to the opinion. It deals with large concepts of public policy and purports to balance the societal interests involved in them. It denies the defamed citizen a recovery by characterizing the policy favoring absolute immunity as \"an expression of a policy designed to aid in the effective functioning of government.\" The explanation is said to be that it is \"important that officials of government should be free to exercise their duties unembarrassed by the fear of damage suits in respect of acts done in the course of those duties - suits which would consume time and energies which would otherwise be devoted to governmental service and the threat of which might appreciably inhibit the \n\n[360 \nU.S. 564, 590]\n\u00a0\n fearless, vigorous, and effective administration of policies of government.\" This, I fear, is a gossamer web self-spun without a scintilla of support to which one can point. To come to this conclusion, and to shift the line from the already extensive protection given the public officer by the qualified privilege doctrine, demands the resolution of large imponderables which one might have thought would be better the business of the Legislative Branch. To what extent is it in the public interest that the Executive Branch carry on publicity campaigns in relation to its activities? (Without reviewing all the history, one can say this is a matter on which Congress and the Executive have not always seen eye to eye. See 38 Stat. 212, 5 U.S.C. 54.) To what extent does fear of litigation actually inhibit the conduct of officers in carrying out the public business? To what extent should it? Where does healthy administrative frankness and boldness shade into bureaucratic tyranny? To what extent is supervision by an administrator's superiors effective in assuring that there will be little abuse of a freedom from suit? To what extent can the referral of constituent complaints by Congressmen to the executive agencies (already myriad in number and quite routinized in processing) take the place of actions in the courts of law in securing the injured citizen redress? Can it be assumed, as the opinion appears to assume, that an absolute privilege so broadly enjoyed will not be subject to severe abuse? Does recent history afford instructive parallels in the experience with constitutionally recognized forms of governmental privilege - say the legislative privilege? I do not purport to know the answers to these questions, and I simply submit that the nature of the questions themselves should lead us to forsake any effort on our own to modify over so wide an area the line the common law generally indicates is to be drawn here. This is particularly so in an area not \n\n[360 \nU.S. 564, 591]\n\u00a0\n foreclosed by our previous cases, and one combining the maximum exposure of the citizen's reputation with the most attenuated of interests in the operation of the Government.\n\nThe courts, it must be remembered, are not the only agency for fashioning policy here. One would think, in fact, if the solution afforded through a qualified privilege (which would apply between private parties under analogous circumstances)\n6\n were to be modified on the strength of considerations such as those discussed today, that Congress would provide a more appropriate forum for the determination. The presence of the imponderables I have discussed, their political flavor, and their intimate relation to the practicalities of government management would support this conclusion. If the fears expressed materialized and great inconvenience to the workings of the Government arose out of allowing defamation actions subject to a showing of malice, Congress might well be disposed to intervene. And its intervention might take a less drastic form than the solution today. Pursuant to an Act of Congress, the inconvenience to the government officials made defendants in these suits has been alleviated through the participation of the Department of Justice. Rev. Stat. 359, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 309; Booth v. Fletcher, 69 App. D.C. 351, 101 F.2d 676. Congress might be disposed to intervene further and pay the judgments rendered against executive officers, or provide for a Tort Claims Act amendment to encompass such actions,\n7\n eliminating the officer as a formal party. We ought not, as I fear we do today, for all practical purposes foreclose such consideration of the problem by expanding on the comparable common-law \n\n[360 \nU.S. 564, 592]\n\u00a0\n privilege and wholly immunizing federal officials from defamation suits whenever they can show that their act was incidental to their jobs.\n8\n\u00a0\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] [REPORTER'S NOTE: This opinion applies also to No. 57, Howard v. Lyons et al., post, p. 593.]\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Prosser, Torts (2d ed. 1955), 95.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Actual \"malice\" is required to vitiate a qualified privilege, not simply the \"constructive\" malice that is inferred from the publication. See Harper and James, Torts (1956), 5.27. Definitions of actual \n\n[360 \nU.S. 564, 587]\n\u00a0\n \"malice\" are essayed in Prosser, Torts (2d ed. 1955), pp. 625-629; Harper and James, Torts (1956), 5.27. See Restatement, Torts, 599-605.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The suit in Spalding seems to have been as much, if not more, a suit for malicious interference with advantageous relationships as a libel suit. The Court reviewed the facts and found no false statement. See \n161 \nU.S., at 487\n-493. The case may stand for no more than the proposition that where a Cabinet officer publishes a statement, not factually inaccurate, relating to a matter within his Department's competence, he cannot be charged with improper motives in publication. The Court's opinion leaned heavily on the fact that the contents of the statement (which were not on their face defamatory) were quite accurate, in support of its conclusion that publishing the statement was within the officer's discretion, foreclosing inquiry into his motives. Id., at 489-493. Different considerations suggest themselves where a statement is defamatory and untrue; it is one thing to say that public officers must answer as to their motives for any official action adversely affecting private interests and another that they must as to the publication of defamatory, untrue matter.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The opinion's rationale covers the entire federal bureaucracy, as compared to the numerically much less extensive legislative and judicial privileges. And as to the former, the Constitution speaks, and the resolution of the factors involved in the latter is very obviously within the courts' special competence.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] See note 2, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] See the opinion of the court below in No. 350, 103 U.S. App. D.C. 176, 177, 256 F.2d 890, 891.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] They presently are excluded. 28 U.S.C. 2680 (h).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] There is controversy as to whether it was mandatory upon petitioner in No. 57 to make his report to the Congressmen.

See Farmers Educational & Cooperative Union v. WDAY, Inc., ante, pp. 525, 531.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART, dissenting.\n\nMy brother HARLAN'S opinion contains, it seems to me, a lucid and persuasive analysis of the principles that should guide decision in this troublesome area of law. Where I part company is in the application of these principles to the facts of the present case.\n\nI cannot agree that the issuance by the petitioner of this press release was \"action in the line of duty.\" The statement to the press (set out in note 5 of MR. JUSTICE HARLAN'S opinion) did not serve to further any agency function. Instead, it represented a personally motivated effort on the petitioner's part to disassociate himself from the alleged chicanery with which the agency had been charged.\n\nBy publicizing the action which he intended to take when he became permanent Acting Director, and his past attitude as a lesser functionary, the petitioner was seeking only to defend his own individual reputation. This was not within, but beyond \"the outer perimeter of petitioner's line of duty.\" \n\n[360 \nU.S. 564, 593]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","11":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBARTKUS v. ILLINOIS(1959)\nNo. 14\nArgued: November 19, 1957Decided: March 30, 1959\n\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner was tried and acquitted in a Federal District Court for violation of 18 U.S.C. 2113, which makes it a crime to rob a federally insured bank. On substantially the same evidence, he was later tried and convicted in an Illinois State Court for violation of an Illinois robbery statute. Held:\n\n 1. The cooperation of federal law enforcement officers with Illinois officials did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Pp. 122-124.\n\n\n 2. The Fourteenth Amendment does not impliedly extend the first eight amendments to the States. Pp. 124-126.\n\n\n 3. The Illinois prosecution for violation of its own penal law after a prior acquittal for a federal offense, on substantially the same evidence, did not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Pp. 127-139.\n\n\n\n 7 Ill. 2d 138, 130 N. E. 2d 187, affirmed.\n\n\nWalter T. Fisher, acting under appointment by the Court, \n352 \nU.S. 958\n, reargued the cause and filed a brief on rehearing for petitioner.\n\n\nWilliam C. Wines, Assistant Attorney General of Illinois, reargued the cause for respondent. With him on a brief on rehearing was Latham Castle, Attorney General.\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\nPetitioner was tried in the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on December 18, 1953, for robbery of a federally insured savings and loan association, \n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 122]\n\u00a0\n the General Savings and Loan Association of Cicero, Illinois, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 2113. The case was tried to a jury and resulted in an acquittal. On January 8, 1954, an Illinois grand jury indicted Bartkus. The facts recited in the Illinois indictment were substantially identical to those contained in the prior federal indictment. The Illinois indictment charged that these facts constituted a violation of Illinois Revised Statutes, 1951, c. 38, 501, a robbery statute. Bartkus was tried and convicted in the Criminal Court of Cook County and was sentenced to life imprisonment under the Illinois Habitual Criminal Statute. Ill. Rev. Stat., 1951, c. 38, 602.\n\n\nThe Illinois trial court considered and rejected petitioner's plea of autrefois acquit. That ruling and other alleged errors were challenged before the Illinois Supreme Court which affirmed the conviction. 7 Ill. 2d 138, 130 N. E. 2d 187. We granted certiorari because the petition raised a substantial question concerning the application of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n352 \nU.S. 907, 958\n. On January 6, 1958, the judgment below was affirmed by an equally divided Court. \n355 \nU.S. 281\n. On May 26, 1958, the Court granted a petition for rehearing, vacated the judgment entered January 6, 1958, and restored the case to the calendar for reargument. \n356 \nU.S. 969\n.\n\n\nThe state and federal prosecutions were separately conducted. It is true that the agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation who had conducted the investigation on behalf of the Federal Government turned over to the Illinois prosecuting officials all the evidence he had gathered against the petitioner. Concededly, some of that evidence had been gathered after acquittal in the federal court. The only other connection between the two trials is to be found in a suggestion that the federal sentencing of the accomplices who testified against petitioner in both \n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 123]\n\u00a0\n trials was purposely continued by the federal court until after they testified in the state trial. The record establishes that the prosecution was undertaken by state prosecuting officials within their discretionary responsibility and on the basis of evidence that conduct contrary to the penal code of Illinois had occurred within their jurisdiction. It establishes also that federal officials acted in cooperation with state authorities, as is the conventional practice between the two sets of prosecutors throughout the country.\n1\n It does not support the claim that the State of Illinois in bringing its prosecution was merely a tool of the federal authorities, who thereby avoided the prohibition of the Fifth Amendment against a retrial of \n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 124]\n\u00a0\n a federal prosecution after an acquittal. It does not sustain a conclusion that the state prosecution was a sham and a cover for a federal prosecution, and thereby in essential fact another federal prosecution.\n\n\nSince the new prosecution was by Illinois, and not by the Federal Government, the claim of unconstitutionality must rest upon the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Prior cases in this Court relating to successive state and federal prosecutions have been concerned with the Fifth Amendment, and the scope of its proscription of second prosecutions by the Federal Government, not with the Fourteenth Amendment's effect on state action. We are now called upon to draw on the considerations which have guided the Court in applying the limitations of the Fourteenth Amendment on state powers. We have held from the beginning and uniformly that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not apply to the States any of the provisions of the first eight amendments as such.\n2\n The relevant historical materials have been canvassed by this Court and by legal scholars.\n3\n These materials demonstrate conclusively that Congress and the members of the legislatures of the ratifying States did not contemplate that the Fourteenth Amendment was a short-hand incorporation of the first eight amendments making them applicable as explicit restrictions upon the States.\n\n\nEvidencing the interpretation by both Congress and the States of the Fourteenth Amendment is a comparison of the constitutions of the ratifying States with the Federal \n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 125]\n\u00a0\n Constitution. Having regard only to the grand jury guarantee of the Fifth Amendment, the criminal jury guarantee of the Sixth Amendment, and the civil jury guarantee of the Seventh Amendment, it is apparent that if the first eight amendments were being applied verbatim to the States, ten of the thirty ratifying States would have impliedly been imposing upon themselves constitutional requirements on vital issues of state policies contrary to those present in their own constitutions.\n4\n Or, to approach the matter in a different way, they would be covertly altering provisions of their own constitutions in disregard of the amendment procedures required by those constitutions. Five other States would have been undertaking procedures not in conflict with but not required by their constitutions. Thus only one-half, or fifteen, of the ratifying States had constitutions in explicit accord with these provisions of the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Amendments. Of these fifteen, four made alterations in their constitutions by 1875 which brought them into important conflict with one or more of these provisions of the Federal Constitution. One of the States whose constitution had not included any provision on one of the three procedures under investigation adopted a provision in 1890 which was inconsistent with the Federal Constitution. And so by 1890 only eleven of the thirty ratifying States were in explicit accord with these provisions of the first eight amendments to the Federal Constitution. Four were silent as to one or more of the provisions and fifteen were in open conflict with these same provisions.\n5\n\u00a0\n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 126]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nSimilarly imposing evidence of the understanding of the Due Process Clause is supplied by the history of the admission of the twelve States entering the Union after the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. In the case of each, Congress required that the State's constitution be \"not repugnant\" to the Constitution of the United States.\n6\n Not one of the constitutions of the twelve States contains all three of the procedures relating to grand jury, criminal jury, and civil jury. In fact all twelve have provisions obviously different from the requirements of the Fifth, Sixth, or Seventh Amendments. And yet, in the case of each admission, either the President of the United States, or Congress, or both have found that the constitution was in conformity with the Enabling Act and the Constitution of the United States.\n7\n Nor is there warrant to believe that the States in adopting constitutions with the specific purpose of complying with the requisites of admission were in fact evading the demands of the Constitution of the United States.\n\n\nSurely this compels the conclusion that Congress and the States have always believed that the Due Process Clause brought into play a basis of restrictions upon the States other than the undisclosed incorporation of the original eight amendments. In Hurtado v. California, \n110 \nU.S. 516\n, this Court considered due process in its historical setting, reviewed its development as a concept in Anglo-American law from the time of the Magna Carta until the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth \n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 127]\n\u00a0\n Amendment and concluded that it was intended to be a flexible concept, responsive to thought and experience - experience which is reflected in a solid body of judicial opinion, all manifesting deep convictions to be unfolded by a process of \"inclusion and exclusion.\" Davidson v. New Orleans, \n96 \nU.S. 97, 104\n. Time and again this Court has attempted by general phrases not to define but to indicate the purport of due process and to adumbrate the continuing adjudicatory process in its application. The statement by Mr. Justice Cardozo in Palko v. Connecticut, \n302 \nU.S. 319\n, has especially commended itself and been frequently cited in later opinions.\n8\n Referring to specific situations, he wrote:\n\n \"In these and other situations immunities that are  valid as against the federal government by force of  the specific pledges of particular amendments have  been found to be implicit in the concept of ordered  liberty, and thus, through the Fourteenth Amendment,  become valid as against the states.\" 302  U.S., at 324-325.\n\n\n\n About the meaning of due process, in broad perspective unrelated to the first eight amendments, he suggested that it prohibited to the States only those practices \"repugnant to the conscience of mankind.\" \n302 \nU.S., at 323\n. In applying these phrases in Palko, the Court ruled that, while at some point the cruelty of harassment by multiple prosecutions by a State would offend due process, the specific limitation imposed on the Federal Government by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment did not bind the States.\n\n\nDecisions of this Court concerning the application of the Due Process Clause reveal the necessary process of \n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 128]\n\u00a0\n balancing relevant and conflicting factors in the judicial application of that Clause. In Chambers v. Florida, \n309 \nU.S. 227\n, we held that a state conviction of murder was void because it was based upon a confession elicited by applying third-degree methods to the defendant. But we have also held that a second execution necessitated by a mechanical failure in the first attempt was not in violation of due process. Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, \n329 \nU.S. 459\n. Decisions under the Due Process Clause require close and perceptive inquiry into fundamental principles of our society. The Anglo-American system of law is based not upon transcendental revelation but upon the conscience of society ascertained as best it may be by a tribunal disciplined for the task and environed by the best safeguards for disinterestedness and detachment.\n\n\nConstitutional challenge to successive state and federal prosecutions based upon the same transaction or conduct is not a new question before the Court though it has now been presented with conspicuous ability.\n9\n The Fifth \n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 129]\n\u00a0\n Amendment's proscription of double jeopardy has been invoked and rejected in over twenty cases of real or hypothetical successive state and federal prosecution cases before this Court. While United States v. Lanza, \n260 \nU.S. 377\n, was the first case in which we squarely held valid a federal prosecution arising out of the same facts which had been the basis of a state conviction, the validity of such a prosecution by the Federal Government has not been questioned by this Court since the opinion in Fox v. Ohio, 5 How. 410, more than one hundred years ago.\n\n\nIn Fox v. Ohio argument was made to the Supreme Court that an Ohio conviction for uttering counterfeit money was invalid. This assertion of invalidity was based in large part upon the argument that since Congress had imposed federal sanctions for the counterfeiting of money, a failure to find that the Supremacy Clause precluded the States from punishing related conduct would expose an individual to double punishment. Mr. Justice Daniel, writing for the Court (with Mr. Justice McLean dissenting), recognized as true that there was a possibility of double punishment, but denied that from this flowed a finding of pre-emption, concluding instead that both the Federal and State Governments retained the power to impose criminal sanctions, the United States because of its interest in protecting the purity of its currency, the States because of their interest in protecting their citizens against fraud.\n\n\nIn some eight state cases decided prior to Fox the courts of seven States had discussed the validity of successive state and federal prosecutions. In three, Missouri,\n10\n North Carolina,\n11\n and Virginia,\n12\n it had been said that there would be no plea in bar to prevent the second prosecution. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 130]\n\u00a0\n Discussions in two cases in South Carolina were in conflict - the earlier opinion\n13\n expressing belief that there would be a bar, the later,\n14\n without acknowledging disagreement with the first, denying the availability of a plea in bar. In three other States, Vermont,\n15\n Massachusetts,\n16\n and Michigan,\n17\n courts had stated that a prosecution by one government would bar prosecution by another government of a crime based on the same conduct. The persuasiveness of the Massachusetts and Michigan decisions is somewhat impaired by the precedent upon which they relied in their reasoning. In the Supreme Court case cited in the Massachusetts and Michigan cases, Houston v. Moore, 5 Wheat. 1, there is some language to the effect that there would be a bar to a second prosecution by a different government. 5 Wheat., at 31. But that language by Mr. Justice Washington reflected his belief that the state statute imposed state sanctions for violation of a federal criminal law. 5 Wheat., at 28. As he viewed the matter, the two trials would not be of similar crimes arising out of the same conduct; they would be of the same crime. Mr. Justice Johnson agreed that if the state courts had become empowered to try the defendant for the federal offense, then such a state trial would bar a federal prosecution. 5 Wheat., at 35. Thus Houston v. Moore can be cited only for the presence of a bar in a case in which the second trial is for a violation of the very statute whose violation by the same conduct has already been tried in the courts of another government empowered to try that question.\n18\n\u00a0\n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 131]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe significance of this historical background of decisions prior to Fox is that it was, taking a position most favorable to advocates of the bars of autrefois acquit and autrefois convict in cases like that before this Court, totally inconclusive. Conflicting opinions concerning the applicability of the plea in bar may manifest conflict in conscience. They certainly do not manifest agreement that to permit successive state and federal prosecutions for different crimes arising from the same acts would be repugnant to those standards of outlawry which offend the conception of due process outlined in Palko. (It is worth noting that Palko sustained a first degree murder conviction returned in a second trial after an appeal by the State from an acquittal of first degree murder.) The early state decisions had clarified the issue by stating the opposing arguments. The process of this Court's response to the Fifth Amendment challenge was begun in Fox v. Ohio, continued in United States v. Marigold, 9 How. 560, and was completed in Moore v. Illinois, 14 How. 13. Mr. Justice Grier, writing for the Court in Moore v. Illinois, gave definitive statement to the rule which had been evolving:\n\n\"An offence, in its legal signification, means the transgression of a law.\" 14 How., at 19.\n\n\n\"Every citizen of the United States is also a citizen of a State or territory. He may be said to owe allegiance to two sovereigns, and may be liable to punishment for an infraction of the laws of either. The same act may be an offence or transgression of the laws of both.\" 14 How., at 20.\n\n\n\"That either or both may (if they see fit) punish such an offender, cannot be doubted. Yet it cannot \n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 132]\n\u00a0\n be truly averred that the offender has been twice punished for the same offence; but only that by one act he has committed two offences, for each of which he is justly punishable. He could not plead the punishment by one in bar to a conviction by the other.\" Ibid.\n\n\n\n In a dozen cases decided by this Court between Moore v. Illinois and United States v. Lanza this Court had occasion to reaffirm the principle first enunciated in Fox v. Ohio.\n19\n Since Lanza the Court has five times repeated the rule that successive state and federal prosecutions are not in violation of the Fifth Amendment.\n20\n Indeed Mr. Justice Holmes once wrote of this rule that it \"is too plain to need more than statement.\"\n21\n One of the post-Lanza cases, Jerome v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 101\n, involved the same federal statute under which Bartkus was indicted and in Jerome this Court recognized that successive state and federal prosecutions were thereby made possible because all States had general robbery statutes. Nonetheless, a unanimous Court, as recently as 1943, accepted as unquestioned constitutional law that such successive prosecutions would not violate the proscription of double \n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 133]\n\u00a0\n jeopardy included in the Fifth Amendment. \n318 \nU.S., at 105\n.\n22\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe lower federal courts have of course been in accord with this Court.\n23\n Although some can be cited only in \n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 134]\n\u00a0\n that they follow the decisions of this Court, others manifest reflection upon the issues involved and express reasoned approval of the two-sovereignty principle. In United States v. Barnhart, 22 F. 285, the Oregon Circuit Court was presented with a case just the obverse of the present one: the prior trial and acquittal was by a state court; the subsequent trial was by a federal court. The Circuit Court rejected defendant's plea of autrefois acquit, saying that the hardship of the second trial might operate to persuade against the bringing of a subsequent prosecution but could not bar it.\n\n\nThe experience of state courts in dealing with successive prosecutions by different governments is obviously also relevant in considering whether or not the Illinois prosecution of Bartkus violated due process of law. Of the twenty-eight States which have considered the validity of successive state and federal prosecutions as against a challenge of violation of either a state constitutional double-jeopardy provision or a common-law evidentiary rule of autrefois acquit and autrefois convict, twenty-seven have refused to rule that the second prosecution \n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 135]\n\u00a0\n was or would be barred.\n24\n These States were not bound to follow this Court and its interpretation of the Fifth Amendment. The rules, constitutional, statutory, or common law which bound them, drew upon the same \n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 136]\n\u00a0\n experience as did the Fifth Amendment, but were and are of separate and independent authority.\n\n\nNot all of the state cases manifest careful reasoning, for in some of them the language concerning double jeopardy is but offhand dictum. But in an array of state cases there may be found full consideration of the arguments supporting and denying a bar to a second prosecution. These courts interpreted their rules as not proscribing a second prosecution where the first was by a different government and for violation of a different statute.\n\n\nWith this body of precedent as irrefutable evidence that state and federal courts have for years refused to bar a second trial even though there had been a prior trial by another government for a similar offense, it would be disregard of a long, unbroken, unquestioned course of impressive adjudication for the Court now to rule that due process compels such a bar. A practical justification for rejecting such a reading of due process also commends \n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 137]\n\u00a0\n itself in aid of this interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment. In Screws v. United States, \n325 \nU.S. 91\n, defendants were tried and convicted in a federal court under federal statutes with maximum sentences of a year and two years respectively. But the state crime there involved was a capital offense. Were the federal prosecution of a comparatively minor offense to prevent state prosecution of so grave an infraction of state law, the result would be a shocking and untoward deprivation of the historic right and obligation of the States to maintain peace and order within their confines. It would be in derogation of our federal system to displace the reserved power of States over state offenses by reason of prosecution of minor federal offenses by federal authorities beyond the control of the States.\n25\n\u00a0\n\n\nSome recent suggestions that the Constitution was in reality a deft device for establishing a centralized government are not only without factual justification but fly in the face of history. It has more accurately been shown that the men who wrote the Constitution as well as the citizens of the member States of the Confederation were fearful of the power of centralized government and sought to limit its power. Mr. Justice Brandeis has written that separation of powers was adopted in the Constitution \"not to promote efficiency but to preclude the exercise of arbitrary power.\"\n26\n Time has not lessened the concern of the Founders in devising a federal system which would likewise be a safeguard against arbitrary government. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 138]\n\u00a0\n The greatest self-restraint is necessary when that federal system yields results with which a court is in little sympathy.\n\n\nThe entire history of litigation and contention over the question of the imposition of a bar to a second prosecution by a government other than the one first prosecuting is a manifestation of the evolutionary unfolding of law. Today a number of States have statutes which bar a second prosecution if the defendant has been once tried by another government for a similar offense.\n27\n A study of the cases under the New York statute,\n28\n which is typical of these laws, demonstrates that the task of determining when the federal and state statutes are so much alike that a prosecution under the former bars a prosecution under the latter is a difficult one.\n29\n The proper solution of that problem frequently depends upon a judgment of the gravamen of the state statute. It depends also upon an understanding of the scope of the bar that has been historically granted in the State to prevent successive state prosecutions. Both these problems are ones with which the States are obviously more competent to deal than is this Court. Furthermore, the rules resulting will intimately affect the efforts of a State to develop a rational and just body of criminal law in the protection of its citizens. We ought not to utilize the Fourteenth Amendment \n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 139]\n\u00a0\n to interfere with this development. Finally, experience such as that of New York may give aid to Congress in its consideration of adoption of similar provisions in individual federal criminal statutes or in the federal criminal code.\n30\n\u00a0\n\n\nPrecedent, experience, and reason alike support the conclusion that Alfonse Bartkus has not been deprived of due process of law by the State of Illinois.\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n\n\n [For dissenting opinion of MR.

This statute punishes robberies of national banks, banks which are members of the Federal Reserve System, and banks the funds of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. And here again there has been no usurpation by the federal government. The states still may prosecute any robbery of any bank within their jurisdiction, and they frequently do. There have been several cases in the last few years where men have been convicted both under the state and federal law for robbing the same bank. In fact, there have been cases where men have been tried under the law of one jurisdiction, acquitted, and on the same facts tried under the law of the other sovereignty and convicted. Bank robbers know today that `flight,' their most valuable weapon, has, under the operation of the National Bank Robbery statute, proved quite impotent. The bank robbery rate has been cut in half, and there has been a fine relation between state and federal agencies in the apprehension and trial of bank robbers.\" Id., at 114.\n\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 23\n] McKinney v.

JUSTICE BLACK, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS concur, dissenting.\n\n\nPetitioner, Bartkus, was indicted in a United States District Court for bank robbery. He was tried by a jury and acquitted. So far as appears the trial was conducted fairly by an able and conscientious judge. Later, Bartkus was indicted in an Illinois state court for the same bank robbery. This time he was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. His acquittal in the federal court would have barred a second trial in any court of the United States because of the provision in the Fifth Amendment that no person shall \"be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\" The Court today rejects Bartkus' contention that his state conviction after a federal acquittal violates the Fourteenth Amendment to our Constitution. I cannot agree.\n\n\nThe Court's holding further limits our already weakened constitutional guarantees against double prosecutions. United States v. Lanza, \n260 \nU.S. 377\n, decided in 1922, allowed federal conviction and punishment of a man who had been previously convicted and punished for the identical acts by one of our States. Today, for the first time in its history, this Court upholds the state conviction of a defendant who had been acquitted of the same offense in the federal courts. I would hold that a federal trial following either state acquittal or conviction is barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Abbate v. United States, post, p. 201 (dissenting opinion). And, quite apart from whether that clause is as fully binding on the States as it is on the Federal Government, see Adamson v. California, \n332 \nU.S. 46, 68\n (dissenting opinion), I would hold that Bartkus' conviction cannot stand. For I think double prosecutions for the same offense are so contrary to the spirit of our free country that they violate even the prevailing view of the \n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 151]\n\u00a0\n Fourteenth Amendment, expressed in Palko v. Connecticut, \n302 \nU.S. 319\n.\n1\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment, this Court said in Palko, does not make all of the specific guarantees of the Bill of Rights applicable to the States. But, the Court noted, some of \"the privileges and immunities\" of the Bill of Rights, \"have been taken over . . . and brought within the Fourteenth Amendment by a process of absorption.\" \n302 \nU.S., at 326\n. The Court indicated that incorporated in due process were those \"principle[s] of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.\" \n302 \nU.S., at 325\n.\n2\n It then held that a statute allowing a State to appeal in a criminal case did not violate such fundamental principles. But it expressly left open the question of whether \"the state [could be] permitted after a trial free from error to try the accused over again.\" \n302 \nU.S., at 328\n. That question is substantially before us today.\n\n\nFear and abhorrence of governmental power to try people twice for the same conduct is one of the oldest ideas found in western civilization. Its roots run deep into \n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 152]\n\u00a0\n Greek and Roman times.\n3\n Even in the Dark Ages, when so many other principles of justice were lost, the idea that one trial and one punishment were enough remained alive through the canon law and the teachings of the early Christian writers.\n4\n By the thirteenth century it seems to have been firmly established in England,\n5\n where it came \n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 153]\n\u00a0\n to be considered as a \"universal maxim of the common law.\"\n6\n It is not surprising, therefore, that the principle was brought to this country by the earliest settlers as part of their heritage of freedom,\n7\n and that it has been \n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 154]\n\u00a0\n recognized here as fundamental again and again.\n8\n Today it is found, in varying forms, not only in the Federal Constitution, but in the jurisprudence or constitutions of every State, as well as most foreign nations.\n9\n It has, in fact, been described as a part of all advanced systems of law\n10\n and as one of those universal principles \"of reason, justice, and conscience, of which Cicero said: `Nor is it one thing at Rome and another at Athens, one now and another in the future, but among all nations it is the same.'\"\n11\n While some writers have explained the opposition to double prosecutions by emphasizing the injustice inherent in two punishments for the same act,\n12\n and others have stressed the dangers to the innocent from allowing the full power of the state to be brought against them \n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 155]\n\u00a0\n in two trials,\n13\n the basic and recurring theme has always simply been that it is wrong for a man to \"be brought into Danger for the same Offence more than once.\"\n14\n Few principles have been more deeply \"rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people.\"\n\n\nThe Court apparently takes the position that a second trial for the same act is somehow less offensive if one of the trials is conducted by the Federal Government and the other by a State. Looked at from the standpoint of the individual who is being prosecuted, this notion is too subtle for me to grasp. If double punishment is what is feared, it hurts no less for two \"Sovereigns\" to inflict it than for one. If danger to the innocent is emphasized, that danger is surely no less when the power of State and Federal Governments is brought to bear on one man in two trials, than when one of these \"Sovereigns\" proceeds alone. In each case, inescapably, a man is forced to face danger twice for the same conduct.\n\n\nThe Court, without denying the almost universal abhorrence of such double prosecutions, nevertheless justifies the practice here in the name of \"federalism.\" This, it seems to me, is a misuse and desecration of the concept. Our Federal Union was conceived and created \"to establish Justice\" and to \"secure the Blessings of Liberty,\" not to destroy any of the bulwarks on which both freedom and justice depend. We should, therefore, be suspicious of any supposed \"requirements\" of \"federalism\" which result in obliterating ancient safeguards. I have been shown nothing in the history of our Union, in the writings of its Founders, or elsewhere, to indicate that individual rights deemed essential by both State and Nation were to \n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 156]\n\u00a0\n be lost through the combined operations of the two governments. Nor has the Court given any sound reason for thinking that the successful operation of our dual system of government depends in the slightest on the power to try people twice for the same act.\n\n\nImplicit in the Court's reliance on \"federalism\" is the premise that failure to allow double prosecutions would seriously impair law enforcement in both State and Nation. For one jurisdiction might provide minor penalties for acts severely punished by the other and by accepting pleas of guilty shield wrongdoers from justice. I believe this argument fails on several grounds. In the first place it relies on the unwarranted assumption that State and Nation will seek to subvert each other's laws. It has elsewhere been persuasively argued that most civilized nations do not and have not needed the power to try people a second time to protect themselves even when dealing with foreign lands.\n15\n It is inconceivable to me, as it was to the Constitutional Court of South Carolina in 1816, that \"If this prevails among nations who are strangers \n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 157]\n\u00a0\n to each other, [it could] fail to [prevail] with us who are so intimately bound by political ties.\" State v. Antonio, 2 Treadway's Const. Rep. (S. C.) 776, 781. Cf. Testa v. Katt, \n330 \nU.S. 386\n.\n\n\nThe Court's argument also ignores the fact that our Constitution allocates power between local and federal governments in such a way that the basic rights of each can be protected without double trials. The Federal Government is given power to act in limited areas only, but in matters properly within its scope it is supreme. It can retain exclusive control of such matters, or grant the States concurrent power on its own terms. If the States were to subvert federal laws in these areas by imposing inadequate penalties, Congress would have full power to protect the national interest, either by defining the crime to be punished and establishing minimum penalties applicable in both state and federal courts, or by excluding the States altogether. Conversely, in purely local matters the power of the States is supreme and exclusive. State courts can and should, therefore, protect all essentially local interests in one trial without federal interference. Cf. Rutkin v. United States, \n343 \nU.S. 130, 139\n (dissenting opinion). In areas, however, where the Constitution has vested power in the Federal Government the States necessarily act only to the extent Congress permits, and it is no infringement on their basic rights if Congress chooses to fix penalties smaller than some of them might wish. In fact, this will rarely occur, for Congress is not likely to use indirect means to limit state power when it could accomplish the same result directly by pre-empting the field.\n16\n\u00a0\n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 158]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nUltimately the Court's reliance on federalism amounts to no more than the notion that, somehow, one act becomes two because two jurisdictions are involved. Hawkins, in his Pleas of the Crown, long ago disposed of a similar contention made to justify two trials for the same offense by different counties as \"a mere Fiction or Construction of Law, which shall hardly take Place against a Maxim made in Favour of Life.\"\n17\n It was discarded as a dangerous fiction then, it should be discarded as a dangerous fiction now.\n\n\nTo bolster its argument that successive state and federal prosecutions do not violate basic principles of justice, the Court cites many cases. It begins with eight early state decisions which, it says, \"clarified the issue by stating opposing arguments.\" Four of these cases held that prosecution by one government must bar subsequent prosecutions elsewhere.\n18\n Two of the remaining four refused to hold that concurrent jurisdiction could exist since they feared that such a holding might bring about two trials for the same offense, a result they considered too shocking to tolerate. \"This is against natural justice,\" said the North Carolina Superior Court in 1794, \"and therefore I cannot believe it to be law.\"\n19\n The seventh case cited is an inconclusive discussion coming from a State whose highest court had previously stated \n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 159]\n\u00a0\n unequivocally that a bar against double prosecutions would exist.\n20\n Thus only of these early state cases actually approves the doctrine the Court today advances, and that approval is in dicta.\n21\n Significantly, the highest court of the same State later expressed the view that such double trials would virtually never occur in our country.\n22\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Court relies mainly, however, on a later line of decisions starting with Fox v. Ohio, 5 How. 410. Most of these, like Fox itself, involved only the question of whether both State and Federal Governments could make the same conduct a crime. Although some, in dicta, admitted the possibility that double prosecutions might result from such concurrent power, others did not discuss the question.\n23\n Many, especially among the earlier cases, pointed out that double punishment violates the genius of our \n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 160]\n\u00a0\n free country and therefore would never occur. As Chief Justice Taney, on circuit, said in one of them \"Yet in all civilized countries it is recognized as a fundamental principle of justice that a man ought not to be punished twice for the same offence; and if this party had been punished . . . in the state tribunal, the court would have felt it to be its duty to suspend sentence, and to represent the facts to the president to give him an opportunity of . . . granting a pardon.\"\n24\n While a limited number of cases after Fox are cited in which a double conviction was upheld, in several of these the second court was so troubled by the result that only nominal sentences were imposed.\n25\n In fact, before United States v. Lanza, \n260 \nU.S. 377\n (1922), where this Court upheld and encouraged the practice, the cases of actual double punishment found are so few, in relation to the great mass of criminal cases decided, that one can readily discern an instinctive unwillingness to impose such hardships on defendants.\n26\n\u00a0\n\n\nDespite its exhaustive research, the Court has cited only three cases before Lanza where a new trial after an acquittal was upheld. In one of these, United States v. Barnhart, 22 F. 285, the state court in which the defendant had been acquitted did not have jurisdiction of the action. The Federal Circuit Court relied on this lack of jurisdiction in allowing a retrial, but made \n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 161]\n\u00a0\n an alternate holding based on the same general arguments used by the Court today.\n27\n The Barnhart opinion also intimated that the first trial may have been a sham.\n28\n Sham trials, as well as those by courts without jurisdiction, have been considered by courts and commentators not to be jeopardy, and might therefore not bar subsequent convictions.\n29\n In the second case cited by the Court, the state conviction followed acquittal by a federal court-martial at a time when, as the state court seemed to recognize, a military trial was thought by many not to be a trial for the purpose of double jeopardy even when both trials were conducted by the same \"Sovereign.\"\n30\n The third case relied on, a 1915 decision from the State of Washington, is the only one of the three where it can fairly be said that a defendant acquitted in a proper \n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 162]\n\u00a0\n jury trial was subsequently tried again by a jury and convicted.\n31\n\u00a0\n\n\nOne may, I think, infer from the fewness of the cases that retrials after acquittal have been considered particularly obnoxious, worse even, in the eyes of many, than retrials after conviction.\n32\n I doubt, in fact, if many practices which have been found to violate due process can boast of so little actual support. Yet it is on this meager basis that the Court must ultimately rest its finding that Bartkus' retrial does not violate fundamental principles \"rooted in the traditions and conscience of our peoples.\" Nor are these scattered and dubious cases unchallenged, for, balanced against them, we have a firm holding by this Court sustaining an extremely narrow construction of a federal statute in order to make a state acquittal conclusive in the federal courts and thereby avoid the evil approved today. United States v. Mason, \n213 \nU.S. 115\n. That case, as well as the \"sacred duty . . . to maintain unimpaired those securities for the personal rights of the individual which have received for ages the sanction of the jurist and the statesman,\" Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163, 178, should make us doubly hesitant to encourage so blatant a violation of constitutional policies against double trials by giving an \"illiberal construction . . . to the words of the fundamental law in which they are embodied.\" Ibid.\n\n\nSince Lanza people have apparently become more accustomed to double trials, once deemed so shocking, just \n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 163]\n\u00a0\n as they might, in time, adjust themselves to all other violations of the Bill of Rights should they be sanctioned by this Court. The Court is therefore able to find a 1943 state case, as well as four federal cases in the last five years, in which a conviction following acquittal was sustained.\n33\n Thus this practice, which for some 150 years was considered so undesirable that the Court must strain to find examples, is now likely to become a commonplace. For, after today, who will be able to blame a conscientious prosecutor for failing to accept a jury verdict of acquittal when he believes a defendant guilty and knows that a second try is available in another jurisdiction and that such a second try is approved by the Highest Court in the Land? Inevitably, the victims of such double prosecutions will most often be the poor and the weak in our society, individuals without friends in high places who can influence prosecutors not to try them again. The power to try a second time will be used, as have all similar procedures, to make scapegoats of helpless, political, religious, or racial minorities and those who differ, who do not conform and who resist tyranny. See Chambers v. Florida, \n309 \nU.S. 227, 236\n.\n\n\nThere are some countries that allow the dangerous practice of trying people twice. I am inserting below a recent news item about a man who was tried, convicted, sentenced to prison and then was tried again, convicted and sentenced to death.\n34\n Similar examples are not hard \n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 164]\n\u00a0\n to find in lands torn by revolution or crushed by dictatorship. I had thought that our constitutional protections embodied in the Double Jeopardy and Due Process Clauses would have barred any such things happening here. Unfortunately, last year's holdings by this Court in Ciucci v. Illinois, \n356 \nU.S. 571\n, and Hoag v. New Jersey, \n356 \nU.S. 464\n, and today's affirmance of the convictions of Bartkus and Abbate cause me to fear that in an important number of cases it can happen here.\n\n\nI would reverse.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] While I participated in the Court's holding and opinion in Palko I have since expressed my disagreement with both, as has MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS. Adamson v. California, \n322 \nU.S. 46, 68\n (dissenting opinion). See also Rochin v. California, \n342 \nU.S. 165, 174\n, 177 (concurring opinion); Hoag v. New Jersey, \n356 \nU.S. 464, 477\n, 480, n. 5 (dissenting opinion).\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Court expressed the same thought in various other ways. The crucial principles were termed those \"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,\" \n302 \nU.S., at 325\n; those without which it would be impossible \"to maintain a fair and enlightened system of justice,\" ibid.; or without which \"neither liberty nor justice would exist,\" id., at 326; those \"fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions,\" and those whose absence creates \"a hardship so acute and shocking that our polity will not endure it.\" Id., at 328.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See Bonner, Lawyers and Litigants in Ancient Athens, 195; 1 Potter, Grecian Antiquities (1808), 194; Radin, Roman Law, 475, n. 28; 2 Sherman, Roman Law in the Modern World (3d ed. 1937), 488-489; Berner, Non bis in idem, 3 Archiv fur Preussisches Strafrecht (1855), 472; Digest of Justinian: Digest 48.2.7.2, translated in 11 Scott, The Civil Law, 17, as \"The governor should not permit the same person to be again accused of crime of which he has been acquitted.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The canon law opposition to double trials stemmed from a reading given by St. Jerome in 391 A. D. to I Nahum 9 (Douay version), \"there shall not rise a double affliction.\" (In the King James version, I Nahum 9, is given as \"affliction shall not rise up the second time.\") Jerome drew from this the rule that God does not punish twice for the same act. See 25 Migne, Patrologia Latina (1845), 1238. This maxim found its way into church canons as early as 847 A. D. and was subsequently given as, \"Not even God judges twice for the same act.\" See Brooke, The English Church and the Papacy, 205; 2 Maitland, Collected Papers (Fisher ed. 1911), Essay, Henry II and the Criminous Clerks, 239; 1 Pollock and Maitland, History of English Law (2d ed. 1899), 448-449; Poole, Domesday Book to Magna Carta, 206. See also Berner, op. cit., supra, note 3, emphasizing the Roman antecedents of the canon law rule.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] See 2 Bracton, De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae (Wood-bine ed. 1922), 391, 397, applying the concept even to acquittals in trial by battle. Cf. 2 Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown (4th ed. 1762), 368-379; 2 Staundeforde, Les Plees Del Corone (rev. ed. 1583), 105-108.\n\n\nIn the twelfth century avoidance of double punishment was a major element in the celebrated controversy between St. Thomas Becket and King Henry II. Henry wanted clerics who had been convicted of crimes in church courts turned over to lay tribunals for their punishment. Whether Becket was in fact correct in his assertions that Henry's proposals would result in double punishment for the clerics has been much debated by historians. In all events, \n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 153]\n\u00a0\n Henry's plan was abandoned after Becket's murder. See Brooke, op. cit., supra, note 4, at 190-214; 2 Maitland, op. cit., supra, note 4; 1 Pollock and Maitland, op. cit., supra, note 4, at 447-456; Poole, op. cit., supra, note 4, at 203-218.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] 2 Cooley's Blackstone (4th ed. 1899), *335, 336.

One commentator has stated that the concept was borrowed by English law from the canon law doctrine of criminal procedure. Radin, Anglo-American Legal History, 228.\n\n\nIn 1487 an exception was made in the rule by a statute dealing with the \"Authority of the Court of Star Chamber,\" 3 Hen. 7, c. 1. At the time criminal proceedings could be brought in two ways, by government indictment and by the parties who suffered injury from the crime. 3 Hen. 7, c. 1, provided that in \"Death or Murder\" cases a defendant acquitted or attainted under government prosecution could be tried again on charges brought by \"the Wife, or next Heir to him so slain.\" The Act was apparently never broadened and was given an extremely narrow construction. See Hawkins, op. cit., supra, note 5, at 373-374, 377-379. See also Staundeforde, op. cit., supra, note 5, at 106-108. It soon fell into disuse, and the legal profession was greatly shocked when, in 1818, the statute was relied on to justify the retrial of a defendant who had previously been acquitted. After many maneuvers, which included upholding the defendant's right to trial by battle, a second acquittal was obtained, and the loophole in the \"universal rule\" against double trials was formally plugged by Parliament. See Radin, Anglo-American Legal History, 226-227, n. 24; Kirk, \"Jeopardy\" During the Period of the Year Books, 32[\u00ee] U. Pa. L. Rev. 602, 608-609.\n\n\n [\u00ee] ERRATA: \"32\" should be \"82\".\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The Body of Liberties of Massachusetts (1641), clause 42, reads, \"No man shall be twise sentenced by Civil Justice for one and the same Crime, offense, or Trespasse.\" See also The Laws and Liberties of Massachusetts (1648) (Farrand ed. 1929) 47, \"everie Action . . . in criminal Causes shall be . . . entred in the rolls of everie Court . . . that such Actions be not afterwards brought again to \n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 154]\n\u00a0\n the vexation of any man.\" Similarly the pleas of former conviction and acquittal were recognized in colonial Virginia.

The court was correct in its belief that the state court had no jurisdiction. See Williams v. Lee, \n358 \nU.S. 217\n.

The sentences aroused widespread public protests.\n\n\n\"At the second trial, held recently, Shanshkin was sentenced to die. The other three, all under 20 years of age, were ordered to serve prison terms ranging from ten to twenty years.\"\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BRENNAN, whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS join, dissenting.\n\n\nBartkus was tried and acquitted in a Federal District Court of robbing a federally insured savings and loan association in Cicero, Illinois. He was indicted for the same robbery by the State of Illinois less than three weeks later, and subsequently convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. The single issue in dispute at both trials was whether Bartkus was the third participant in the robbery along with two self-confessed perpetrators of the crime.\n\n\nThe Government's case against Bartkus on the federal trial rested primarily upon the testimony of two of the robbers, Joseph Cosentino and James Brindis, who confessed \n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 165]\n\u00a0\n their part in the crime and testified that Bartkus was their confederate. The defense was that Bartkus was getting a haircut in a barber shop several miles away at the time the robbery was committed. The owner of the barber shop, his son and other witnesses placed Bartkus in the shop at the time. The federal jury in acquitting Bartkus apparently believed the alibi witnesses and not Cosentino and Brindis.\n\n\nThe federal authorities were highly displeased with the jury's resolution of the conflicting testimony, and the trial judge sharply upbraided the jury for its verdict. See some of his remarks printed in United States v. Vasen, 222 F.2d 3, 9-10 (dissenting opinion). The federal authorities obviously decided immediately after the trial to make a second try at convicting Bartkus, and since the federal courthouse was barred to them by the Fifth Amendment, they turned to a state prosecution for that purpose. It is clear that federal officers solicited the state indictment, arranged to assure the attendance of key witnesses, unearthed additional evidence to discredit Bartkus and one of his alibi witnesses, and in general prepared and guided the state prosecution. Thus the State's Attorney stated at the state trial: \"I am particularly glad to see a case where the federal authorities came to see the state's attorney.\" And Illinois conceded with commendable candor on the oral argument in this Court \"that the federal officers did instigate and guide this state prosecution\" and \"actually prepared this case.\" Indeed, the State argued the case on the basis that the record showed as a matter of \"fair inference\" that the case was one in which \"federal officers bring to the attention of the state prosecuting authority the commission of an act and furnish and provide him with evidence of defendant's guilt.\"\n\n\nI think that the record before us shows that the extent of participation of the federal authorities here constituted this state prosecution actually a second federal \n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 166]\n\u00a0\n prosecution of Bartkus. The federal jury acquitted Bartkus late in December 1953. Early in January 1954 the Assistant United States Attorney who prosecuted the federal case summoned Cosentino to his office. Present also were the FBI agent who had investigated the robbery and the Assistant State's Attorney for Cook County who later prosecuted the state case. The Assistant State's Attorney said to Cosentino, \"Look, we are going to get an indictment in the state court against Bartkus, will you testify against him?\" Cosentino agreed that he would. Later Brindis also agreed to testify. Although they pleaded guilty to the federal robbery charge in August 1953, the Federal District Court postponed their sentencing until after they testified against Bartkus at the state trial, which was not held until April 1954. The record does not disclose what sentences were imposed after they testified at the state trial or whether sentences have yet been imposed. Both Cosentino and Brindis were also released on bail pending the state trial, Brindis on his own recognizance.\n\n\nIn January, also, an FBI agent who had been active in the federal prosecution purposefully set about strengthening the proofs which had not sufficed to convict Bartkus on the federal trial. And he frankly admitted that he \"was securing it [information] for the federal government,\" although what he gathered had \"gone to the state authorities.\" These January efforts of the agent were singularly successful and may well have tipped the scales in favor of conviction. He uncovered a new witness against Bartkus, one Grant Pursel, who had been enlarged on bail pending his sentencing on his plea of guilty to an indictment for violation of the Mann Act. Pursel testified that \"about two weeks after the federal trial, in the first part of January,\" the FBI agent sought him out to discuss an alleged conversation between Pursel and Bartkus \n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 167]\n\u00a0\n during September 1953 when both were in jail awaiting their respective federal trials. Pursel's testimony at the state trial, that Bartkus had told him he participated in the robbery, was obviously very damaging. Yet, indicative of the attitude of the federal officials that this was actually a federal prosecution, the FBI agent arranged no interview between Pursel and any state authority. The first time that Pursel had any contact whatsoever with a state official connected with the case was the morning that he testified. And as in the case of Cosentino and Brindis, Pursel's sentencing was postponed until after he testified against Bartkus at the state trial. Here too the record does not disclose what sentence was imposed or whether any has yet been imposed.\n\n\nAlso within a month after the federal acquittal the FBI agent sought out the operator of the barber shop who had placed Bartkus in his shop at the time of the robbery. The barber testified at both federal and state trials that Bartkus entered his shop before 4 o'clock, about which time the robbery was committed. The agent testified as a rebuttal witness for the State that the barber had told him in January that it might have been after 4:30 o'clock when Bartkus entered the shop. And the significance of the federal participation in this prosecution is further evidenced by the Assistant State's Attorney's motion at the beginning of the trial, which was granted over defense objection, to permit the FBI agent to remain in the courtroom throughout the trial although other witnesses were excluded.\n\n\nThe Court, although not finding such to be the case here, apparently acknowledges that under certain circumstances it would be necessary to set aside a state conviction brought about by federal authorities to avoid the prohibition of the Fifth Amendment against a second federal prosecution. Our task is to determine how much \n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 168]\n\u00a0\n the federal authorities must participate in a state prosecution before it so infects the conviction that we must set it aside. The test, I submit, must be fashioned to secure the fundamental protection of the Fifth Amendment \"that the . . . [Federal Government] with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense, and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity . . . .\" Green v. United States, \n355 \nU.S. 184, 187\n. Under any test based upon these principles, this conviction cannot stand. In allowing the use of federal resources to bring about this second try at Bartkus, the Court denies Bartkus the protection which the Fifth Amendment assures him. Given the fact that there must always be state officials involved in a state prosecution, I cannot see how there can be more complete federal participation in a state prosecution than there was in this case. I see no escape from the conclusion that this particular state trial was in actuality a second federal prosecution - a second federal try at Bartkus in the guise of a state prosecution. If this state conviction is not overturned, then, as a practical matter, there will be no restraints on the use of state machinery by federal officers to bring what is in effect a second federal prosecution.\n\n\nTo set aside this state conviction because infected with constitutional violations by federal officers implies no condemnation of the state processes as such. The conviction is set aside not because of any infirmities resulting from fault of the State but because it is the product of unconstitutional federal action. I cannot grasp the merit of an argument that protection against federal oppression in the circumstances shown by this record would do violence to the principles of federalism. Of course, cooperation \n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 169]\n\u00a0\n between federal and state authorities in criminal law enforcement is to be desired and encouraged, for cooperative federalism in this field can indeed profit the Nation and the States in improving methods for carrying out the endless fight against crime. But the normal and healthy situation consists of state and federal officers cooperating to apprehend lawbreakers and present the strongest case against them at a single trial, be it state or federal. Cooperation in order to permit the Federal Government to harass the accused so as to deny him his protection under the Fifth Amendment is not to be tolerated as a legitimate requirement of federalism. The lesson of the history which wrought the Fifth Amendment's protection has taught us little if that shield may be shattered by reliance upon the requirements of federalism and state sovereignty to sustain this transparent attempt of the Federal Government to have two tries at convicting Bartkus for the same alleged crime. What happened here was simply that the federal effort which failed in the federal courthouse was renewed a second time in the state courthouse across the street. Not content with the federal jury's resolution of conflicting testimony in Bartkus' favor, the federal officers engineered this second prosecution and on the second try obtained the desired conviction. It is exactly this kind of successive prosecution by federal officers that the Fifth Amendment was intended to prohibit. This Court has declared principles in clearly analogous situations which I think should control here. In Rea v. United States, \n350 \nU.S. 214\n, the Court held that an injunction should issue against a federal agent's transference of illegally obtained evidence to state authorities for use as the basis of a state charge. If the federal courts have power to defeat a state prosecution by force of their supervision of federal officers, surely the federal courts have power to defeat a state \n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 170]\n\u00a0\n prosecution transparently employed by federal authorities in violation of the Fifth Amendment. In Knapp v. Schweitzer, \n357 \nU.S. 371, 380\n, we declared: \"Of course the Federal Government may not take advantage of . . . the States' autonomy in order to evade the Bill of Rights.\" See also Feldman v. United States, \n322 \nU.S. 487, 494\n; cf. Byars v. United States, \n273 \nU.S. 28\n. These principles require, I think, that we set aside this state conviction. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 121, 171]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","12":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBASS v.

Petitioner filed a counterclaim raising the issues which would have been raised in the antitrust suit for treble damages and demanded a jury trial. Purporting to act in the exercise of its discretion under Rules 42 (b) and 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the District Court ruled that it would try in equity without a jury the issues common to both proceedings before trying petitioner's counterclaim. The Court of Appeals held that the District Court had acted within the proper scope of its discretion, and it denied petitioner's application for a writ of mandamus requiring the District Court to set aside its ruling. Held: The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed. Pp. 501-511.\n\n 1.

JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner, Beacon Theatres, Inc., sought by mandamus to require a district judge in the Southern District of California to vacate certain orders alleged to deprive it of a jury trial of issues arising in a suit brought against it by Fox West Coast Theatres, Inc. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit refused the writ, holding that the trial judge had acted within his proper discretion in denying petitioner's request for a jury. 252 F.2d 864. We granted certiorari, \n356 \nU.S. 956\n, because \"Maintenance of the jury as a fact-finding body is of such importance and occupies so firm a place in our history and jurisprudence that any seeming curtailment of the right to a jury trial should be scrutinized with the utmost care.\" Dimick v. Schiedt, \n293 \nU.S. 474, 486\n. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 500, 502]\n\u00a0\n\n\nFox had asked for declaratory relief against Beacon alleging a controversy arising under the Sherman Antitrust Act, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 1, 2, and under the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731, 15 U.S.C. 15, which authorizes suits for treble damages against Sherman Act violators. According to the complaint Fox operates a movie theatre in San Bernardino, California, and has long been exhibiting films under contracts with movie distributors. These contracts grant it the exclusive right to show \"first run\" pictures in the \"San Bernardino competitive area\" and provide for \"clearance\" - a period of time during which no other theatre can exhibit the same pictures. After building a drive-in theatre about 11 miles from San Bernardino, Beacon notified Fox that it considered contracts barring simultaneous exhibitions of first-run films in the two theatres to be overt acts in violation of the antitrust laws.\n1\n Fox's complaint alleged that this notification, together with threats of treble damage suits against Fox and its distributors, gave rise to \"duress and coercion\" which deprived Fox of a valuable property right, the right to negotiate for exclusive first-run contracts. Unless Beacon was restrained, the complaint continued, irreparable harm would result. Accordingly, while its pleading was styled a \"Complaint for Declaratory Relief,\" Fox prayed both for a declaration that a grant of clearance between the Fox and Beacon theatres is reasonable and \n\n[359 \nU.S. 500, 503]\n\u00a0\n not in violation of the antitrust laws, and for an injunction, pending final resolution of the litigation, to prevent Beacon from instituting any action under the antitrust laws against Fox and its distributors arising out of the controversy alleged in the complaint.\n2\n Beacon filed an answer, a counterclaim against Fox, and a cross-claim against an exhibitor who had intervened. These denied the threats and asserted that there was no substantial competition between the two theatres, that the clearances granted were therefore unreasonable, and that a conspiracy existed between Fox and its distributors to manipulate contracts and clearances so as to restrain trade and monopolize first-run pictures in violation of the antitrust laws. Treble damages were asked.\n\nBeacon demanded a jury trial of the factual issues in the case as provided by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 38 (b). The District Court, however, viewed the issues raised by the \"Complaint for Declaratory Relief,\" including the question of competition between the two theatres, as essentially equitable. Acting under the purported authority of Rules 42 (b) and 57, it directed that these issues be tried to the court before jury determination of the validity of the charges of antitrust violations made in the counterclaim and cross-claim.\n3\n A common issue of the \"Complaint for Declaratory Relief,\" the counterclaim, and the cross-claim was the reasonableness of the clearances granted to Fox, which depended, in part, on the \n\n[359 \nU.S. 500, 504]\n\u00a0\n existence of competition between the two theatres. Thus the effect of the action of the District Court could be, as the Court of Appeals believed, \"to limit the petitioner's opportunity fully to try to a jury every issue which has a bearing upon its treble damage suit,\" for determination of the issue of clearances by the judge might \"operate either by way of res judicata or collateral estoppel so as to conclude both parties with respect thereto at the subsequent trial of the treble damage claim.\" 252 F.2d ___, at 874.\n\nThe District Court's finding that the Complaint for Declaratory Relief presented basically equitable issues draws no support from the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. 2201, 2202; Fed. Rules Civ. Proc., 57. See also 48 Stat. 955, 28 U.S.C. (1940 ed.) 400. That statute, while allowing prospective defendants to sue to establish their nonliability, specifically preserves the right to jury trial for both parties.\n4\n It follows that if Beacon would have been entitled to a jury trial in a treble damage suit against Fox it cannot be deprived of that right merely because Fox took advantage of the availability of declaratory relief to sue Beacon first. Since the right to trial by jury applies to treble damage suits under the antitrust laws, and is, in fact, an essential part of the congressional plan for making competition rather than monopoly the rule of trade, see Fleitmann v. Welsbach Street Lighting Co., \n240 \nU.S. 27, 29\n, the Sherman and Clayton Act issues on which Fox sought a declaration were essentially jury questions.\n\nNevertheless the Court of Appeals refused to upset the order of the district judge. It held that the question of whether a right to jury trial existed was to be judged \n\n[359 \nU.S. 500, 505]\n\u00a0\n by Fox's complaint read as a whole. In addition to seeking a declaratory judgment, the court said, Fox's complaint can be read as making out a valid plea for injunctive relief, thus stating a claim traditionally cognizable in equity. A party who is entitled to maintain a suit in equity for an injunction, said the court, may have all the issues in his suit determined by the judge without a jury regardless of whether legal rights are involved. The court then rejected the argument that equitable relief, traditionally available only when legal remedies are inadequate, was rendered unnecessary in this case by the filing of the counterclaim and cross-claim which presented all the issues necessary to a determination of the right to injunctive relief. Relying on American Life Ins. Co. v. Stewart, \n300 \nU.S. 203, 215\n, decided before the enactment of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, it invoked the principle that a court sitting in equity could retain jurisdiction even though later a legal remedy became available. In such instances the equity court had discretion to enjoin the later lawsuit in order to allow the whole dispute to be determined in one case in one court.\n5\n Reasoning by analogy, the Court of Appeals held it was not an abuse of discretion for the district judge, acting under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 42 (b), to try the equitable cause first even though this might, through collateral estoppel, prevent a full jury trial of the counterclaim and cross-claim which were as effectively stopped as by an equity injunction.\n6\n\u00a0\n\n[359 \nU.S. 500, 506]\n\u00a0\n\n\nBeacon takes issue with the holding of the Court of Appeals that the complaint stated a claim upon which equitable relief could be granted. As initially filed the complaint alleged that threats of lawsuits by petitioner against Fox and its distributors were causing irreparable harm to Fox's business relationships. The prayer for relief, however, made no mention of the threats but asked only that pending litigation of the claim for declaratory judgment, Beacon be enjoined from beginning any lawsuits under the antitrust laws against Fox and its distributors arising out of the controversy alleged in the complaint. Evidently of the opinion that this prayer did not state a good claim for equitable relief, the Court of Appeals construed it to include a request for an injunction against threats of lawsuits. This liberal construction of a pleading is in line with Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Conley v. Gibson, \n355 \nU.S. 41, 47\n-48. But this fact does not solve our problem. Assuming that the pleadings can be construed to support such a request and assuming additionally that the complaint can be read as alleging the kind of harassment by a multiplicity of lawsuits which would traditionally have justified equity to take jurisdiction and settle the case in one suit,\n7\n we are nevertheless of the opinion that, under the Declaratory Judgment Act and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, neither claim can justify denying Beacon a trial by jury of all the issues in the antitrust controversy.\n\nThe basis of injunctive relief in the federal courts has always been irreparable harm and inadequacy of legal \n\n[359 \nU.S. 500, 507]\n\u00a0\n remedies.\n8\n At least as much is required to justify a trial court in using its discretion under the Federal Rules to allow claims of equitable origins to be tried ahead of legal ones, since this has the same effect as an equitable injunction of the legal claims. And it is immaterial, in judging if that discretion is properly employed, that before the Federal Rules and the Declaratory Judgment Act were passed, courts of equity, exercising a jurisdiction separate from courts of law, were, in some cases, allowed to enjoin subsequent legal actions between the same parties involving the same controversy. This was because the subsequent legal action, though providing an opportunity to try the case to a jury, might not protect the right of the equity plaintiff to a fair and orderly adjudication of the controversy. See, e. g., New York Life Ins. Co. v. Seymour, 45 F.2d 47. Under such circumstances the legal remedy could quite naturally be deemed inadequate. Inadequacy of remedy and irreparable harm are practical terms, however. As such their existence today must be determined, not by precedents decided under discarded procedures, but in the light of the remedies now made available by the Declaratory Judgment Act and the Federal Rules.\n9\n\u00a0\n\n[359 \nU.S. 500, 508]\n\u00a0\n\n\nViewed in this manner, the use of discretion by the trial court under Rule 42 (b) to deprive Beacon of a full jury trial on its counterclaim and cross-claim, as well as on Fox's plea for declaratory relief, cannot be justified. Under the Federal Rules the same court may try both legal and equitable causes in the same action. Fed. Rules Civ. Proc., 1, 2, 18. Thus any defenses, equitable or legal, Fox may have to charges of antitrust violations can be raised either in its suit for declaratory relief or in answer to Beacon's counterclaim. On proper showing, harassment by threats of other suits, or other suits actually brought, involving the issues being tried in this case, could be temporarily enjoined pending the outcome of this litigation. Whatever permanent injunctive relief Fox might be entitled to on the basis of the decision in this case could, of course, be given by the court after the jury renders its verdict. In this way the issues between these parties could be settled in one suit giving Beacon a full jury trial of every antitrust issue. Cf. Ring v. Spina, 166 F.2d 546. By contrast, the holding of the court below while granting Fox no additional protection unless the avoidance of jury trial be considered as such, would compel Beacon to split his antitrust case, trying part to a judge and part to a jury.\n10\n Such a result, which involves the postponement and subordination of Fox's own legal claim for declaratory relief as well as of the counterclaim which Beacon was compelled by the Federal Rules to bring,\n11\n is not permissible.\n\nOur decision is consistent with the plan of the Federal Rules and the Declaratory Judgment Act to effect \n\n[359 \nU.S. 500, 509]\n\u00a0\n substantial procedural reform while retaining a distinction between jury and nonjury issues and leaving substantive rights unchanged.\n12\n Since in the federal courts equity has always acted only when legal remedies were inadequate,\n13\n the expansion of adequate legal remedies provided by the Declaratory Judgment Act and the Federal Rules necessarily affects the scope of equity. Thus, the justification for equity's deciding legal issues once it obtains jurisdiction, and refusing to dismiss a case, merely because subsequently a legal remedy becomes available, must be re-evaluated in the light of the liberal joinder provisions of the Federal Rules which allow legal and equitable causes to be brought and resolved in one civil action.\n14\n Similarly the need for, and therefore, the availability of such equitable remedies as Bills of Peace, Quia Timet and Injunction must be reconsidered in view of the existence of the Declaratory Judgment Act as well as the liberal joinder provision of the Rules.\n15\n This is not only in accord with the spirit of the Rules and the Act \n\n[359 \nU.S. 500, 510]\n\u00a0\n but is required by the provision in the Rules that \"[t]he right to trial by jury as declared by the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution or as given by a statute of the United States shall be preserved . . . inviolate.\"\n16\n\u00a0\n\nIf there should be cases where the availability of declaratory judgment or joinder in one suit of legal and equitable causes would not in all respects protect the plaintiff seeking equitable relief from irreparable harm while affording a jury trial in the legal cause, the trial court will necessarily have to use its discretion in deciding whether the legal or equitable cause should be tried first. Since the right to jury trial is a constitutional one, however while no similar requirement protects trials by the court,\n17\n that discretion is very narrowly limited and must, wherever possible, be exercised to preserve jury trial. As this Court said in Scott v. Neely, \n140 \nU.S. 106, 109\n-110: \"In the Federal courts this [jury] right cannot be dispensed with, except by the assent of the parties entitled to it, nor can it be impaired by any blending with a claim, properly cognizable at law, of a demand for equitable relief in aid of the legal action or during its pendency.\"\n18\n This longstanding principle of equity dictates that only under the \n\n[359 \nU.S. 500, 511]\n\u00a0\n most imperative circumstances, circumstances which in view of the flexible procedures of the Federal Rules we cannot now anticipate,\n19\n can the right to a jury trial of legal issues be lost through prior determination of equitable claims. See Leimer v. Woods, 196 F.2d 828, 833-836. As we have shown, this is far from being such a case.\n\nRespondent claims mandamus is not available under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. 1651. Whatever differences of opinion there may be in other types of cases, we think the right to grant mandamus to require jury trial where it has been improperly denied is settled.\n20\n\u00a0\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Beacon allegedly stated that the clearances granted violated both the antitrust laws and the decrees issued in United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 66 F. Supp. 323, 70 F. Supp. 53, affirmed in part and reversed in part, \n334 \nU.S. 131\n, subsequent proceedings in the District Court, 85 F. Supp. 881. The decrees in that case set limits on what clearances could be given when theatres were in competition with each other and held that there should be no clearances between theatres not in substantial competition. Neither Beacon nor Fox, however, appears to have been a party to those decrees. Their relevance, therefore, seems to be only that of significant precedents.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Other prayers aside from the general equitable plea for \"such further relief as the court deems proper\" added nothing material to those set out.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Fed. Rules Civ. Proc., 42 (b) reads: \"The court in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice may order a separate trial of any claim, cross-claim, counterclaim, or third-party claim, or of any separate issue or of any number of claims, cross-claims, counter-claims, third-party claims, or issues.\" Rule 57 reads in part: \"The court may order a speedy hearing of an action for a declaratory judgment and may advance it on the calendar.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See, e. g., (American) Lumbermens Mut.

JUSTICE WHITTAKER concur, dissenting.\n\nThere can be no doubt that a litigant is entitled to a writ of mandamus to protect a clear constitutional or statutory right to a jury trial. But there was no denial of such a right here. The district judge simply exercised his inherent discretion, now explicitly confirmed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to schedule the trial of an equitable claim in advance of an action at law. Even an abuse of such discretion could not, I think, be attacked \n\n[359 \nU.S. 500, 512]\n\u00a0\n by the extraordinary writ of mandamus.\n1\n In any event no abuse of discretion is apparent in this case.\n\nThe complaint filed by Fox stated a claim traditionally cognizable in equity. That claim, in brief, was that Beacon had wrongfully interfered with the right of Fox to compete freely with Beacon and other distributors for the licensing of films for first-run exhibition in the San Bernardino area. The complaint alleged that the plaintiff was without an adequate remedy at law and would be irreparably harmed unless the defendant were restrained from continuing to interfere - by coercion and threats of litigation - with the plaintiff's lawful business relationships.\n\nThe Court of Appeals found that the complaint, although inartistically drawn, contained allegations entitling the petitioner to equitable relief.\n2\n That finding is accepted in the prevailing opinion today. If the complaint had been answered simply by a general denial, therefore, the issues would under traditional principles have been triable as a proceeding in equity. Instead of just putting in issue the allegations of the complaint, however, Beacon filed pleadings which affirmatively alleged the existence of a broad conspiracy among the plaintiff and other theatre owners to monopolize the first-run exhibition of films in the San Bernardino area, to refrain from competing among themselves, and to discriminate against Beacon in granting film licenses. Based upon these allegations, Beacon asked damages in the amount of $300,000. Clearly these conspiracy allegations stated a cause of action triable as of right by a \n\n[359 \nU.S. 500, 513]\n\u00a0\n jury. What was demanded by Beacon, however, was a jury trial not only of this cause of action, but also of the issues presented by the original complaint.\n\nUpon motion of Fox the trial judge ordered the original action for declaratory and equitable relief to be tried separately to the court and in advance of the trial of the defendant's counterclaim and cross-claim for damages. The court's order, which carefully preserved the right to trial by jury upon the conspiracy and damage issues raised by the counterclaim and cross-claim, was in conformity with the specific provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n3\n Yet it is decided today that the Court of Appeals must compel the district judge to rescind it.\n\nAssuming the existence of a factual issue common both to the plaintiff's original action and the defendant's counterclaim for damages, I cannot agree that the District Court must be compelled to try the counterclaim first.\n4\n\u00a0\n\n[359 \nU.S. 500, 514]\n\u00a0\n It is, of course, a matter of no great moment in what order the issues between the parties in the present litigation are tried. What is disturbing is the process by which the Court arrives at its decision - a process which appears to disregard the historic relationship between equity and law.\n\n\nI.\n\n\nThe Court suggests that \"the expansion of adequate legal remedies provided by the Declaratory Judgment Act . . . necessarily affects the scope of equity.\" Does the Court mean to say that the mere availability of an action for a declaratory judgment operates to furnish \"an adequate remedy at law\" so as to deprive a court of equity of the power to act? That novel line of reasoning is at least implied in the Court's opinion. But the Declaratory Judgment Act did not \"expand\" the substantive law. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 500, 515]\n\u00a0\n That Act merely provided a new statutory remedy, neither legal nor equitable, but available in the areas of both equity and law. When declaratory relief is sought, the right to trial by jury depends upon the basic context in which the issues are presented. See Moore's Federal Practice (2d ed.) 38.29, 57.30; Borchard, Declaratory Judgments (2d ed.), 399-404. If the basic issues in an action for declaratory relief are of a kind traditionally cognizable in equity, e. g., a suit for cancellation of a written instrument, the declaratory judgment is not a \"remedy at law.\"\n5\n If, on the other hand, the issues arise in a context traditionally cognizable at common law, the right to a jury trial of course remains unimpaired, even though the only relief demanded is a declaratory judgment.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nThus, if in this case the complaint had asked merely for a judgment declaring that the plaintiff's specified manner of business dealings with distributors and other exhibitors did not render it liable to Beacon under the antitrust laws, this would have been simply a \"juxtaposition of parties\" case in which Beacon could have demanded a jury trial.\n7\n But the complaint in the present case, as the Court recognizes, presented issues of exclusively equitable cognizance, going well beyond a mere defense to any subsequent action at law. Fox sought from the court protection against Beacon's allegedly unlawful interference with its business relationships - protection which this \n\n[359 \nU.S. 500, 516]\n\u00a0\n Court seems to recognize might not have been afforded by a declaratory judgment, unsupplemented by equitable relief. The availability of a declaratory judgment did not, therefore, operate to confer upon Beacon the right to trial by jury with respect to the issues raised by the complaint.\n\n\nII.\n\n\nThe Court's opinion does not, of course, hold or even suggest that a court of equity may never determine \"legal rights.\" For indeed it is precisely such rights which the Chancellor, when his jurisdiction has been properly invoked, has often been called upon to decide. Issues of fact are rarely either \"legal\" or \"equitable.\" All depends upon the context in which they arise. The examples cited by Chief Judge Pope in his thorough opinion in the Court of Appeals in this case are illustrative: \". . . [I]n a suit by one in possession of real property to quiet title, or to remove a cloud on title, the court of equity may determine the legal title. In a suit for specific performance of a contract, the court may determine the making, validity and the terms of the contract involved. In a suit for an injunction against trespass to real property the court may determine the legal right of the plaintiff to the possession of that property. Cf. Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence, 5th ed., 138-221, 221a, 221b, 221d, 250.\" 252 F.2d 864, 874.\n\nThough apparently not disputing these principles, the Court holds, quite apart from its reliance upon the Declaratory Judgment Act, that Beacon by filing its counterclaim and cross-claim acquired a right to trial by jury of issues which otherwise would have been properly triable to the court. Support for this position is found in the principle that, \"in the federal courts equity has always acted only when legal remedies were inadequate. . . .\" Yet that principle is not employed in its traditional sense as a limitation upon the exercise of power by a court of \n\n[359 \nU.S. 500, 517]\n\u00a0\n equity. This is apparent in the Court's recognition that the allegations of the complaint entitled Fox to equitable relief - relief to which Fox would not have been entitled if it had had an adequate remedy at law. Instead, the principle is employed today to mean that because it is possible under the counterclaim to have a jury trial of the factual issue of substantial competition, that issue must be tried by a jury, even though the issue was primarily presented in the original claim for equitable relief. This is a marked departure from long-settled principles.\n\nIt has been an established rule \"that equitable jurisdiction existing at the filing of a bill is not destroyed because an adequate legal remedy may have become available thereafter.\"\n8\n American Life Ins. Co. v. Stewart, \n300 \nU.S. 203, 215\n. See Dawson v. Kentucky Distilleries Co., \n255 \nU.S. 288, 296\n. It has also been long settled that the District Court in its discretion may order the trial of a suit in equity in advance of an action at law between the same parties, even if there is a factual issue common to both. In the words of Mr. Justice Cardozo, writing for a unanimous Court in American Life Ins. Co. v. Stewart, supra:\n\n\"A court has control over its own docket. . . . In the exercise of a sound discretion it may hold one lawsuit in abeyance to abide the outcome of another, especially where the parties and the issues are the same. . . . If request had been made by the respondents to suspend the suits in equity till the other causes were disposed of, the District Court could have considered whether justice would not be \n\n[359 \nU.S. 500, 518]\n\u00a0\n done by pursuing such a course, the remedy in equity being exceptional and the outcome of necessity. . . . There would be many circumstances to be weighed, as, for instance, the condition of the court calendar, whether the insurer had been precipitate or its adversaries dilatory, as well as other factors. In the end, benefit and hardship would have to be set off, the one against the other, and a balance ascertained.\" \n300 \nU.S. 203, 215\n-216.\n9\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nThe Court today sweeps away these basic principles as \"precedents decided under discarded procedures.\" It suggests that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure have somehow worked an \"expansion of adequate legal remedies\" so as to oust the District Courts of equitable jurisdiction, as well as to deprive them of their traditional power to control their own dockets. But obviously the Federal Rules could not and did not \"expand\" the substantive law one whit.\n10\n\u00a0\n\nLike the Declaratory Judgment Act, the Federal Rules preserve inviolate the right to trial by jury in actions historically cognizable at common law, as under the Constitution they must.\n11\n They do not create a right of trial \n\n[359 \nU.S. 500, 519]\n\u00a0\n by jury where that right \"does not exist under the Constitution or statutes of the United States.\" Rule 39 (a). Since Beacon's counterclaim was compulsory under the Rules, see Rule 13 (a), it is apparent that by filing it Beacon could not be held to have waived its jury rights.\n12\n Compare American Mills Co. v. American Surety Co., \n260 \nU.S. 360\n. But neither can the counterclaim be held to have transformed Fox's original complaint into an action at law.\n13\n See Bendix Aviation Corp. v. Glass, 81 F. Supp. 645.\n\nThe Rules make possible the trial of legal and equitable claims in the same proceeding, but they expressly affirm the power of a trial judge to determine the order in which claims shall be heard. Rule 42 (b). Certainly the Federal Rules were not intended to undermine the basic structure of equity jurisprudence, developed over the centuries and explicitly recognized in the United States Constitution.\n14\n\u00a0\n\nFor these reasons I think the petition for a writ of mandamus should have been dismissed.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Compare Black v. Boyd, 248 F.2d 156, with Black v. Boyd, 251 F.2d 843.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Cf. De Groot v. Peters, 124 Cal. 406; California G. C. Bd. v. California P. Corp., 4 Cal. App. 2d 242, 244, 40 P.2d 846. Compare Kessler v. Eldred, \n206 \nU.S. 285\n; International News Serv. v. Associated Press, \n248 \nU.S. 215, 236\n; Truax v. Raich, \n239 \nU.S. 33, 38\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Rule 42 (b) provides: \"(b) Separate Trials. The court in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice may order a separate trial of any claim, cross-claim, counterclaim, or third-party claim, or of any separate issue or of any number of claims, cross-claims, counterclaims, third-party claims, or issues.\"\n\nThe Note to Rule 39 of the Advisory Committee on Rules states that, \"When certain of the issues are to be tried by jury and others by the court, the court may determine the sequence in which such issues shall be tried.\" This language was at one time contained in a draft of the Rules, but was deleted because \"the power is adequately given by Rule 42 (b). . . .\" Moore's Federal Practice (2d ed.) 39.12, n. 8.\n\nSee also Rule 57, which provides, inter alia, that, \"The court may order a speedy hearing of an action for a declaratory judgment and may advance it on the calendar.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] It is not altogether clear at this stage of the proceedings whether the existence of substantial competition between Fox and Beacon is actually a material issue of fact common to both the equitable claim and the counterclaim for damages. The respondent ingeniously argues that determination in the equitable suit of the issue \n\n[359 \nU.S. 500, 514]\n\u00a0\n of competition between the theatres would be determinative of little or nothing in the counterclaim for damages. \"The fact issue in the action for equitable and declaratory relief is whether the Fox West Coast California Theatre and the Petitioner's drive-in are substantially competitive with each other. The fact issue in the counterclaim is whether the cross-defendants and co-conspirators therein named conspired together in restraint of trade and to monopolize in the manner alleged in the counterclaim. Absent conspiracy, whether or not the distributors licensed a single first run picture to Petitioner's drive-in, be it in substantial competition or not in substantial competition with other first run theatres in the San Bernardino area, Petitioner will not have made out a case on its counterclaim. . . . If Petitioner on its counterclaim should fail to prove conspiracy the issue of competition between the theatres is meaningless. If Petitioner on the other hand succeeds in proving the allegations of its counterclaim, the conspiracy to monopolize first run and to discriminate against the new drive-in, the existence or non-existence of competition between the theatres would exculpate none of the alleged wrongdoers, although if there was an absence of competition between the drive-in and the other first run theatres, as Petitioner contended in its answer to the complaint, it might have some difficulty proving injury to its business.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] State Farm Mut.

I, 8 of the Constitution. Pp. 521-530.\n\n (a) Even state safety regulations must yield when they run afoul of the policy of free trade reflected in the Commerce Clause. Pp. 523-524, 528-529.\n\n\n (b) Interchanging mudguards on trucks and trailers at the border of Illinois is a time-consuming task; and the necessity to use welding might mean that some trucks or trailers would have to be unloaded and loaded again - all of which adds up to a serious burden on interstate commerce not justified by a compelling need for this new safety measure. Pp. 527-528.\n\n\n (c) The record in this case shows that this is one of those exceptional cases where a state safety regulation in the exercise of the police power places such a heavy burden on interstate commerce, uncompensated by compelling advantages of safety, that it violates the Commerce Clause. Pp. 529-530.\n\n\n 159 F. Supp. 385, affirmed.\n\nWilliam C. Wines, Assistant Attorney General of Illinois, argued the cause for appellants.

Zola Groves, Assistant Attorneys General.\n\nDavid Axelrod argued the cause for appellees. With him on the brief were Jack Goodman and Carl L. Steiner.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nWe are asked in this case to hold that an Illinois statute\n1\n requiring the use of a certain type of rear fender \n\n[359 \nU.S. 520, 522]\n\u00a0\n mudguard on trucks and trailers operated on the highways of that State conflicts with the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. The statutory specification for this type of mudguard provides that the guard shall contour the rear wheel, with the inside surface being relatively parallel to the top 90 degrees of the rear 180 degrees of the whole surface.\n2\n The surface of the guard must extend downward to within 10 inches from the ground when the truck is loaded to its maximum legal capacity. The guards must be wide enough to cover the width of the protected tire, must be installed not more than 6 inches from the tire surface when the vehicle is loaded \n\n[359 \nU.S. 520, 523]\n\u00a0\n to maximum capacity, and must have a lip or flange on its outer edge of not less than 2 inches.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nAppellees, interstate motor carriers holding certificates from the Interstate Commerce Commission, challenged the constitutionality of the Illinois Act. A specially constituted three-judge District Court concluded that it unduly and unreasonably burdened and obstructed interstate commerce, because it made the conventional or straight mudflap, which is legal in at least 45 States, illegal in Illinois, and because the statute, taken together with a Rule of the Arkansas Commerce Commission\n4\n requiring straight mudflaps, rendered the use of the same motor vehicle equipment in both States impossible. The statute was declared to be violative of the Commerce Clause and appellants were enjoined from enforcing it. 159 F. Supp. 385. An appeal was taken and we noted probable jurisdiction. \n358 \nU.S. 808\n.\n\nThe power of the State to regulate the use of its highways is broad and pervasive. We have recognized the peculiarly local nature of this subject of safety, and have upheld state statutes applicable alike to interstate and intrastate commerce, despite the fact that they may have an impact on interstate commerce. South Carolina Highway Dept. v. Barnwell Bros., \n303 \nU.S. 177\n; Maurer v. Hamilton, \n309 \nU.S. 598\n; Sproles v. Binford, \n286 \nU.S. 374\n. The regulation of highways \"is akin to quarantine \n\n[359 \nU.S. 520, 524]\n\u00a0\n measures, game laws, and like local regulations of rivers, harbors, piers, and docks, with respect to which the state has exceptional scope for the exercise of its regulatory power, and which, Congress not acting, have been sustained even though they materially interfere with interstate commerce.\" Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona, \n325 \nU.S. 761, 783\n.\n\nThese safety measures carry a strong presumption of validity when challenged in court. If there are alternative ways of solving a problem, we do not sit to determine which of them is best suited to achieve a valid state objective. Policy decisions are for the state legislature, absent federal entry into the field.\n5\n Unless we can conclude on the whole record that \"the total effect of the law as a safety measure in reducing accidents and casualties is so slight or problematical as not to outweigh the national interest in keeping interstate commerce free from interferences which seriously impede it\" (Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona, supra, pp. 775-776) we must uphold the statute.\n\nThe District Court found that \"since it is impossible for a carrier operating in interstate commerce to determine which of its equipment will be used in a particular area, or on a particular day, or days, carriers operating into or through Illinois . . . will be required to equip all their trailers in accordance with the requirements of the Illinois Splash Guard statute.\" With two possible exceptions \n\n[359 \nU.S. 520, 525]\n\u00a0\n the mudflaps required in those States which have mudguard regulations would not meet the standards required by the Illinois statute. The cost of installing the contour mudguards is $30 or more per vehicle. The District Court found that the initial cost of installing those mudguards on all the trucks owned by the appellees ranged from $4,500 to $45,840. There was also evidence in the record to indicate that the cost of maintenance and replacement of these guards is substantial.\n\nIllinois introduced evidence seeking to establish that contour mudguards had a decided safety factor in that they prevented the throwing of debris into the faces of drivers of passing cars and into the windshields of a following vehicle. But the District Court in its opinion stated that it was \"conclusively shown that the contour mud flap possesses no advantages over the conventional or straight mud flap previously required in Illinois and presently required in most of the states\" (159 F. Supp., at 388) and that \"there is rather convincing testimony that use of the contour flap creates hazards previously unknown to those using the highways.\" Id., at 390. These hazards were found to be occasioned by the fact that this new type of mudguard tended to cause an accumulation of heat in the brake drum, thus decreasing the effectiveness of brakes, and by the fact that they were susceptible of being hit and bumped when the trucks were backed up and of falling off on the highway.\n\nThese findings on cost and on safety are not the end of our problem. Local regulation of the weight of trucks using the highways upheld in Sproles v. Binford, supra, also involved increased financial burdens for interstate carriers. State control of the width and weight of motor trucks and trailers sustained in South Carolina Highway Dept. v. Barnwell Bros., supra, involved nice questions of judgment concerning the need of those regulations so far as the issue of safety was concerned. That case also presented \n\n[359 \nU.S. 520, 526]\n\u00a0\n the problem whether interstate motor carriers, who were required to replace all equipment or keep out of the State, suffered an unconstitutional restraint on interstate commerce. The matter of safety was said to be one essentially for the legislative judgment; and the burden of redesigning or replacing equipment was said to be a proper price to exact from interstate and intrastate motor carriers alike. And the same conclusion was reached in Maurer v. Hamilton, supra, where a state law prohibited any motor carrier from carrying any other vehicle above the cab of the carrier vehicle or over the head of the operator of that vehicle. Cost taken into consideration with other factors might be relevant in some cases to the issue of burden on commerce. But it has assumed no such proportions here. If we had here only a question whether the cost of adjusting an interstate operation to these new local safety regulations prescribed by Illinois unduly burdened interstate commerce, we would have to sustain the law under the authority of the Sproles, Barnwell, and Maurer cases. The same result would obtain if we had to resolve the much discussed issues of safety presented in this case.\n\nThis case presents a different issue. The equipment in the Sproles, Barnwell, and Maurer cases could pass muster in any State, so far as the records in those cases reveal. We were not faced there with the question whether one State could prescribe standards for interstate carriers that would conflict with the standards of another State, making it necessary, say, for an interstate carrier to shift its cargo to differently designed vehicles once another state line was reached. We had a related problem in Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona, supra, where the Court invalidated a statute of Arizona prescribing a maximum length of 70 cars for freight trains moving through that State. More closely in point is Morgan v. Virginia, \n328 \nU.S. 373\n, where a local law required a reseating of passengers on interstate \n\n[359 \nU.S. 520, 527]\n\u00a0\n busses entering Virginia in order to comply with a local segregation law. Diverse seating arrangements for people of different races imposed by several States interfered, we concluded, with \"the need for national uniformity in the regulations for interstate travel.\" Id., at 386. Those cases indicate the dimensions of our present problem.\n\nAn order of the Arkansas Commerce Commission, already mentioned,\n6\n requires that trailers operating in that State be equipped with straight or conventional mudflaps. Vehicles equipped to meet the standards of the Illinois statute would not comply with Arkansas standards, and vice versa. Thus if a trailer is to be operated in both States, mudguards would have to be interchanged, causing a significant delay in an operation where prompt movement may be of the essence. It was found that from two to four hours of labor are required to install or remove a contour mudguard. Moreover, the contour guard is attached to the trailer by welding and if the trailer is conveying a cargo of explosives (e. g., for the United States Government) it would be exceedingly dangerous to attempt to weld on a contour mudguard without unloading the trailer.\n\nIt was also found that the Illinois statute seriously interferes with the \"interline\" operations of motor carriers - that is to say, with the interchanging of trailers between an originating carrier and another carrier when the latter serves an area not served by the former. These \"interline\" operations provide a speedy through-service for the shipper. Interlining contemplates the physical transfer of the entire trailer; there is no unloading and reloading of the cargo. The interlining process is particularly vital in connection with shipment of perishables, which would spoil if unloaded before reaching their destination, or with the movement of explosives carried \n\n[359 \nU.S. 520, 528]\n\u00a0\n under seal. Of course, if the originating carrier never operated in Illinois, it would not be expected to equip its trailers with contour mudguards. Yet if an interchanged trailer of that carrier were hauled to or through Illinois, the statute would require that it contain contour guards. Since carriers which operate in and through Illinois cannot compel the originating carriers to equip their trailers with contour guards, they may be forced to cease interlining with those who do not meet the Illinois requirements. Over 60 percent of the business of 5 of the 6 plaintiffs is interline traffic. For the other it constitutes 30 percent. All of the plaintiffs operate extensively in interstate commerce, and the annual mileage in Illinois of none of them exceeds 7 percent of total mileage.\n\nThis in summary is the rather massive showing of burden on interstate commerce which appellees made at the hearing.\n\nAppellants did not attempt to rebut the appellees' showing that the statute in question severely burdens interstate commerce. Appellants' showing was aimed at establishing that contour mudguards prevented the throwing of debris into the faces of drivers of passing cars and into the windshields of a following vehicle. They concluded that, because the Illinois statute is a reasonable exercise of the police power, a federal court is precluded from weighing the relative merits of the contour mudguard against any other kind of mudguard and must sustain the validity of the statute notwithstanding the extent of the burden it imposes on interstate commerce. They rely in the main on South Carolina Highway Dept. v. Barnwell Bros., supra. There is language in that opinion which, read in isolation from such later decisions as Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona, supra, and Morgan v. Virginia, supra, would suggest that no showing of burden on interstate commerce is sufficient to invalidate local \n\n[359 \nU.S. 520, 529]\n\u00a0\n safety regulations in absence of some element of discrimination against interstate commerce.\n\nThe various exercises by the States of their police power stand, however, on an equal footing. All are entitled to the same presumption of validity when challenged under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Lincoln Union v. Northwestern Co., \n335 \nU.S. 525\n; Day-Brite Lighting, Inc., v. Missouri, \n342 \nU.S. 421\n; Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., \n348 \nU.S. 483\n. Similarly the various state regulatory statutes are of equal dignity when measured against the Commerce Clause. Local regulations which would pass muster under the Due Process Clause might nonetheless fail to survive other challenges to constitutionality that bring the Supremacy Clause into play. Like any local law that conflicts with federal regulatory measures (California Comm'n v. United States, \n355 \nU.S. 534\n; Service Storage & Transfer Co. v. Virginia, \n359 \nU.S. 171\n), state regulations that run afoul of the policy of free trade reflected in the Commerce Clause must also bow.\n\nThis is one of those cases - few in number - where local safety measures that are nondiscriminatory place an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. This conclusion is especially underlined by the deleterious effect which the Illinois law will have on the \"interline\" operation of interstate motor carriers. The conflict between the Arkansas regulation and the Illinois regulation also suggests that this regulation of mudguards is not one of those matters \"admitting of diversity of treatment, according to the special requirements of local conditions,\" to use the words of Chief Justice Hughes in Sproles v. Binford, supra, at 390. A State which insists on a design out of line with the requirements of almost all the other States may sometimes place a great burden of delay and inconvenience on those interstate motor carriers \n\n[359 \nU.S. 520, 530]\n\u00a0\n entering or crossing its territory. Such a new safety device - out of line with the requirements of the other States - may be so compelling that the innovating State need not be the one to give way. But the present showing - balanced against the clear burden on commerce - is far too inconclusive to make this mudguard meet that test.\n\nWe deal not with absolutes but with questions of degree. The state legislatures plainly have great leeway in providing safety regulations for all vehicles - interstate as well as local. Our decisions so hold. Yet the heavy burden which the Illinois mudguard law places on the interstate movement of trucks and trailers seems to us to pass the permissible limits even for safety regulations.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The state statute (effective July 8, 1957) in relevant part provides:\n\n\"It is unlawful for any person to operate any motor vehicle of the second division upon the highways of this state outside the corporate limits of a city, village or incorporated town unless such vehicle is equipped with rear fender splash guards which shall comply with the specifications hereinafter provided in this Section; except that any motor vehicle of the second division which is or has been purchased, new or used, prior to August 1, 1957 shall be equipped with rear fender splash guards which are so attached as to prevent the splashing of mud or water upon the windshield of other motor vehicles and such splash guards on such vehicle shall not be required to comply with the specifications hereinafter provided in this Section until January 1, 1958.\n\n\n\"The rear fender splash guards shall contour the wheel in such a manner that the relationship of the inside surface of any such splash guard to the tread surface of the tire or wheel shall be relatively parallel, both laterally and across the wheel, at least throughout the top 90 degrees of the rear 180 degrees of the wheel surface; provided however, on vehicles which have a clearance of less than 5 inches between the top of the tire or wheel and that part of the body of the vehicle directly above the tire or wheel when the vehicle is loaded to maximum legal capacity, the curved portion of the splash guard need only extend from a point directly behind the center of the rear axle and to the rear of the wheel surface upwards to within at least 2 inches of the bottom line of the body when the vehicle is loaded to maximum legal capacity. On all vehicles to which this Section applies, there shall be a downward extension of the curved surface which shall end not more than 10 inches from the ground \n\n[359 \nU.S. 520, 522]\n\u00a0\n when the vehicle is loaded to maximum legal capacity. This downward extension shall be part of the curved surface or attached directly to said curved surface, but it need not contour the wheel.\n\n\n\"The splash guards shall be wide enough to cover the full tread or treads of the tires being protected and shall be installed not more than 6 inches from the tread surface of the tire or wheel when the vehicle is loaded to maximum legal capacity. The splash guard shall have a lip or flange on its outside edge to minimize side throw and splash. The lip or flange shall extend toward the center of the wheel, and shall be perpendicular to and extend not less than 2 inches below the inside or bottom surface line or plane of the guard.\n\n\n\"The splash guards may be constructed of a rigid or flexible material, but shall be attached in such a manner that, regardless of movement, either by the splash guards or the vehicle, the splash guards will retain their general parallel relationship to the tread surface of the tire or wheel under all ordinary operating conditions.\" Ill. Rev. Stat., 1957, c. 95 1\/2, 218b.\n\n\n Motor vehicles of the second division are defined as \"Those vehicles which are designed and used for pulling or carrying freight and also those vehicles or motor cars which are designed and used for the carrying of more than seven persons.\" Ill. Rev. Stat., 1957, c. 95 1\/2, 99 (b).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The specifications are somewhat modified if the clearance between the top of the tire and the body of the vehicle directly above it is less than 5 inches when the vehicle is loaded to its maximum legal capacity.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] There are certain exemptions from the statute, but their validity or the validity of the statute in light of them is not questioned here. But see Rudolph Express Co. v. Bibb, 15 Ill. 2d 76, 153 N. E. 2d 820. No contention is here made that the statute discriminates against interstate commerce, and it is clear that its provisions apply alike to vehicles in intrastate as well as in interstate commerce. Nor is it contended that the statute violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Cf. People v. Warren, 11 Ill. 2d 420, 143 N. E. 2d 28.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Arkansas Commerce Commission Rule 100, December 13, 1957.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] It is not argued that there has been a pre-emption of the field by federal regulation. While the Interstate Commerce Commission has, pursuant to 204 (a) of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 Stat. 546, 49 U.S.C. 304 (a)), promulgated its Motor Carrier Safety Regulations to govern vehicles operating in interstate or foreign commerce (see 49 CFR, Pts. 190-197), it has expressly declined to establish any requirements concerning wheel flaps, and has disclaimed any intention to occupy the field or abrogate state regulations not inconsistent with its standards. 54 M.

In view of the findings of the District Court, summarized on page 525 of the Court's opinion and fully justified by the record, to the effect that the contour mudflap \"possesses no advantages\" in terms of safety over the conventional flap permitted in all other States, and indeed creates certain safety hazards, this heavy burden cannot be justified on the theory that the Illinois statute is a necessary, appropriate, or helpful local safety measure.

PFEIFER TRANSPORTATION CO.(1959)\nNo. 32\nArgued: November 16, 1959Decided: December 14, 1959\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner, a mate on respondent's barge, was ordered to do some carpentry work on a raft used to facilitate chipping, painting and welding on respondent's vessels but which was not being used at the time to repair the barge on which petitioner was mate. While on a catwalk used to board or leave the barge and while attempting to move the raft into position for boarding preparatory to carrying out this order, petitioner was injured when the catwalk gave way. Held: He was injured while acting \"in the course of his employment\" and he was entitled to recover from respondent under the Jones Act. Pp. 129-133.\n\n (a) At the time of his injury, petitioner had a status as a seaman and as a member of the crew of his vessel. Pp. 131-132.\n\n\n (b) The fact that he was injured while not on his vessel is immaterial. Pp. 132-133.\n\n\n (c) Petitioner was acting \"in the course of his employment,\" within the meaning of the Jones Act. P. 133.\n\n\n 263 F.2d 147, reversed.\n\nBenjamin H. Siff argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief was Bernard Rolnick. Arthur N. Seiff was of counsel for petitioner.\n\nEdmund F. Lamb argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner brought this suit under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. 688, and recovered judgment after a jury trial. He was employed as mate on respondent's barge. On the day prior to the injury the barge came to respondent's \n\n[361 \nU.S. 129, 130]\n\u00a0\n repair yard to have a cargo pump fixed. At this repair yard respondent maintained a covered lighter, known as the Winisook, which was used as a work barge. Its inshore side was connected with the dock by a plank runway. Between the Winisook and the dock was a raft used for chipping, painting, and welding on such barges as might need that service. The barge on which petitioner worked was not at this time being serviced by the raft. But the raft had been used in repair work on the barge at other times and now needed new decking.\n\nThe barge was moored to adjoin the open water side of the Winisook, the crew of the barge using a catwalk around the sides of the Winisook whenever they left or boarded the barge. The morning after the barge was moored, petitioner's supervisor ordered him to lay some decking on the raft, as petitioner had experience as a carpenter. Petitioner accordingly prepared to go to work on this new job assignment. As he was standing on the catwalk, preparatory to starting his work, releasing a line on the raft to permit him to maneuver it into place so he could board it, the catwalk gave way, causing the injury. The Court of Appeals reversed the judgment for petitioner. 263 F.2d 147. We granted the petition for certiorari because that decision seemed to be out of line with the authorities. \n359 \nU.S. 952\n.\n\nIn O'Donnell v. Great Lakes Co., \n318 \nU.S. 36\n, a seaman was allowed to recover under the Jones Act even though he was injured on shore. The seaman was a deckhand. The ship was discharging her cargo through a conduit that was connected at its outer end to a land pipe by means of a gasket. The seaman in question was ordered by the master to go ashore to assist in repairing the gasket. While so engaged, he was injured by reason of the negligence of a fellow employee. We held that the words \"in the course of his employment\" as used in the Jones Act were not restricted to injuries occurring on navigable \n\n[361 \nU.S. 129, 131]\n\u00a0\n waters, that they were broadly used by Congress in support of \"all the constitutional power it possessed,\" id., at 39, and that it was constitutionally permissible for Congress to supplement the remedy of maintenance and cure by extending a right of recovery in trial by jury to a seaman injured \"while in the service of his vessel by negligence.\" Id., at 43.\n\nThe test, as the O'Donnell case holds, is not whether the injury occurred on navigable waters, for that had been applied by the lower court, id., at 38, which we reversed. Rather it is whether the seaman was injured by negligence while \"in the course of his employment.\"\n\nThe injured party must of course have \"status as a member of the vessel\" for it is seamen, not others who may work on the vessel (Swanson v. Marra Bros., \n328 \nU.S. 1, 4\n), to whom Congress extended the protection of the Jones Act. Nice questions often arise concerning the status of particular workmen and whether their duties give them the status of \"seamen\" as that word is used in the Act. Desper v. Starved Rock Ferry Co., \n342 \nU.S. 187\n. And see Gianfala v. Texas Co., \n350 \nU.S. 879\n, reversing 222 F.2d 382; Senko v. LaCrosse Dredging Corp., \n352 \nU.S. 370\n; Butler v. Whiteman, \n356 \nU.S. 271\n. The court below apparently thought that at the moment petitioner was injured he was not a \"seaman\"; and that conclusion apparently turned on its view that to be such he had to be engaged at the time of the injury in work which was in furtherance of the navigation of the vessel. The court, indeed, held it error not to have given instructions to that effect.\n\nAt times the work done by an employee will be crucial in determining what his status is for purposes of recovery. South Chicago Co. v. Bassett, \n309 \nU.S. 251, 260\n; Swanson v. Marra Bros., supra; Desper v. Starved Rock Ferry Co., supra; Pennsylvania R. Co. v. O'Rourke, \n344 \nU.S. 334\n; Grimes v. Raymond Concrete Pile Co., \n356 \nU.S. 252\n; \n\n[361 \nU.S. 129, 132]\n\u00a0\n Butler v. Whiteman, supra. Those cases, however, are not relevant to our present problem since the question whether petitioner's duties on the raft assignment were of the type to bring one not otherwise a member of a ship's crew within the scope of the Act is not presented in this case. Here we start with an employee who had the status of mate. The issue is whether petitioner, a mate and therefore a \"seaman,\" was injured \"in the course of his employment.\" We conclude that he was.\n\nThe fact that the injury did not occur on the vessel is not controlling, as Senko v. LaCrosse Dredging Corp., supra, 373, holds. A \"seaman\" may often be sent off ship to perform duties of his employment. O'Donnell v. Great Lakes Co., supra. In Marceau v. Great Lakes Transit Corp., 146 F.2d 416, a ship's cook was allowed to recover under the Jones Act when, pursuant to duty, he was returning to the ship and was injured on the dock while approaching a ladder used as ingress to the vessel.\n\nWe held that a seaman who was injured on the dock while departing from the ship on shore leave was in the service of the vessel and was entitled to recover for maintenance and cure in Aguilar v. Standard Oil Co., \n318 \nU.S. 724\n. It was there recognized that a seaman is as much in the service of his ship when boarding it on first reporting for duty, quitting it on being discharged, or going to and from the ship while on shore leave, as he is while on board at high sea. Id., at 736-737. We also held that a seaman injured in a dance hall while on shore leave was in the service of his ship in Warren v. United States, \n340 \nU.S. 523, 529\n. These two cases were not brought under the Jones Act but involved maintenance and cure. Yet they make clear that the scope of a seaman's employment or the activities which are related to the furtherance of the vessel are not measured by the standards applied to land-based employment relationships. They also supply relevant guides to the meaning of the term \"course of \n\n[361 \nU.S. 129, 133]\n\u00a0\n employment\" under the Act since it is the equivalent of the \"service of the ship\" formula used in maintenance and cure cases. See Gilmore and Black, The Law of Admiralty, p. 284. And see O'Donnell v. Great Lakes Co., supra, at 43; Marceau v. Great Lakes Transit Corp., supra.\n\nPetitioner in the present case was ordered by a superior to perform some carpentry work on a raft which lay between the lighter and the dock. Petitioner was injured, as we have said, while on the catwalk attempting to move the raft into position for boarding. The raft was used to facilitate chipping, painting and welding on respondent's vessels. Cf. Grant Smith-Porter Co. v. Rohde, \n257 \nU.S. 469\n. New decking was to be installed on the raft. The fact that the raft was not presently being used to repair respondent's barge is in our view immaterial. Petitioner was acting \"in the course of his employment\" at the time of the injury, for at that moment he was doing the work of his employer pursuant to his employer's orders. No more is required by the Jones Act, as the O'Donnell case indicates, petitioner being a seaman who was injured as a consequence of the negligence of his employer.\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the judgment of the District Court is reinstated.\n\n     So ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER and MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\nTo assert a right of action under the Jones Act, a plaintiff must not only be a seaman, that is, a \"member of a crew of any vessel.\" but must have been injured \"in the course of his employment.\" 46 U.S.C. 688; 33 U.S.C. 903 (a) (1). Petitioner was concededly a member of the \n\n[361 \nU.S. 129, 134]\n\u00a0\n crew of a vessel at the time the events in question took place. The controverted issue is whether a jury could have found that he was injured \"in the course of his employment.\" I cannot agree that the nature of a seaman's duties at the time of injury is irrelevant to this latter issue.\n\nUntil today it has not been intimated in any opinion of the Court that I know of that a seaman may recover under the Jones Act for injuries arising out of activities unrelated to the maintenance or operation of his vessel, and not incidental to its affairs. In other words, the status of being a seaman does not alone bring the Jones Act into play. The character of the activities giving rise to the injury complained of is also an indispensable element to the existence of a federal right to relief under this statute. In the O'Donnell case, \n318 \nU.S. 36\n, cited by the Court, it was stated (at 42-43): \"The right of recovery in the Jones Act is given to the seaman as such, and . . . depends . . . on the nature of the service and its relationship to the operation of the vessel plying in navigable waters.\" There a crew member was ordered to go ashore momentarily to assist in the repair of a fixture being used in unloading the ship. That the work was being done on the dock was held immaterial to Jones Act liability. But that work was plainly in aid of the operations of the vessel on which O'Donnell was employed. See Swanson v. Marra Bros., \n328 \nU.S. 1, 4\n.\n1\n It is a far different matter to say, as the Court seems to say here, that a crew member \n\n[361 \nU.S. 129, 135]\n\u00a0\n may recover under the Jones Act for injuries arising out of activities not directly related to the affairs of the vessel, as in O'Donnell, and not incidental to his shipboard work, see Thompson v. Eargle, 182 F.2d 717; Marceau v. Great Lakes Transit Corp., 146 F.2d 416. \"In the service of the ship\" is something quite different than \"in the service of the shipowner.\"\n2\n In this case the seaman's employer also had a nonseaman-employing business, the repair yard, for which nonseaman activities were needed.\n\nThe Jones Act extended to maritime workers the negligence remedy provided for interstate railroad workers by the Federal Employers' Liability Act, 45 U.S.C. 51. Under the FELA, and the uniform course of our decisions under it, see, e. g., Southern Pacific Co. v. Gileo, \n351 \nU.S. 493\n; Reed v. Pennsylvania R. Co., \n351 \nU.S. 502\n, the remedy given by that Act applies only \"to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such [interstate] carrier in such commerce.\" Under the Jones Act the remedy is given to \"[a]ny seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment.\" I think this means that a seaman's injury must have arisen out of his work as a seaman, just as a railroad worker's injury must have arisen out of his employment in interstate commerce. Otherwise it is difficult to see what purpose the \"in the course of his employment\" requirement of the Jones Act serves. Both the FELA and the Jones Act give a federal cause of action in negligence only in respect of particular kinds of injuries - under the FELA, those \n\n[361 \nU.S. 129, 136]\n\u00a0\n suffered in interstate commerce, under the Jones Act, those suffered in work as a seaman.\n\nThus, I think the issue of liability in this case turns on whether petitioner, when he fell from the faulty catwalk, was already engaged in the performance of his raft assignment, or whether he was simply en route to that assignment. If the former, there would, in my opinion, be no liability, for the record contains no basis for an inference that petitioner's assignment was related to the business of the vessel and, lacking such relationship, petitioner's injury cannot be deemed to have occurred \"in the course of his employment.\" In that event any remedy would be that afforded by local law. Cf. Swanson v. Marra Bros., supra, at p. 7; 2 Larson, Law of Workmen's Compensation, 90.22.\n3\n If, however, petitioner was injured en route to his raft assignment, the Jones Act would apply, for \"the course of his employment,\" I think, continued until he commenced that assignment. Considering that the evidence presents a jury issue on this score, I concur in the reversal of the judgment of the Court of Appeals dismissing the complaint.\n\nHowever, I dissent from the reinstatement of the judgment of the District Court. The relevant portion of the charge, to which respondent excepted, was vague and lacking in guidance as to the nature of the factual issue presented in this respect.\n4\n Moreover, in making liability \n\n[361 \nU.S. 129, 137]\n\u00a0\n turn on the question whether crew members normally performed work of this nature, the charge was in error.\n5\n Such a factor might well be relevant in a case where there was doubt as to the ultimate issue whether an injury was suffered in the course of work\n6\n in some way related to the vessel in which the plaintiff seaman served. However, here it was not disputed that the petitioner's assignment to work on the raft was at the time wholly unrelated to any of the affairs of his vessel.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In referring to the O'Donnell case, it was stated in Swanson (at p. 4): \"We there held the ship owner liable, under the Jones Act, for injuries caused to a seaman by a fellow servant while the former was on shore engaged in repairing a conduit which was a part of the vessel and used for discharging its cargo. But in that case we sustained the recovery because the injured person was a seaman and an employee of the vessel, engaged in the course of his employment as such.\" (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The maintenance and cure decisions relied on by the Court are all, like the Marceau case, instances of injuries incurred during leave-time activities, and are inapposite here. Whether, on the facts in the case before us, the petitioner would be found to have been working \"in the service of his ship\" for purposes of the doctrine of maintenance and cure, we need not decide, for the Court advances no reason for assimilating the issue of Jones Act coverage to that of the availability of maintenance and cure.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] I think the Court of Appeals was mistaken in considering that the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act would apply, for that Act, 33 U.S.C. 902 (3), 903 (a) (1), excludes from its coverage a \"member of a crew of any vessel,\" which this petitioner admittedly was.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The charge, in pertinent part, read as follows: \"While it seemed at the outset to be some question as to whether or not he was a member of the crew, it does not seem to be seriously disputed that at the time of the accident he was a member of the crew. \"Whether or not at the time of the accident he was engaged in \n\n[361 \nU.S. 129, 137]\n\u00a0\n functions which are normally performed by a member of the crew, and as he stated, some functions he gave in detail, that he did perform various functions prior to the date of the accident, are for you to determine.\" Subsequently the court amended the charge in this language: \"I did state that it is not seriously disputed that the plaintiff was not a member of the crew. Apparently according to the defendant's statement, he says that is a serious issue. \"So I will leave that as an issue.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The two lower courts seem to have failed to come sharply to grips with the distinction between the two separate requirements of the Jones Act, namely, that the plaintiff have the status of a \"seaman,\" and that his injury must have been suffered \"in the course of his employment\" as such. Most of the Jones Act cases decided by this Court have involved only the \"seaman\" issue. See, e. g., Senko v. LaCrosse Dredging Corp., \n352 \nU.S. 370\n; Grimes v. Raymond Concrete Pile Co., \n356 \nU.S. 252\n; Butler v. Whiteman, \n356 \nU.S. 271\n. Such decisions are only remotely apposite here where the petitioner's status as a seaman is not disputed. It only confuses things to equate the issue of being a \"seaman\" with the issue whether the injuries suffered were \"in the course of his employment.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Shore leave cases such as Marceau, supra, present a different problem. \n\n[361 \nU.S. 129, 138]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","20":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBROADY v.

UNITED STATES(1959)\nNo. 4\nArgued: October 16, 1958Decided: March 9, 1959\n\n\n\n\n Subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury which was investigating possible violations of Part II of the Interstate Commerce Act, petitioner refused, on grounds of possible self-incrimination, to answer questions which were concededly relevant to the grand jury's inquiry. The grand jury sought the aid of the district judge, who heard extensive arguments on the subject, ruled that petitioner would be accorded immunity as extensive as the privilege he had asserted, and ordered petitioner to answer the questions. After returning to the jury room, petitioner persisted in his refusal, and he was again brought before the district judge, who addressed the same questions to him in the presence of the grand jury, explicitly directed him to answer them, and, upon his refusal to do so, adjudged him guilty of criminal contempt and sentenced him to imprisonment for 15 months. Held: The judgment is sustained. Pp. 42-52.\n\n 1. Section 205 (e) of the Motor Carrier Act, 49 U.S.C. 305 (d), clothed petitioner with statutory immunity coextensive with his constitutional privilege not to incriminate himself; and, therefore, he had an unqualified duty to answer the questions as he was directed to do. Pp. 44-47.\n\n\n 2. Since petitioner's disobedience of the court's order occurred in the court's presence, it was proper for the court to proceed under Rule 42 (a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure; and the court's action in affording petitioner a locus penitentiae before finally adjudicating him in contempt was entirely proper. Pp. 47-52.\n\n\n 3. The sentence of 15 months' imprisonment was not an abuse of the District Court's discretion. P. 52.\n\n\n 247 F.2d 332, affirmed.\n\nMyron L.

On the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Anderson, Beatrice Rosenberg and Carl H. Imlay.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe petitioner was sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment for criminal contempt stemming from his refusal to testify before a federal grand jury. His conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, 247 F.2d 332. The case was brought here primarily to review the validity of the procedure which resulted in the contempt adjudication. \n356 \nU.S. 926\n. Other issues relate to the nature and extent of immunity from prosecution conferred by 205 (e) of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended,\n1\n and the severity of the punishment imposed by the District Court.\n\nA grand jury in the Southern District of New York investigating possible violations of Part II of the Interstate Commerce Act\n2\n issued a subpoena directing the petitioner to appear and testify as to \"all and everything which you may know in regard to an alleged violation of Sections 309, 322, Title 49, United States Code.\" In response to this subpoena the petitioner appeared and, after being sworn, answered a few preliminary questions. He was then asked six further questions concededly relevant to the grand jury's inquiry. These he refused to answer upon the ground of possible self-incrimination. After consulting with his lawyer, who was continuously present in an adjoining anteroom, the petitioner persisted in his refusal to answer, although advised at length by the Assistant United States Attorney that the applicable \n\n[359 \nU.S. 41, 43]\n\u00a0\n statute conferred complete immunity from prosecution as to any matter concerning which the petitioner might testify, and that, therefore, \"you do not have any privilege to plead the Fifth Amendment.\"\n\nThereupon the scene of the proceedings shifted to the courtroom, where the grand jury sought the aid of the district judge. After being apprised of what had transpired in the grand jury room, the district judge heard extensive argument by counsel as to the scope of immunity afforded a grand jury witness under the applicable statute.\n\nFollowing a weekend recess the district judge ruled that under the statute the petitioner would be accorded immunity as extensive as the privilege he had asserted, and directed that the petitioner therefore return to the grand jury room and answer the questions. Later the same day the grand jury again returned to the courtroom \"to request the aid and assistance of the Court.\" The district judge was advised through the official reporter that the petitioner had refused to obey the court's order to answer the questions.\n\nThe judge then addressed the same questions to the petitioner in the grand jury's presence. Each question was met with a refusal to answer upon the ground of possible self-incrimination. The petitioner was thereupon explicitly directed by the judge to answer each question, and he just as explicitly refused. The judge inquired whether the petitioner would persist in his refusal if he returned to the grand jury room and were again asked the questions there. The petitioner replied that he would. After further argument by counsel, the district judge held the petitioner in contempt and imposed sentence.\n\nThroughout the proceedings in the courtroom the petitioner was represented by counsel, who unsuccessfully advanced three basic contentions: (1) A witness who testifies before a grand jury investigating offenses under the Motor Carrier Act is accorded no statutory immunity \n\n[359 \nU.S. 41, 44]\n\u00a0\n from subsequent prosecution based upon his testimony. (2) Even if some immunity is conferred, it is not coextensive with the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination. (3) In any event, the District Court, by adjudging the petitioner in criminal contempt without following the procedural requirements of Rule 42 (b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, deprived the petitioner of due process of law. The same contentions are advanced here. In addition, we are asked to hold that the sentence of 15 months' imprisonment was an abuse of the District Court's discretion.\n\nIn determining that 205 (e) of the Motor Carrier Act clothed the petitioner with statutory immunity coextensive with his constitutional privilege not to incriminate himself, the District Court and the Court of Appeals were plainly correct. The relevant statutory language is unambiguous: \". . . and any person subpenaed or testifying in connection with any matter under investigation under this chapter shall have the same rights, privileges, and immunities and be subject to the same duties, liabilities, and penalties as though such matter arose under chapter 1 of this title [Part I of the Interstate Commerce Act] . . . .\"\n3\n The obvious purpose and effect of this \n\n[359 \nU.S. 41, 45]\n\u00a0\n language is to confer the same immunity upon a witness testifying in an investigation under Part II of the Interstate Commerce Act as is conferred upon one testifying in an investigation under Part I. Both Part I and Part II contain criminal sanctions, and the power of a grand jury to investigate violations of either Part is unquestioned.\n\nThe statute which confers immunity upon a witness testifying in a grand jury investigation under Part I was enacted in 1893.\n4\n For more than half a century it has \n\n[359 \nU.S. 41, 46]\n\u00a0\n been settled that this statute confers immunity from prosecution coextensive with the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination, and that the witness may not therefore lawfully refuse to testify. Brown v. Walker, \n161 \nU.S. 591\n (1896). The context in which the doctrine originated and the history of its reaffirmance through the years have been so recently re-examined by this Court in Ullman v. United States, \n350 \nU.S. 422\n, as to make it a needless exercise to retrace that ground here. Suffice it to repeat that Brown v. Walker has become \"part of our constitutional fabric.\" \n350 \nU.S., at 438\n. It is thus clearly too late in the day to question the constitutional sufficiency of the immunity provided under Part I of the Act.\n\nIn contending that this immunity is not fully imported into Part II the petitioner grasps at straws. He points out that the above-quoted language of 49 U.S.C. 305 (d) which incorporates into Part II the immunity provisions of Part I is separated by only a semicolon from a provision which gives the Commission investigative powers under Part II. See footnote 3. He would therefore have us rewrite the section so as to make the immunity provision applicable only to witnesses appearing before the Commission, not to those appearing before a grand jury or in a court. Such a construction would not only do violence to plain language, but also, as the Court of Appeals observed, to the whole structure of the Interstate Commerce Act. See 247 F.2d, at 336-337.\n\nThe petitioner argues alternatively that even if some immunity is granted by Part II to a grand jury witness, the immunity is not commensurate with that of Part I, and that its scope is therefore constitutionally insufficient. The contention is that 305 (d) provides immunity from \n\n[359 \nU.S. 41, 47]\n\u00a0\n prosecution only for offenses related to violations of the Motor Carrier Act itself because of the clause appearing at the beginning of the section - \"So far as may be necessary for the purposes of this chapter.\" See footnote 3. Assuming that this clause limits the immunity provision of the section at all, it clearly limits only the class of witnesses to whom the immunity will attach, not the scope of the immunity conferred. The petitioner \"subpoenaed . . . in connection with [a] matter under investigation under this chapter . . . necessary for the purposes of this chapter\" was clearly within that class.\n\nCongress thus provided that the petitioner could not and would not incriminate himself by answering the questions put to him. He could not \"be prosecuted or subjected to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter or thing, concerning which he [might] testify. . . .\" 49 U.S.C. 46. He therefore had an unqualified duty to answer the questions as he was directed to do.\n\nWe turn then to the petitioner's attack upon the validity of the procedure which the District Court followed in adjudicating him in contempt.\n5\n This procedure, it is contended, robbed the petitioner not only of the safeguards \n\n[359 \nU.S. 41, 48]\n\u00a0\n of notice, opportunity to prepare a defense, and a hearing, but also of the presumption of innocence and other rights basic to a fair criminal trial.\n\nIn view of the apparent breadth of the petitioner's argument, it may promote analysis of this aspect of the case to emphasize at the outset what it does not involve. This is not a situation where the contempt was in any sense personal to the judge, raising issues of possible unfairness resulting from the operation of human emotions. Cf. Cooke v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 517, 539\n; Sacher v. United States, \n343 \nU.S. 1\n; Offutt v. United States, \n348 \nU.S. 11\n. This is not a case of \"misbehavior\" involving factual issues as to the nature of the petitioner's conduct and whether it occurred in the \"presence\" of the court or \"so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice.\"\n6\n Cf. Ex parte Savin, \n131 \nU.S. 267\n; Ex parte Cuddy, \n131 \nU.S. 280\n; Nye v. United States, \n313 \nU.S. 33, 44\n-53. Moreover, the petitioner does not question the power of the court to punish disobedience of its lawful order as a criminal contempt,\n7\n and to do so summarily, if the disobedience occurs in the presence of the court and in the sight or hearing of the judge.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nThe issue presented is thus considerably narrower than the broad strokes of the petitioner's argument would at \n\n[359 \nU.S. 41, 49]\n\u00a0\n first suggest. Indeed, the argument boils down to the contention that when the petitioner first disobeyed the court's order in the grand jury room the court had no choice but to initiate criminal contempt proceedings against him at once, under the provisions of Rule 42 (b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,\n9\n and that it therefore violated his rights by calling him before it and giving him another opportunity to answer the questions before adjudicating him in contempt. This argument disregards the historic relationship between court and grand jury. It finds support in neither precedent nor reason.\n\nA grand jury is clothed with great independence in many areas, but it remains an appendage of the court, powerless to perform its investigative function without the court's aid, because powerless itself to compel the testimony of witnesses. It is the court's process which summons the witness to attend and give testimony, and it is the court which must compel a witness to testify if, after appearing, he refuses to do so.\n\nWhen the petitioner first refused to answer the grand jury's questions, he was guilty of no contempt. He was \n\n[359 \nU.S. 41, 50]\n\u00a0\n entitled to persist in his refusal until the court ordered him to answer. Unless, therefore, it was to be frustrated in its investigative purpose, the grand jury had to do exactly what it did - turn to the court for help. If the court had ruled that the privilege against self-incrimination had been properly invoked, that would have been the end of the matter. Even after an adverse ruling upon his claim of privilege, the petitioner was still guilty of no contempt. It was incumbent upon the court unequivocally to order the petitioner to answer. Cf. Wong Gim Ying v. United States, 98 U.S. App. D.C. 23, 231 F.2d 776. The court did so.\n\nWhen upon his return to the grand jury room the petitioner again refused to answer the grand jury's questions, now in direct disobedience of the court's order, he was for the first time guilty of contempt. At that point a contempt proceeding could unquestionably and quite properly have been initiated. Since this disobedience of the order did not take place in the actual presence of the court, and thus could be made known to the court only by the taking of evidence, the proceeding would have been conducted upon notice and hearing in conformity with Rule 42 (b). See Carlson v. United States, 209 F.2d 209, 216 (C. A. 1st Cir.).\n\nA judge more intent upon punishing the witness than aiding the grand jury in its investigation might well have taken just such a course. Instead, the court made another effort to induce the petitioner to testify. Again unequivocally advising the petitioner that the statute afforded him complete immunity, the court directed him to answer the questions. Had the petitioner done so, he would have purged himself of contempt, and the grand jury's investigation could have proceeded.\n10\n His deliberate refusal, \n\n[359 \nU.S. 41, 51]\n\u00a0\n continuing his contempt, cf. Yates v. United States, \n355 \nU.S. 66, 75\n, left the court no choice.\n11\n Since the disobedience occurred in the court's presence, it was clearly proper to proceed under Rule 42 (a).\n\nRule 42 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure is no innovation. It simply makes \"more explicit\" the long-settled usages of law governing the procedure to be followed in contempt proceedings.\n12\n No decision of this Court has ever questioned the propriety of summary contempt proceedings in aid of a grand jury investigation. Repeated decisions of this Court and the Courts of Appeals have, at least sub silentio, approved such a procedure, stemming as it does from the usages of the common law.\n13\n Indeed less than a decade ago this Court did not consider the question sufficiently doubtful to merit discussion.\n14\n In the light, therefore, of both reason and \n\n[359 \nU.S. 41, 52]\n\u00a0\n authority, we hold that the court's action in affording the petitioner a locus penitentiae before finally adjudicating him in contempt was entirely proper.\n\nWe hold, finally, that the sentence of 15 months' imprisonment was not an abuse of the District Court's discretion. Because there is no statutory limit upon a District Court's sentencing power in cases of criminal contempt, Green v. United States, \n356 \nU.S. 165\n, this Court is not without power to review its exercise. Cf. Yates v. United States, \n356 \nU.S. 363\n; Nilva v. United States, \n352 \nU.S. 385, 396\n. But the decision is one primarily for the District Court, to be made \"with the utmost sense of responsibility and circumspection.\" Green v. United States, supra, at 188. The record does not indicate that the district judge's decision was otherwise reached. Before sentence was imposed, the petitioner's counsel was fully, repeatedly and patiently heard.\n15\n\u00a0\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 49 Stat. 550; 54 Stat. 922, 49 U.S.C. 305 (d).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Commonly known as the Motor Carrier Act, 49 Stat. 543, as amended, 54 Stat. 919, 49 U.S.C. 301 et seq.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The full text of the subsection, as it appears in the United States Code, is as follows: \"So far as may be necessary for the purposes of this chapter, the Commission and the members and examiners thereof and joint boards shall have the same power to administer oaths, and require by subpena the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers, tariffs, contracts, agreements, and documents, and to take testimony by deposition, relating to any matter under investigation, as the Commission has in a matter arising under chapter 1 of this title; and any person subpenaed or testifying in connection with any matter under investigation under this chapter shall have the same rights, privileges, and immunities and be subject to the same duties, liabilities, and penalties as though such matter arose under chapter 1 of this title, unless otherwise provided in this chapter.\" 49 U.S.C. 305 (d).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] 27 Stat. 443, 49 U.S.C. 46. \"No person shall be excused from attending and testifying or from producing books, papers, tariffs, contracts, agreements, and documents before the Interstate Commerce Commission, or in obedience to the subpoena of the commission, whether such subpoena be signed or issued by one or more commissioners, or in any cause or proceeding, criminal or otherwise, based upon or growing out of any alleged violation of chapter 1 of this title on the ground or for the reason that the testimony or evidence, documentary or otherwise, required of him, may tend to criminate him or subject him to a penalty or forfeiture.

United States, \n340 \nU.S. 367\n, the petitioner attacked the validity of the summary procedure by which she was found guilty of criminal contempt for refusing to testify before a grand jury. (See petitioner's brief Nos. 20, 21, 22, O. T., 1950, pp. 54-58; brief of United States, ibid., pp. 51-53.) Neither the opinion of the Court nor the dissenting opinion discussed the question. A petition for rehearing which complained of the Court's silence on this issue \n\n[359 \nU.S. 41, 52]\n\u00a0\n (Petition for Rehearing No. 20, O. T., 1950, pp. 6-10) was denied. \n341 \nU.S. 912\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] The petitioner points out that the sentence imposed was in excess of the maximum punishment authorized by statute for substantive violations of the Motor Carrier Act. A more relevant comparison might be made to the statutory offenses involving obstruction of the administration of justice, punishable by a maximum of five years' imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. 1503. The record shows that the grand jury was investigating suspected violations of the Motor Carrier Act not by the petitioner, but by others. The District Court was informed that the testimony the grand jury \"desired to elicit from this witness . . . is of the very greatest importance, and the witness's refusal to answer is a very great stumbling block to this investigation and to all these investigations.\" If within 60 days of the termination of these proceedings the petitioner indicates his willingness to testify, the District Court will no doubt consider that fact in passing upon a motion for reduction of his sentence under Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 41, 53]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK, MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, and MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN join, dissenting.\n\nI find myself in disagreement with the majority opinion, not because of its interpretation of the scope of the immunity provisions here in question, but because it sanctions the procedure used below to convict petitioner summarily of criminal contempt and to sentence him to 15 months' imprisonment under Rule 42 (a) when the proceedings should have been in accordance with Rule 42 (b). The denial of even the minimal protections accorded by Rule 42 (b) deprived petitioner of an opportunity to prepare a legal defense, or to demonstrate extenuating circumstances,\n1\n and satisfied neither the plain intent of Rule 42 nor the principles of fair play.\n\nRule 42 (b) prescribes that criminal contempts \"shall\" be prosecuted on notice allowing a \"reasonable time for the preparation of the defense\" and other protections, except in those instances wherein Rule 42 (a) provides that contempts committed in the presence of the court \"may\" be punished summarily. This demonstrates that the general mode of procedure was to be that prescribed by Rule 42 (b). On the other hand, Rule 42 (a) covers \n\n[359 \nU.S. 41, 54]\n\u00a0\n only specific situations and even then the contempt procedure need not be summary. In the light of the concern long demonstrated by both Congress\n2\n and this Court\n3\n over the possible abuse of the contempt power, it is obvious that Rule 42 (a) was reserved for exceptional circumstances. These might include threatening the judge, United States v. Hall, 176 F.2d 163, or other acts disrupting court proceedings and obstructing the administration of the court's business. United States v. Landes, 97 F.2d 378.\n\nRule 42 (a) was not inserted in the Rules in order to ease the difficulties of prosecuting contempts. It was not meant to authorize the practice of having government prosecutors force persons who had already committed contempts outside of the presence of the court to repeat the action before the court and thus subject themselves to deprivation of their rights under Rule 42 (b). Given the purpose of Rule 42 (a) with its admittedly precipitous character and extremely harsh consequences, this Court should not countenance a procedure whereby a contempt already completed out of the court's presence may be reproduced in a command performance before the court to justify summary disposition. That is not to say the Government could not properly bring the petitioner before the court a second time. Of course, both the Government and the grand jury could use such additional persuasion to obtain answers to the questions. But that second refusal should not constitute a second contempt. Nor should this procedure alone justify imposing a more \n\n[359 \nU.S. 41, 55]\n\u00a0\n severe penalty than would have been appropriate for contempt of the grand jury.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nAfter petitioner refused to answer the questions the judge might very properly have summarily committed the petitioner to jail for civil contempt until he answered the questions. Oriel v. Russell, \n278 \nU.S. 358, 363\n. See Gompers v. Bucks Stove & Range Co., \n221 \nU.S. 418, 442\n. This is not disputed. In such a proceeding the recalcitrant witness although summarily committed is said to carry the keys to the jail in his own pocket. See In re Nevitt, 117 F. 448, 461. Or, upon presentment, the judge might have given notice in open court of a criminal contempt proceeding to be commenced under the procedures set forth in Rule 42 (b), and the Government so concedes. That is the normal manner of proceeding in these cases. See Wong Gim Ying v. United States, 98 U.S. App. D.C. 23, 27, 231 F.2d 776, 780; Carlson v. United States, 209 F.2d 209, 216.\n\nBut the Government was not satisfied with such a procedure. On April 8, though ostensibly seeking the court's assistance in obtaining the answers to the questions, the prosecutor never even faintly suggested any coercive remedy.\n5\n Rather, from the outset he spoke in terms assuming that petitioner would continue his refusal to testify and made known to the court that he would seek a summary disposition under Rule 42 (a) immediately. After the finding of contempt, he asked the judge to \n\n[359 \nU.S. 41, 56]\n\u00a0\n give petitioner a substantial sentence and the judge complied - with 15 months in the penitentiary. He then asked the judge to omit a purge clause which the judge did.\n6\n Thereafter he urged the judge to deny bail and the judge promptly acceded to that request.\n\nBeyond a short statement, nothing was offered by the Assistant United States Attorney to show the seriousness of the contempt.\n7\n The offense the grand jury was investigating was punishable by no more than a fine. 71 Stat. 352, 49 U.S.C. (Supp. V) 322 (a).\n\nI do not assert that the contempt could not be more serious than the offense under investigation,\n8\n but where there is a disparity such as exists in this case, a hearing should be held to demonstrate, subject to rebuttal, at least the purpose and significance of the grand jury investigation, the witness' relationship to the subject matter under investigation, and the effect of the witness' recalcitrance on the future of the investigation.\n\nThe Court's opinion observes that the judge may reduce the sentence within 60 days of the termination of these proceedings under Rule 35. But that power has been held to be discretionary, Flores v. United States, 238 F.2d 758; \n\n[359 \nU.S. 41, 57]\n\u00a0\n Miller v. United States, 224 F.2d 501, and does not in any sense make a term in the penitentiary comparable to a jail commitment for civil contempt. Exercise of Rule 35 power does not make petitioner any less a convicted criminal. Also, the failure to invoke civil contempt indicates that the judge intended the sentence to be punitive and not coercive.\n9\n\u00a0\n\nIt is asserted that only a legal issue is involved here - the scope of immunity - so that there was no need to give petitioner time to prepare a defense under Rule 42 (b).\n10\n But this overlooks the right of petitioner to present evidence in extenuation and to show what other courts had done in similar circumstances. This argument also neglects the importance of affording the judge an opportunity for reflection. A judge should not be forced - or goaded - into spur-of-the-moment decisions where the imprisonment of a person is in the balance. There is no indication that the district judge expected the grand jury to return on the afternoon of April 8. Yet, within a short time after its return, the judge had convicted the petitioner and sentenced him to 15 months in prison for his conduct and had denied bail. Neither counsel discussed the sentences given in comparable cases and, from the severity of the sentence here, it is clear that the judge was not \n\n[359 \nU.S. 41, 58]\n\u00a0\n advised how other judges were treating similar offenses.\n11\n There is no statutory limit for the length of sentence in contempts of this character. Apparently, the 15-month sentence in this case is the longest contempt sentence ever \n\n[359 \nU.S. 41, 59]\n\u00a0\n sustained by any appellate court in the federal system for a refusal to answer questions of a court or grand jury.\n12\n Even a short delay might have given the judge enough time for research to establish that the Government's reason for seeking omission of the purge clause was groundless.\n13\n Also, the judge took no time to consider the bail \n\n[359 \nU.S. 41, 60]\n\u00a0\n question. After a minimum of argument by counsel, the judge denied bail pending appeal.\n14\n\u00a0\n\nShortcuts in criminal procedure are always confusing\n15\n and dangerous, but they are particularly so here, because if sanctioned by this Court, prosecutors throughout the federal system will be tempted to do all they can to make Rule 42 (b) a dead letter. The contempt power traditionally has been utilized sparingly and only when necessary to uphold the dignity of the courts. Early in our history, the limits of the power to punish for contempt were said to be \"the least possible power adequate to the end proposed.\" Anderson v. Dunn, 6 Wheat. 204, 231. As MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER has said in Sacher v. United States, \n343 \nU.S. 1, 24\n-25 (dissenting opinion):\n\n\"To dispense with indictment by grand jury and trial by a jury of twelve does not mean the right to disregard reason and fairness. Reason and fairness demand, even in punishing contempt, procedural safeguards within which the needs for the effective administration of justice can be amply satisfied while at the same time the reach of so drastic a power is \n\n[359 \nU.S. 41, 61]\n\u00a0\n kept within limits that will minimize abuse. While experience has shown the necessary of recognizing that courts possess this authority, experience has also proven that restrictions appropriate to the purposes of the power must fence in its exercise. Hence Congress, by legislation dating back more than a hundred years, has put geographic and procedural restrictions upon the power of the United States courts to punish summarily for contempt. . . .\n\n\n \"The Court did so for a reason deeply imbedded in our legal system and by that very fact too often neglected. Times of tension, which are usually periods of war and their aftermath, bring it to the surface. Reflecting no doubt their concern over untoward events in law enforcement arising out of the First World War, Mr. Justice Brandies and Mr. Justice Holmes gave quiet warning when they observed that `in the development of our liberty insistence upon procedural regularity has been a large factor.' Burdeau v. McDowell, \n256 \nU.S. 465, 477\n. It is not for nothing that most of the provisions of our Bill of Rights are concerned with matters of procedure.\n\n\n \"That is what this case is about - `procedural regularity.' Not whether these petitioners have been guilty of conduct professionally inexcusable, but what tribunal should sit in judgment; not whether they should be punished, but who should mete out the appropriate punishment; not whether a Federal court has authority to prevent its proceedings from being subverted, but how that authority should be exercised so as to assure the rectitude of legal proceedings and at the same time not detract from the authority of law itself.\"\n\n\n And, shortly thereafter, the Court adopted this viewpoint. See Offutt v. United States, \n348 \nU.S. 11\n. The importance of procedural regularity often lies in advising \n\n[359 \nU.S. 41, 62]\n\u00a0\n the defendant of the procedure he must expect and giving him time to prepare. Also, judicial reflection is an invaluable by-product of procedures that are designed to be no more precipitous than necessary to meet the demands of the situation. Here, there was no demonstrated need for haste and no resultant benefit (except in saving the United States Attorney's office the time and effort of preparing for a hearing on notice). There had already been a fully committed contempt before the grand jury which might have been prosecuted within a short time giving petitioner only \"a reasonable time for the preparation of the defense.\" This Court with its supervisory power over the administration of criminal justice in the federal courts, McNabb v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 332, 340\n, should not permit the utilization of summary contempt procedures where immediate action is not necessary for the preservation of the respect and dignity of the federal courts. Improvident use of summary procedures only weakens that respect.\n16\n\u00a0\n\nIn the light of the sentences given in this type of case, I doubt if any judge in the federal system would summarily send a witness to the penitentiary for 15 months for merely refusing to testify in a grand jury investigation of whether a trucker is operating without an ICC certificate. It is quite obvious that much of the sentence was for some reason collateral to that investigation. It is not sufficient for the purpose of increasing punishment to act on the suspicion that the refusal of the witness to testify may redound to the interest of a racketeer, and on that basis deny him the protections that Congress has seen fit to accord to all witness before grand juries. If such factors are to play a part in the sentence the witness is entitled to a hearing on notice. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 41, 63]\n\u00a0\n\n\nUnfortunately, the failure to adhere to procedural regularity may be glossed over in the investigation of matters of burning public interest, but it should be remembered that the deprivation of the rights of a witness in such an investigation must apply as a precedent to people in all walks of life, both good and bad. I suggest that the full import of the decision in this case will not be recognized until it is applied at some future time in other types of investigations and to other people.\n\nI would reverse the conviction.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The prosecutor indicated to the court that the inquiry, though directed toward minor violations of the Interstate Commerce Act, was really part of an effort to discover facts concerning notorious gangsters suspected of complicity in the Victor Riesel acid-throwing incident and general racketeering in the Southern District of New York. In view of the total absence of any intimation that petitioner had violated the Interstate Commerce Act or was himself guilty of criminal conduct, the actual basis for his refusal to testify may well have been fear of gangster reprisals, a not unreasonable fear in such circumstances. Regardless of the legal significance of such a defense, see Widger v. United States, 244 F.2d 103, a hearing would have provided an opportunity for presentation of such facts to the judge and might well have affected the length of sentence.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See, generally, Frankfurter and Landis, Power of Congress Over Procedure in Criminal Contempts in \"Inferior\" Federal Courts - A Study in Separation of Powers, 37 Harv. L. Rev. 1010.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See, e. g., Cammer v. United States, \n350 \nU.S. 399\n; Offutt v. United States, \n348 \nU.S. 11\n; Nye v. United States, \n313 \nU.S. 33\n; Cooke v.

Dunn, 6 Wheat. 204.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Although the district judge asked petitioner other questions during this second proceeding in the courtroom, the judge's certificate makes clear that the contempt found was for refusal to answer the six substantive questions and not for any other answers. Cf. Carlson v. United States, 209 F.2d 209, 216.\n\nIn practice, contempts before the court are punished no more severely than those before the grand jury. See n. 11, infra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] See the statement in n. 5 of the Court's opinion. But see n. 9, infra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] See n. 13, infra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The only expression by the Assistant United States Attorney about the connection of petitioner with the grand jury investigation then in progress was the following statement made during discussion of the punishment:\n\n\"The information that it is desired to elicit from this witness, I represent to the Court, is of the very greatest importance, and the witness' refusal to answer is a very great stumbling block to this investigation and to all these investigations.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Comparing this sentence with that possible under the penalty for obstructing the administration of justice, 18 U.S.C. 1503, is not meaningful because in such a prosecution petitioner would have been entitled to all of the safeguards normally afforded criminal defendants, including, of course, the very basic protection of trial by jury.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] This would seem true despite the confusion existent in the courtroom just before the sentencing wherein the prosecutor asked the judge for a \"substantial sentence, and that is done not so much for any punitive effect as it would be for the coercive effect of the sentence.\" This was stated just after the prosecutor had requested the judge to omit a purge clause!\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Although this Court disagrees with petitioner's argument concerning the breadth and applicability of the immunity provisions in question, the Court of Appeals did grant bail and its opinion recognized that the point had some \"novel aspects.\" 247 F.2d 332, 338. Thus, when considering the action taken by the district judge, it must be recognized that the question of immunity was not frivolous.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] The following cases involving contempt of the grand jury appear to be the only appellate decisions in the Second Circuit: O'Connell v.

United States, 179 F.2d 559, aff'd \n340 \nU.S. 367\n (four-month sentence for refusal before court to testify before grand jury); Green v. United States, 193 F.2d 111 (C. A. 2d Cir.) (six-month sentence for telling court he would not obey order to produce records before the grand jury at a later date); United States v. Field, 193 F.2d 92 (C. A. 2d Cir.) (one sentence of 90 days and two sentences of 6 months, all with purge clauses for refusals to answer certain questions and produce certain documents at hearing before the court); Enrichi v. United States, 212 F.2d 702 (six-month sentence and $500 fine for refusal before court to testify before grand jury).\n\nEven refusals to testify during the course of trial have not been punished as severely: In re Cashman, 168 F. 1008 (D.C. S. D. N. Y.) (8 months and $750 fine for refusal to answer questions at bankruptcy hearing); United States v. Barker, 11 F. R.

(six months for witness' refusal to give direct testimony); United States v. Gates, 176 F.2d 78 (C. A. 2d Cir.) (30 days with purge clause for refusal to answer question on cross-examination during trial); Widger v. United States, 244 F.2d 103 (one-year sentence for refusal to testify reversed).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] All of the longer sentences have been vacated or reversed on appeal: United States v. Miranti, 253 F.2d 135 (C. A. 2d Cir.); Carlson v. United States, 209 F.2d 209; Healey v. United States, 186 F.2d 164. The 18-month sentence sustained in Lopiparo v. United States, 216 F.2d 87, was not for a refusal to testify. Rather, the contempt there was based upon the judge's disbelief of defendant's story that he could not find the corporate books which he was ordered to produce before the grand jury. 216 F.2d, at 91. Even the sentence in that case contained a purge clause.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] The stated reason for requesting omission of a purge clause was the legal effect it might have in shortening the fixed term. But see Lopiparo v. United States, 222 F.2d 897. Cf. Loubriel v. United States, 9 F.2d 807, relied on by the Government.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] Eight days later, the Court of Appeals granted bail and petitioner has been at large since.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] The question of whether the April 8 proceedings were conducted in secret is the subject of some confusion caused by the swift procedure invoked. It is clear that on April 5 the courtroom was cleared. It is also clear that on April 8 the grand jury returned to the courtroom ostensibly for further aid and assistance, and that the grand jury reporter read to the court what had happened earlier. Though the transcript does not so indicate, it would seem most likely that secrecy was again in effect. In fact, petitioner's counsel objected to the procedure and asked that he be served in \"open court\" with notice of the charges. There is no indication of any change in this situation after the refusal to answer and before the actual contempt proceeding. The Assistant United States Attorney has stated that in fact there were no spectators in the courtroom on April 8. A secret proceeding is no less secret because the defendant is allowed to have counsel. See also n. 10, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] Reliance upon the improper application of Rule 42 (a) to petitioner in this case, makes it unnecessary to discuss the issue raised in Green v.

OHIO(1959)\nNo. 581\nArgued: May 18, 1959Decided: June 15, 1959\n\n\n\n\n Ohio accords to each person whose conviction of a felony has been affirmed by its Court of Appeals the right to apply to its Supreme Court for leave to appeal, and that Court has jurisdiction to grant such leave and hear such appeals in its discretion. After petitioner's conviction of a felony had been affirmed by the Ohio Court of Appeals, he gave notice of appeal and attempted to file in the Ohio Supreme Court motions for leave to appeal and to proceed in forma pauperis, supported by an affidavit of poverty. These papers were returned to him by the Clerk of the Ohio Supreme Court with a letter advising him, in effect, that the Court had determined on numerous occasions that such papers could not be filed without payment of a docket fee. In this Court, counsel for the State conceded that the Clerk's letter is \"in reality and in effect\" the judgment of the Supreme Court of Ohio. Held:\n\n 1. Since the Ohio Supreme Court had sanctioned its Clerk's well-publicized and uniform practice of returning pauper's applications with form letters such as that used in this case, this amounted to a delegation to the Clerk of a matter involving no discretion, and it sufficed to make the Clerk's letter a \"final judgment\" of Ohio's highest court within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. 1257. Pp. 256-257.\n\n\n 2. Since a person who is not indigent may have the Ohio Supreme Court consider his application for leave to appeal from a felony conviction, denial of the same right to this indigent petitioner solely because he was unable to pay the filing fee violated the Fourteenth Amendment. Griffin v. Illinois, \n351 \nU.S. 12\n. Pp. 257-258.\n\n\n (a) That petitioner had already received one appellate review of his conviction in Ohio does not require a different result, since others similarly situated who could pay the filing fee could have the State's Supreme Court consider their applications for leave to appeal. P. 257. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 252, 253]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n  (b) That the granting of leave to appeal is discretionary with the Ohio Supreme Court in a case such as this does not require a different result, since that Court did not permit petitioner to invoke its discretion. Pp. 257-258.\n\n\n Judgment vacated and cause remanded.\n\nHelen G. Washington (appointed by this Court as counsel for petitioner in this case, \n358 \nU.S. 939\n) argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner.\n\nWilliam M. Vance, Assistant Attorney General of Ohio, and Harry C. Schoettmer argued the cause for respondent. With them on the brief were Mark McElroy, Attorney General of Ohio, and C. Watson Hover.\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe question presented in this case is whether a State may constitutionally require that an indigent defendant in a criminal case pay a filing fee before permitting him to file a motion for leave to appeal in one of its courts.\n\nAfter a trial in Ohio in 1953, the petitioner was convicted of burglary and sentenced to life imprisonment.\n1\n That same year his conviction was affirmed without opinion by the Ohio Court of Appeals. Petitioner immediately filed a notice of appeal in the Court of Appeals but did nothing further until 1957, when he sought to file a copy of the earlier notice of appeal and a motion for leave to appeal in the Supreme Court of Ohio.\n2\n To these papers petitioner attached an affidavit of poverty which declared that he was \"without sufficient funds with which to pay the costs for Docket and Filing Fees in this \n\n[360 \nU.S. 252, 254]\n\u00a0\n cause of action.\" He also attached a motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis.\n\nThe Clerk of the Supreme Court of Ohio refused to file the papers. He returned them with the following letter:\n\n \"This will serve to acknowledge receipt of your motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis, motion for leave to appeal and notice of appeal.\n\n\n \"We must advise that the Supreme Court has determined on numerous occasions that the docket fee, required by Section 1512 of the General Code of Ohio, and the Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court, takes precedence over any other statute which may allow a pauper's affidavit to be filed in lieu of a docket fee. For that reason we cannot honor your request.\n\n\n \"We are returning the above mentioned papers to you herewith.\"\n3\n\u00a0\n\n[360 \nU.S. 252, 255]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Under Art. IV, 2, of the State Constitution, the Supreme Court of Ohio has appellate jurisdiction in many types of cases including those \"involving questions arising under the constitution of the United States or of this state\" and \"cases of felony on leave first obtained.\"\n4\n Since burglary is a felony in Ohio,\n5\n the Supreme Court had jurisdiction to review petitioner's conviction and petitioner sought to file his motion asking leave to appeal.\n6\n The filing fee required by the Supreme Court on a motion for leave to appeal is $20\n7\n and if that fee is paid, and the \n\n[360 \nU.S. 252, 256]\n\u00a0\n papers are otherwise proper, the motion will be considered with the possibility that leave to appeal will be granted.\n\nWe granted certiorari and leave to proceed in forma pauperis. \n358 \nU.S. 919\n. Subsequently, an order was entered, \n358 \nU.S. 943\n, expressly limiting the grant of certiorari to the question posed by petitioner in his pro se petition which is restated at the outset of this opinion.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nThe State's commendable frankness in this case has simplified the issues. It has acknowledged that the clerk's letter to petitioner is \"in reality and in effect\" the judgment of the Supreme Court. Only recently, that court had occasion to comment on the function of its clerk in these words:\n\n \"It is the duty of the clerk of this court, in the absence of instructions from the court to the contrary, to accept for filing any paper presented to him, provided such paper is not scurrilous or obscene, is properly prepared and is accompanied by the requisite filing fee.\"\n9\n\u00a0\n\n\n In a companion case, the court observed that its clerk \"acts as the court in carrying out its instructions.\"\n10\n The State represented that the clerk had been instructed not to docket any papers without fees and also that the Supreme Court had not deviated from its practice in this respect. Moreover, the State asserted that it was impossible for petitioner to file any action at all in the Supreme \n\n[360 \nU.S. 252, 257]\n\u00a0\n Court without paying the fee in advance. There is no showing that these instructions have been modified or rescinded in any way and the Supreme Court has sanctioned the clerk's well-publicized procedure of returning pauper's applications, without exception, with the above-quoted form letter. This delegation to the clerk of a matter involving no discretion clearly suffices to make the clerk's letter a final judgment of Ohio's highest court, as required by 28 U.S.C. 1257.\n\nAlthough the State admits that petitioner \"in truth and in fact\" is a pauper, it presses several arguments which it claims distinguish Griffin v. Illinois, \n351 \nU.S. 12\n, and justify the Ohio practice. First, the State argues that petitioner received one appellate review of his conviction in Ohio, while in Griffin, Illinois had left the defendant without any judicial review of his conviction. This is a distinction without a difference for, as Griffin holds, once the State chooses to establish appellate review in criminal cases, it may not foreclose indigents from access to any phase of that procedure because of their poverty. \n351 \nU.S., at 18\n, 22. This principle is no less applicable where the State has afforded an indigent defendant access to the first phase of its appellate procedure but has effectively foreclosed access to the second phase of that procedure solely because of his indigency.\n\nSince Griffin proceeded upon the assumption that review in the Illinois Supreme Court was a matter of right, \n351 \nU.S., at 13\n, Ohio seeks to distinguish Griffin on the further ground that leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio is a matter of discretion. But this argument misses the crucial significance of Griffin. In Ohio, a defendant who is not indigent may have the Supreme Court consider on the merits his application for leave to appeal from a felony conviction. But as that court has interpreted 1512 and its rules of practice, an indigent defendant is denied that opportunity. There is no \n\n[360 \nU.S. 252, 258]\n\u00a0\n rational basis for assuming that indigents' motions for leave to appeal will be less meritorious than those of other defendants. Indigents must, therefore, have the same opportunities to invoke the discretion of the Supreme Court of Ohio.\n\nThe State's action in this case in some ways is more final and disastrous from the defendant's point of view than was the Griffin situation. At least in Griffin, the defendant might have raised in the Supreme Court any claims that he had that were apparent on the bare record, though trial errors could not be raised. Here, the action of the State has completely barred the petitioner from obtaining any review at all in the Supreme Court of Ohio. The imposition by the State of financial barriers restricting the availability of appellate review for indigent criminal defendants has no place in our heritage of Equal Justice Under Law.\n\nWhat was said in Griffin, might well be said here: \"We are confident that the State will provide corrective rules to meet the problem which this case lays bare.\" \n351 \nU.S., at 20\n.\n11\n\u00a0\n\nThe judgment below is vacated and the cause is remanded to the Supreme Court of Ohio for further action not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE STEWART took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Petitioner was also convicted of larceny and sentenced to a term of seven years to be served concurrently with the burglary sentence.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Despite the passage of years the appeal was timely. State v. Grisafulli, 135 Ohio St. 87, 19 N. E. 2d 645.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court of Ohio obviously referred to in the clerk's letter are Rules VII and XVII.\n\n 1512 (Rev. Code 2503.17):\n\n\"The clerk of the supreme court shall charge and collect the following fees:\n\n\n\"(A) For each case entered upon the minute book, including original actions in said court, appeal proceedings filed as of right, . . . for each motion . . . for leave to file a notice of appeal in criminal cases . . . twenty dollars . . . .\n\n\n\"(B) For filing assignments of error . . . upon allowance of a motion for leave to appeal . . . five dollars . . . .\n\n\n .  .  .   .  .\n\n\"Such fees must be paid to the clerk by the party invoking the action of the court, before the case or motion is docketed and shall be taxed as costs and recovered from the other party, if the party invoking the action succeeds, unless the court otherwise directs.\" Rule VII:\n\n\n\"Section 1. Felony Cases. In felony cases, where leave to appeal is sought, a motion for leave to appeal shall be filed with the Clerk of this Court along with a copy of the notice of appeal which was \n\n[360 \nU.S. 252, 255]\n\u00a0\n filed in the Court of Appeals, upon payment of the docket fee required by Section 2503.17, Revised Code.\n\n.   .  .  .  .\n\n\n\n\"Section 4. Appeal as of Right. In any criminal case, whether felony or misdemeanor, if the notice of appeal shows that the appeal involves a debatable question arising under the Constitution of the United States or of this state, the appeal may be docketed upon filing the transcript of the record and any original papers in the case, upon payment of the fee required by Section 2503.17, Revised Code.\"\n\n\n Rule XVII:\n\n\"The Docket Fees fixed by Section 2503.17, Revised Code, must be paid in advance. . . .\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See also Ohio Rev. Code 2953.02, 2953.08, which implement this constitutional provision.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] See Ohio Rev. Code 2907.09, 1.06, 1.05.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] In his notice of appeal filed in the Court of Appeals, petitioner stated \"This appeal is on questions of law and is taken on condition that a motion for leave to appeal be allowed.\" But in the motion for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court, petitioner stated, among other contentions, that his conviction conflicted with his \"Constitutional Guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment (14) to the Constitution of the United States; and, Article I, Section 10 of the Constitution of the State of Ohio.\" This might indicate that petitioner was claiming an appeal as of right to the Supreme Court. However, since petitioner has consistently characterized his appeal as one which requires leave, we so consider it here.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] See n. 3, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] As posed by petitioner, the question was\n\n\"Whether in a prosecution for Burglary, the Due Process Clause, And The Equal Protection Clause, of the Fourteenth (14) Amendment to the United States Constitution are violated by the refusal of the Supreme Court of Ohio, to file the aforementioned legal proceedings, because Petitioner was unable to secure the costs.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] State ex rel.

E. 2d 108, 109.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] Shortly after this Court's decision in Griffin v. Illinois, supra, the Illinois Supreme Court promulgated Rule 65-1, which provides in part that any person sentenced to imprisonment who is \"without financial means with which to obtain the transcript of the proceedings at his trial\" will receive a transcript if it is \"necessary to present fully the errors recited in the petition. . . .\" \n\n[360 \nU.S. 252, 259]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, whom MR. JUSTICE HARLAN joins, dissenting.\n\nIt is the special obligation of this Court strictly to observe the limits of its jurisdiction. No matter how tempting the appeal of a particular situation, we should not indulge in disregard of the bounds by which Congress has defined our power of appellate review. There will be time enough to enforce the constitutional right, if right it be, which the Court now finds the petitioner to possess when it is duly presented for judicial determination here, and there are ample modes open to the petitioner for assertion of such a claim in a way to require our adjudication.\n\nThe appellate power of this Court to review litigation originating in a state court can come into operation only if the judgment to be reviewed is the final judgment of the highest court of the State. That a judgment is the prerequisite for the appellate review of this Court is an ingredient of the constitutional requirement of the \"Cases\" or \"Controversies\" to which alone \"The judicial Power shall extend.\" U.S. Const., Art. III, 2. That it be a \"final judgment\" was made a prerequisite by the very Act which established this Court in 1789. Act of September 24, 1789, 25, 1 Stat. 85, now 28 U.S.C. 1257. \"Close observance of this limitation upon the Court is not regard for a strangling technicality.\" Republic Natural Gas Co. v. Oklahoma, \n334 \nU.S. 62, 67\n. Such has been the undeviating constitutional, legislative and judicial command binding on this Court and respected by it without exception or qualification to this very day.\n\nThe requisites of such a final judgment are not met by what a state court may deem to be a case or judgment in the exercise of the state court's jurisdiction. See Tyler v. Judges, \n179 \nU.S. 405\n; Doremus v. Board of Education, \n\n[360 \nU.S. 252, 260]\n\u00a0\n \n342 \nU.S. 429\n. Nor can consent of the parties to the determination of a cause by this Court overleap the jurisdictional limitations which are part of this Court's being. Litigants cannot give this Court power which the Constitution and Congress have withheld. Mansfield, C. & L. M. R. Co. v. Swan, \n111 \nU.S. 379, 382\n. The President of the United States himself cannot secure from this Court determination of a legal question except when such a question duly arises in the course of adjudication of a case or controversy, even though he asks for needed help in a great national emergency. See President Washington's questions in 33 Writings of Washington (Fitzpatrick ed. 1940) 15-19, 28, and the correspondence between Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and Chief Justice Jay, in 3 Correspondence and Public Papers of John Jay (Johnston ed. 1891) 486-489.\n\nAs the importance of the interrogator and the significance of the question confer no power upon this Court to render advisory opinions, a compassionate appeal cannot endow it with jurisdiction to review a judgment which is not final. One's sympathy, however deep, with petitioner's claim cannot dispense with the precondition of a final judgment for exercising our judicial power. If the history of this Court teaches one lesson as important as any, it is the regretful consequences of straying off the clear path of its jurisdiction to reach a desired result. This Court cannot justify a yielding to the temptation to cut corners in disregard of what the Constitution and Congress command. Burns has other paths to this Court to assert what, forsooth, all of us may deem a failure by Ohio to accord him - a constitutional right - other paths besides our indifference to the rules by which we are bound. Specifically, he has four obvious remedies for securing an ascertainment and enforcement of his constitutional claim by this Court without having \n\n[360 \nU.S. 252, 261]\n\u00a0\n this Court treat the letter of a clerk of a court as a court's judgment. For although the caption of the case would indicate that our review was of the Supreme Court of Ohio, in fact the review can only be of the refusal of the clerk of that court to docket petitioner's papers until a twenty-dollar docket fee was paid. The Supreme Court of Ohio was not asked to consider the appeal, nor did it itself refuse to do so. The decisions in State ex rel. Dawson v. Roberts, 165 Ohio St. 341, 135 N. E. 2d 409, and State ex rel. Wanamaker v. Miller, 164 Ohio St. 174 and 176, 128 N. E. 2d 108 and 110, mandamus denied sub nom. Wanamaker v. Supreme Court of Ohio, \n350 \nU.S. 881\n, demonstrate conclusively that the Ohio court has retained the ultimate power to determine what papers will be permitted to be filed. There is not the remotest indication in the record that this petitioner's claim to file his appeal without paying the customary filing fee, because of indigence, was brought to the attention of the Ohio Supreme Court, nor is there any showing in the record that in writing his letter the clerk was acting at the specific behest of that court in this case.\n\n(1) Petitioner may make a direct application addressed in terms to the judges of the Supreme Court of Ohio. Such applications informally expressed by way of letters are frequently addressed to this Court, and are accepted here as the basis for judgments by this Court. We are not to assume that an application so addressed to the judges of the Ohio Supreme Court will not be transmitted to that court and acted upon by it. This is not merely an appropriate assumption about the functioning of courts. It is an assumption one can confidently make based upon the records in this Court. See Wanamaker v. Supreme Court of Ohio, supra. (Papers filed here in connection with the Wanamaker case make it clear that the Supreme Court of Ohio does consider letters \n\n[360 \nU.S. 252, 262]\n\u00a0\n asking that that court instruct its clerk to accept petitions for filing.) The Supreme Court of Ohio might well yield to this claim of Burns as other courts in like situations have yielded since Griffin v. Illinois, \n351 \nU.S. 12\n. But in any event, a denial of Burns' application or refusal to entertain it would constitute a judgment of that court as an appropriate prerequisite for review here.\n\n(2) Ever since 13 of the Act of September 24, 1789, 1 Stat. 81, as amended, 28 U.S.C. 1651, this Court has had power to issue mandamus in protection of its appellate jurisdiction in order to avoid frustration of it. This is an exercise of anticipatory review by bringing here directly a case which could be brought to this Court in due course.\n\n(3) Under the Civil Rights Act, R. S. 1979, 42 U.S.C. 1983, Burns, like others before him who have allegedly been denied constitutional rights under color of any statute of a State, may have his constitutional rights determined and, incidentally, secure heavy damages for any denial of constitutional rights. See Lane v. Wilson, \n307 \nU.S. 268\n.\n\n(4) Burns' claim, in essence, is unlawful detention because of a denial of a constitutional right under the Fourteenth Amendment. That lays the foundation for a habeas corpus proceeding in the United States District Court. See Johnson v. Zerbst, \n304 \nU.S. 458\n. To be sure, if the right he claims be recognized in habeas corpus proceedings, he would not be released as a matter of course but merely conditionally on the State Supreme Court's entertaining his petition for review as an indigent incapable of meeting court costs. The contingent nature of the release would not impair the availability of habeas corpus. See Chin Yow v. United States, \n208 \nU.S. 8\n.\n\nThus, it cannot be urged that necessity compels what the Constitution and statutes forbid - adjudication here of a claim which has not been rejected in a final judgment \n\n[360 \nU.S. 252, 263]\n\u00a0\n of a state court. Adherence to the dictates of the laws which govern our jurisdiction, though it may result in postponement of our determination of petitioner's rights, is the best assurance of the vindication of justice under law through the power of the courts. We should dismiss the writ of certiorari inasmuch as there has been no final judgment over which we have appellate power. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 252, 264]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","24":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCAMMARANO v.

JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThese cases, coming to us from two different Circuits, present identical issues, and may appropriately be dealt with together in one opinion. The issues involve the interpretation and validity of Treas. Reg. 111, 29.23 (o)-1 and 29.23 (q)-1 as applied by the courts below to deny deduction as \"ordinary and necessary\" business expenses under 23 (a) (1) (A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939\n1\n to sums expended by the respective taxpayer petitioners in furtherance of publicity programs designed to help secure the defeat of initiative measures then pending before the voters of the States of Washington and Arkansas.\n\nThe Treasury Regulations in question each provides in pertinent part that no deduction shall be allowed to \"sums of money expended for lobbying purposes, the promotion \n\n[358 \nU.S. 498, 500]\n\u00a0\n or defeat of legislation, the exploitation of propaganda, including advertising other than trade advertising . . . .\"\n2\n Both Courts of Appeals held that these provisions render nondeductible sums paid by petitioners to organizations which expended them in extensive publicity programs designed to persuade the voters to cast their ballots against state initiative measures, even though the passage of those measures would have seriously affected, or indeed wholly destroyed, the taxpayers' business - and that so interpreted the Regulations are a valid exercise of the Commissioner's rule-making power. We granted certiorari because of the recurring nature of the question, and because of its importance to the proper administration of the Internal Revenue laws. \n355 \nU.S. 952\n; \n356 \nU.S. 966\n.\n\nA brief review of the facts in the two cases is necessary to an understanding of the issues.\n\nNo. 29: In 1948 petitioners William and Louise Cammarano, husband and wife, jointly owned a one-fourth interest in a partnership engaged in the distribution of beer at wholesale in the State of Washington. The partnership was a member of the Washington Beer Wholesalers Association. In December 1947 the Association had established a trust fund as a repository for assessments collected from its members to help finance a state-wide publicity program urging the defeat of \"Initiative to the Legislature No. 13,\" a measure to be submitted to the electorate at the general election of November 2, 1948, which would have placed the retail sale of wine and beer in Washington exclusively in the hands of the State. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 498, 501]\n\u00a0\n During 1948 petitioners' partnership paid to the trust fund $3,545.15, of which petitioners' pro rata share was $886.29. The trust fund collected a total of $53,500, which was turned over to an Industry Advisory Committee organized by wholesale and retail wine and beer dealers, which in turn expended it as part of contributions totaling $231,257.10 for various kinds of advertising directed to the public, none of which referred to petitioners' wares as such and all of which urged defeat of Initiative No. 13.\n3\n The initiative was defeated.\n\nIn preparing their joint income tax return for 1948, petitioners deducted as a business expense the $886.29 paid to the Association's trust fund as their share of the partnership assessment. The deduction was disallowed by the Commissioner, and petitioners paid under protest the additional sum thus due and sued in the District Court for refund. That court ruled that the payments made to the trust fund were \"expended for . . . the . . . defeat of legislation\" within the meaning of Treas. Reg. 111, 29.23 (o)-1 and were therefore not deductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses under 23 (a) (1) (A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding the Regulation applicable and valid as applied. 246 F.2d 751.\n4\n\u00a0\n\n[358 \nU.S. 498, 502]\n\u00a0\n\n\nNo. 50: Petitioner F. Strauss & Son, Inc., is a corporation engaged in the wholesale liquor business in Arkansas. In 1950 an initiative calling for an election on statewide prohibition was placed on the ballot to be voted on in the state general election on November 7, 1950. In May of that year Strauss, together with eight other Arkansas liquor wholesalers, organized Arkansas Legal Control Associates, Inc., as a means of coordinating their efforts to persuade the voters of Arkansas to vote against the proposed prohibition measure. Between May 30 and November 30, 1950, Arkansas Legal Control Associates collected a total of $126,265.84, which was disbursed for various forms of publicity concerning the proposed Act.\n5\n Strauss' contribution amounted to $9,252.67.\n\nThe initiative measure was defeated in the November election. On its 1950 income tax return Strauss deducted the $9,252.67 as a business expense. The Commissioner disallowed the deduction and Strauss filed a timely petition in the Tax Court seeking a redetermination of the deficiency asserted. That court upheld the action of the Commissioner in disallowing the claimed deduction, and the Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed. 251 F.2d 724.\n\nSince 1918 regulations promulgated by the Commissioner under the Internal Revenue Code have continuously provided that expenditures for the \"promotion or defeat of legislation . . .,\" or for any of the other purposes specified in the \"corporate\" Regulation now before us, are not deductible from gross corporate income; and \n\n[358 \nU.S. 498, 503]\n\u00a0\n since 1938 regulations containing identical language have forbidden such deductions from individual income.\n6\n During this period of more than 40 years these regulatory provisions have been before this Court on only one occasion. In Textile Mills Securities Corp. v. Commissioner, \n314 \nU.S. 326\n, it was held that the Commissioner properly disallowed the deduction of sums paid by a corporation to a publicist and two legal experts employed to help secure the passage of legislation designed to secure the return of certain properties in this country seized during World War I under the provisions of the Trading With the Enemy Act. This holding was squarely based on the regulatory provisions now embodied in Treas. Reg. 111, 29.23 (q)-1, which were found valid and applicable to the facts involved in that case, although the very business \n\n[358 \nU.S. 498, 504]\n\u00a0\n of the taxpayer seeking the deduction was the direction of the publicity program in the course of which the expenditures were made.\n\nPetitioners suggest that Textile Mills is not dispositive of the present cases, either as to the applicability of the Regulations upon the facts disclosed by these records or as to the validity of those Regulations under the statute if they are found to be applicable. Essentially, petitioners' contentions are (1) that the Regulations cannot properly be construed as applicable to expenditures made in connection with efforts to promote or defeat the passage of legislation by persuasion of the general public as opposed to direct influence on legislative bodies, that is \"lobbying\"; (2) that in any case the Regulations are inapplicable to expenditures made in connection with initiative measures; and (3) that if construed as applicable to the facts here presented the Regulations are invalid as contrary to the plain terms of 23 (a) (1) (A) of the 1939 Code and possibly as unconstitutional under the First Amendment.\n\nWe need not be long detained by the question of the applicability of the Regulations to petitioners' expenditures. First, we see no justification for reading into these regulatory provisions the implied exceptions which petitioners would have us there find. We cannot accept petitioners' argument that Textile Mills should be read as limiting such provisions to direct dealings with legislators, insidious or otherwise. The deductions whose propriety was before the Court in that case were for expenditures, characterized by the Court of Appeals as being for \"matters of publicity, `including the making of arrangements for speeches, contacting the press, in respect of editorial comments, and news items,'\" and for the preparation of \"brochures\" involving \"a comprehensive study of the history of the treatment of persons and property in war,\" 117 F.2d 62, 65, 63, all designed to influence \n\n[358 \nU.S. 498, 505]\n\u00a0\n the opinions of the general public.\n7\n Apart from Textile Mills, the Courts of Appeals have uniformly applied these Regulations to expenditures for publicity directed to the general public on legislative matters. See, e. g., Revere Racing Assn. v. Scanlon, 232 F.2d 816 (C. A. 1st Cir.); American Hardware & Eq. Co. v. Commissioner, 202 F.2d 126 (C. A. 4th Cir.); Roberts Dairy Co. v. Commissioner, 195 F.2d 948 (C. A. 8th Cir.); Sunset Scavenger Co. v. Commissioner, 84 F.2d 453 (C. A. 9th Cir.). Petitioners' reading of these Regulations would make all but the reference to \"lobbying\" pure surplusage. We think that the Regulations must be construed to mean what they say - that not only lobbying expenses, but also sums spent for \"the promotion or defeat of legislation, the exploitation of propaganda, including advertising other than trade advertising\" are nondeductible.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nLikewise unpersuasive is petitioners' suggested distinction between expenses incurred in attempting to promote or defeat legislation pending before legislatures and those incurred in furthering or combatting an initiative measure. We think that initiatives are plainly \"legislation\" within the meaning of these Regulations. Had the \n\n[358 \nU.S. 498, 506]\n\u00a0\n measures involved in these cases been passed by the people of Washington and Arkansas they would have had the effect and status of ordinary laws in every respect. The Constitutions of the States of Washington and Arkansas both explicitly recognize that in providing for initiatives they are vesting legislative power in the people.\n9\n Every court which has considered the question has found these provisions to be fully as applicable to initiatives and referendums as to any other kind of legislation. See Revere Racing Assn. v. Scanlon, supra; Old Mission Portland Cement Co. v. Commissioner, 69 F.2d 676, affirmed on other issues, \n293 \nU.S. 289\n; Mosby Hotel Co. v. Commissioner, decided October 22, 1954, P-H 1954 TC Mem. Dec. \u00a7 54,288; McClintock-Trunkey Co. v. Commissioner, 19 T. C. 297, reversed on other issues, 217 F.2d 329 (involving payments, like those of petitioners Cammarano, made to the Washington Beer Wholesalers Association in connection with \"Initiative to the Legislature No. 13\").\n\nA contrary reading of the Regulations would, indeed, be anomalous, for it would mean that expenses of publicity campaigns directed to the public to influence it in turn to persuade its legislative representatives to vote for or against pending bills would be encompassed by the Regulations and denied deductibility, whereas a less-diluted \n\n[358 \nU.S. 498, 507]\n\u00a0\n form of persuasion and influence, directed to the voters as legislators, would be left at large so far as the Regulations are concerned. We see no reason to give so artificial and strained a construction to the pertinent language.\n10\n\u00a0\n\nThe cornerstone of petitioners' argument is that Treas. Reg. 111, 29.23 (o)-1 and 29.23 (q)-1 are invalid if interpreted to apply to the expenditures here at issue. It is contended that sums expended by a taxpayer to preserve his business from destruction are deductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses under the Code as a matter of law, and that therefore a regulation purporting to deny deductibility to such expenditures is plainly contrary to the statute and ipso facto invalid. Petitioners rely upon Commissioner v. Heininger, \n\n[358 \nU.S. 498, 508]\n\u00a0\n \n320 \nU.S. 467\n, where this Court held that attorney's fees incurred by a mail-order dentist in resisting a postal fraud charge which would have ended his business were deductible as an ordinary and necessary business expense.\n\nWe do not think that Heininger governs the present cases, nor that it establishes as broad a rule of law as petitioners suggest. In Heininger this Court held no more than that expenditures without which a business enterprise would inevitably suffer adverse effects, and the granting of deductibility to which would frustrate no \"sharply defined national or state policies,\" \n320 \nU.S., at 473\n (see also Commissioner v. Sullivan, \n356 \nU.S. 27\n), were deductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses under the statute.\n11\n Here the deductions sought are prohibited by Regulations which themselves constitute an expression of a sharply defined national policy, further demonstration of which may be found in other sections of the Internal Revenue Code.\n12\n\u00a0\n\nAs was said in Textile Mills, \"the words `ordinary and necessary' are not so clear and unambiguous in their meaning and application as to leave no room for an interpretative regulation. The numerous cases which have come to this Court on that issue bear witness to that.\" \n314 \nU.S., at 338\n. In the present cases there is before us regulatory language of more than 40 years' continuous duration expressly providing that sums expended for the activities here involved shall not be considered an ordinary and necessary business expense under the statute. The provisions of the Internal Revenue Code which underlie the Regulations have been repeatedly re-enacted by the Congress without the slightest suggestion that the \n\n[358 \nU.S. 498, 509]\n\u00a0\n policy expressed in these regulatory measures does other than precisely conform to its intent.\n13\n\u00a0\n\nIn 1934 the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denied deduction to expenses incurred in connection with a referendum which would, if passed, have increased the taxpayer's business. Old Mission Portland Cement Co. v. Commissioner, supra.\n14\n And in 1936 the same court in Sunset Scavenger Co. v. Commissioner, supra, reversed the Board of Tax Appeals to hold that the regulatory language now before us, through repeated re-enactment by Congress of the underlying legislation, already had acquired the force of law, and applied it to deny deductibility to expenditures made by an incorporated association of garbage collectors for a publicity program directed to the general public urging the defeat of legislation which would have injured the business of the Association's membership. The court recognized that the Board of Tax Appeals had twice previously held similar expenditures deductible so long as not made for an illegal purpose,\n15\n but pointed out that in both of those cases the effect of the Regulation had been entirely disregarded, and that \n\n[358 \nU.S. 498, 510]\n\u00a0\n they were therefore not sound authority. Three years later the Congress, in the face of these decisions, again re-enacted without change in the 1939 Code the \"ordinary and necessary\" business expense section.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that Congress, in its 1954 re-enactment of the Internal Revenue Code, again adopted the \"ordinary and necessary\" provision without substantive change,\n16\n following consistent rulings by the courts subsequent to the 1939 re-enactment holding these Regulations applicable to sums spent in efforts to persuade the general public of the desirability or undesirability of proposed legislation affecting the taxpayer's business. See Textile Mills; American Hardware & Eq. Co. v. Commissioner, supra; Roberts Dairy Co. v. Commissioner, supra; McClintock-Trunkey Co. v. Commissioner, supra. Although the tax years involved in the cases before us are 1948 and 1950, and a 1954 re-enactment of course cannot conclusively demonstrate the propriety of an administrative and judicial interpretation and application as made to transactions occurring before the re-enactment, the 1954 action of Congress is significant as indicating satisfaction with the interpretation consistently given the statute by the Regulations here at issue and in demonstrating its prior intent. Cf. United States v. Stafoff, \n260 \nU.S. 477, 480\n.\n\nUnder these circumstances we think that the Regulations have acquired the force of law. This is not a case where the Government seeks to cloak an interpretative regulation with immunity from judicial examination as to conformity with the statute on which it is based simply because Congress has for some period failed affirmatively to act to change the interpretation which the regulation gives to an otherwise unambiguous statute. Cf. Jones v. Liberty Glass Co., \n332 \nU.S. 524\n. Nor is it a case where \n\n[358 \nU.S. 498, 511]\n\u00a0\n no reliable inference as to Congress' intent can be drawn from re-enactment of a statute because of a conflict between administrative and judicial interpretation of the statute at the time of its re-enactment. Cf. Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co., \n348 \nU.S. 426, 431\n. Here we have unambiguous regulatory language, adopted by the Commissioner in the early days of federal income tax legislation, in continuous existence since that time, and consistently construed and applied by the courts on many occasions to deny deduction of sums expended in efforts to persuade the electorate,\n17\n even when a clear business motive for the expenditure has been demonstrated.\n\nIn these circumstances we consider that what was said in Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. United States, \n288 \nU.S. 269, 273\n, applies here:\n\n \"This action [of Congress in re-enacting a statute] was taken with knowledge of the construction placed upon the section by the official charged with its administration. If the legislative body had considered the Treasury interpretation erroneous it would have amended the section. Its failure so to do requires the conclusion that the regulation was not inconsistent with the intent of the statute [citations] unless, perhaps, the language of the act is unambiguous and the regulation clearly inconsistent with it. [citation].\"\n18\n\u00a0\n\n\n This Court has heretofore recognized that the \"ordinary and necessary\" language of the Code is hardly unambiguous, see Textile Mills Securities Corp. v. Commissioner, \n\n[358 \nU.S. 498, 512]\n\u00a0\n supra, and we cannot say that these Regulations are clearly, or even apparently, inconsistent with it. Cf. Trust of Bingham v. Commissioner, \n325 \nU.S. 365\n.\n\nThe statutory policy is further evidenced by the treatment given by Congress to the tax status of organizations, otherwise qualified for exemption as organized exclusively for \"religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes,\" which engage in activities designed to promote or defeat legislation. As early as 1934 Congress amended the Code expressly to provide that no tax exemption should be given to organizations, otherwise qualifying, a substantial part of the activities of which \"is carrying on propaganda, or otherwise attempting, to influence legislation,\" and that deductibility should be denied to contributions by individuals to such organizations. Revenue Act of 1934, 101 (6), 23 (o) (2), 48 Stat. 700, 690. And a year thereafter, when the Code was for the first time amended to permit corporations to deduct certain contributions not qualifying as \"ordinary and necessary\" business expenses, an identical limitation was imposed. Revenue Act of 1935, 102 (c), 49 Stat. 1016. These limitations, carried over into the 1939 and 1954 Codes,\n19\n made explicit the conclusion derived by Judge Learned Hand in 1930 that \"political agitation as such is outside the statute, however innocent the aim . . . . Controversies of that sort must be conducted without public subvention; the Treasury stands aside from them.\" Slee v. Commissioner, 42 F.2d 184, 185. The Regulations here contested appear to us to be but a further expression of the same sharply defined policy.\n\nPetitioners suggest that if the Regulations are construed to deny them deduction, a substantial constitutional issue under the First Amendment is presented. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 498, 513]\n\u00a0\n They rely upon Speiser v. Randall, \n357 \nU.S. 513\n, where a California statute requiring the taking of a loyalty oath as a condition of property tax exemption was struck down on grounds of procedural due process. This contention, made by neither petitioner below, is without merit. Speiser has no relevance to the cases before us. Petitioners are not being denied a tax deduction because they engage in constitutionally protected activities, but are simply being required to pay for those activities entirely out of their own pockets, as everyone else engaging in similar activities is required to do under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Nondiscriminatory denial of deduction from gross income to sums expended to promote or defeat legislation is plainly not \"`aimed at the suppression of dangerous ideas.'\" \n357 \nU.S., at 519\n. Rather, it appears to us to express a determination by Congress that since purchased publicity can influence the fate of legislation which will affect, directly or indirectly, all in the community, everyone in the community should stand on the same footing as regards its purchase so far as the Treasury of the United States is concerned.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] That section (26 U.S.C. 23 (a) (1) (A)) provides in pertinent part:\n\n\" 23. Deductions from gross income. In computing net income there shall be allowed as deductions:\n\n\n\"(a) Expenses.\n\n\n\"(1) Trade or Business Expenses.\n\n\n\"(A) In General. All the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business . . . .\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Only 29.23 (o)-1, which reads on individuals, is involved as to petitioners Cammarano, and only 29.23 (q)-1, reading on corporations, as to petitioner F. Strauss & Son, Inc. Because the language and effect of the two Regulations are in all relevant respects identical they will be discussed throughout this opinion as if they were one.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] A typical advertisement paid for by the Industry Advisory Committee, signed by \"Men & Women Against Prohibition,\" begins \"We intend to Vote Against Initiative 13 - because it would mean a return to the speakeasy, the bootlegger, the gangster - and, finally, state-wide PROHIBITION! We urge our friends and neighbors to do likewise.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The Court of Appeals alternatively held that judgment in favor of the Commissioner was required by a trial court finding that petitioners Cammarano had failed to show that passage of the initiative would have impaired their partnership's business as a beer distributor. 246 F.2d, at 754. This ground of decision is not strongly defended by the Government in this Court, and on our view of the principles which control it need not be considered.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] A typical advertisement, which ran in all Arkansas daily and weekly newspapers, and which shows as its sponsor \"Arkansas Against Prohibition,\" begins:\n\n\"What Does `One Quart' Prohibition REALLY MEAN? There's nothing like it anywhere . . . it's novel . . . it's unique. But it's sinister . . it's plan to destroy the strictly-regulated alcohol beverage business and to turn that business over to the bootlegger.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Article 143 of Treas. Reg. 33 (1918 ed.) denied deductibility as ordinary and necessary business expenses to corporate expenditures for \"lobbying purposes, the promotion or defeat of legislation, the exploitation of propaganda . . . .\" The prohibition against corporate deduction of such expenditures first appears in its present form in Art. 562 of Treas. Reg. 45 (1919 ed.), promulgated under the Revenue Act of 1918. Thereafter it so appears continuously without change. See Art. 562 of Treas. Reg. 45 (1920 ed.), 62, 65, and 69, promulgated under the Revenue Acts of 1918, 1921, 1924, and 1926, Art. 262 of Treas.

Reg. 103, 111, and 118, respectively, promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.\n\nThe prohibition against individual deductibility of such expenditures first appears in Art. 23 (o)-1 of Treas. Reg. 101, promulgated under the Revenue Act of 1938, and thereafter in 19.23 (o)-1, 29.23 (o)-1, and 39.23 (o)-1 of Treas. Reg. 103, 111, and 118, respectively, promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.\n\nIn the proposed Income Tax Regulations under the 1954 Code the prohibitions are consolidated in 1.162-15.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Petitioners Cammarano suggest that in fact \"lobbying\" was involved in Textile Mills because of the activities of one Mondell whose services had also been engaged by the petitioner there. But the opinion of the Court of Appeals shows that none of the payments made to Mondell were involved in the litigation (see 117 F.2d, at 64), and the opinion of this Court makes no reference to any of Mondell's activities.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Petitioners point to United States v. Rumely, \n345 \nU.S. 41\n, and United States v. Harriss, \n347 \nU.S. 612\n, where this Court interpreted the term \"lobbying\" in a congressional resolution and in the Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act, 2 U.S.C. 261-270, to mean only representations and communications made directly to Congress and its members concerning pending or proposed legislation. These cases do not advance petitioners' cause, since the regulatory provisions here explicitly embrace more than \"lobbying.\" Cf. United States v. Rumely, supra, at 47.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Amendment 7 of the Constitution of the State of Washington provides in pertinent part:\n\n\"Art. 2, Sec. 1. Legislative Powers, Where Vested - The legislative authority of the state of Washington shall be vested in the legislature, consisting of a senate and house of representatives, which shall be called the legislature of the State of Washington, but the people reserve to themselves the power to propose bills, laws, and to enact or reject the same at the polls, independent of the legislature . . . .\"\n\n\n Amendment 7 of the Arkansas Constitution contains a virtually identical provision.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Petitioners place heavy reliance on the Commissioner's acquiescence until 1958 in a 1944 decision of the Tax Court allowing deduction to expenditures - found otherwise to qualify under 23 (a) (1) (A) of the 1939 Code - incurred by a taxpayer in connection with a self-operative amendment to the Missouri Constitution, on the ground that \"no legislation was needed or involved.\" Smith v. Commissioner, 3 T. C. 696. Whether or not under the Regulations here at issue a distinction can rationally be drawn between a popularly enacted constitutional amendment and an initiative, we do not see how the fact that the Tax Court and the Commissioner for a period made such a distinction, compare Smith v. Commissioner, supra, with McClintock-Trunkey Co. v. Commissioner, 19 T. C. 297, reversed on other issues, 217 F.2d 329, helps petitioners' case, as the Commissioner and the Tax Court have been entirely consistent in their position that expenditures connected with initiatives - as in the present cases - are not deductible.\n\nThe Tax Court appears to have modified its view since the Smith case even as to expenditures made in connection with constitutional amendments. See Mosby Hotel Co. v. Commissioner, decided October 22, 1954, P-H 1954 TC Mem. Dec. \u00a7 54,288. And the Commissioner has recently withdrawn his acquiescence in the Smith decision. See Rev. Rul. 58-255, 1958-1 Cum. Bull. 91.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] The Court noted that in judging the issues before it \"we do not have the benefit of an interpretative departmental regulation defining the application of the words `ordinary and necessary' to the particular expenses here involved.\" \n320 \nU.S., at 470\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] See p. 512, post.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] See Note 6, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] The suggestion of petitioners Cammarano that the decision in that case turned on factors of the kind involved in McDonald v. Commissioner, \n323 \nU.S. 57\n, is contradicted by the statement of the Court of Appeals concerning Old Mission in Sunset Scavenger Co. v. Commissioner, 84 F.2d, at 457.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] G. T. Wofford v. Commissioner, 15 B. T. A. 1225; Los Angeles & Salt Lake R. Co. v. Commissioner, 18 B. T. A. 168. Cf. Lucas v. Wofford, 49 F.2d 1027, where a petition by the Commissioner for review of the decision in G. T. Wofford, supra, was denied upon a finding that the expenditures involved were not made \"to secure the passage or defeat of any legislation.\" 49 F.2d, at 1028.\n\nAfter this Court's decision in Textile Mills the Board of Tax Appeals recognized that the Regulation was applicable to expenditure incurred in a \"proper and legal attempt to prevent [business] injury\" by endeavoring to secure the defeat of legislation.

Chrestensen, \n316 \nU.S. 52, 54\n, held that business advertisements and commercial matters\n*\n did not enjoy the protection of the First Amendment, made \n\n[358 \nU.S. 498, 514]\n\u00a0\n applicable to the States by the Fourteenth. The ruling was casual, almost offhand. And it has not survived reflection. That \"freedom of speech or of the press,\" directly guaranteed against encroachment by the Federal Government and safeguarded against state action by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, is not in terms or by implication confined to discourse of a particular kind and nature. It has often been stressed as essential to the exposition and exchange of political ideas, to the expression of philosophical attitudes, to the flowering of the letters. Important as the First Amendment is to all those cultural ends, it has not been restricted to them. Individual or group protests against action which results in monetary injuries are certainly not beyond the reach of the First Amendment, as Thornhill v. Alabama, \n310 \nU.S. 88\n, which placed picketing within the ambit of the First Amendment, teaches. And see Newell v. Local Union, 181 Kan. 898, 182 Kan. 205, 317 P.2d 817, 319 P.2d 171, reversed, \n356 \nU.S. 341\n. A protest against government action that affects a business occupies as high a place. The profit motive should make no difference, for that is an element inherent in the very conception of a press under our system of free enterprise. Those who make their living through exercise of First Amendment rights are no less entitled to its protection than those whose advocacy or promotion is not hitched to a profit motive. We held as much in Follett v. McCormick, \n321 \nU.S. 573\n. And I find it difficult to draw a line between that group and those who in other lines of endeavor advertise their wares by different means. Chief Justice Hughes speaking for the Court in Lovell v. Griffin, \n303 \nU.S. 444, 452\n, defined the First Amendment right with which we now deal in the broadest terms, \"The press in its historic connotation comprehends every sort of publication which affords a vehicle of information and opinion.\" And see Jamison v. Texas, \n318 \nU.S. 413, 416\n; Martin v. Struthers, \n\n[358 \nU.S. 498, 515]\n\u00a0\n \n319 \nU.S. 141, 143\n; Burstyn v. Wilson, \n343 \nU.S. 495, 501\n-502.\n\nIn spite of the overtones of Valentine v. Chrestensen, supra, I find it impossible to say that the owners of the present business who were fighting for their lives in opposing these initiative measures were not exercising First Amendment rights. If Congress had gone so far as to deny all deductions for \"ordinary and necessary business expenses\" if a taxpayer spent money to promote or oppose initiative measures, then it would be placing a penalty on the exercise of First Amendment rights. That was in substance what a State did in Speiser v. Randall, \n357 \nU.S. 513\n. \"To deny an exemption to claimants who engage in certain forms of speech is in effect to penalize them for such speech.\" Id., at 518. Congress, however, has taken no such action here. It has not undertaken to penalize taxpayers for certain types of advocacy; it has merely allowed some, not all, expenses as deductions. Deductions are a matter of grace, not of right. Commissioner v. Sullivan, \n356 \nU.S. 27\n. To hold that this item of expense must be allowed as a deduction would be to give impetus to the view favored in some quarters that First Amendment rights must be protected by tax exemptions. But that proposition savors of the notion that First Amendment rights are somehow not fully realized unless they are subsidized by the State. Such a notion runs counter to our decisions (Grosjean v. American Press Co., \n297 \nU.S. 233, 250\n; Murdock v. Pennsylvania, \n319 \nU.S. 105, 112\n; Follett v. McCormick, supra, at 578), and may indeed conflict with the underlying premise that a complete hands-off policy on the part of government is at times the only course consistent with First Amendment rights. See McCollum v. Board of Education, \n333 \nU.S. 203\n.\n\nWith this addendum, I concur in the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Two decisions prior to the Valentine case approved broad regulation of commercial advertising. Fifth Avenue Coach Co. v. New York, \n221 \nU.S. 467\n, was decided long before Stromberg v. California, \n283 \nU.S. 359\n, extended the application of the First Amendment to the States. In Packer Corp. v. Utah, \n285 \nU.S. 105\n, the First Amendment problem was not raised. The extent to which such advertising could be regulated consistently with the First Amendment (cf. Cantwell v. Connecticut, \n310 \nU.S. 296\n; Martin v. Struthers, \n319 \nU.S. 141\n; Breard v. Alexandria, \n341 \nU.S. 622\n; Roth v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 476\n) has therefore never been authoritatively determined. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 498, 516]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","25":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCASH v. CULVER(1959)\nNo. 91\nArgued: January 22, 1959Decided: February 24, 1959\n\n\n\n\n At a trial in a state court at which he was not represented by counsel, petitioner was convicted of burglary and sentenced to imprisonment for 15 years. No appeal was taken, and the State Supreme Court denied without a hearing a petition for habeas corpus which he filed later and in which he alleged, inter alia, that: He was 20 years old, uneducated and inexperienced in court trials. He was represented by counsel at an earlier trial for the same offense which resulted in a hung jury. He was then placed in solitary confinement, pending a new trial of which he was not notified until the day before it began. Meanwhile, his counsel had withdrawn from the case and his mother had made several unsuccessful attempts to obtain other counsel. At the trial, he was denied both the appointment of counsel for his defense and a continuance to enable him to obtain counsel. His conviction was based largely on the testimony of an alleged accomplice who pleaded guilty and testified for the State - not only regarding the crime for which petitioner was being tried but also regarding other alleged crimes. Held: If petitioner's allegations be true, he was denied the due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment; and it was incumbent on the state courts to determine what the true facts were. Pp. 633-638.\n\n Reversed.\n\nIrwin L. Langbein, acting under appointment by the Court, \n357 \nU.S. 933\n, argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner.\n\nEdward S. Jaffry, Assistant Attorney General of Florida, argued the cause, pro hac vice, by special leave of the Court, for respondent. With him on the brief was Richard W. Ervin, Attorney General.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe petitioner is serving a 15-year prison sentence imposed by a Florida court after conviction by a jury of \n\n[358 \nU.S. 633, 634]\n\u00a0\n burglary.\n1\n He was not represented by counsel at the trial. No appeal was taken, and the Supreme Court of Florida denied without a hearing a petition for habeas corpus which he later filed.\n2\n Certiorari was granted to determine whether the circumstances alleged in the habeas corpus petition make this a case where the denial of counsel's assistance at the trial operated to deprive the defendant of the due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. \n357 \nU.S. 904\n. For reasons to be stated, we hold that this is such a case.\n\nThe record here consists only of the habeas corpus petition and the Florida Supreme Court's bare order of denial. With the case in that posture, the factual allegations of the petition must for present purposes be accepted as true. Hawk v. Olson, \n326 \nU.S. 271, 273\n. Composed in the penitentiary, the petition, like many such documents, is heavily larded with irrelevant innuendoes, unsupported conclusions, and pretentious legalisms. Within its confines, however, are to be found allegations of a chain of events which we now relate.\n\nOn December 6, 1954, the petitioner, an uneducated farm boy of 20, was first tried by a jury on the burglary charge. At the trial he was represented by experienced counsel of his own choice. At the conclusion of the evidence, the jury was unable to agree on a verdict, and a mistrial resulted.\n\nThe petitioner was then immediately placed in solitary confinement, where he remained awaiting retrial. He first learned on the evening of February 20, 1955, that his new trial was to take place the next day. Only a few days earlier he had learned through a prison official that his former lawyer had withdrawn from the case. The \n\n[358 \nU.S. 633, 635]\n\u00a0\n petitioner's mother on his behalf had tried to engage a number of other lawyers to represent him, but they had all refused, telling her that the fee she could offer was inadequate, and the time for preparation too short.\n\nAt the opening of the second trial the petitioner asked the court for a continuance to give him time to employ a new lawyer, or in the alternative that the court appoint counsel for him. In making these requests the petitioner called the trial judge's attention to his youth, his lack of education and courtroom experience, and the sudden withdrawal of prior counsel.\n3\n The requests were denied, and the trial proceeded at once, with the petitioner left to conduct his own defense.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nHis co-defendant, Allen, an alleged accomplice, pleaded guilty and testified for the State. Allen stated, among other things, that he and the petitioner in the company of two others had burglarized stores, stolen a truck, and engaged in a running gun battle with police. He further testified that he (Allen) had \"pulled a $180,000 robbery\" in New Orleans with two of the petitioner's older brothers, \n\n[358 \nU.S. 633, 636]\n\u00a0\n in which the petitioner had taken no part, and that one of these brothers had also participated in the crime for which the petitioner was on trial. Physical evidence was introduced, including a revolver stolen from the store the petitioner was charged with burglarizing, which had been found in Allen's possession. No evidence in the case except Allen's testimony connected Allen and the petitioner. It is not clear what, if any, objections were made to Allen's testimony, or whether he was cross-examined.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nOn conviction, the petitioner, a first offender, was sentenced to the 15-year prison term he is now serving. Allen, an ex-convict, was sentenced to 10 years, but placed on probation. No charges were brought against the petitioner's brother or the fourth person named by Allen as a participant in the crime for which the petitioner was convicted.\n\nIn the 17 years that have passed since its decision in Betts v. Brady, \n316 \nU.S. 455\n, this Court, by a traditional process of inclusion and exclusion has, in a series of decisions, indicated the factors which may render state criminal proceedings without counsel so apt to result in injustice as to violate the Fourteenth Amendment.\n6\n The \n\n[358 \nU.S. 633, 637]\n\u00a0\n alleged circumstances of the present case so clearly make it one where, under these decisions, federal organic law required the assistance of counsel that it is unnecessary here to explore the outer limits of constitutional protection in this area.\n\n\"Where the gravity of the crime and other factors - such as the age and education of the defendant, the conduct of the court or the prosecuting officials, and the complicated nature of the offense charged and the possible defenses thereto - render criminal proceedings without counsel so apt to result in injustice as to be fundamentally unfair,\" the Constitution requires that the accused must have legal assistance at his trial. Uveges v. Pennsylvania, \n335 \nU.S. 437, 441\n. Of particular relevance here are the decisions of the Court which have held the appointment of counsel necessary to a fair trial because of the complexity of the proceedings. Rice v. Olson, \n324 \nU.S. 786\n; Gibbs v. Burke, \n337 \nU.S. 773\n; and see Williams v. Kaiser, \n323 \nU.S. 471, 475\n-476.\n\n\n All that stood between the petitioner and a verdict of acquittal was the testimony of Allen - an admitted accomplice. Although Florida law does not require corroboration of an accomplice's testimony to sustain a conviction, Land v. State, 59 So.2d 370, the defendant has a right to demand that the trial judge instruct the jury that the \"evidence of an accomplice should be received by the jury with great caution.\" Varnum v. State, 137 Fla. 438, 449, 188 So. 346, 351. The Florida decisions also establish the right to cross-examine an accomplice witness as to whether he is testifying under an agreement for leniency, and even \n\n[358 \nU.S. 633, 638]\n\u00a0\n as to whether he believes that his testimony will be in his best interest. Leavine v. State, 109 Fla. 447, 147 So. 897; Henderson v. State, 135 Fla. 548, 555, 185 So. 625, 627 (concurring opinion). A layman would hardly be familiar with these rights.\n\nMoreover, Allen's testimony concerning the petitioner's commission of other crimes and the commission of a crime by the petitioner's brother, who allegedly also participated in the burglary which was the subject of the trial, if not inadmissible in its entirety, certainly raised serious questions under Florida law. As the Florida Supreme Court has recently noted. \"There are literally thousands of cases in this country discussing the admission of such evidence.\" Padgett v. State, 53 So.2d 106, 108. The problems which this testimony raised were thus beyond the ken of a layman, and it was clearly the kind of testimony that could seriously damage a defendant in the eyes of a jury. Finally, the transcript of the petitioner's previous trial would have offered a lawyer opportunities for impeachment of prosecution witnesses, opportunities of which we cannot assume that a layman would be aware.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nFor these reasons, the requirements of due process made necessary the assistance of a lawyer if the circumstances alleged in the habeas corpus petition are true. On the present record there is no way to test their truth. But the allegations themselves made it incumbent upon the Florida courts to determine what the true facts were.\n8\n\u00a0\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] A noncapital offense in Florida, punishable in this case by a maximum prison term of 20 years. Fla. Stat., 1955, 810.01.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The petition was originally filed in that court in accordance with state procedure explained in Sneed v. Mayo, 66 So.2d 865, 874.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] On this point the allegations of the petition are as follows: \"Petitioner explained to the Court that he was not capable of representing himself, that he was only 20 years of age and was uneducated and had never heard a court trial except the one time he was tried on the same charge, and then he was represented by Mr. Carr, and that he did not know court procedure or how to conduct his defense, and told the court he had been closely confined in solitary at the Florida State Prison at Raiford, up until the night before, and therefore he had no opportunity to employ new counsel, since the Court had permitted his chosen counsel to abandon him in the face of trial, and it was an absolute necessity that the court grant a continuance, or, in the alternative, for the court to remedy the situation by appointing counsel to represent the petitioner.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Under Florida law a trial court has an absolute duty to provide counsel only for an indigent defendant on trial for a capital offense. Sneed v. Mayo, 66 So.2d 865, 872; Johnson v. Mayo, 158 Fla. 264, 28 So.2d 585; Fla. Stat., 1955, 909.21.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The habeas corpus petition incorporates, among other things, excerpts from a newspaper account of the trial, a form of pleading to which the Florida Attorney General makes no objection in the present case. An excerpt from this newspaper account reads as follows: \"While making objections and inquiring of the Judge and witnesses, Cash appeared unsure of himself. On several occasions he would start a sentence, then stop to rephrase it or start on another subject. Before making objections Cash raised his hand to attract the attention of the Judge, then in a halting manner would make his statement.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] See Rice v.

ACKER(1959)\nNo. 13\nArgued: October 19, 1959Decided: November 16, 1959\n\n\n\n\n Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, the failure of a taxpayer, without reasonable cause, to file a declaration of estimated income tax, as required by 58, subjects him to the addition to the tax prescribed by 294 (d) (1) (A) for failure to file the declaration; but it does not subject him also to the addition to the tax prescribed by 294 (d) (2) for the filing of a \"substantial underestimate\" of his tax. Pp. 87-94. 258 F.2d 568, affirmed.\n\nRalph S. Spritzer argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Rice and Robert N. Anderson.\n\nFred N. Acker, respondent, argued the cause and filed a brief pro se.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case presents the question whether, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, the failure of a taxpayer to file a declaration of estimated income tax, as required by 58,\n1\n not only subjects him to the addition to the tax \n\n[361 \nU.S. 87, 88]\n\u00a0\n prescribed by 294 (d) (1) (A) for failure to file the declaration, but also subjects him to the further addition to the tax prescribed by 294 (d) (2) for the filing of a \"substantial underestimate\" of his tax.\n\nSection 294 (d) (1) (A) provides, in substance, that if a taxpayer fails to make and file \"a declaration of estimated tax,\" within the time prescribed, there shall be added to the tax an amount equal to 5% of each installment due and unpaid, plus 1% of such unpaid installments for each month except the first, not exceeding an aggregate of 10% of such unpaid installments.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nSection 294 (d) (2), in pertinent part, provides:\n\n \"(2) Substantial underestimate of estimated tax.\n\n\n \"If 80 per centum of the tax (determined without  regard to the credits under sections 32 and 35) . . .  exceeds the estimated tax (increased by such credits),  there shall be added to the tax an amount equal to \n\n[361 \nU.S. 87, 89]\n\u00a0\n  such excess, or equal to 6 per centum of the amount  by which such tax so determined exceeds the estimated  tax so increased, whichever is the lesser. . . .\"  26 U.S.C. (1952 ed.) 294 (d) (2).\n\n\n Section 29.294-1 (b) (3) (A) of Treasury Regulation 111, promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, contains the statement that:\n\n \"In the event of a failure to file the required  declaration, the amount of the estimated tax for the  purposes of [ 294 (d) (2)] is zero.\"\n\n\n Respondent, without reasonable cause, failed to file a declaration of his estimated income tax for any of the years 1947 through 1950. The Commissioner imposed an addition to the tax for each of those years under 294 (d) (1) (A) for failure to file the declaration, and also imposed a further addition to the tax for each of those years under 294 (d) (2) for a \"substantial underestimate\" of the tax. The Tax Court sustained the Commissioner's imposition of both additions. The Court of Appeals affirmed with respect to the addition imposed for failure to file the declaration, but reversed with respect to the addition imposed for substantial underestimation of the tax, holding that 294 (d) (2) does not authorize the treatment of a taxpayer's failure to file a declaration of estimated tax as the equivalent of a declaration estimating no tax, and that the regulation, which purports to do so, is not supported by the statute and is invalid. 258 F.2d 568. Because of a conflict among the circuits\n3\n we \n\n[361 \nU.S. 87, 90]\n\u00a0\n granted the Commissioner's petition for certiorari. \n358 \nU.S. 940\n.\n\nThe first and primary question that we must decide is whether there is any expressed or necessarily implied provision or language in 294 (d) (2) which authorizes the \n\n[361 \nU.S. 87, 91]\n\u00a0\n treatment of a taxpayer's failure to file a declaration of estimated tax as, or the equivalent of, a declaration estimating his tax to be zero.\n\nWe are here concerned with a taxing Act which imposes a penalty.\n4\n The law is settled that \"penal statutes are to be construed strictly,\" Federal Communications Comm'n v. American Broadcasting Co., \n347 \nU.S. 284, 296\n, and that one \"is not to be subjected to a penalty unless the words of the statute plainly impose it,\" Keppel v. Tiffin Savings Bank, \n197 \nU.S. 356, 362\n. See, e. g., Tiffany v. National Bank of Missouri, 18 Wall. 409, 410; Elliott v. Railroad Co., \n99 \nU.S. 573, 576\n.\n\nViewing 294 (d) (2) in the light of this rule, we fail to find any expressed or necessarily implied provision or language that purports to authorize the treatment of a taxpayer's failure to file a declaration of estimated tax as, or the equivalent of, a declaration estimating his tax to be zero. This section contains no words or language \n\n[361 \nU.S. 87, 92]\n\u00a0\n to that effect, and its implications look the other way. By twice mentioning, and predicating its application upon, \"the estimated tax\" the section seems necessarily to contemplate, and to apply only to, cases in which a declaration of \"the estimated tax\" has been made and filed. The fact that the section contains no basis or means for the computation of any addition to the tax in a case where no declaration has been filed would seem to settle the point beyond all controversy. If the section had in any appropriate words conveyed the thought expressed by the regulation it would thereby have clearly authorized the Commissioner to treat the taxpayer's failure to file a declaration as the equivalent of a declaration estimating his tax at zero and, hence, as constituting a \"substantial underestimate\" of his tax. But the section contains nothing to that effect, and, therefore, to uphold this addition to the tax would be to hold that it may be imposed by regulation, which, of course, the law does not permit. United States v. Calamaro, \n354 \nU.S. 351, 359\n; Koshland v. Helvering, \n298 \nU.S. 441, 446\n-447; Manhattan Co. v. Commissioner, \n297 \nU.S. 129, 134\n.\n\nThe Commissioner points to the fact that both the Senate Report\n5\n which accompanied the bill that became the Current Tax Payment Act of 1943,\n6\n and the Conference Report\n7\n relating to that bill, contained the statement which was later embodied in the regulation. He then argues that by reading 294 (d) (2) in connection with that statement in those reports it becomes evident \n\n[361 \nU.S. 87, 93]\n\u00a0\n that Congress intended by 294 (d) (2) to treat the failure to file a declaration as the equivalent of a declaration estimating no tax. He urges us to give effect to the congressional intention which he thinks is thus disclosed. However, these reports pertained to the forerunner of the section with which we are now confronted, and not to that section itself. Bearing in mind that we are here concerned with an attempt to justify the imposition of a second penalty for the same omission for which Congress has specifically provided a separate and very substantial penalty, we cannot say that the legislative history of the initial enactment is so persuasive as to overcome the language of 294 (d) (2) which seems clearly to contemplate the filing of an estimate before there can be an underestimate.\n\nThe Commissioner next argues that the fact that Congress, with knowledge of the regulation, several times amended the 1939 Code but left 294 (d) (2) unchanged, shows that Congress approved the regulation, and that we should accordingly hold it to be valid. This argument is not persuasive, for it must be presumed that Congress also knew that the courts, except the Tax Court, had almost uniformly held that 294 (d) (2) does not authorize an addition to the tax in a case where no declaration has been filed, and that the regulation is invalid.\n8\n But the point is immaterial, for Congress could not add to or expand this statute by impliedly approving the regulation.\n\nThese considerations compel us to conclude that 294 (d) (2) does not authorize the treatment of a taxpayer's failure to file a declaration of estimated tax as the equivalent of a declaration estimating his tax to be zero. The questioned regulation must therefore be regarded \"as \n\n[361 \nU.S. 87, 94]\n\u00a0\n no more than an attempted addition to the statute of something which is not there.\" United States v. Calamaro, supra, \n354 \nU.S., at 359\n.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 58, as amended, provides, in pertinent part, that: \"Every individual . . . shall, at the time prescribed in subsection (d), make a declaration of his estimated tax for the taxable year if [his gross income from wages or other sources can reasonably be expected to exceed stated sums, showing] the amount which he estimates as the amount of tax under this chapter for the taxable year, without regard to any credits under Sections 32 and 35 for taxes withheld at source . . .; the amount which he estimates as \n\n[361 \nU.S. 87, 88]\n\u00a0\n [such] credits . . .; and [that] the excess of the [estimated tax] over the [estimated credits] shall be considered the estimated tax for the taxable year.\" 26 U.S.C. (1952 ed.) 58.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 294 (d) (1) (A), as amended, provides, in pertinent part, that: \"(A) Failure to file declaration. \"In the case of a failure to make and file a declaration of estimated tax within the time prescribed . . . there shall be added to the tax 5 per centum of each installment due but unpaid, and in addition, with respect to each such installment due but unpaid, 1 per centum of the unpaid amount thereof for each month (except the first) or fraction thereof during which such amount remains unpaid. In no event shall the aggregate addition to the tax under this subparagraph with respect to any installment due but unpaid, exceed 10 per centum of the unpaid portion of such installment. For the purposes of this subparagraph the amount and due date of each installment shall be the same as if a declaration had been filed within the time prescribed showing an estimated tax equal to the correct tax reduced by the credits under sections 32 and 35.\" 26 U.S.C. (1952 ed.) 294 (d) (1) (A).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] After the Sixth Circuit had delivered its opinion in this case but before it had decided the Commissioner's petition for rehearing, the Third Circuit, in Abbott v. Commissioner, 258 F.2d 537, and the Fifth Circuit, in Patchen v. Commissioner, 258 F.2d 544, held that the failure of a taxpayer to file a declaration of estimated tax subjected him not only to the \"addition to the tax\" imposed by \n\n[361 \nU.S. 87, 90]\n\u00a0\n 294 (d) (1) (A) for failure to file a declaration, but also to the \"addition to the tax\" imposed by 294 (d) (2) for a \"substantial underestimate\" of his tax. Less than two months earlier, the Ninth Circuit, too, had so held in Hansen v. Commissioner, 258 F.2d 585. From the beginning of litigation involving the question here presented, a large majority of the published opinions of the District Courts have held that 294 (d) (2) does not authorize the treatment of a taxpayer's failure to file any declaration at all as the equivalent of a declaration estimating his tax to be zero, and that the regulation attempts to amend and extend the statute and is therefore invalid. See, e. g., United States v. Ridley, 120 F. Supp. 530, 538; United States v. Ridley, 127 F. Supp. 3, 11; Owen v. United States, 134 F. Supp. 31, 39, modified on another point sub nom. Knop v. United States, 234 F.2d 760; Powell v. Granquist, 146 F. Supp. 308, 312, aff'd, 252 F.2d 56; Hodgkinson v. United States, 57-1 U.S. T. C. \u00a7 9294; Jones v. Wood, 151 F. Supp. 678; Glass v.

C. \u00a7 9732, aff'd, 253 F.2d 26; Barnwell v. United States, 164 F. Supp. 430. Three District Court opinions have held the other way, Palmisano v. United States, 159 F. Supp. 98; Farrow v. United States, 150 F. Supp. 581; and Peterson v. United States, 141 F. Supp. 382; and the Tax Court has consistently so held. See, e. g., Buckley v. Commissioner, 29 T. C. 455; Garsaud v. Commissioner, 28 T. C. 1086, 1090. The 1954 Internal Revenue Code has eliminated the question here presented as respects taxable years beginning after January 1, 1955, by providing for a single addition to the tax of 6% of the amount of underpayment, whether for failure to file a declaration of estimated tax or timely to pay the quarterly installments or for a substantial underestimation of the tax. 26 U.S.C. (1952 ed., Supp. V) 6654. But the question is still a live one because of the pendency of a substantial number of cases which arose under and are governed by the 1939 Code.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Although the Commissioner concedes that the addition to the tax imposed by 294 (d) (1) (A) for failure to file a declaration of estimated tax is a penalty, he contends that the addition to the tax imposed by 294 (d) (2) for substantial underestimation of the tax may not be so regarded. He attempts to support a distinction upon the ground that the amount of the addition imposed by 294 (d) (1) (A) of 5%, plus 1% per month of unpaid installments, not exceeding an aggregate of 10% of such unpaid installments, does not represent a normal interest rate, whereas, he argues, the addition of the maximum of 6% that may be imposed under 294 (d) (2) is a normal interest rate and should not be regarded as a penalty but as interest to compensate the Government for delayed payment. We think this argument is unsound, for both of the additions are imposed for the breach of statutory duty, and both are characterized by the same language. Each is stated in the respective sections to be an \"addition to the tax\" itself; and, being such, it cannot be interest. Moreover, being \"addition[s] to the tax,\" both additions are themselves as subject to statutory interest as the remainder of the tax. 26 U.S.C. (1952 ed.) 292 (a).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] S. Rep.

JUSTICE HARLAN join, dissenting.\n\nEnglish courts would decide the case as it is being decided here. They would do so because English courts do not recognize the relevance of legislative explanations of the meaning of a statute made in the course of its enactment. If Parliament desires to put a gloss on the meaning of ordinary language, it must incorporate it in the text of legislation. See Plucknett, A Concise History of the Common Law (5th ed.), 330-336; Amos, The Interpretation of Statutes, 5 Camb. L. J. 163; Davies, The Interpretation of Statutes, 35 Col. L. Rev. 519; Lord Haldane in Viscountess Rhondda's Claim, 1922. 2 A. C. 339, 383-384. Quite otherwise has been the process of statutory construction practiced by this Court over the decades in scores and scores of cases. Congress can be the glossator of the words it legislatively uses either by writing its desired meaning, however odd, into the text of its enactment, or by a contemporaneously authoritative explanation accompanying a statute. The most authoritative form of such explanation is a congressional report defining the scope and meaning of proposed legislation. The most authoritative report is a Conference Report acted upon by both Houses and therefore unequivocally representing the will of both Houses as the joint legislative body.\n\nNo doubt to find failure to file a declaration of estimated income to be a \"substantial underestimate\" would be to attribute to Congress a most unlikely meaning for that phrase in 294 (d) (2) simpliciter. But if Congress chooses by appropriate means for expressing its \n\n[361 \nU.S. 87, 95]\n\u00a0\n purpose to use language with an unlikely and even odd meaning, it is not for this Court to frustrate its purpose. The Court's task is to construe not English but congressional English. Our problem is not what do ordinary English words mean, but what did Congress mean them to mean. \"It is said that when the meaning of language is plain we are not to resort to evidence in order to raise doubts. That is rather an axiom of experience than a rule of law, and does not preclude consideration of persuasive evidence if it exists.\" Boston Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 41, 48\n.\n\nHere we have the most persuasive kind of evidence that Congress did not mean the language in controversy, however plain it may be to the ordinary user of English, to have the ordinary meaning. These provisions were first enacted in the Current Tax Payment Act of 1943, c. 120, 57 Stat. 126, as additions to 294 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. The Conference Report, H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 510, p. 56, and the Senate Report, S. Rep. No. 221, p. 42, both gave the provision dealing with substantial underestimation of taxes the following gloss:\n\n \"In the event of a failure to file any declaration  where one is due, the amount of the estimated tax  for the purposes of this provision will be zero.\"\n\n\n The revision of the section eight months later by the Revenue Act of 1943, c. 63, 58 Stat. 21, did not affect its substance, and this provision, therefore, continued to carry the original gloss. While the Court adverts to this congressional definition, it disregards its controlling significance.\n*\n\u00a0\n\n[361 \nU.S. 87, 96]\n\u00a0\n\n\nI agree with the construction placed upon the provision by the Third, Fifth, and Ninth Circuits. Abbott v. Commissioner, 258 F.2d 537 (C. A. 3d Cir. 1958); Patchen v. Commissioner, 258 F.2d 544 (C. A. 5th Cir. 1958); Hansen v. Commissioner, 258 F.2d 585 (C. A. 9th Cir. 1958).\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] The essential reliance of the Court is on its characterization of 294 (d) (2) as a penalty. No adequate justification for this exists. Section 294 (d) (2) on its face indicates that it is in the nature of \n\n[361 \nU.S. 87, 96]\n\u00a0\n an interest charge, designed to compensate the Treasury for delay in receipt of funds which a reasonably accurate estimate would have disclosed to be due and owing. Significantly, this charge is imposed regardless of fault, while 294 (d) (1) (A), a true penalty provision, authorizes no addition to tax when the failure to file is shown \"to be due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.\" Had taxpayer here had reasonable cause for failure to file, the 10% addition under 294 (d) (1) (A) could not have been imposed. Yet taxes would have been withheld by him pending the filing of a final return for the year. Section 294 (d) (2) provides the Government a definite means for ascertaining the compensation for this loss of funds. \n\n[361 \nU.S. 87, 97]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","31":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOMMISSIONER v.

Obligations of purchasers for deferred payments on instalment sales are discounted or sold by them to finance companies, which pay the dealers most of the amounts in cash but credit to each dealer in a \"reserve account\" a small percentage thereof, which is retained by the finance company to secure performance of the dealer's obligations under his guaranties or endorsements.

JUSTICE WHITTAKER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThese federal income tax cases present questions concerning the proper and timely accrual of gross income deriving from sales of commercial installment paper by retail dealers to finance companies. The taxpayers involved in these cases are two retail automobile dealers and a house trailer dealer. All keep their books on the accrual \n\n[360 \nU.S. 446, 448]\n\u00a0\n basis. Most of their sales are \"credit sales.\" It appears that they generally negotiate, consummate, and finance such sales in accordance with a common pattern. The dealer and his customer agree upon a \"Cash Delivered Price\" for a particular vehicle owned by the dealer. In part payment of that price the customer makes a down payment to the dealer in cash or \"trade in,\" or both. To the remaining balance of that cash price there is added the cost of insurance on the vehicle and a \"finance charge.\" The aggregate is sometimes called the \"Deferred Balance.\" It is evidenced and secured by an assignable or negotiable instrument retaining defeasible title to or a lien on the vehicle - generally on a form supplied by the finance company with which the dealer may then be doing business - and the instrument is signed by the customer, delivered to the dealer, and made payable to him in monthly installments over an agreed period - one to three years on automobiles and three to five years on house trailers. Thereupon, the dealer delivers the vehicle to his customer, with such memoranda or bill of sale as will enable him to register, license and use it.\n\nSoon after completion of these procedures, these dealers sell (discount) those instruments (hereafter called \"installment paper\") to finance companies for an agreed or formula fixed price, and the dealers guarantee payment, in whole or in part, of the installment paper.\n\nUnder contracts between the respective dealers and finance companies here concerned, the latter, upon receipt and acceptance of installment paper, are obligated to pay immediately to the dealers a major percentage of the purchase price, but they are thereby also authorized to retain the remaining percentage of the price and to credit it on their books to a \"Dealers Reserve Account\" in the name of the particular dealer, for the purpose of securing performance by him of his guarantor, endorser, and other liabilities to the finance company. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 446, 449]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe dealers involved in these cases recorded on their books in the years the installment paper was sold, and included in their income tax returns for those years, the cash received from the finance companies, but they did not accrue on their books or include in their returns the percentage of the price that was retained by the finance companies and credited to their reserve accounts.\n\nThe Commissioner contends that in the year of their sales of installment paper to the finance companies, the taxpayers acquired a fixed right to receive - even though not until a later year - the percentage of the purchase money that was retained by the finance companies and credited on their books to the dealers' reserve accounts in that year, and, hence, those amounts constituted accrued income to the taxpayers in that year, and should have been accrued on their books and included in their returns for that year. The taxpayers, on the other hand, contend that the amounts so retained and credited were never under or subject to their control, and were always subject to such contingent liabilities of the taxpayers to the finance companies that it could not have been known, in the year of the sales, how much, if any, of the reserves would actually be received by them in cash, and hence they did not acquire, in the year of any of the sales, a fixed right to receive - in a later year or at any time - the amounts credited to them in the reserves, and, therefore, the reserves did not constitute accrued income to them. This presents, in essence, the issue for decision in these cases.\n\nOn the grounds stated, the Commissioner proposed assessment of income tax deficiencies for certain years against the respective taxpayers here involved. The taxpayers each petitioned the Tax Court for a redetermination. After hearings, the Tax Court sustained the Commissioner in each case. The taxpayers petitioned for review. In No. 380, the Hansen case, the Ninth Circuit \n\n[360 \nU.S. 446, 450]\n\u00a0\n reversed, 258 F.2d 585; in No. 381, the Glover case, the Eighth Circuit reversed, 253 F.2d 735; and in No. 512, the Baird case, the Seventh Circuit affirmed, 256 F.2d 918. Because of an asserted conflict between those circuits in these cases, and between other circuits on the question involved,\n1\n and because of the importance of the question to the proper administration of the revenue laws, we granted certiorari in all three cases.\n\nInasmuch as these cases turn on the same issue, and the Hansen and Glover cases were consolidated for argument and argued together in this Court, and the Baird case was argued immediately following, it will be convenient to decide the three cases in one opinion. Although the relevant facts in the three cases are very similar and follow the pattern just explained, there are variations which we think should be set forth.\n\nRespondents in No. 380, John R. Hansen and Shirley G. Hansen, are husband and wife and filed joint federal income tax returns for the taxable years 1951, 1952 and 1953 here involved. During those years, John R. Hansen (\"taxpayer\"), was a motorcar dealer in Bellevue, Washington, \n\n[360 \nU.S. 446, 451]\n\u00a0\n and kept his books on the accrual basis. He frequently sold automobiles on \"time payments.\" The taxpayer was not bound by any contract to sell his installment paper, but because of his needs for operating capital he consistently sold it to General Motors Acceptance Corporation (\"GMAC\").\n\nAlthough before selling installment paper to GMAC the taxpayer did not have an express contract with that company concerning the terms and conditions of such sales and purchases, he had received its manual covering its policies on those subjects and apparently acted under them. That manual was not put in evidence, but it is intimated in the evidence and findings and stated in the briefs, without contradiction, that it contained provisions to the effect that upon receipt and acceptance of a duly assigned conditional sale contract guaranteed by the dealer, GMAC would pay to the dealer the major percentage (not specified in the evidence or findings) of the agreed price therefor, but would retain the remaining percentage of the price and credit the same on its books to a \"Dealers Reserve Account\" in the name of the dealer, as security for performance of his obligations to GMAC under his guaranty of payment of the installment paper and for the payment of any other obligation which he might incur to GMAC. Once in each year GMAC would remit to the dealer so much of his accumulated reserve as exceeded 5% of the then aggregate unpaid balances on installment paper which GMAC had purchased from the dealer.\n\nUpon negotiating a time sale of an automobile and receiving the down payment and any other sum immediately payable, the taxpayer prepared, on forms supplied by GMAC, a conditional sale contract setting forth a compilation of the figures, including insurance and a finance charge, involved in the time sale and concluding with a statement of the \"Time (Deferred) Balance\" which was \n\n[360 \nU.S. 446, 452]\n\u00a0\n payable at the office of GMAC in fixed monthly installments. When the customer signed and delivered to the taxpayer the conditional sale contract, the automobile was delivered to the customer and, as recited in that contract, he acknowledged \"delivery and acceptance of [it] in good order.\"\n2\n\u00a0\n\nIt was the taxpayer's consistent practice immediately thereafter to assign the conditional sale contract (and guarantee its payment) to GMAC by executing the form of assignment printed at the foot of the form and forwarding it to GMAC for purchase.\n3\n Upon receipt and acceptance \n\n[360 \nU.S. 446, 453]\n\u00a0\n of the conditional sale contract and assignment, GMAC remitted to the taxpayer the major percentage of the price it was to pay therefor, but retained the remaining percentage and credited it on its books to a \"Dealers Reserve Account\" in the name of the taxpayer, for the purpose of securing performance by him of his obligations to GMAC.\n\nThe taxpayer recorded on his books in the year such installment paper was sold, and included in his income tax return for that year, the cash received from GMAC, but he did not accrue on his books, or include in his return, the percentage of the price that was retained by GMAC and credited to his reserve account.\n\nThe Commissioner proposed the assessment of deficiencies in income taxes against the taxpayer and his wife for the years involved upon the grounds earlier stated. The taxpayer sought a redetermination in the Tax Court which, after hearing, sustained the Commissioner, but on taxpayer's petition for review the Ninth Circuit reversed, 258 F.2d 585, and we granted certiorari for the reasons already stated, \n358 \nU.S. 879\n.\n\nRespondent in No. 381, Burl P. Glover (\"taxpayer\"), during the years 1949, 1950 and 1951 here involved, was a motorcar dealer in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, and kept his books and filed his income tax returns on a calendar year accrual basis. He frequently sold automobiles on time payments, the unpaid balance of the purchase price of each automobile, including insurance and a finance charge, being evidenced by the customer's promissory note payable to the dealer, or his order, in monthly installments over a fixed period, and secured by a chattel mortgage on the automobile.\n\nBefore the note and mortgage sales transactions here involved, the taxpayer signed a letter addressed to Universal C. I. T. Credit Corporation (obviously written on a form prepared by the addressee) proposing to sell to \n\n[360 \nU.S. 446, 454]\n\u00a0\n Universal C. I. T. Credit Corporation (\"C. I. T.\") such of his notes and mortgages as he chose to sell and as were \"acceptable to\" C. I. T., and agreeing, among other things, to endorse with \"full recourse\" certain of the notes accepted and purchased by C. I. T., and to purchase from C. I. T. any automobile that it repossessed or recovered under a note and mortgage bought from him, at a cash price, payable on demand, equal to the then unpaid balance of the note and mortgage, or, failing in that obligation, to pay to C. I. T. the amount of any loss incurred by it in selling such repossessed automobile. The letter also stated that the provisions for \"reserves as outlined in [C. I. T.'s] reserve arrangement effective at the time paper [was] purchased by [it],\" would apply to such sales,\n4\n and that 3 times in each 12-month period, if the dealer was not then indebted to C. I. T., the latter would pay to the dealer so much of his reserves as exceeded 3% of the then aggregate unpaid balances on paper purchased from the dealer.\n5\n\u00a0\n\n[360 \nU.S. 446, 455]\n\u00a0\n\n\nUpon consummating a time sale of an automobile with his customer in the manner stated, the taxpayer delivered the automobile to his customer, along with a bill of sale, subject to the mortgage, which enabled the customer to register, license and use it.\n\nSoon afterward the taxpayer, pursuant to his letter to C. I. T. just referred to, endorsed the note (and assigned the mortgage) to C. I. T., in some cases without recourse and in others with full recourse, and forwarded the same to C. I. T. for purchase. Upon receipt and acceptance of the note and mortgage, C. I. T. remitted to the taxpayer the major percentage (not specified in the evidence or findings) of the agreed price therefor, but retained the remaining percentage and credited it on its books to a \"Dealers Reserve Account\" in the name of the taxpayer, for the purpose of securing performance by him of his obligations to C. I. T.\n\nAs in the Hansen case, the taxpayer recorded on his books in the year the installment paper was sold, and included in his income tax return for that year, the cash received from C. I. T., but he did not accrue on his books, or include in his return, the percentage of the price that was retained by C. I. T. and credited to his reserve \n\n[360 \nU.S. 446, 456]\n\u00a0\n account. And, as in the Hansen case, the Commissioner proposed the assessment of deficiencies in income taxes against the taxpayer for the years involved upon the grounds earlier stated. The taxpayer sought a redetermination in the Tax Court which, after hearing, sustained the Commissioner, but, on the taxpayer's petition for review, the Eighth Circuit reversed, 253 F.2d 735, and we granted certiorari for the reasons already stated, \n358 \nU.S. 879\n.\n\nPetitioners in No. 512, Clifton E. Baird and Violet L. Baird (\"taxpayers\"), are husband and wife and, during the years 1952, 1953 and 1954 here involved, they were also partners in a firm known as \"Baird Trailer Sales\" (\"the partnership\") which was engaged primarily in selling house trailers at Salem, Indiana. The partnership kept its books and filed its partnership (informational) income tax returns on a fiscal year accrual basis, but the taxpayers kept their personal books, and filed their returns, on a calendar year cash basis. During the years involved the partnership sold many of its trailers on \"the installment basis,\" the unpaid purchase price of each trailer being evidenced and secured by an assignable or negotiable instrument, retaining in the partnership defeasible title to or a lien on the trailer, signed by the customer, delivered to the partnership, and payable to it in monthly installments over an agreed period.\n\nThe partnership was not legally obligated to sell its installment paper but its limited operating capital made it necessary, as a practical matter, to do so. Prior to the transactions here involved the partnership entered into contracts with Minnehoma Financial Company (\"Minnehoma\"), of Tulsa, Oklahoma, Michigan National Bank, of Grand Rapids, Michigan, and Midland Discount Corporation (\"Midland\"), of Cincinnati, Ohio, providing for the sale and purchase of such of the partnership's installment paper as it offered for sale and as those companies \n\n[360 \nU.S. 446, 457]\n\u00a0\n were willing to buy, and throughout the years in question the partnership sold installment paper to each of those companies under those contracts.\n\nIt was provided in the Minnehoma contract that the partnership, among other liabilities assumed by it to Minnehoma, would unconditionally guarantee payment when due of all sums called for by any installment paper purchased from it, and that Minnehoma, upon receipt and acceptance of such installment paper, would remit to the partnership 95% of the agreed price to be paid therefor, but would retain the remaining 5% of the price and credit it (and also, if it wished, a portion of the \"finance charge\") to a reserve account on its books in the name of the partnership, as security for performance of all endorser, guarantor, and other liabilities of the partnership to Minnehoma.\n6\n\u00a0\n\n[360 \nU.S. 446, 458]\n\u00a0\n\n\nUnder an oral contract with Michigan National Bank, the bank agreed that, upon receipt and acceptance of installment paper endorsed by the partnership with full recourse, it would immediately pay to the partnership a percentage (not specified in the evidence or findings) of the price to be paid therefor, but that the remaining percentage of the price would be retained and credited to a \"reserve account\" in the bank in the name of the partnership. That reserve account was contemporaneously assigned to the bank by the partnership under the \"collateral assignment\" shown in the margin.\n7\n\u00a0\n\n[360 \nU.S. 446, 459]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe contract with Midland was evidenced by two letters. In essence they stated that upon receipt and acceptance of installment paper, endorsed by the partnership with full recourse, Midland would \"advance\" 97% of the price to be paid therefor if on new trailers and 95% of the price if on used trailers, and that the \"differentials of 3% and 5%\" would be retained and credited on Midland's books to a reserve account in the name of the partnership, for the purpose of securing performance of its obligations to Midland.\n8\n They also stated that, when a particular note has been paid out, the amount credited to the reserve on account of that note would be immediately paid to the dealer, and that when the \"reserve fund exceeds 10% of [the partnership's] outstandings, the excess will be paid [to the partnership] automatically.\"\n\nHere, as in the Hansen and Glover cases, the partnership did not accrue on its books, and the taxpayers did not include in their individual returns, in any of the \n\n[360 \nU.S. 446, 460]\n\u00a0\n years here involved, the amounts that were retained by Minnehoma, Michigan National Bank and Midland and credited on their respective books to the partnership's reserve accounts, and, again, as in the Hansen and Glover cases, the Commissioner proposed assessment against the taxpayers of deficiencies in income taxes for the years involved upon the grounds previously stated. Similarly, the taxpayers sought a redetermination in the Tax Court which, after hearing, sustained the Commissioner. On the taxpayers' petition for review, the Seventh Circuit affirmed, 256 F.2d 918, and we granted certiorari for the reasons already stated, \n358 \nU.S. 918\n.\n\nWe turn, first, to the taxpayers' contention that, in substance, the purchaser, not the dealer, obtains the loan directly from a finance company, and that the percentage of the loan which is retained by the finance company - although credited on its books to a reserve account in the name of the dealer as collateral security for the payment of his liabilities to the finance company - is the property of the purchaser of the vehicle, not the dealer, and therefore may not be regarded as accrued income to the dealer.\n\nThe basis of the contention (filling in the omitted but necessarily involved steps) is that each of these transactions is a single, \"three-cornered\" one between the dealer, the finance company and the purchaser; that, in substance, the dealer agrees to sell the vehicle to the purchaser for \"a down payment plus cash\" (the term \"cash\" as here used must necessarily refer to the unpaid balance of the purchase price); that the purchaser agrees immediately to obtain from the finance company, and it agrees to make to the purchaser, a loan, on the security of the vehicle, in an amount at least equal to the unpaid balance of the purchase price owing by the purchaser to the dealer for the vehicle; and that the purchaser agrees immediately to pay, or to direct the finance company to pay, to the dealer, out of the proceeds of the loan, an \n\n[360 \nU.S. 446, 461]\n\u00a0\n amount equal to 95% (in most instances) of the unpaid balance of the purchase price owing by the purchaser to the dealer for the vehicle. Although this leaves an unpaid balance of the purchase price of the vehicle (5% in most instances) still owing by the purchaser to the dealer, it also leaves in possession of the finance company, out of the proceeds of the loan, an amount at least equal to that 5%. Nevertheless the purchaser, with the consent of the dealer, agrees with the finance company that the latter shall retain that 5% and credit it on its books to a reserve account in the name of the dealer, as collateral security for the payment of his contingent liabilities to the finance company. On these assumptions of fact the taxpayers contend that the reserves retained by the finance companies, though credited on their books to the dealers' reserve accounts, are only contingently so credited and are subject to cancellation if the purchaser fails to pay out his loan and, at all events, the reserves belong to the purchasers, and should not be regarded as accrued income of the dealers.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit in the Hansen case, heavily relying upon the opinion of the Fifth Circuit in Texas Trailer-coach, Inc., v. Commissioner, 251 F.2d 395, adopted this theory and largely rested its decision upon that ground, 258 F.2d, at 588, and, to a lesser extent, so did the Eighth Circuit in the Glover case, 253 F.2d, at 737. The taxpayers contend here that such is the substance, if not the form, of their transactions and that, inasmuch as taxation depends on substance and not on form, the Hansen and Glover cases should be affirmed and the Baird case should be reversed on this ground alone.\n\nWe agree, of course, that the incidence of taxation depends upon the substance, not the form, of the transaction, Commissioner v. Court Holding Co., \n324 \nU.S. 331, 334\n; Helvering v. F. & R. Lazarus & Co., \n308 \nU.S. 252, 255\n; Bowers v. Kerbaugh-Empire Co., \n271 \nU.S. 170, 174\n; \n\n[360 \nU.S. 446, 462]\n\u00a0\n Weiss v. Stearn, \n265 \nU.S. 242, 254\n; United States v. Phellis, \n257 \nU.S. 156, 168\n, but we think that the taxpayers have assumed facts which are contrary to the records and are wholly without substance.\n\nThese records clearly show that, in every instance, the installment paper was executed by the purchaser and made payable to the dealer (though in the Hansen case \"at the office of\" GMAC, and in the Baird case \"at the office of\" Minnehoma), and that the same was later assigned or endorsed by the dealer and sent to the finance company for purchase, under and subject to the dealer's contractually assumed contingent liabilities to the finance company respecting it,\n9\n and that, in every instance, \n\n[360 \nU.S. 446, 463]\n\u00a0\n the finance company, upon receipt and acceptance of the installment paper and of the dealer's obligations respecting it, immediately paid to the dealer a major percentage of the agreed or formula fixed price for the paper; but, pursuant to the terms of the dealer's contract with the finance company, the latter retained the remaining percentage of the price and credited it on its books to the dealer's reserve account, as collateral security for the payment of his contingent liabilities to the finance company on such installment paper.\n\nIt is therefore clear that the retained percentages of the purchase price of the installment paper, from the time they were entered on the books of the finance companies as liabilities to the respective dealers, were vested in and belonged to the respective dealers, subject only to their several pledges thereof to the respective finance companies as collateral security for the payment of their then contingent liabilities to the finance companies.\n\nThis brings us to the question whether amounts of purchase price withheld by finance companies as security to cover possible losses on installment paper purchased from dealers, who employ the accrual method of accounting, constitute income to them at the time the withheld amounts are recorded on the books of the finance companies as liabilities to the dealers.\n\nThe principles governing the accrual and reporting of income by taxpayers who employ the accrual basis have long been settled by the opinions of this Court, Security Flour Mills Co. v. Commissioner, \n321 \nU.S. 281\n; Spring City Foundry Co. v. Commissioner, \n292 \nU.S. 182, 184\n; \n\n[360 \nU.S. 446, 464]\n\u00a0\n Brown v. Helvering, \n291 \nU.S. 193, 199\n. In Spring City Foundry Co. v. Commissioner, supra, Chief Justice Hughes, speaking for the Court, said:\n\n\"Keeping accounts and making returns on the accrual basis, as distinguished from the cash basis, import that it is the right to receive and not the actual receipt that determines the inclusion of the amount in gross income. When the right to receive an amount becomes fixed, the right accrues.\" \n292 \nU.S., at 184\n-185.\n\n\n Those principles are not questioned here, but the parties differ respecting their application to the facts of these cases. The taxpayers contend, first, that they cannot presently compel the finance companies to pay to them the amounts of their reserve accounts, and therefore they have not acquired a presently enforcible right to recover those reserves, and, hence, they should not be deemed to constitute accrued income to them. Inasmuch as these records show that the pay-out period for automobiles varies from 12 to 36 months and for house trailers from 36 to 60 months, it is doubtless true that the taxpayers, having pledged their reserve accounts to the finance companies as collateral security, cannot presently compel the finance companies to pay over their reserves. But the question is not whether the taxpayers can presently recover their reserves, for, as stated, it is the time of acquisition of the fixed right to receive the reserves and not the time of their actual receipt that determines whether or not the reserves have accrued and are taxable.\n\nThe taxpayers next contend that the amounts that were retained by the finance companies and entered on their books as liabilities to the dealers under their reserve accounts, were subject to such contingencies that it could not have been known, in the year of such retentions \n\n[360 \nU.S. 446, 465]\n\u00a0\n and credits, what amount of those reserves would actually be received by them and, hence, they did not acquire, in the year of such retentions and credits, a fixed right to receive - in a later year or at any time - the amounts so withheld and credited to them, and therefore those amounts did not constitute accrued income to them.\n\nIt is true that the amounts retained by any one of the finance companies, and entered on its books as a liability to a particular dealer, are subject to such liabilities as the dealer may have contractually assumed to the finance company, but only the obligations of the dealer to the finance company arising from those liabilities may be offset against a like amount in the dealer's reserve account. Hence, those liabilities and obligations provide the only conditions that can affect full cash payment to the dealer of his reserve account. No amount may be charged by the finance company against the dealer's reserve account which he has not thus authorized.\n\nIt follows that only one or the other of two things can happen to the dealer's reserve account: (1) the finance company is bound to pay the full amount to the dealer in cash, or (2) if the dealer has incurred obligations to the finance company under his guaranty, endorsement, or contract of sale, of the installment paper, the finance company may apply so much of the reserve as is necessary to discharge those obligations, and is bound to pay the remainder to the dealer in cash.\n\nDoes the dealer \"receive\" funds which are so taken from his reserve account and applied to the payment of his obligations to the finance company? The dealer agreed in his contract with the finance company to receive his reserve in offset payment of his obligations to the finance company and the balance in cash. It would therefore seem that funds in the dealer's reserve which are applied to the payment of his obligations to the finance \n\n[360 \nU.S. 446, 466]\n\u00a0\n company are as much \"received\" by him as those which the finance company pays to him in cash. The Seventh Circuit took that view in the Baird case, saying:\n\n \"Ultimately only two things could happen to the funds in the dealer's reserve accounts: either the amounts would be paid to the partnership in cash or they would be used to satisfy the partnership's other obligations to the finance companies.\" 256 F.2d ___, at 924.\n\n\n In any realistic view we think that the dealer has \"received\" his reserve account whether it is applied, as he authorized, to the payment of his obligations to the finance company, or is paid to him in cash.\n10\n\u00a0\n\nIt follows that the amounts (of purchase price of the installment paper) that were withheld by the finance companies constituted accrued income to these accrual basis dealers at the time the withheld amounts were entered on the books of the finance companies as liabilities to the dealers, for at that time the dealers acquired a fixed right to receive the amounts so retained by the finance companies.\n\nThe taxpayers complain that such a holding will unfairly require them to pay taxes upon funds which are not available to them for that purpose. Though the funds are not presently available to the taxpayers for the payment of taxes, they are nevertheless owned by the taxpayers, and the latter cannot expect to collateralize their liabilities, for periods running from 1 to 5 years, by the use of their accrued but untaxed funds. Moreover, it is a normal result of the accrual basis of accounting and reporting that taxes frequently must be paid on accrued \n\n[360 \nU.S. 446, 467]\n\u00a0\n funds before receipt of the cash with which to pay them, just as the Ninth Circuit stated in the Hansen case, 258 F.2d ___, at 587. See Security Flour Mills Co. v. Commissioner, \n321 \nU.S. 281, 284\n-285.\n\nTo permit accrual basis taxpayers to escape accrual and taxation, in a particular year, of such portions of their sales as they may permit to be retained by buyers, as collateral security, well might violate 42 (a) of the 1939 Internal Revenue Code as amended,\n11\n and, moreover, might well afford opportunities to accrual basis taxpayers to allocate income to years deemed most advantageous.\n\nThe Commissioner has broad powers in determining whether accounting methods used by a taxpayer clearly reflect income, Lucas v. American Code Co., \n280 \nU.S. 445, 449\n; Automobile Club of Michigan v. Commissioner, \n353 \nU.S. 180, 189\n-190, and under 41, of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, 26 U.S.C. (1952 ed.) 41, the Commissioner, believing that the accounting method employed by a taxpayer \"does not clearly reflect the income,\" may require that \"computation shall be made in accordance with such method as in [his] opinion . . . does clearly reflect the income.\" Since 1931 the Internal Revenue Service has consistently maintained that amounts withheld by finance companies to cover possible losses on notes purchased from dealers constitute income to dealers, who employ the accrual method of accounting, from the time the amounts are recorded on the books of \n\n[360 \nU.S. 446, 468]\n\u00a0\n the finance companies as liabilities to the dealers.\n12\n That position, in general, accords with our view.\n\nThe taxpayers have argued that portions of the Dealers Reserve Accounts consist of percentages of \"finance charges\"\n13\n which the finance companies agreed to allow them, and that such percentages of the \"finance charges,\" not being a part of the purchase price of the installment paper, should in no event be regarded as accrued income to the dealers. However, the respective taxpayers, each of whom had the burden of showing that he did not owe the taxes which the Commissioner proposed to assess against him, wholly failed to adduce evidence to support their claims. They failed even to adduce evidence showing whether any percentages of the \"finance charges\" that may have been allowed to them by the respective finance companies were entered on the books of the finance companies as credits to the respective \"Dealers Reserve Accounts,\" and if so, whether such percentages of the \"finance charges\" so credited had been identified and separated in character and amount from the percentages of the purchase price of the installment paper that were retained by the finance companies and entered on their \n\n[360 \nU.S. 446, 469]\n\u00a0\n books as liabilities to the dealers in their respective Dealers Reserve Accounts. For these reasons the respective taxpayers have wholly failed to sustain the burden of showing that any part of the amounts credited on the books of the finance companies to the respective Dealers Reserve Accounts was entitled to special treatment.\n\nThe judgments in No. 380 and No. 381 are reversed and the judgment in No. 512 is affirmed.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS dissents.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Sixth Circuit in Schaeffer v. Commissioner, 258 F.2d 861, sustained the Commissioner's position. Also the Tax Court since Shoemaker-Nash, Inc., v. Commissioner, 41 B. T. A. 417 (1940), has by a long line of decisions consistently sustained the Commissioner's position.\n\nOn the other hand the Fourth Circuit has sustained the taxpayers' position in Johnson v. Commissioner, 233 F.2d 952. And the Fifth Circuit has sustained the taxpayers' position in Texas Trailercoach, Inc., v. Commissioner, 251 F.2d 395, West Pontiac, Inc., v. Commissioner, 257 F.2d 810, and in several judgments (without opinions) entered on stipulations specifically presenting a new the same issue which that court had decided in Texas Trailercoach, Inc., v. Commissioner, supra. In entering those judgments (in United States v. Hines Pontiac, 2 P-H Fed. Tax Rep. 2d 5694, United States v. Modern Olds, Inc., 2 P-H Fed. Tax Rep. 2d 5713, and Kilborn v. Commissioner, 2 P-H Fed. Tax Rep. 2d 5812), the Fifth Circuit adhered to its decision in Texas Trailercoach, Inc., v. Commissioner, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] At the very beginning of the form there is a recital that \"The undersigned seller [the dealer] hereby sells, and the undersigned purchaser or purchasers, jointly and severally, hereby purchase(s), subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, the following property, delivery and acceptance of which in good order are hereby acknowledged by purchaser,\" and then follows a detailed description of the automobile, and a computation of the amounts which support the \"Time (Deferred) Balance\" that is payable by the purchaser in monthly installments.\n\nThe reverse side of the form recites that \"[f]or the purpose of securing payment of the obligation hereunder, seller reserves title, and shall have a security interest, in said property until said amount is fully paid in cash.\" It then goes on to specify the various conditions to be observed by the purchaser, which are usually found in conditional sale contracts.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] That assignment, so far as pertinent, provides:\n\n\"For value received, undersigned [the dealer] does hereby sell, assign and transfer to the General Motors Acceptance Corporation his . . . right, title and interest in and to the within contract, herewith submitted for purchase by it, and the property covered thereby and authorizes said General Motors Acceptance Corporation to do every act and thing necessary to collect and discharge the same.\n\n.   .  .  .   .\n\n\n\n\"In consideration of your purchase of the within contract, undersigned [the dealer] guarantees payment of the full amount remaining unpaid hereon, and covenants if default be made in payment of any instalment herein to pay the full amount then unpaid to General Motors Acceptance Corporation upon demand. . . .\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] This record does not contain C. I. T.'s \"reserve arrangement.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The pertinent parts of the taxpayer's letter, referred to in the text, may be more fully summarized as follows: C. I. T. was to buy from the taxpayer such of his notes and mortgages as he chose to sell and as were \"acceptable to\" C. I. T. Some of the notes and mortgages were to be endorsed by the dealer to C. I. T. without recourse, but \"paper covering commercial cars used for long distance hauling, commercial cars of more than two tons capacity, busses, cars used for taxi, jitney, `drive-yourself' service, or cars sold to relatives or employees\" was to bear the dealer's \"full recourse endorsement.\"\n\nProvisions for \"reserves as outlined in [C. I. T.'s] reserve arrangement effective at the time paper [was] purchased by [it],\" were to be applicable to such sales, but as earlier observed this record does not contain C. I. T.'s \"reserve arrangement.\" Three times in each 12-month period, if the dealer was not then indebted to C. I. T., the latter would pay to the dealer his \"accumulated reserves in excess of 3% of the then aggregate unpaid balances on paper purchased from [him],\" but if C. I. T. stopped buying installment paper from \n\n[360 \nU.S. 446, 455]\n\u00a0\n the dealer the former was authorized to \"hold and apply all reserves until liquidation of all paper purchased from [the dealer was] completed.\"\n\nThe taxpayer was to purchase from C. I. T. \"each repossessed or recovered car tendered at [the dealer's] place of business within 90 days after maturity of the earliest instalment still unpaid,\" at a price, payable on demand, equal to \"the unpaid balance due on the car,\" or, if the dealer failed to do so, he was to pay to C. I. T. the amount of \"any deficiency incurred by [C. I. T.] in the resale of such repossessed cars. . . .\"\n\nIf because of prepayment of a note by a maker, C. I. T. refunded any part of a \"service charge,\" the taxpayer agreed to pay to C. I. T. the same percentages, if any, of the refund as had originally been credited to his reserve account.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The material parts of the contract between the partnership and Minnehoma may be summarized as follows: Upon receipt and acceptance of installment paper from the partnership, Minnehoma would remit to the partnership 95% of the price to be paid therefor, but would retain the remaining 5% of the price and credit it (and also, if it wished, a portion of the \"finance charge\" paid by the maker) to a reserve account on its books in the name of the partnership. The partnership unconditionally guaranteed payment when due of all sums called for by the installment paper, and guaranteed that the makers would perform all obligations assumed by them under that paper, and that in the event the makers failed to pay any installment when due or to keep any obligation assumed by them under the installment paper, the partnership would repurchase such installment paper from Minnehoma, upon demand, at a price equal to the unpaid balance thereon.\n\nMinnehoma was authorized to charge against the partnership's reserve account any sums for which the partnership might be or become indebted to Minnehoma; and at such times as - after the payment of all contingent liabilities of the partnership to Minnehoma - the amount then credited to the partnership's reserve account exceeded 15% of the aggregate unpaid balances of all outstanding installment paper so sold and purchased, Minnehoma would pay \n\n[360 \nU.S. 446, 458]\n\u00a0\n such excess, once each month, to the partnership; and when all installment paper purchased by Minnehoma from the partnership had been paid in full, Minnehoma would pay to the partnership the balance of its reserve account.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n]\n\n  \"COLLATERAL ASSIGNMENT.\n\n\n\"For Valuable Consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the undersigned hereby sells, assigns, transfers, and conveys unto Michigan National Bank, of Grand Rapids, Michigan, its successors, and assigns forever, irrevocably, all of his, its, or their right, title and interest in certain sums of money now on deposit or that may hereafter be deposited in the Michigan National Bank, of Grand Rapids, Michigan, and identified and represented by Reserve account in the name of the undersigned in the Michigan National Bank.\n\n\n\"This Assignment and Transfer is made as collateral security for the payment of the direct and indirect liability of the undersigned to the said Michigan National Bank, of Grand Rapids, Michigan, and to secure the payment of the several notes representing said direct and indirect liability and any renewal or renewals thereof, or any installment payment or payments and to secure any obligation . . . which the undersigned may owe to said Michigan National Bank, of Grand Rapids, Michigan.\n\n\n\"In the event of default in the payment of said liability or any installment thereof, or any of the several notes at the time when same shall fall due or in the payment of the interest thereon or any part of the principal of said liability then the Michigan National Bank, of Grand Rapids, Michigan, at their election, notice of said election being hereby expressly waived, may apply the total of said \n\n[360 \nU.S. 446, 459]\n\u00a0\n sums of money represented by said Reserve account at the date of election or any part thereof to meet the default in the liability.\n\n\n\"Whenever the indebtedness secured hereby is paid in full the Michigan National Bank, of Grand Rapids, Michigan, shall reassign said sums of money represented by said Reserve account along with all right, title and interest back to the undersigned.\n\n\n\"If in the opinion of the bank the undersigned dealer's account is in good standing, all sums in this reserve account in excess of ten per cent (10%) of the gross unpaid balance of all contracts outstanding on February 28 of each year will promptly be returned to the undersigned dealer.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Midland's vice president who handled these transactions with the partnership testified relative to the purpose of the reserve as follows:\n\n\"A.

Slade, Leavenworth Colby and Seymour Farber filed a brief in No. 62 for the United States, as amicus curiae.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner, Crumady, was an employee of a stevedoring company engaged in transferring a cargo of lumber from the ship Joachim Hendrik Fisser of German registry to a pier at Newark, New Jersey. While so engaged, he was injured and brought this admiralty suit by libel in rem against the vessel. The vessel impleaded the stevedoring contractor.\n\nWhen the accident happened the stevedores were trying to lift two timbers through a hatch. The manner of the accident was described as follows by the District Court:\n\n\". . . libellant and his fellow-employees had placed a double-eyed wire rope sling, provided with a sliding hook movable between the eyes thereof, around the two timbers at a location two or three feet from their after ends. The two eyes of the sling were then placed upon the cargo hook of the up-and-down boom runner and a signal given by the stevedore gangway-man to the winchman to `take up the slack.' The winchman complied with the signal, and during this operation libellant stood clear upon other timbers forming a part of the cargo, within the open square of the hatch. There was some testimony that when the slack was taken up by the winchman, the two timbers slid toward each other in the sling, the timber \n\n[358 \nU.S. 423, 425]\n\u00a0\n which had been under the lower edge of the hatch coaming moving or commencing to move toward the timber which lay within the open hatch square. After the slack had been taken up by the winchman, the same signaller called for the `taking of a strain' upon the cargo runner. The winchman again responded, the two-part topping-lift broke and the head of the up-and-down boom, with its attached cargo and topping-lift blocks, fell to the top of the cargo within the hatch square.\n\n\n \"The topping-lift had been rigged in a double purchase and had been supporting the head of the boom. The wire rope constituting the topping-lift extended from a shackle on the topping-lift block at the cross-tree of the mast, through a block at the boom head, back through the mast block, down the mast, through a block welded to the mast table, and thence around a drum of the winch. When the boom fell, libellant was knocked down, either by the boom itself or its appurtenant tackle, and thus sustained numerous serious and permanently disabling orthopedic and neurological injuries.\" 142 F. Supp. 389, 391.\n\n\n The safe working load of the boom and cargo runner and topping-lift handling the load at the time of the accident was three tons each. This equipment, which was part of the unloading and loading gear of the vessel, was in good condition. The winch, which served the boom, had a \"cut off\" device or circuit breaker. It was set to shut off the current on the application of a load of about six tons, which was twice the safe working load of the unloading gear. The circuit breaker operated perfectly, cutting off current at the point of stress for which it was set. It had been set to operate at a load slightly more than twice \n\n[358 \nU.S. 423, 426]\n\u00a0\n the safe working load of the unloading gear\n*\n by employees of the ship before the winch was turned over to petitioner's fellow employees for operation.\n\nThe District Court accordingly found the vessel unseaworthy and therefore liable to petitioner. It also found that the stevedores moved the head of the boom in an effort to clear the cargo from the sides of the hatch and that this \"created a load on the topping-lift greatly in excess of its safe working load.\" This act was found to be \"the primary cause of the parting of the topping-lift and consequent fall of the boom.\" Since the stevedoring company was found to be negligent in bringing \"into play the unseaworthy condition of the vessel,\" the District Court directed the stevedoring company to indemnify the vessel for the damages to petitioner. 142 F. Supp. 389. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the vessel was not unseaworthy and that the sole cause of the injury was the negligence of the stevedores. 249 F.2d 818. A petition for rehearing was denied en banc, Judge Biggs dissenting. 249 F.2d 821. The cases are here on petitions for certiorari. \n357 \nU.S. 903\n.\n\nI. We held in Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, \n328 \nU.S. 85, 95\n, that stevedores, though intermediately employed, are, when performing \"the ship's service,\" entitled to the same protection against unseaworthiness which members \n\n[358 \nU.S. 423, 427]\n\u00a0\n of the crew doing the same work would receive. And see Pope & Talbot v. Hawn, \n346 \nU.S. 406\n. The work of loading and unloading is historically \"the work of the ship's service.\" Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, supra, at 96.\n\nThis protection against unseaworthiness imposes a duty which the owner of the vessel cannot delegate. Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, supra, at 100. Unseaworthiness extends not only to the vessel but to the crew (Boudoin v. Lykes Bros. Steamship Co., \n348 \nU.S. 336\n) and to appliances that are appurtenant to the ship. Mahnich v. Southern S. S. Co., \n321 \nU.S. 96\n. And as to appliances the duty of the shipowner does not end with supplying them; he must keep them in order. Id., at 104; The Osceola, \n189 \nU.S. 158, 175\n. The shipowner is not relieved of these responsibilities by turning control of the loading or unloading of the ship over to a stevedoring company. It was held in Grillea v. United States, 232 F.2d 919, that stevedores themselves could render a ship pro tanto unseaworthy and make the vessel owner liable for injuries to one of them. And see Rogers v. United States Lines, \n347 \nU.S. 984\n; Alaska S. S. Co. v. Petterson, \n347 \nU.S. 396\n. We need not go so far to sustain the District Court here. For there is ample evidence to support the finding that these stevedores did no more than bring into play the unseaworthy condition of the vessel. The winch - an appurtenance of the vessel - was not inherently defective as was the rope in the Mahnich case. But it was adjusted by those acting for the vessel owner in a way that made it unsafe and dangerous for the work at hand. While the rigging would take only three tons of stress, the cutoff of the winch - its safety device - was set at twice that limit. This was rigging that went with the vessel and was safe for use within known limits. Yet those limits were disregarded by the vessel owner when the winch was adjusted. The case is no different in principle from \n\n[358 \nU.S. 423, 428]\n\u00a0\n loading or unloading cargo with cable or rope lacking the test strength for the weight of the freight to be moved. In that case the cable or rope, in this case the winch, makes the vessel pro tanto unseaworthy. That was the theory of the District Court; it correctly applied the concept of unseaworthiness; and its findings of fact were not clearly erroneous. McAllister v. United States, \n348 \nU.S. 19, 20\n.\n\nII. A majority of the Court ruled in Ryan Co. v. Pan-Atlantic Corp., \n350 \nU.S. 124\n, that where a shipowner and stevedoring company entered into a service agreement, the former was entitled to indemnification for all damages it sustained as a result of the stevedoring company's breach of its warranty of workmanlike service. And see Weyerhaeuser S. S. Co. v. Nacirema Co., \n355 \nU.S. 563\n. The facts here are different from those in the Ryan case, in that this vessel had been chartered by its owners to Ovido Compania Naviera S. A. Panama, which company entered into the service agreement with this stevedoring company. The contract, however, mentioned the name of the vessel on which the work was to be done and contained an agreement on the part of the stevedoring company \"to faithfully furnish such stevedoring services.\"\n\nWe think this case is governed by the principle announced in the Ryan case. The warranty which a stevedore owes when he goes aboard a vessel to perform services is plainly for the benefit of the vessel whether the vessel's owners are parties to the contract or not. That is enough to bring the vessel into the zone of modern law that recognizes rights in third-party beneficiaries. Restatement, Law of Contracts, 133. Moreover, as we said in the Ryan case, \"competency and safety of stowage are inescapable elements of the service undertaken.\" \n350 \nU.S., at 133\n. They are part of the stevedore's \"warranty of workmanlike service that is comparable to a manufacturer's warranty of the soundness of its manufactured \n\n[358 \nU.S. 423, 429]\n\u00a0\n product.\" Id., at 133-134. See MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co., 217 N. Y. 382, 111 N. E. 1050.\n\nWe conclude that since the negligence of the stevedores, which brought the unseaworthiness of the vessel into play, amounted to a breach of the warranty of workmanlike service, the vessel may recover over.\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the judgment of the District Court is reinstated.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] One expert, Robert A. Simons, testified:\n\n\"I said that it is not safe practice to have a rig that was designed for three tons working load and of the winch with a cut-off set at six tons so that you could apply six tons load to the hoist before the winch would cut off because that would be doubling the load for which the rig was designed for.\"\n\n\n Another expert, Walter J. Byrne, testified:\n\n\". . . if you have three-ton gear and a three-ton winch and due to cut-offs in back, you allow, let us say, a hundred per cent overload to be developed, then I think from my point of view as a safety man you are taking away a governor. You are taking away something which is built in for the protection of the gear and personnel.\"\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER and MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER join, dissenting.\n\nIt should be said at the outset that neither of these cases should have been taken for review. No. 61, although of course important to the unfortunate victim of this accident, satisfies none of the criteria for certiorari set forth generally in Rule 19. The case involves merely factual issues of consequence only in this particular litigation, and being in admiralty lacks even that feature, the right to jury trial, which some of my Brethren have found to justify the Court's reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence in FELA and Jones Act cases. No. 62, dependent as it is on No. 61, likewise does not belong here.\n\nWhen this Court reverses a Court of Appeals, particularly on issues of fact, I think the lower court is at least due an understandable explication of the reasons. In No. 61 the Court holds the vessel liable on the ground that its setting of the circuit breaker to cut off at a strain of more than 3 tons rendered the lifting gear unseaworthy, and further finds that the stevedores \"did no more than bring into play\" this unseaworthy condition. The Court overturns the findings of a unanimous Court of Appeals that the setting of the circuit breaker at a strain of 6 tons did not make the lifting gear unseaworthy, and that the accident was caused not by this setting but by the stevedores' \n\n[358 \nU.S. 423, 430]\n\u00a0\n improper positioning of the head of the boom.\n*\n 249 F.2d 818. In my opinion the action of the Court lacks any solid basis. My views can best be pointed up by briefly recounting what was held by the court below in reversing the District Court.\n\nThe Court of Appeals first found that Crumady's claim of unseaworthiness in the District Court was predicated on the alleged defective condition of the topping-lift, and not on the setting of the circuit breaker. Id., at 819. It then concluded that the District Court, \"with adequate basis in the record,\" had correctly rejected this claim. Ibid.\n\nThe court then went on to hold that the District Court had properly found the accident primarily attributable to the negligent handling of the lifting operation by the stevedores, in that they had permitted a long and heavy timber to become wedged under the coaming of the hatch from which it was being removed, as well as having changed, contrary to instructions, the position of the head of the boom. Ibid. This \"incorrect procedure,\" the Court of Appeals held, caused the topping-lift cable to be subjected to \"excessive and abnormal strain,\" which in turn caused the cable to break and the boom to fall on Crumady. Id., at 819, 820-821.\n\nNext, the Court of Appeals turned to the setting of the circuit breaker, \"a new theory of the ship's unseaworthiness\" which the court found had been \"adopted\" by the trial court on its own initiative. Id., at 819. In rejecting this basis for holding the vessel liable the Court of Appeals analyzed the situation as follows: (1) hoisting gear is \"rated\" in terms of supporting a load of not more than \n\n[358 \nU.S. 423, 431]\n\u00a0\n one-fifth of the strength of the lifting cable; (2) the gear here involved was rated to lift 3 tons; (3) the cable it was intended to and did utilize, for both the topping-lift and cargo runner, was strong enough to withstand a strain of 15 tons; (4) the setting of the circuit breaker to cut off the power from the winch controlling the lifting operation at a strain of 6 tons was proper; (5) the circuit breaker functioned properly, but the stevedores' improper positioning of the boom subjected the topping-lift to \"an enormous, abnormal and unanticipated\" additional strain. Id., at 820.\n\nIn light of its analysis of the record the Court of Appeals concluded (id., at 820-821):\n\n\"It was a proper finding that the negligence of the stevedores was `the sole active or primary cause' of the parting of the gear. But we think it is equally clear that the court erred in the next step of its reasoning, that this negligence of Nacirema `brought into play the unseaworthy condition of the vessel.' The concept of seaworthiness contemplates no more than that a ship's gear shall be reasonably fit for its intended purpose. [Footnote omitted.] Applied to the present facts, this means that the setting of the electrical circuit breaker could make the gear unseaworthy only if there was reason to fear that a strain of about six tons on the running gear, which would activate the cut off, would subject cable of fifteen ton capacity in the topping-lift to a dangerous strain. There is nothing in this record which suggests that such an eventuality was reasonably to be feared or anticipated. Thus, the gear was not proved to have been unseaworthy, neither was the setting of the cut off device established as a legal cause of the accident which occurred.\" \n\n[358 \nU.S. 423, 432]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n What answer does this Court now make to the Court of Appeals' convincingly reasoned opinion? Simply the assertion that because the lifting gear was \"rated\" for only 3 tons, it was not clearly erroneous for the District Court to conclude that it was wrong to set the circuit breaker to cut off at 6 tons, \"twice that limit.\" What support does the Court muster for this assertion? Nothing but a footnote reference to the testimony of two witnesses, without so much as a word about the Court of Appeals' rejection of the probative value of such testimony in the face of, among other things, \"a Coast Guard standard for the setting of such a control, indicating that the setting [at 6 tons] of the cut off device was entirely safe and proper.\" Id., at 820.\n\nPerhaps I should add that I believe unavailing Chief Judge Biggs' suggestion on petition for rehearing that liability might be predicated on the stevedores' improper positioning of the head of the boom and the theory of unseaworthiness enunciated by Judge Learned Hand in Grillea v. United States, 232 F.2d 919. 249 F.2d, at 821. The record contains no indication that the positioning of the boom was other than \"an incident in a continuous operation\" beyond the compass of that theory. Grillea v. United States, supra, at 922.\n\nIn view of the foregoing I think the Court's action overriding the Court of Appeals entirely unjustified. I would affirm the judgment below in No. 61, and not reach, as the Court of Appeals found it unnecessary to do, the indemnity issue put to us in No. 62.\n\nSince my views have not prevailed, however, I am bound to consider the indemnity issue in light of the Court's reasoning in the action for unseaworthiness. In this light I must again dissent. As I read Ryan Stevedoring Co. v. Pan-Atlantic S. S. Corp., \n350 \nU.S. 124\n, the ship is entitled to indemnity only if the liability-inducing unseaworthiness or hazardous working condition is created \n\n[358 \nU.S. 423, 433]\n\u00a0\n by the stevedore. Here, on the Court's premises, Nacirema merely brought into play an unseaworthy condition created by the vessel itself. And on the Court's further premise that this condition was the cause of the injuries sustained by Crumady I think neither the decision nor the underlying principles in Ryan justifies the award of indemnity. Cf. Weyerhaeuser S. S. Co. v. Nacirema Operating Co., \n355 \nU.S. 563, 568\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Chief Judge Biggs, dissenting from the refusal of the Court of Appeals to grant rehearing en banc, did not disagree with these findings. 249 F.2d, at 821. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 423, 434]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","34":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCUDD v.

NEW YORK LIFE INS. CO.(1959)\nNo. 58\nArgued: January 12, 1959Decided: May 18, 1959\n\n\n\n\n In this case federal jurisdiction was based on diversity of citizenship and the issue was whether an insured died as a result of suicide or accident. He was alone when he met his death from two wounds from his double-barreled shotgun. In such circumstances applicable state law presumes that death was accidental and places on the insurer the burden of proving that death resulted from suicide. So instructed, the jury found that death was accidental and returned a verdict for the beneficiary. The evidence was entirely circumstantial and could support such a verdict. The District Court denied the insurer's motions for a directed verdict, judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a new trial and entered judgment for the beneficiary. After reviewing the record, the Court of Appeals concluded that the gun could not have been fired without someone or something pulling or pushing the trigger and that the evidence did not justify submitting the issue to the jury, and it reversed with directions to dismiss the complaint. Held: The District Court properly submitted the issue to the jury, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed. Pp. 437-447.\n\n 252 F.2d 43, reversed.\n\nPhilip B. Vogel argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief were Pershing Boe and Donald C. Holand.\n\nNorman G. Tenneson argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was Harold W. Bangert.\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe question in this case is whether the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, under the applicable principles hereinafter discussed, properly held that it was error to submit to a jury's determination whether an insured died as a result of suicide or accident. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 437, 438]\n\u00a0\n\n\nPetitioner is the beneficiary of two policies issued by respondent in 1944 and 1949 insuring the life of her now-deceased husband, William Dick. Each policy contained a clause which provided that double indemnity would be payable upon receipt of proof that the death of the insured \"resulted directly, and independently of all other causes, from bodily injury effected solely through external violent and accidental means,\" but that the double indemnity would not be payable if the insured's death resulted from \"self-destruction, whether sane or insane.\"\n\nMr. Dick met his death while alone in the silage shed of his farm. The death resulted from two wounds caused by the discharge of his shotgun.\n1\n Petitioner filed proofs of death but respondent rejected her claim for double indemnity payments on the ground that Mr. Dick had committed suicide. Petitioner then filed suit in the North Dakota courts. Her complaint set forth the policies in issue, the facts surrounding her husband's death, an allegation that the death was accidental, and a demand for payment. Respondent removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of North Dakota on the grounds of diversity of citizenship and jurisdictional amount. It then filed an answer to the complaint in which it set up suicide as an affirmative defense to the demand for double indemnity payments. Respondent admitted liability for the face amounts of the policies ($7,500) and no issue is presented concerning those amounts.\n\nTrial proceeded before the district judge and jury. The evidence showed that the Dicks, who had been happily married since 1926, lived on a farm near Lisbon, North \n\n[359 \nU.S. 437, 439]\n\u00a0\n Dakota, where they raised sheep, cattle and field crops. Five of the six quarter sections of the farm were unmortgaged and Mr. Dick, who was not known to have any financial problems, had nearly $1,000 in the bank. He was known as a \"husky,\" \"strong,\" \"jolly\" man who was seldom moody. \"If he had anything on his chest, he would get it off and forget about it.\" Dick got along well with his neighbors and was well liked in the community. He was 47 at the time of his death. He was five feet seven inches tall, weighed approximately 165 pounds, and was generally healthy. The coroner, who was also Dick's personal doctor, testified that Dick was a mature, muscular, physically able workman who, three weeks before his death, was bright and cheerful. About a year and a half before his death, Mr. Dick visited the doctor and complained that he felt tired and pepless. His condition was diagnosed as mild to moderate non-specific prostatitis for which he received sulfa treatments and hormone shots. But the record is devoid of evidence that the condition was serious or particularly painful or that Mr. Dick was especially concerned with it. The Dicks reared five children. One daughter still lived with them and attended high school in nearby Elliott. Dick got along well with his whole family.\n\nThe evening before he died, the family returned from Elliott and ate ice cream and watched television together. Mr. Dick helped his daughter with a school problem in general science explaining to her the intricacies of a transformer. He slept soundly that night. He intended to help his cousin - a neighbor - make sausage the following day. He arose the next morning, milked the cows, ate a hearty breakfast, and spoke with his wife about their plans for the day. He said nothing to indicate that he contemplated doing anything out of the ordinary. About 8:30 a. m., Mrs. Dick drove their daughter to school. Mr. Dick backed the car out of the garage for his wife and said \n\n[359 \nU.S. 437, 440]\n\u00a0\n goodbye in a normal way. He was then in the process of feeding milk to the pigs and silage to the cattle.\n\nMrs. Dick returned in about a half hour and proceeded to work in the house. Later, when she thought it was time to leave for the cousin's house, she went to locate Mr. Dick. She walked to the barn and called for him but there was no answer. She then went to the little 8 foot by 12 foot silage shed adjacent to the barn and saw Mr. Dick lying on the floor. He was fully clothed for the zero weather Lisbon was then experiencing and he wore bulky gloves and a heavy jacket which was fully zipped up. Near him lay his shotgun. A good part of his head appeared blown off and she knew from his appearance that he was dead. She hurriedly returned to the house and called Mr. Dick's brother who lived nearby. He came immediately and at Mrs. Dick's direction went to the silage shed. There he saw Mr. Dick lying with his head to the northwest and his feet to the southeast of the shed. The body was along the south wall with the feet near the corner. Later, when he examined the shed more closely, he found a concentration of shotgun pellets high in the northwest corner of the shed and other pellets four to five feet from the floor in the southeast corner. He also noticed a sprinkle of frozen silage on the floor of the shed and on the steps leading to the door from the shed.\n\nJames Dick, the deceased's nephew, also responded to Mrs. Dick's call. He stated that upon arriving at the Dicks' house, he saw a tub newly filled with ground corn in the silage yard and that normally his uncle fed silage with a topping of ground corn to the cattle. He also stated that the cattle were just then finishing the silage presumably laid out by Mr. Dick before his death.\n\nAt about 11 a. m., the sheriff arrived. Mr. Dick was still lying where he had died. The sheriff examined Mr. Dick's shotgun and found two discharged shells in its chamber. The gun was dry and clean and there were no \n\n[359 \nU.S. 437, 441]\n\u00a0\n bloodstains on it or on the gloves which Dick was still wearing. The sheriff also noticed some of the shot patterns found by Dick's brother and saw some brain tissue splattered on the southeast corner. He found a screwdriver lying on the floor about a foot from the gun. The Dicks used the screwdriver to open and close the door to the silage shed because the doorknob was missing.\n\nSoon thereafter the coroner arrived. He testified that Mr. Dick's body contained a shotgun wound on the left side and one on the head. The body wound was mortal, but not immediately fatal. It consisted of a gouged out wound on the left lateral chest wall which removed skin, fat, rib muscles and portions of rib from the body. In addition, other ribs were fractured and Dick's left lung was collapsed. In the coroner's opinion, it was the type of wound which would have had to result in immense pain, although it probably would not have made it impossible for Dick again to discharge the gun. The wound to the head caused immediate death. According to the testimony of the sheriff and a member of the Fargo police department, both wounds were received from the front. In the sheriff's opinion, the chest wound was received from an upward shot into Dick's body, but this testimony conflicted with another statement of the sheriff indicating that the wound was received from a downward shot.\n\nIt was clear from the testimony that Mr. Dick was an experienced hunter. Petitioner testified that he kept the shotgun in the barn because of attacks on his sheep by vicious dogs during the preceding year. A number of the sheep had been killed in this manner. In addition, Dick had mentioned seeing foxes near the barn. Mrs. Dick testified that when her husband went hunting, he sometimes borrowed his father's gun because he didn't trust his own. She was with him once when the gun wouldn't fire and had been told that occasionally it fired accidentally. In addition, Dick's brother testified that while hunting \n\n[359 \nU.S. 437, 442]\n\u00a0\n with Dick he heard a shot at an unexpected time which Dick explained as an accidental discharge that occurred \"once in a while.\" The gun was over 26 years old.\n\nThe sheriff testified that after the death he tested Dick's gun by cocking and dropping it a number of times.\n2\n The triggers did not release on any of these occasions. The sheriff also explained that the gun had a safety and could not discharge with the safety on. The safety was off during each of his tests. Finally, the sheriff stated that each trigger had approximately a seven-pound trigger pull.\n\nNo suicide notes were found. Mr. Dick had said nothing to his relatives or friends concerning suicide. He left no will.\n\nAt the conclusion of the evidence, respondent unsuccessfully moved for a directed verdict. The court charged the jury that under state law accidental death should be presumed and that respondent had the burden to show by a fair preponderance of the evidence that Dick committed suicide. The jury returned a verdict of $7,500 for petitioner. Respondent's motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for new trial were denied.\n\nIn this Court and before the Court of Appeals, both parties assumed that the propriety of the District Court's refusal to grant respondent's motions was a matter of North Dakota law. Under that law, it is clear that under the circumstances present in this case a presumption arises, which has the weight of affirmative evidence, that death was accidental. Svihovec v. Woodmen Accident \n\n[359 \nU.S. 437, 443]\n\u00a0\n Co., 69 N. D. 259, 285 N. W. 447. See Paulsen v. Modern Woodmen of America, 21 N. D. 235, 130 N. W. 231; Clemens v. Royal Neighbors of America, 14 N. D. 116, 103 N. W. 402; Stevens v. Continental Casualty Co., 12 N. D. 463, 97 N. W. 862.\n3\n Proof of coverage and of death by gunshot wound shifts the burden to the insurer to establish that the death of the insured was due to his suicide. Svihovec v. Woodmen Accident Co., supra. Under North Dakota law, this presumption does not disappear once the insurer presents any evidence of suicide. Ibid. Rather, the presumed fact (accidental death) continues and a plaintiff is entitled to affirmative instructions to the jury concerning its existence and weight.\n4\n This is not to say that under North Dakota law the presumption of accidental death may not be overcome by so much evidence that the insurer is entitled to a directed verdict. For it is clear that where \"there is no evidence in the record that can be said to be inconsistent with the conclusion of death by suicide,\" or \"the facts and circumstances surrounding the death [can] not be reconciled with any reasonable theory of accidental or nonintentional injury,\" the state court may direct a verdict for the insurer even though the insurer is charged with the burden of proving that death was caused by suicide.\n5\n These state rules determine when \n\n[359 \nU.S. 437, 444]\n\u00a0\n the evidence in a \"suicide\" case is sufficient to go to a jury. They are not directed at determining when the presumption of accidental death is rebutted, and thus excised from the case, because, as stated above, the presumed fact of accidental death continues throughout the trial and has the weight of affirmative evidence.\n\nThe Court of Appeals, in its opinion, reviewed the evidence in detail and resolved at least one disputed point in respondent's favor. It found, as \"definitely established by the evidence,\" that \"neither barrel [of the shotgun] could have been fired unless someone or something either pulled or pushed one of the triggers.\" It stated that \"[o]ne can believe that even an experienced hunter might accidentally shoot himself once, but the asserted theory that he could accidentally shoot himself first with one barrel and then with the other stretches credulity beyond the breaking point.\"\n6\n And it concluded that the facts and circumstances could not \"be reconciled with any reasonable theory of accident, and that, under the evidence, the question whether the death was accidental was not a question of fact for the jury.\" Judgment was reversed with directions to dismiss the complaint. 252 F.2d 43. We granted certiorari, \n357 \nU.S. 925\n.\n\nLurking in this case is the question whether it is proper to apply a state or federal test of sufficiency of the evidence to support a jury verdict where federal jurisdiction \n\n[359 \nU.S. 437, 445]\n\u00a0\n is rested on diversity of citizenship. On this question, the lower courts are not in agreement. Compare Rowe v. Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines, 231 F.2d 922; Cooper v. Brown, 126 F.2d 874; Lovas v. General Motors Corp., 212 F.2d 805, with Davis Frozen Foods v. Norfolk Southern R. Co., 204 F.2d 839; Reuter v. Eastern Air Lines, 226 F.2d 443; Diederich v. American News Co., 128 F.2d 144. And see Morgan, Choice of Law Governing Proof, 58 Harv. L. Rev. 153, 174, and 5 Moore's Federal Practice (2d ed. 1951) 38.10. But the question is not properly here for decision because, in the briefs and arguments in this Courts, both parties assumed that the North Dakota standard applied.\n7\n Moreover, although the Court of Appeals appears to have applied the state standard, that court did not discuss the issue. Under these circumstances, we will not reach out to decide this important question particularly where, in the context of this case, the two standards are substantially the same.\n8\n A decision as to which standard should be applied can well be left to another case where the question is briefed and argued. This case can be decided on the simple issue stated at the outset of the opinion.\n\nIn our view, the Court of Appeals improperly reversed the judgment of the District Court. It committed its basic error in resolving a factual dispute in favor of respondent that the shotgun would not fire unless someone or something pulled the triggers. Petitioner's evidence on this score, despite the \"tests\" performed by the sheriff, could support a jury conclusion that the gun might have \n\n[359 \nU.S. 437, 446]\n\u00a0\n fired accidentally from other causes. Once an accidental discharge is possible, a jury could rationally conceive of a number of explanations of accidental death which were consistent with evidence which the jury might well have believed showed the overwhelming improbability of suicide. The record indisputably shows lack of motive - in fact there is affirmative evidence from which the jury could infer that Dick was a most unlikely suicide prospect. He was relatively healthy, financially secure, happily married, well liked, and apparently emotionally stable. He left nothing behind to indicate that he had committed suicide and nothing in his conduct before death indicated an intention to destroy himself. The timing of the death, while in the midst of normal chores and immediately preceding a planned appointment with neighbors, militates against such a conclusion. Dick's presence in the shed and the accessibility of the gun are explicable in view of the fact that dogs had previously attacked his sheep and the fact that the door in the shed provided a convenient exit to the adjoining fields. And a jury could well believe it improbable that a man would not even bother to remove his bulky gloves, or thick jacket, when he intended to commit suicide even though those articles of clothing made it difficult to turn the gun on himself.\n\nIn a case like this one, North Dakota presumes that death was accidental and places on the insurer the burden of proving that death resulted from suicide. Stevens v. Continental Casualty Co., supra; Paulsen v. Modern Woodmen of America, supra. Under the Erie rule,\n9\n presumptions (and their effects) and burden of proof are \"substantive\" and hence respondent was required to shoulder the burden during the instant trial. Palmer v. Hoffman, \n318 \nU.S. 109\n; Cities Service Oil Co. v. Dunlap, \n308 \nU.S. 208\n. And see Balchunas v. Palmer, 151 F.2d 842; \n\n[359 \nU.S. 437, 447]\n\u00a0\n Sylvania Electric Products v. Barker, 228 F.2d 842; Matsumoto v. Chicago & N. W. R. Co., 168 F.2d 496. After all the evidence was in, the district judge, who was intimately concerned with the trial and who has a firsthand knowledge of the applicable state principles, believed that the case should go to the jury. Under all the circumstances, we believe that he was correct and that reasonable men could conclude that the respondent failed to satisfy its burden of showing that death resulted from suicide.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The gun was a Stevens, 12 gauge, double barreled shotgun with two triggers placed one behind the other. It weighed approximately seven pounds. It had an over-all length of 46 inches and measured 32 inches from muzzle to triggers.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The sheriff stated that he did not \"pretend to be an expert as far as shotguns are concerned.\" His tests consisted of dropping the gun with the muzzle down ten times from a height of ten inches and holding the gun with the butt down about ten inches from the floor and dropping it on a board eight or ten times. He also placed the gun in a normal shooting position against his shoulder and swung the barrel against an obstacle three or four times.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] This statement of the presumption and its weight accords with the requirements of N. D. Rev. Code, 1943, 31-1101, which provides:\n\n\"A presumption, unless declared by law to be conclusive, may be controverted by other direct or indirect evidence but unless so controverted, the jurors are bound to find according to the presumption.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Respondent's argument below that the court should adopt the \"modern\" rule on the effect of presumptions, see, e. g., 9 Wigmore On Evidence (3d ed. 1940) 2491, was rejected. The \"modern\" rule was applied by this Court in New York Life Ins. Co. v. Gamer, \n303 \nU.S. 161\n, a decision predating Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n. For the subsequent history of the Gamer case, see 106 F.2d 375.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Svihovec v. Woodmen Accident Co., supra; Clemens v. Royal Neighbors of America, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The Court of Appeals admitted the improbability of Dick's being able to pull the triggers with bulky gloves on but believed that this was offset by the probability that he used the screwdriver to push the triggers. This resolution of the facts seems strained indeed. The presence of the screwdriver was accounted for by testimony indicating that it was used to open the silage shed door. And the jury could reject as improbable the court's implicit theory that a man mortally wounded in the chest and bulkily clothed could hold a heavy shotgun at arm's length and shoot off his head particularly when he was wearing heavy gloves that could only be inserted in the trigger guard with difficulty.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Respondent argued that the North Dakota rule on presumptions should be abandoned in favor of the \"modern\" rule, see note 4, supra, but the record does not show that it argued for the application of the federal standard of sufficiency of the evidence.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Compare Brady v. Southern R. Co., \n320 \nU.S. 476, 479\n-480, and Bailey v. Central Vermont R. Co., \n319 \nU.S. 350, 353\n, with Svihovec v. Woodmen Accident Co., supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART, concurring.\n\nI concur in the judgment, believing that the district judge correctly followed applicable North Dakota law in submitting this case to the jury. Not having been a member of the Court when the petition for certiorari was granted, \n357 \nU.S. 925\n, I consider it inappropriate now to express a view as to the wisdom of bringing here a case like this.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, whom MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER joins, dissenting.\n\nOn several occasions I have stated the reasons for my adherence to the traditional practice of the Court not to note dissent from the Court's disposition of petitions for certiorari.\n1\n Different considerations apply once a case is decided. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 437, 448]\n\u00a0\n\n\nEstablishment of intermediate appellate courts in 1891\n2\n was designed by Congress to relieve the overburdened docket of the Court.\n3\n The Circuit Courts of Appeals were to be equal in dignity to the Supreme Courts of the several States.\n4\n The essential purpose of the Evarts Act was to enable the Supreme Court to discharge its indispensable functions in our federal system by relieving it of the duty of adjudication in cases that are important only to the litigants.\n5\n The legislative history of the Evarts Act demonstrates that it was clear in 1891 no less than today that litigation allowed to be brought into the federal courts solely on the basis of diversity of citizenship is rarely of moment except to the parties.\n6\n The Act provided, therefore, that in diversity cases \"the judgments or decrees of the circuit courts of appeals shall be final.\"\n7\n In a provision which Senator Evarts referred to as a \"weakness\" in the Act,\n8\n this Court was given the discretionary power to grant certiorari in these cases, to be exercised if some question of general interest, outside the limited scope of an ordinary diversity litigation, was also involved.\n9\n\u00a0\n\nAny hesitance which Senator Evarts may have felt was not justified by the early history of use of this certiorari power. The Court, mindful of the reasons for the restriction, so long and eagerly sought by the Court itself, on its obligatory jurisdiction, and faithful to the complementary obligation imposed upon it by its newly \n\n[359 \nU.S. 437, 449]\n\u00a0\n conferred power to control its docket, exercised the greatest restraint and caution in granting certiorari in cases resting solely on diversity of citizenship.\n10\n\u00a0\n\nTime and again in the years immediately following the passage of the Evarts Act this Court stated that it was only in cases of \"gravity and general importance\" or \"to secure uniformity of decision\" that the certiorari power should be exercised.\n11\n Mr. Justice Brewer explained the Court's wariness in granting certiorari in terms of the purpose of the Act:\n\n\"Obviously, a power so broad and comprehensive, if carelessly exercised, might defeat the very thought and purpose of the act creating the courts of appeal. So exercised it might burden the docket of this court with cases which it was the intent of Congress to terminate in the Courts of Appeal, and which, brought here, would simply prevent that promptness of decision which in all judicial actions is one of the elements of justice.\"\n12\n\u00a0\n\n\n In order to justify the establishment of the Circuit Courts of Appeals it was necessary to view certiorari as\n\n\"a power which will be sparingly exercised, and only when the circumstances of the case satisfy us that \n\n[359 \nU.S. 437, 450]\n\u00a0\n the importance of the question involved, the necessity of avoiding conflict between two or more Courts of Appeal, or between Courts of Appeal and the courts of a State, or some matter affecting the interests of this nation in its internal or external relations, demands such exercise.\"\n13\n\u00a0\n\n\n These considerations have led the Court in scores of cases to dismiss the writ of certiorari even after oral argument when it became manifest that the writ was granted under a misapprehension of the true issues.\n14\n Cases which raised as their sole question the sufficiency of evidence for submission to a jury were not regarded as complying with the standards necessitated by the purposes of \n\n[359 \nU.S. 437, 451]\n\u00a0\n the Evarts Act for limiting the power of review by certiorari.\n15\n\u00a0\n\nTo strengthen further this Court's control over its docket and to avoid review of cases which in the main raise only factual controversies, Congress in 1916 made cases arising under the Federal Employers' Liability Act final in the Courts of Appeals, reviewable by this Court only when required by the guiding standards for exercising its certiorari jurisdiction.\n16\n The Senate Report which accompanied this bill to the floor of the Senate suggested that this change would allow the Supreme Court more time for \"expeditious determination of those [cases] having real substance.\"\n17\n\u00a0\n\nIn 1925 Congress enacted the \"Judges' Bill,\"\n18\n called such because it was drafted by a committee of this Court composed of Van Devanter, McReynolds, and Sutherland, JJ.\n19\n At the hearings on the bill these Justices and Mr. Chief Justice Taft explained the bill and also the Court's past practice in respecting the limitations \n\n[359 \nU.S. 437, 452]\n\u00a0\n of its certiorari jurisdiction.\n20\n These authoritative expositions and assurances to Congress, on the basis of which Congress sharply restricted the Court's obligatory jurisdiction, admit of no doubt, contain no ambiguity. Mr. Chief Justice Taft said:\n\n\"No litigant is entitled to more than two chances, namely, to the original trial and to a review, and the intermediate courts of review are provided for that purpose. When a case goes beyond that, it is not primarily to preserve the rights of the litigants. The Supreme Court's function is for the purpose of expounding and stabilizing principles of law for the benefit of the people of the country, passing upon constitutional questions and other important questions of law for the public benefit. It is to preserve uniformity of decision among the intermediate courts of appeal.\"\n21\n\u00a0\n\n\n The House Report, in recommending to the House of Representatives passage of the bill, stated the matter succinctly:\n\n\"The problem is whether the time and attention and energy of the court shall be devoted to matters of large public concern, or whether they shall be consumed \n\n[359 \nU.S. 437, 453]\n\u00a0\n by matters of less concern, without especial general interest, and only because the litigant wants to have the court of last resort pass upon his right.\"\n22\n\u00a0\n\n\n Though various objections to certain jurisdictional changes worked by the bill were voiced on the floor of the Senate, even critical Senators recognized the great difference between the Supreme Court and other appellate tribunals. Thus Senator Copeland:\n\n\"The United States Supreme Court is one of the three great coordinate branches of the Government, and its time and labor should, generally speaking, be devoted to matters of general interest and importance and not to deciding private controversies between citizens involving no questions of general public importance.\"\n23\n\u00a0\n\n\n In correspondence between Senator Copeland and Mr. Chief Justice Taft, the latter wrote: \"The appeal to us should not be based on the right of a litigant to have a second appeal.\"\n24\n\u00a0\n\nThis understanding of the role of the Supreme Court and the way in which it is to be maintained in observing the scope of certiorari jurisdiction, are clearly set forth in a contemporary exposition by Mr. Chief Justice Taft of the purposes of the Judiciary Act of 1925:\n\n\"The sound theory of that Act [Act of 1891] and of the new Act is that litigants have their rights sufficiently protected by a hearing or trial in the courts of first instance, and by one review in an intermediate appellate Federal court. The function of the Supreme Court is conceived to be, not the remedying of a particular litigant's wrong, but the consideration \n\n[359 \nU.S. 437, 454]\n\u00a0\n of cases whose decision involves principles, the application of which are of wide public or governmental interest, and which should be authoritatively declared by the final court.\"\n25\n\u00a0\n\n\n Questions of fact have traditionally been deemed to be the kind of questions which ought not to be recanvassed here unless they are entangled in the proper determination of constitutional or other important legal issues. In Newell v. Norton, 3 Wall. 257, Mr. Justice Grier stated the considerations weighing against Supreme Court review of factual determinations: \"It would be a very tedious as well as a very unprofitable task to again examine and compare the conflicting statements of the witnesses in this volume of depositions. And, even if we could make our opinion intelligible, the case could never be a precedent for any other case, or worth the trouble of understanding.\" 3 Wall. at 267. And he issued this caveat: \"Parties ought not to expect this court to revise their decrees merely on a doubt raised in our minds as to the correctness of their judgment, on the credibility of witnesses, or the weight of conflicting testimony.\" 3 Wall., at 268. In Houston Oil Co. v. Goodrich, \n245 \nU.S. 440\n, certiorari was dismissed as improvidently granted after it became apparent that the only question in the case was the \"propriety of submitting\" certain questions to the jury and this \"depended essentially upon an appreciation of the evidence.\" \n245 \nU.S., at 441\n. Testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee in hearings concerning the Judges' Bill, Mr. Justice Van Devanter related a similar incident.\n26\n The proper use of the discretionary \n\n[359 \nU.S. 437, 455]\n\u00a0\n certiorari jurisdiction was on a later occasion thus expounded by Mr. Chief Justice Hughes:\n\n\"Records are replete with testimony and evidence of facts. But the questions on certiorari are questions of law. So many cases turn on the facts, principles of law not being in controversy. It is only when the facts are interwoven with the questions of law which we should review that the evidence must be examined and then only to the extent that it is necessary to decide the questions of law.\n\n\n \"This at once disposes of a vast number of factual controversies where the parties have been fully heard in the courts below and have no right to burden the Supreme Court with the dispute which interests no one but themselves.\"\n27\n\u00a0\n\n\n What are the questions which petitioner here presses upon us? The petition for certiorari sets forth as the questions presented: (1) was petitioner deprived of her constitutional right to a jury trial guaranteed by the Seventh Amendment? (2) did the Court of Appeals refuse to follow North Dakota law as it was required to do under Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n? If this case raises a question under the Seventh Amendment, so does every granted motion for dismissal of a complaint calling for trial by jury, every direction of verdict, every judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Fabulous inflation cannot turn these conventional motions turning on appreciation of evidence into constitutional issues, nor can the many diversity cases sought to be brought here on contested questions of evidentiary weight be similarly transformed by insisting before this Court that the Constitution has been violated. This verbal smoke screen cannot obscure the truth that all that is involved is an appraisal of the \n\n[359 \nU.S. 437, 456]\n\u00a0\n fair inferences to be drawn from the evidence. Chief Judge Magruder has expressed the common sense of the matter:\n\n \"If an appellate court is of the view that the trial court made an error of judgment in withdrawing a case from the jury, or in entering judgment for the defendant notwithstanding a plaintiff's verdict, a reversal [by a Court of Appeals] is no doubt called for; but we cannot see that anything is gained by blowing up that error of judgment into a denial of the constitutional right to a jury trial as guaranteed by the Seventh Amendment.\"\n28\n\u00a0\n\n\n Petitioner's insistence that the Court of Appeals ignored or acted at variance with the law of North Dakota is disproved by the citation and discussion of the relevant North Dakota decision in the opinion below. See 252 F.2d 43, 46. The test of sufficiency applied by the Court of Appeals below is the same test which petitioner asks us to apply, and is the test established by the North Dakota Supreme Court in Svihovec v. Woodmen Acc. Co., \n\n[359 \nU.S. 437, 457]\n\u00a0\n 69 N. D. 259, 285 N. W. 447. \"Our conclusion,\" the opinion below announced, \"is that the infliction of two wounds in succession, one in the left side in close proximity to the heart, and the other in the head, cannot be reconciled with any reasonable theory of accident, and that, under the evidence, the question whether the death was accidental was not a question of fact for the jury.\" 252 F.2d 43, 47. Thus, as the record was interpreted by the Court of Appeals the evidence fell short of the requirements of North Dakota law for submission to a jury. It might be noted that its interpretation of the record would have required the same result were federal law to determine sufficiency. We have held that \"[w]hatever may be the general formulation, the essential requirement is that mere speculation be not allowed to do duty for probative facts, after making due allowance for all reasonably possible inferences favoring the party whose case is attacked.\"\n29\n\u00a0\n\nAlike in Congress and here it has been repeatedly insisted that a question like that raised by petitioner - was there sufficient evidence for submission to a jury - is not proper for review in this Court. The circumstances in the type of situation before us are infinite in their variety. Judicial judgments upon such circumstances are bound to vary with the particularities of the individual situation. The decision in each case is a strictly particular adjudication - a unique case since it turns on unique facts - and cannot have precedential value. Of course it is of interest, perhaps of great importance to the parties, but only as such and not independently of any general public interest.\n\nThe considerations that demand strict adherence by the Court to the rules it has laid down for the bar in \n\n[359 \nU.S. 437, 458]\n\u00a0\n applying for the exercise of the Court's \"sound judicial discretion\" in granting a writ of certiorari are not technical, in the invidious sense of the term. They go to the very heart of the effective discharge of this Court's functions. To bring a case here when there is no \"special and important\"\n30\n reason for doing so, when there is no reason other than the interest of a particular litigant, especially when the decision turns solely on a view of conflicting evidence or the application of a particular local doctrine decided one way rather than another by a Court of Appeals better versed in the field of such local law than we can possibly be, works inroads on the time available for due study and reflection of those classes of cases for the adjudication of which this Court exists.\n\nThe conditions that are indispensable for enabling this Court adequately to discharge the duties in its special keeping cannot be too consciously and too persistently kept in mind. The far-reaching and delicate problems that call for the ultimate judgment of the Nation's highest tribunal require vigor of thought and high effort, and their conservation, even for the ablest judges. Listening to arguments, examining records and briefs, analyzing the issues, investigating materials beyond what partisan counsel offer, constitute only a fraction of what goes into the judicial process of this Court.\n\nFor one thing, the types of cases that now come before the Court (as the present United States Reports compared with those of even a generation ago bear ample testimony) require to a considerable extent study of materials outside the legal literature. More important, however, the judgments of this Court are collective judgments. Such judgments presuppose ample time and freshness of mind for private study and reflection in preparation for discussion at Conference. Without adequate study there cannot \n\n[359 \nU.S. 437, 459]\n\u00a0\n be adequate reflection; without adequate reflection there cannot be adequate discussion; without adequate discussion there cannot be that fruitful interchange of minds which is indispensable to thoughtful, unhurried decision and its formulation in learned and impressive opinions. It is therefore imperative that the docket of the Court be kept down so that its volume does not preclude wise adjudication. This can be avoided only if the Court rigorously excludes any case from coming here that does not rise to the significance of inescapability in meeting the responsibilities vested in this Court.\n\nAdjudication is, of course, the most exacting and most time-consuming of the Court's labors; it is by no means the whole story. In 1925 the Congress, by withdrawing all but a few categories of cases which can come to the Court as a matter of right, gave to the Court power to control its docket, to control, that is, the volume of its business. Congress conferred this discretionary power on the Court's own urging that this was necessary if the proper discharge of the Court's indispensable functions were to be rendered feasible. The process of screening those cases which alone justify adjudication by the Supreme Court is in itself a very demanding aspect of the Court's work. The litigious tendency of our people and the unwillingness of litigants to rest content with adverse decisions after their cause has been litigated in two and often in three courts, lead to attempts to get a final review by the Supreme Court in literally thousands of cases which should never reach the highest Court of the land.\n31\n The examination of the papers in these cases, to sift out the few that properly belong in this Court from the very many that have no business here, is a laborious \n\n[359 \nU.S. 437, 460]\n\u00a0\n process in a Court in which every member is charged and properly charged with making an independent examination of the right of access to the Court.\n32\n\u00a0\n\nEvery time the Court grants certiorari in disregard of its own professed criteria, it invites disregard of the responsibility of lawyers enjoined upon the bar by the Court's own formal rules and pronouncements. It is idle to preach obedience to the justifying considerations for filing petitions for certiorari, which Mr. Chief Justice Taft and his successors and other members of the Court have impressively addressed to the bar year after year, if the Court itself disregards the code of conduct by which it seeks to bind the profession. Lawyers not unnaturally hope to draw a prize in the lottery and even conscientious lawyers who feel it their duty, as officers of the Court, to obey the paper requirements of a petition for certiorari, may feel obligated to their clients not to abstain where others have succeeded. No doubt the most rigorous adherence to the criteria for granting certiorari will not prevent too many hopeless petitions for certiorari from being filed. But laxity by the Court in respecting its own rules is bound to stimulate petitions for certiorari with which the Court should never be burdened.\n\nTherefore, ever since Congress, in 1891, established the Courts of Appeals as the customary tribunal for final adjudication of the class of cases to which the present \n\n[359 \nU.S. 437, 461]\n\u00a0\n belongs, this Court has, as a rule, been resolute in guarding against abuse of its closely restricted discretionary certiorari jurisdiction. Due regard for our practice and for the vital jurisdictional principle which underlies it, compels the conclusion that this writ of certiorari should never have issued.\n\nHowever, if we are to review facts, we must establish and adhere to a rational standard of review. In so doing we cannot ignore the relevance to this task of the many expressions of the impropriety of such review. If it is unwise for this Court to grant review of cases turning solely on questions of fact, how much less wise to undertake to reassess the record in disregard of the reasoned assessment of the evidence by the Court of Appeals.\n\n \"The same considerations that should lead us to  leave undisturbed, by denying certiorari, decisions of  Courts of Appeals involving solely a fair assessment  of a record on the issue of unsubstantiality, ought to  lead us to do no more than decide that there was such  a fair assessment when the case is here, as this is, on  other legal issues.\n\n\n  \"This is not the place to review a conflict of evidence  nor to reverse a Court of Appeals because  were we in its place we would find the record tilting  one way rather than the other, though fair-minded  judges could find it tilting either way.\"\n33\n\u00a0\n\n\n It is the staple business of Courts of Appeals to examine records for the sufficiency of evidence. To undertake an independent review of the review by the Court of Appeals of evidence is neither our function nor within our special aptitude through constant practice. Such disregard of \n\n[359 \nU.S. 437, 462]\n\u00a0\n sound judicial administration is emphasized by the fact that the judges of the Court of Appeals are, by the very nature of the business with which they deal, far more experienced than we in dealing with evidence, ascertaining the facts, and determining the sufficiency of evidence to go to a jury.\n34\n If due regard be paid to the weighing of conflicting evidence and inferences drawn therefrom by these experienced judges, can it be fairly said that there was no reasoned justification for their conclusion and that their judgment was baseless? If not, we should leave undisturbed the judgment below.\n35\n After all, we are reviewing the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and it is its judgment that must be subjected to the rule of reason. Comparison of the Court of Appeals' opinion with the record made at the trial manifests scrupulous \n\n[359 \nU.S. 437, 463]\n\u00a0\n deference to the local law of North Dakota, as pronounced by its Supreme Court, and unmistakable care by the Court of Appeals in considering all the evidence and the inferences which the evidence reasonably yields. Whether we agree or disagree with its evaluation of the evidence, a tolerant judgment can surely not conclude that it does not represent a fair, judicial determination. If we are to consider the merits of the case, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] E. g., Maryland v.

UNITED STATES(1959)\nNo. 136\nArgued: December 11, 1958Decided: January 26, 1959\n\n\n\n\n An experienced federal narcotics agent was told by an informer, whose information the agent had always found to be accurate and reliable, that petitioner, whom the agent did not know but who was described by the informer, was peddling narcotics, had gone to Chicago to obtain a supply, and would return on a certain train on a certain day or the day after. The agent met the train, easily recognized petitioner from the informer's description, and, without a warrant, arrested him, searched him and seized narcotics and a hypodermic syringe found in his possession. These were later admitted in evidence over petitioner's objection at the trial at which he was convicted of violating a federal narcotics law. Held: The arrest, search and seizure were lawful and the articles seized were properly admitted in evidence at petitioner's trial. Pp. 308-314.\n\n (a) Even if the information received by the agent from the informer was \"hearsay,\" the agent was legally entitled to consider it in determining whether he had \"probable cause,\" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, and \"reasonable grounds,\" within the meaning of 26 U.S.C. 7607, to believe that petitioner had committed or was committing a violation of the narcotics laws. Pp. 310-312.\n\n\n (b) The information in the possession of the narcotics agent was sufficient to show probable cause and reasonable grounds to believe that petitioner had violated or was violating the narcotics laws and to justify his arrest without a warrant. Pp. 312-313.\n\n\n (c) The arrest was lawful, and the subsequent search and seizure, having been made incident to a lawful arrest, were likewise valid. Pp. 310-311, 314.\n\n\n 248 F.2d 295, affirmed.\n\nOsmond K. Fraenkel argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 307, 308]\n\u00a0\n\n\nLeonard B. Sand argued the cause for the United States. On the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Anderson, Beatrice Rosenberg and Jerome M. Feit.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner was convicted of knowingly concealing and transporting narcotic drugs in Denver, Colorado, in violation of 35 Stat. 614, as amended, 21 U.S.C. 174. His conviction was based in part on the use in evidence against him of two \"envelopes containing [865 grains of] heroin\" and a hypodermic syringe that had been taken from his person, following his arrest, by the arresting officer. Before the trial, he moved to suppress that evidence as having been secured through an unlawful search and seizure. After hearing, the District Court found that the arresting officer had probable cause to arrest petitioner without a warrant and that the subsequent search and seizure were therefore incident to a lawful arrest, and overruled the motion to suppress. 146 F. Supp. 689. At the subsequent trial, that evidence was offered and, over petitioner's renewed objection, was received in evidence, and the trial resulted, as we have said, in petitioner's conviction. The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, 248 F.2d 295, and certiorari was sought on the sole ground that the search and seizure violated the Fourth Amendment\n1\n and therefore the use of the heroin in evidence vitiated the conviction. We granted the writ to determine that question. \n357 \nU.S. 935\n. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 307, 309]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe evidence offered at the hearing on the motion to suppress was not substantially disputed. It established that one Marsh, a federal narcotic agent with 29 years' experience, was stationed at Denver; that one Hereford had been engaged as a \"special employee\" of the Bureau of Narcotics at Denver for about six months, and from time to time gave information to Marsh regarding violations of the narcotic laws, for which Hereford was paid small sums of money, and that Marsh had always found the information given by Hereford to be accurate and reliable. On September 3, 1956, Hereford told Marsh that James Draper (petitioner) recently had taken up abode at a stated address in Denver and \"was peddling narcotics to several addicts\" in that city. Four days later, on September 7, Hereford told Marsh \"that Draper had gone to Chicago the day before [September 6] by train [and] that he was going to bring back three ounces of heroin [and] that he would return to Denver either on the morning of the 8th of September or the morning of the 9th of September also by train.\" Hereford also gave Marsh a detailed physical description of Draper and of the clothing he was wearing,\n2\n and said that he would be carrying \"a tan zipper bag,\" and that he habitually \"walked real fast.\"\n\nOn the morning of September 8, Marsh and a Denver police officer went to the Denver Union Station and kept watch over all incoming trains from Chicago, but they did not see anyone fitting the description that Hereford had given. Repeating the process on the morning of September 9, they saw a person, having the exact physical attributes and wearing the precise clothing described by Hereford, alight from an incoming Chicago train and \n\n[358 \nU.S. 307, 310]\n\u00a0\n start walking \"fast\" toward the exit. He was carrying a tan zipper bag in his right hand and the left was thrust in his raincoat pocket. Marsh, accompanied by the police officer, overtook, stopped and arrested him. They then searched him and found the two \"envelopes containing heroin\" clutched in his left hand in his raincoat pocket, and found the syringe in the tan zipper bag. Marsh then took him (petitioner) into custody. Hereford died four days after the arrest and therefore did not testify at the hearing on the motion.\n\n26 U.S.C. (Supp. V) 7607, added by 104 (a) of the Narcotic Control Act of 1956, 70 Stat. 570, provides, in pertinent part:\n\n \"The Commissioner . . . and agents, of the Bureau of Narcotics . . . may -\n\n\n  .   .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"(2) make arrests without warrant for violations of any law of the United States relating to narcotic drugs . . . where the violation is committed in the presence of the person making the arrest or where such person has reasonable grounds to believe that the person to be arrested has committed or is committing such violation.\"\n\n\n The crucial question for us then is whether knowledge of the related facts and circumstances gave Marsh \"probable cause\" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, and \"reasonable grounds\" within the meaning of 104 (a), supra,\n3\n to believe that petitioner had committed or was committing a violation of the narcotic laws. If it did, the arrest, though without a warrant, was lawful \n\n[358 \nU.S. 307, 311]\n\u00a0\n and the subsequent search of petitioner's person and the seizure of the found heroin were validly made incident to a lawful arrest, and therefore the motion to suppress was properly overruled and the heroin was competently received in evidence at the trial. Weeks v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 383, 392\n; Carroll v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 132, 158\n; Agnello v. United States, \n269 \nU.S. 20, 30\n; Giordenello v. United States, \n357 \nU.S. 480, 483\n.\n\nPetitioner does not dispute this analysis of the question for decision. Rather, he contends (1) that the information given by Hereford to Marsh was \"hearsay\" and, because hearsay is not legally competent evidence in a criminal trial, could not legally have been considered, but should have been put out of mind, by Marsh in assessing whether he had \"probable cause\" and \"reasonable grounds\" to arrest petitioner without a warrant, and (2) that, even if hearsay could lawfully have been considered, Marsh's information should be held insufficient to show \"probable cause\" and \"reasonable grounds\" to believe that petitioner had violated or was violating the narcotic laws and to justify his arrest without a warrant.\n\nConsidering the first contention, we find petitioner entirely in error. Brinegar v. United States, \n338 \nU.S. 160, 172\n-173, has settled the question the other way. There, in a similar situation, the convict contended \"that the factors relating to inadmissibility of the evidence [for] purposes of proving guilt at the trial, deprive[d] the evidence as a whole of sufficiency to show probable cause for the search . . . .\" Id., at 172. (Emphasis added.) But this Court, rejecting that contention, said: \"[T]he so-called distinction places a wholly unwarranted emphasis upon the criterion of admissibility in evidence, to prove the accused's guilt, of the facts relied upon to show probable cause. That emphasis, we think, goes much too far in confusing and disregarding the difference between what is required to prove guilt in a criminal case and what is \n\n[358 \nU.S. 307, 312]\n\u00a0\n required to show probable cause for arrest or search. It approaches requiring (if it does not in practical effect require) proof sufficient to establish guilt in order to substantiate the existence of probable cause. There is a large difference between the two things to be proved [guilt and probable cause], as well as between the tribunals which determine them, and therefore a like difference in the quanta and modes of proof required to establish them.\"\n4\n\u00a0\n338 \nU.S., at 172\n-173.\n\nNor can we agree with petitioner's second contention that Marsh's information was insufficient to show probable cause and reasonable grounds to believe that petitioner had violated or was violating the narcotic laws and to justify his arrest without a warrant. The information given to narcotic agent Marsh by \"special employee\" \n\n[358 \nU.S. 307, 313]\n\u00a0\n Hereford may have been hearsay to Marsh, but coming from one employed for that purpose and whose information had always been found accurate and reliable, it is clear that Marsh would have been derelict in his duties had he not pursued it. And when, in pursuing that information, he saw a man, having the exact physical attributes and wearing the precise clothing and carrying the tan zipper bag that Hereford had described, alight from one of the very trains from the very place stated by Hereford and start to walk at a \"fast\" pace toward the station exit, Marsh had personally verified every facet of the information given him by Hereford except whether petitioner had accomplished his mission and had the three ounces of heroin on his person or in his bag. And surely, with every other bit of Hereford's information being thus personally verified, Marsh had \"reasonable grounds\" to believe that the remaining unverified bit of Hereford's information - that Draper would have the heroin with him - was likewise true.\n\n\"In dealing with probable cause, . . . as the very name implies, we deal with probabilities. These are not technical; they are the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act.\" Brinegar v. United States, supra, at 175. Probable cause exists where \"the facts and circumstances within [the arresting officers'] knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information [are] sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that\" an offense has been or is being committed. Carroll v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 132, 162\n.\n5\n\u00a0\n\n[358 \nU.S. 307, 314]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n We believe that, under the facts and circumstances here, Marsh had probable cause and reasonable grounds to believe that petitioner was committing a violation of the laws of the United States relating to narcotic drugs at the time he arrested him. The arrest was therefore lawful, and the subsequent search and seizure, having been made incident to that lawful arrest, were likewise valid.\n6\n It follows that petitioner's motion to suppress was properly denied and that the seized heroin was competent evidence lawfully received at the trial.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Fourth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States provides: \"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Hereford told Marsh that Draper was a Negro of light brown complexion, 27 years of age, 5 feet 8 inches tall, weighed about 160 pounds, and that he was wearing a light colored raincoat, brown slacks and black shoes.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The terms \"probable cause\" as used in the Fourth Amendment and \"reasonable grounds\" as used in 104 (a) of the Narcotic Control Act, 70 Stat. 570, are substantial equivalents of the same meaning. United States v. Walker, 246 F.2d 519, 526 (C. A. 7th Cir.); cf. United States v. Bianco, 189 F.2d 716, 720 (C. A. 3d Cir.).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] In United States v. Heitner, 149 F.2d 105, 106 (C. A. 2d Cir.), Judge Learned Hand said \"It is well settled that an arrest may be made upon hearsay evidence; and indeed, the `reasonable cause' necessary to support an arrest cannot demand the same strictness of proof as the accused's guilt upon a trial, unless the powers of peace officers are to be so cut down that they cannot possibly perform their duties.\"\n\nGrau v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 124, 128\n, contains a dictum that \"A search warrant may issue only upon evidence which would be competent in the trial of the offense before a jury (Giles v. United States, 284 Fed. 208; Wagner v. United States, 8 F. (2d) 581) . . . .\" But the principles underlying that proposition were thoroughly discredited and rejected in Brinegar v. United States, supra, \n338 \nU.S., at 172\n-174, and notes 12 and 13. There are several cases in the federal courts that followed the now discredited dictum in the Grau case, Simmons v. United States, 18 F.2d 85, 88; Worthington v. United States, 166 F.2d 557, 564-565; cf. Reeve v. Howe, 33 F. Supp. 619, 622; United States v. Novero, 58 F. Supp. 275, 279, but the great weight of authority is the other way. See, e. g., Wrightson v. United States, 236 F.2d 672 (C. A. D.C. Cir.); United States v. Heitner, supra (C. A. 2d Cir.); United States v. Bianco, 189 F.2d 716 (C. A. 3d Cir.); Wisniewski v. United States, 47 F.2d 825 (C. A. 6th Cir.); United States v. Walker, 246 F.2d 519 (C. A. 7th Cir.); Mueller v. Powell, 203 F.2d 797 (C. A. 8th Cir.). And see Note, 46 Harv. L. Rev. 1307, 1310-1311, criticizing the Grau dictum.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] To the same effect are: Husty v.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting.\n\nDecisions under the Fourth Amendment,\n1\n taken in the long view, have not given the protection to the citizen which the letter and spirit of the Amendment would seem to require. One reason, I think, is that wherever a culprit is caught red-handed, as in leading Fourth Amendment cases, it is difficult to adopt and enforce a rule that would turn him loose. A rule protective of law-abiding citizens is not apt to flourish where its advocates are usually criminals. Yet the rule we fashion is for the innocent and guilty alike. If the word of the informer \n\n[358 \nU.S. 307, 315]\n\u00a0\n on which the present arrest was made is sufficient to make the arrest legal, his word would also protect the police who, acting on it, hauled the innocent citizen off to jail.\n\nOf course, the education we receive from mystery stories and television shows teaches that what happened in this case is efficient police work. The police are tipped off that a man carrying narcotics will step off the morning train. A man meeting the precise description does alight from the train. No warrant for his arrest has been - or, as I see it, could then be - obtained. Yet he is arrested; and narcotics are found in his pocket and a syringe in the bag he carried. This is the familiar pattern of crime detection which has been dinned into public consciousness as the correct and efficient one. It is, however, a distorted reflection of the constitutional system under which we are supposed to live.\n\nWith all due deference, the arrest made here on the mere word of an informer violated the spirit of the Fourth Amendment and the requirement of the law, 26 U.S.C. (Supp. V) 7607, governing arrests in narcotics cases. If an arrest is made without a warrant, the offense must be committed in the presence of the officer or the officer must have \"reasonable grounds to believe that the person to be arrested has committed or is committing\" a violation of the narcotics law. The arresting officers did not have a bit of evidence, known to them and as to which they could take an oath had they gone to a magistrate for a warrant, that petitioner had committed any crime. The arresting officers did not know the grounds on which the informer based his conclusion; nor did they seek to find out what they were. They acted solely on the informer's word. In my view that was not enough.\n\nThe rule which permits arrest for felonies, as distinguished from misdemeanors, if there are reasonable grounds for believing a crime has been or is being committed (Carroll v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 132, 157\n), \n\n[358 \nU.S. 307, 316]\n\u00a0\n grew out of the need to protect the public safety by making prompt arrests. Id. Yet, apart from those cases where the crime is committed in the presence of the officer, arrests without warrants, like searches without warrants, are the exception, not the rule in our society. Lord Chief Justice Pratt in Wilkes v. Wood, 19 How. St. Tr. 1153, condemned not only the odious general warrant,\n2\n in which the name of the citizen to be arrested was left blank, but the whole scheme of seizures and searches\n3\n under \"a discretionary power\" of law officers to act \"wherever their suspicions may chance to fall\" - a practice which he denounced as \"totally subversive of the liberty of the subject.\" Id., at 1167. See III May, Constitutional History of England, c. XI. Wilkes had written in 1762, \"To take any man into custody, and deprive him of his liberty, without having some seeming foundation at least, on which to justify such a step, is inconsistent with wisdom and sound policy.\" The Life and Political Writings of John Wilkes, p. 372.\n\nGeorge III in 1777 pressed for a bill which would allow arrests on suspicion of treason committed in America. The words were \"suspected of\" treason and it was to these words that Wilkes addressed himself in Parliament. \"There is not a syllable in the Bill of the degree of probability attending the suspicion. . . . Is it possible, Sir, to give more despotic powers to a bashaw of the Turkish \n\n[358 \nU.S. 307, 317]\n\u00a0\n empire? What security is left for the devoted objects of this Bill against the malice of a prejudiced individual, a wicked magistrate . . . ?\" The Speeches of Mr. Wilkes, p. 102.\n\nThese words and the complaints against which they were directed were will known on this side of the water. Hamilton wrote about \"the practice of arbitrary imprisonments\" which he denounced as \"the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny.\" The Federalist No. 84. The writs of assistance, against which James Otis proclaimed,\n4\n were vicious in the same way as the general warrants, since they required no showing of \"probable cause\" before a magistrate, and since they allowed the police to search on suspicion and without \"reasonable grounds\" for believing that a crime had been or was being committed. Otis' protest was eloquent; but he lost the case. His speech, however, rallied public opinion. \"Then and there,\" wrote John Adams, \"the child Independence was born.\" 10 Life and Works of John Adams (1856), p. 248.\n\nThe attitude of Americans to arrests and searches on suspicion was also greatly influenced by the lettres de cachet extensively used in France.\n5\n This was an order emanating from the King and countersigned by a minister directing the seizure of a person for purposes of immediate imprisonment or exile. The ministers issued the lettres in an arbitrary manner, often at the request of the head of a noble family to punish a deviant son or relative. See Mirabeau, A Victim of the Lettres de Cachet, 3 Am. Hist. Rev. 19. One who was so arrested \n\n[358 \nU.S. 307, 318]\n\u00a0\n might remain incarcerated indefinitely, as no legal process was available by which he could seek release. \"Since the action of the government was secret, his friends might not know whither he had vanished, and he might even be ignorant of the cause of his arrest.\" 8 The Camb. Mod. Hist. 50. In the Eighteenth Century the practice arose of issuing the lettres in blank, the name to be filled in by the local mandatory. Thus the King could be told in 1770 \"that no citizen of your realm is guaranteed against having his liberty sacrificed to revenge. For no one is great enough to be beyond the hate of some minister, nor small enough to be beyond the hate of some clerk.\" III Encyc. Soc. Sci. 138. As Blackstone wrote, \". . . if once it were left in the power of any, the highest, magistrate to imprison arbitrarily whomever he or his officers thought proper, (as in France it is daily practiced by the crown,) there would soon be an end of all other rights and immunities.\" I Commentaries (4th ed. Cooley) *135.\n\nThe Virginia Declaration of Rights, adopted June 12, 1776, included the forerunner of the Fourth Amendment:\n6\n\u00a0\n\n  \"That general warrants, whereby an officer or  messenger may be commanded to search suspected  places without evidence of a fact committed, or to  seize any person or persons not named, or whose  offence is not particularly described and supported  by evidence, are grievous and oppressive, and ought  not to be granted.\" (Italics added.)\n\n\n The requirement that a warrant of arrest be \"supported by evidence\" was by then deeply rooted in history. And it is inconceivable that in those days, when the right of \n\n[358 \nU.S. 307, 319]\n\u00a0\n privacy was so greatly cherished, the mere word of an informer - such as we have in the present case - would be enough. For whispered charges and accusations, used in lieu of evidence of unlawful acts, were the main complaint of the age. Frisbie v. Butler, Kirby's Rep. (Conn.) 1785-1788, p. 213, decided in 1787, illustrates, I think, the mood of the day in the matter of arrests on suspicion. A warrant of arrest and search was issued by a justice of the peace on the oath of a citizen who had lost some pork from a cellar, the warrant stating, \"said Butler suspects one Benjamin Frisbie, of Harwinton, to be the person that hath taken said pork.\" The court on appeal reversed the judgment of conviction, holding inter alia that the complaint \"contained no direct charge of the theft, but only an averment that the defendant was suspected to be guilty.\" Id., at 215. Nothing but suspicion is shown in the instant case - suspicion of an informer, not that of the arresting officers. Nor did they seek to obtain from the informer any information on which he based his belief. The arresting officers did not have a bit of evidence that the petitioner had committed or was committing a crime before the arrest. The only evidence of guilt was provided by the arrest itself.\n\nWhen the Constitution was up for adoption, objections were made that it contained no Bill of Rights. And Patrick Henry was one who complained in particular that it contained no provision against arbitrary searches and seizures:\n\n \". . . general warrants, by which an officer may  search suspected places, without evidence of the commission  of a fact, or seize any person without evidence  of his crime, ought to be prohibited. As these are  admitted, any man may be seized, any property may  be taken, in the most arbitrary manner, without any  evidence or reason. Every thing the most sacred \n\n[358 \nU.S. 307, 320]\n\u00a0\n  may be searched and ransacked by the strong hand  of power. We have infinitely more reason to dread  general warrants here than they have in England,  because there, if a person be confined, liberty may  be quickly obtained by the writ of habeas corpus.  But here a man living many hundred miles from  the judges may get in prison before he can get that  writ.\" I Elliot's Debates 588.\n\n\n The determination that arrests and searches on mere suspicion would find no place in American law enforcement did not abate following the adoption of a Bill of Rights applicable to the Federal Government. In Conner v. Commonwealth, 3 Binn. (Pa.) 38, an arrest warrant issued by a magistrate stating his \"strong reason to suspect\" that the accused had committed a crime because of \"common rumor and report\" was held illegal under a constitutional provision identical in relevant part to the Fourth Amendment. \"It is true, that by insisting on an oath, felons may sometimes escape. This must have been very well known to the framers of our constitution; but they thought it better that the guilty should sometimes escape, than that every individual should be subject to vexation and oppression.\" Id., at 43-44. In Grumon v. Raymond, 1 Conn. 40, the warrant stated that \"several persons are suspected\" of stealing some flour which is concealed in Hyatt's house or somewhere else, and ordered the constable to search Hyatt's house or other places and arrest the suspected persons if found with the flour. The court held the warrant void, stating it knew of \"no such process as one to arrest all suspected persons, and bring them before a court for trial. It is an idea not to be endured for a moment.\" Id., at 44. See also Fisher v. McGirr, 1 Gray (Mass.) 1; Lippman v. People, 175 Ill. 101, 51 N. E. 872; Somerville v. Richards, 37 Mich. 299; Commonwealth v. Dana, 2 Metc. (Mass.) 329, 335-336. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 307, 321]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt was against this long background that Professors Hogan and Snee of Georgetown University recently wrote:\n\n\". . . it must be borne in mind that any arrest based on suspicion alone is illegal. This indisputable rule of law has grave implications for a number of traditional police investigative practices. The round-up or dragnet arrest, the arrest on suspicion, for questioning, for investigation or on an open charge all are prohibited by the law. It is undeniable that if those arrests were sanctioned by law, the police would be in a position to investigate a crime and to detect the real culprit much more easily, much more efficiently, much more economically, and with much more dispatch. It is equally true, however, that society cannot confer such power on the police without ripping away much of the fabric of a way of life which seeks to give the maximum of liberty to the individual citizen. The finger of suspicion is a long one. In an individual case it may point to all of a certain race, age group or locale. Commonly it extends to any who have committed similar crimes in the past. Arrest on mere suspicion collides violently with the basic human right of liberty. It can be tolerated only in a society which is willing to concede to its government powers which history and experience teach are the inevitable accoutrements of tyranny.\" 47 Geo. L. J. 1, 22.\n\n\n Down to this day our decisions have closely heeded that warning. So far as I can ascertain the mere word of an informer, not bolstered by some evidence\n7\n that a \n\n[358 \nU.S. 307, 322]\n\u00a0\n crime had been or was being committed, has never been approved by this Court as \"reasonable grounds\" for making an arrest without a warrant. Whether the act complained of be seizure of goods, search of premises, or the arrest of the citizen, the judicial inquiry has been directed toward the reasonableness of inferences to be drawn from suspicious circumstances attending the action thought to be unlawful. Evidence required to prove guilt is not necessary. But the attendant circumstances must be sufficient to give rise in the mind of the arresting officer at least to inferences of guilt. Locke v. United States, 7 Cranch 339; The Thompson, 3 Wall. 155; Stacey v. Emery, \n97 \nU.S. 642\n; Director General v. Kastenbaum, \n263 \nU.S. 25\n; Carroll v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 132, 159\n-162; United States v. Di Re, \n332 \nU.S. 581, 591\n-592; Brinegar v. United States, \n338 \nU.S. 160, 165\n-171.\n\nThe requirement that the arresting officer know some facts suggestive of guilt has been variously stated:\n\n\"If the facts and circumstances before the officer are such as to warrant a man of prudence and caution in believing that the offense has been committed, it is sufficient.\" Stacey v. Emery, supra, at 645.\n\n\n \". . . good faith is not enough to constitute probable cause. That faith must be grounded on facts within knowledge of the . . . agent, which in the judgment of the court would make his faith reasonable.\" Director General v. Kastenbaum, supra, at 28. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 307, 323]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Even when officers had information far more suggestive of guilt than the word of the informer used here, we have not sustained arrests without a warrant. In Johnson v. United States, \n333 \nU.S. 10, 16\n, the arresting officer not only had an informer's tip but he actually smelled opium coming out of a room; and on breaking in found the accused. That arrest was held unlawful. Yet the smell of opium is far more tangible direct evidence than an unverified report that someone is going to commit a crime. And in United States v. Di Re, supra, an arrest without a warrant of a man sitting in a car, where counterfeit coupons had been found passing between two men, was not justified in absence of any shred of evidence implicating the defendant, a third person. And see Giacona v. State, 164 Tex. Cr. R. 325, 298 S. W. 2d 587. Yet the evidence before those officers was more potent than the mere word of the informer involved in the present case.\n\nThe Court is quite correct in saying that proof of \"reasonable grounds\" for believing a crime was being committed need not be proof admissible at the trial. It could be inferences from suspicious acts, e. g., consort with known peddlers, the surreptitious passing of a package, an intercepted message suggesting criminal activities, or any number of such events coming to the knowledge of the officer. See People v. Rios, 46 Cal. 2d 297, 294 P.2d 39. But, if he takes the law into his own hands and does not seek the protection of a warrant, he must act on some evidence known to him.\n8\n The law goes for to protect \n\n[358 \nU.S. 307, 324]\n\u00a0\n the citizen. Even suspicious acts observed by the officers may be as consistent with innocence as with guilt. That is not enough, for even the guilty may not be implicated on suspicion alone. Baumboy v. United States, 24 F.2d 512. The reason is, as I have said, that the standard set by the Constitution and by the statute is one that will protect both the officer and the citizen. For if the officer acts with \"probable cause\" or on \"reasonable grounds,\" he is protected even though the citizen is innocent.\n9\n This important requirement should be strictly enforced, lest the whole process of arrest revert once more to whispered accusations by people. When we lower the guards as we do today, we risk making the role of the informer - odious in our history - once more supreme. I think the correct rule was stated in Poldo v. United States, 55 F.2d 866, 869. \"Mere suspicion is not enough; there must be circumstances represented to the officers through the testimony of their senses sufficient to justify them in a good-faith belief that the defendant had violated the law.\"\n\nHere the officers had no evidence - apart from the mere word of an informer - that petitioner was committing a crime. The fact that petitioner walked fast and carried a tan zipper bag was not evidence of any crime. The officers knew nothing except what they had been told by the informer. If they went to a magistrate to get a warrant of arrest and relied solely on the report of the informer, it is not conceivable to me that one would be granted. See Giordenello v. United States, \n357 \nU.S. 480, 486\n. For they could not present to the magistrate any of the facts which the informer may have had. They could swear only to the fact that the informer had made the accusation. They could swear to no evidence that lay in their own knowledge. They could \n\n[358 \nU.S. 307, 325]\n\u00a0\n present, on information and belief, no facts which the informer disclosed. No magistrate could issue a warrant on the mere word of an officer, without more.\n10\n See Giordenello v. United States, supra. We are not justified in lowering the standard when an arrest is made without a warrant and allowing the officers more leeway than we grant the magistrate.\n\nWith all deference I think we break with tradition when we sustain this arrest. We said in United States v. Di Re, supra, at 595, \". . . a search is not to be made legal by what it turns up. In law it is good or bad when it starts and does not change character from its success.\" In this case it was only after the arrest and search were made that there was a shred of evidence known to the officers that a crime was in the process of being committed.\n11\n\u00a0\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Fourth Amendment provides:\n\n\"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\" (Italics added.)\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The general warrant was declared illegal by the House of Commons in 1766. See 16 Hansard, Parl. Hist. Eng., 207.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The nameless general warrant was not the only vehicle for intruding on the privacy of the subjects without a valid basis for believing them guilty of offenses. In declaring illegal a warrant to search a plaintiff's house for evidence of libel, issued by the Secretary of State without any proof that the named accused was the author of the alleged libels, Lord Camden said, \"we can safely say there is no law in this country to justify the defendants in what they have done; if there was, it would destroy all the comforts of society.\" Entick v. Carrington, 2 Wils. K. B. 275, 291.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See Quincy's Mass. Rep., 1761-1772, Appendix I, p. 469.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] \"Experience . . . has taught us that the power [to make arrests, searches and seizures] is one open to abuse. The most notable historical instance of it is that of lettres de cachet. Our Constitution was framed during the seethings of the French Revolution. The thought was to make lettres de cachet impossible with us.\" United States v. Innelli, 286 F. 731.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] See also Maryland Declaration of Rights (1776), Art.

X.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Hale, who traced the evolution of arrests without warrants in The History of the Pleas of the Crown (1st Am. ed. 1847), states that while officers need at times to act on information from others, they must make that information, so far as they can, their own. He puts a case where A, suspecting B \"on reasonable grounds\" of being a felon, \n\n[358 \nU.S. 307, 322]\n\u00a0\n asks an officer to arrest B. The duty of the officer was stated as follows:\n\n\"He ought to inquire and examine the circumstances and causes of the suspicion of A. which tho he cannot do it upon oath, yet such an information may carry over the suspicion even to the constable, whereby it may become his suspicion as well as the suspicion of A.\" Id., at 91.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] United States v. Heitner, 149 F.2d 105, 106, that says an arrest may be made \"upon hearsay evidence\" was a case where the arrest was made after the defendant on seeing the officers tried to get away. Our cases cited by that court in support of the use of hearsay were Carroll v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 132\n; Dumbra v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 435\n; and Husty v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 694\n. But each of them was a case where the information on which the arrest was made, though perhaps not competent at the trial, was known to the arresting officer.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Maghan v. Jerome, 67 App. D.C. 9, 88 F.2d 1001; Pritchett v. Sullivan, 182 F. 480. See Ravenscroft v. Casey, 139 F.2d 776.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] See State v. Gleason, 32 Kan. 245, 4 P. 363; State v. Smith, 262 S. W. 65 (Mo. App.), arising under state constitutions having provisions comparable to our Fourth Amendment.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] The Supreme Court of South Carolina has said:\n\n\"Some things are to be more deplored than the unlawful transportation of whiskey; one is the loss of liberty. Common as the event may be, it is a serious thing to arrest a citizen, and it is a more serious thing to search his person; and he who accomplishes it, must do so in conformity to the laws of the land. There are two reasons for this: one to avoid bloodshed, and the other to preserve the liberty of the citizen. Obedience to law is the bond of society, and the officers set to enforce the law are not exempt from its mandates.\n\n\n\"In the instant case the possession of the liquor was the body of the offense; that fact was proven by a forcible and unlawful search of the defendant's person to secure the veritable key to the offense. It is fundamental that a citizen may not be arrested and have his person searched by force and without process in order to secure testimony against him. . . . It is better that the guilty shall escape, rather than another offense shall be committed in the proof of guilt.\" Town of Blacksburg v. Beam, 104 S. C. 146, 148, 88 S.

Bergan, for petitioners.\n  Mr. Godfrey P. Schmidt, for respondents (except Cunningham).\n  Mr. Martin F. O'Donoghue, for the Board of Monitors.\n  Mr. Raymond R. Dickey, for Distinti and others.\n\n\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER has filed the following memorandum:\n  For me, the reasons that govern the normal practice of the Court is not recording votes on dispositions of petitions for certiorari are controlling against departures from that practice. On appropriate occasions, however, I deem \n\n[361 \nU.S. 905\n, 906]\n\u00a0\n it desirable to indicate the issues presented by such a petition and the legal significance of its denial. Here, this will become manifest from the following memorandum in which on August 4, 1959, 19, as a Circuit Justice, I denied the application for a stay of the judgment, review of which is sought in this petition for certiorari:\n'This is an application for a stay of the decree entered on July 9, 1959, by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit against the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen, and Helpers of America, hereafter called the Teamsters, and certain of their officers, who, together with the Teamsters, will be called defendants. The litigation was initiated by thirteen members of locals of the Teamsters (one of whom has dissociated himself from the rest ), to be called plaintiffs. This application is in effect a review of the refusal of the Court of Appeals to grant such a stay.\n\n'The basis of the application is to enable defendants to file a petition for certiorari to review the decree of the Court of Appeals, the validity of which they propose to challenge and the enforcement of which, pending potential review and potential reversal here, will, they claim, cause them irreparable damage. Since the contemplated petition for certiorari cannot be considered prior to the reconvening of this Court on October 5, 1959, the threshold question on this application is whether the issues which defendants plan to bring before the Court are not of such a legal nature that they may fairly be deemed so lacking in substantiality as to preclude a reasonable likelihood of satisfying the considerations governing review on certiorari, as guided by Rule 19, 28 U.S.C.A., and the practice of the Court. Informed by the illuminating opinion of Judge Fahy, 106 U.S.A.pp.D.C. 70, 92, 269 F.2d 517, 539, and having had the advantage to hear elucidation of the issues by counsel for the parties and by the Chairman of the Board of Monitors appointed \n\n[361 \nU.S. 905\n, 907]\n\u00a0\n by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, as consent decree entered January 31, 1958 (the scope of which underlies the immediate litigation), I cannot say, on a balance of probabilities, that these issues may not commend themselves to at least four members of this Court as warranting review here of the decree below. I am confirmed in this view by the candid acknowledgment of the Chairman of the Board of Monitors and counsel for plaintiffs that serious legal questions are at stake.\n\n'Accordingly, the matter before me is reduced to the very narrow question whether I should overrule the discretion exercised by the Court of Appeals in refusing a stay of its mandate until October 12, which is the earliest day when this Court, in the normal course of affairs, will determine whether to grant the prospective petition for certiorari ( assuming that it will have duly come before the Court) and also determine, in case the petition be granted, that the decree to be reviewed is not to be enforced pending final adjudication.\n\n'As already indicated, at the core of this litigation is the scope of a consent decree entered in the District Court on January 31, 1958, and the power of the District Court, in enforcing that decree, to order the defendants to carry out the specific directions defined by the Court of Appeals in its decree of July 9, 1959, in accordance with the procedure defined in that decree and in the opinion which gave rise to it, rendered on June 10, 1959. By the consent decree, the defendants, as officers of the Teamsters, undoubtedly assumed certain obligations judicially enforcible. Whatever may or may not have been the freedom of action of these officers prior to this consent decree, by it their freedom of action was circumscribed to the extent that the consent decree imposed upon them enforcible obligations. The legal issue growing out of this voluntary restriction of defendants' action is the validity \n\n[361 \nU.S. 905\n, 908]\n\u00a0\n of specific recommendations by the Board of Monitors as judicially defined and approved. Such orders, as they have been defined by the Court of Appeals, are concededly unconsented and are challenged as unwarranted, unilateral modifications of the consent decree.\n\n'I have said that these specific commands, about half a dozen in number, restrict what is asserted to be the freedom of the power of officers of the Teamsters, claimed to be theirs under the constitution of the union. According to the Court of Appeals, these judicial commands upon the defendants are merely enforcement of the obligations which they undertook by the consent decree and are not one-sided modifications of it. This is the controversy to be raised by the petition for certiorari which the defendants plan to file. But, in any event, they claim that by denying a stay until the matter can duly come before this Court, the Court of Appeals has commanded them to take action of an irreparable nature claimed to be outside the scope of the consent decree and in derogation of the powers of the officers under the constitution of the Teamsters, before this Court has had an opportunity to pass on the petition for certiorari, with the derivative problem whether to keep matters in status quo until such a petition, if granted, could be disposed of on its merits.\n\n'If it were clear that between now and October 12, which is the earliest day for the disposition of the proposed petition for certiorari, what the Court of Appeals has directed to be done would be capable of being carried out so as to change, irrevocably and adversely, the rights and powers claimed by defendants, before this Court had an opportunity to determine the validity of what the defendants have been ordered to do, I would feel constrained to grant the stay. It may well be that the Court of Appeals, after due consideration, on July 15, 1959, denied this stay on its forecast that its decree could \n\n[361 \nU.S. 905\n, 909]\n\u00a0\n not, in view of all the circumstances, be effectuated before this Court could pass on a petition for certiorari, with the ancillary question of a stay in case such petition were granted. In any event, my appreciation of the intrinsic elements in carrying out the various items of the decree still left in controversy (several of them have become either moot or taken out of contest by agreement) leads me to conclude that, in the setting of the immediate circumstances, they are not of a nature to cause irreparable harm between now and October 12. I am reinforced in this conclusion by the responsible assurances of the Chairman of  course of events which will control such matters. The details of the half- dozen items in controversy are so specialized and technical that nothing would be gained by particularizing them.\n\n'One thing more does need to be said.\n\n'As is recognized by all concerned, judicial supervision of a union with a membership of 1,500,000 and some 800 locals through the agency of a mechanism like the Board of \n\n[361 \nU.S. 905\n, 910]\n\u00a0\n Monitors is an unusual manifestation of equity powers. Defendants seek to enlarge the significance of the immediate items in controversy by their anticipation of an expansion of the powers of the Board of Monitors and their resulting fear of disruption of forces within the Teamsters as well as a heavy drain on the Teamsters' treasury in the course of such far- flung judicial administration. These are matters not immediately involved in the decree of the Court of Appeals now before me. But I deem it appropriate to say that the Court of Appeals, in its decision of June 10, 1959, as well as on preliminary proceedings and in the procedure which it followed in formulating its decree of July 9, 1959, has manifested an alert understanding of the gravity of the litigation, and has made manifest its sense of the high importance of assuring the most protective procedure on the part of the Board of Monitors in making recommendations and of the District Court in issuing orders on the basis of such recommendations; it has been mindful of the importance of working out problems between the Monitors and the Teamsters on the basis of the ample consultation, with full regard for the interests of the membership of the union of which, after all, the union is the collective expression. As to the fear of excessive drain on the Teamsters' treasury, one may safely rely on the Court of Appeals in affording a shining example in the spending of other people's money. A court should be the most sensitive of fiduciaries. In sanctioning fees and other expenditures it will be guided by frugality and not generosity.' \n\n\n\n","44":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEX PARTE POWELL(1959)\nNo. 58\nArgued: Decided: October 19, 1959\n\n\n\n\n Certiorari granted; judgment vacated and case remanded to the District Court for a full hearing.\n\nPetitioner pro se.\n\nMacDonald Gallion, Attorney General of Alabama, and James W.

One of the principal violations found was that many of respondent's retail sales were falsely \"invoiced\" in violation of 3 of the Act.\n1\n The term \"invoice\" is defined in 2 (f) as \"a written account, memorandum, list, or catalog, which is issued in connection with any commercial dealing in fur products or furs, and describes the particulars of any fur products or furs, transported or delivered to a purchaser, consignee, factor, bailee, correspondent, or agent, or any other person who is engaged in dealing commercially in fur products or furs.\" Section 5 (b) provides that a fur product or fur is falsely \"invoiced\" if it is not \"invoiced\" to show (a) the name of the animal that produced the fur; and, where applicable, that the product (b) contains used fur, (c) contains bleached, dyed, or otherwise artificially colored fur, (d) is composed in whole or substantial part of paws, tails, bellies, or waste fur; (e) the name and address of the person issuing the \"invoice\"; and (f) the country of origin of any imported furs. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 385, 387]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Commission found that respondent had violated the \"invoice\" provisions of the Act by failure to include in many of its retail sales slips of fur products, (a) its address, (b) whether the fur was bleached, dyed, or otherwise artificially colored, and (c) the correct name of the animal producing the fur.\n\nThe Act in 4 also provides\n2\n that a fur product is misbranded (1) if it is \"falsely or deceptively labeled . . . or identified,\" (2) if there is not affixed a label setting forth substantially the same six items of information required \n\n[359 \nU.S. 385, 388]\n\u00a0\n for an \"invoice,\" or (3) if the label designates the animal that produced the fur by some name other than that prescribed in the Fur Products Name Guide.\n3\n The Commission found that the labels on respondent's fur products were false in numerous instances by reason of the failure to include information in three of the categories listed under the second part of 4. It held, however, that there was no evidence that the labels were deficient in the other three categories of information. Nevertheless, it issued a cease-and-desist order against misbranding by failure to include in the labels the required six categories of information, all of which were listed.\n\nOn appeal, the Court of Appeals first eliminated the prohibitions relating to invoicing on the ground that a retail sales slip was not an \"invoice\" within the meaning of the Act; and second, it struck from the order the prohibition against misbranding through omission of the three categories as to which no violations were found. 254 F.2d 18. The case is here on a petition for a writ of certiorari. \n358 \nU.S. 812\n.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nFirst, as to invoicing. We start with an Act whose avowed purpose, inter alia, was to protect \"consumers . . . against deception . . . resulting from the misbranding, false or deceptive advertising, or false invoicing of fur products and furs.\" S. Rep. No. 78, 82d Cong., 1st Sess., p. 1. The House Report also emphasizes that the bill was \"designed to protect consumers and others from widespread abuses\" arising out of false and misleading matter in advertisements and otherwise. H. R. Rep. No. 546, 82d Cong., 1st Sess., p. 1. The Title of the Act (which, though not limiting the plain meaning of the text, is nonetheless \n\n[359 \nU.S. 385, 389]\n\u00a0\n a useful aid in resolving an ambiguity (see Maguire v. Commissioner, \n313 \nU.S. 1, 9\n)), states that its purpose was to \"protect consumers and others against . . . false invoicing of fur products and furs.\" 65 Stat. 175. So we have an avowed purpose to protect retail purchasers against improper \"invoicing.\" We therefore should read 2 (f) which contains the definition of \"invoice\" hospitably with that end in view. Section 2 (f) is not unambiguous. Yet we do not have here the problem of a penal statute that deserves strict construction. We deal with remedial legislation of a regulatory nature where our task is to fit, if possible, all parts into an harmonious whole. Black v. Magnolia Liquor Co., \n355 \nU.S. 24, 26\n.\n\nSection 2 (f) uses \"invoice\" to include a \"written account\" and \"memorandum.\" So far a retail sales slip is included. Section 2 (f) requires the \"invoice\" to be issued \"in connection with any commercial dealing\" in furs. A retail sale is plainly a \"commercial dealing.\" Section 2 (f) requires the invoice to be issued to a \"purchaser.\" There again a customer of a retailer is a \"purchaser.\" The case for inclusion of a retail sales slip in \"invoice,\" as that term is used in the Act, would therefore seem to be complete. What turned the Court of Appeals the other way was the last phrase in 2 (f) - \"or any other person who is engaged in dealing commercially in fur products or furs.\" It held that \"engaged in dealing commercially\" modifies not only \"any other person\" but also all the other preceding terms in the subsection including \"purchaser.\" Cf. United States v. Standard Brewery, \n251 \nU.S. 210, 218\n. That is a possible construction. We conclude, however, that this limiting clause is to be applied only to the last antecedent.\n4\n We think it would \n\n[359 \nU.S. 385, 390]\n\u00a0\n be a partial mutilation of this Act to construe it so that the \"invoice\" provisions were inapplicable to retail sales. In the first place, the language of 2 (f) specifies in sweeping language the categories of persons for whose benefit the invoicing requirements were imposed, viz., purchaser, consignee, factor, bailee, correspondent, or agent. Then as a general catch-all \"any other person who is engaged in dealing commercially in fur products or furs\" was added. In the second place, only by construing \"invoice\" to include retail sales slips can the full protection of the Act be accorded consumers. We do not agree with the point stressed by respondent that the consumer's protection is to be found solely in the label on the fur product and that invoices are required only at each antecedent step of delivery or transfer to a person dealing commercially in either furs or fur products. The advertising and mislabeling prohibitions in 3 (b) of the Act\n5\n are plainly applicable to retail sales. Yet the prohibition of false invoices is contained in the same clause. If we held that Congress, in spite of its desire to protect consumers, withheld from them the benefits of reliable invoices, we would have to read the clauses of 3 distributively, making only some of them applicable to retail sales. That would be a refashioning of 3, an undertaking more consonant with the task of a congressional committee than with judicial construction.\n\nMoreover, fur product \"labels,\" we are advised, are not pieces of cloth sewn into garments but tags which the purchaser is likely to throw away after the purchase. The \"invoice\" is the only permanent record of the transaction that the retail purchaser has. Its importance was emphasized by the Commission:\n\n \"Inasmuch as the invoice may serve as a documentary link connecting the sale of specific fur \n\n[359 \nU.S. 385, 391]\n\u00a0\n products back through the retailer's records with advertisements therefor, the application of the invoicing provisions of the Act to transactions between retailers and consumers represents a key implement for effective administration of the Act.\"\n\n\n The inclusion of retail sales slips in invoices has been the consistent administrative construction of the Act.\n6\n This contemporaneous construction is entitled to great weight (United States v. American Trucking Assns., \n310 \nU.S. 534, 549\n; Black v. Magnolia Liquor Co., supra; Federal Housing Adm'n v. Darlington, Inc., \n358 \nU.S. 84, 90\n) even though it was applied in cases settled by consent rather than in litigation.\n\nFinally respondent urges that a retailer's sale is a local transaction not subject to the exercise by Congress of the commerce power. Misbranding a drug held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce was held to be within the commerce power in United States v. Sullivan, \n332 \nU.S. 689\n. That decision and its predecessors sanction what is done here.\n\nWe conclude that a retail sales slip is an \"invoice\" within the meaning of the Act and accordingly the judgment of the Court of Appeals setting aside the part of the cease-and-desist order which requires this retailer to give a proper \"invoice\" to each purchaser is reversed.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nSecond, as to false labeling. The Commission, as we have noted, found that respondent had committed numerous violations of three of the six disclosure requirements \n\n[359 \nU.S. 385, 392]\n\u00a0\n contained in 4 (2) of the Act,\n7\n noting that there was no evidence that it had not complied with the other three disclosure requirements of 4 (2). The cease-and-desist order of the Commission was however directed against \"misbranding fur products by: 1. Failing to affix labels to fur products showing\" each of the six categories of information required by 4 (2). The Court of Appeals struck from the order the prohibition with respect to the three categories as to which there was no evidence of violation.\n\nWe do not believe the Commission abused the \"wide discretion\" that it has in a choice of a remedy \"deemed adequate to cope with the unlawful practices\" disclosed by the record. Jacob Siegel Co. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, \n327 \nU.S. 608, 611\n. It is not limited to prohibiting \"the illegal practice in the precise form\" existing in the past. Federal Trade Comm'n v. Ruberoid Co., \n343 \nU.S. 470, 473\n. This agency, like others, may fashion its relief to restrain \"other like or related unlawful acts.\" Labor Board v. Express Pub. Co., \n312 \nU.S. 426, 436\n. The practice outlawed by 4 is \"misbranding.\" The disclosure required for a properly branded garment is specified. These disclosure requirements are so closely interrelated that the Commission might well conclude that a retailer who for example failed to disclose that the fur was bleached or dyed might well default when it came to disclosure of the fact that used fur was contained in the garment. One cannot generalize as to the proper scope of these orders. It depends on the facts of each case and a judgment as to the extent to which a particular violator should be fenced in. Here, as in Sherman Act decrees (Local 167 v. United States, \n291 \nU.S. 293, 299\n; International Salt Co. v. United States, \n332 \nU.S. 392, 400\n-401; International Boxing Club v. United States, \n358 \nU.S. 242\n, \n\n[359 \nU.S. 385, 393]\n\u00a0\n 253), the question of the extent to which related activity should be enjoined is one of kind and degree. We sit only to determine if the trier of facts has exercised an allowable discretion. Where the episodes of misbranding have been so extensive and so substantial in number as they were here,\n8\n we think it permissible for the Commission to conclude that like and related acts of misbranding should also be enjoined as a prophylactic and preventive measure.\n\nRespondent objects to the wording of the cease-and-desist order saying it suggests that the store has sold garments contrary to the disclosure requirements not found to have been violated here. The Commission bows to the suggestion that Part A, par. 1 of the cease-and-desist order be rephrased to enjoin \"misbranding fur products by failing to affix labels to fur products showing each element of information required by the Act.\" We so order.\n\nOn this phase of the case the judgment of the Court of Appeals is also reversed, the cease-and-desist order to be rephrased as we have indicated.\n\n    It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 3 provides in part:\n\n\"(a) The introduction, or manufacture for introduction, into commerce, or the sale, advertising or offering for sale in commerce, or the transportation or distribution in commerce, of any fur product which is misbranded or falsely or deceptively advertised or invoiced, within the meaning of this Act or the rules and regulations prescribed under section 8 (b), is unlawful and shall be an unfair method of competition, and an unfair and deceptive act or practice, in commerce under the Federal Trade Commission Act.\n\n\n\"(b) The manufacture for sale, sale, advertising, offering for sale, transportation or distribution, of any fur product which is made in whole or in part of fur which has been shipped and received in commerce, and which is misbranded or falsely or deceptively advertised or invoiced, within the meaning of this Act or the rules and regulations prescribed under section 8 (b), is unlawful and shall be an unfair method of competition, and an unfair and deceptive act or practice, in commerce under the Federal Trade Commission Act.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 4 provides:\n\n\"For the purposes of this Act, a fur product shall be considered to be misbranded -\n\n\n\"(1) if it is falsely or deceptively labeled or otherwise falsely or deceptively identified, or if the label contains any form of misrepresentation or deception, directly or by implication, with respect to such fur product;\n\n\n\"(2) if there is not affixed to the fur product a label showing in words and figures plainly legible -\n\n\n\"(A) the name or names (as set forth in the Fur Products Name Guide) of the animal or animals that produced the fur, and such qualifying statement as may be required pursuant to section 7 (e) of this Act;\n\n\n\"(B) that the fur product contains or is composed of used fur, when such is the fact;\n\n\n\"(C) that the fur product contains or is composed of bleached, dyed, or otherwise artificially colored fur, when such is the fact;\n\n\n\"(D) that the fur product is composed in whole or in substantial part of paws, tails, bellies, or waste fur, when such is the fact;\n\n\n\"(E) the name, or other identification issued and registered by the Commission, of one or more of the persons who manufacture such fur product for introduction into commerce, introduce it into commerce, sell it in commerce, advertise or offer it for sale in commerce, or transport or distribute it in commerce;\n\n\n\"(F) the name of the country of origin of any imported furs used in the fur product;\n\n\n\"(3) if the label required by paragraph (2) (A) of this section sets forth the name or names of any animal or animals other than the name or names provided for in such paragraph.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] This is a register of the names of hair, fleece, and fur-bearing animals which 7 of the Act requires the Commission to maintain.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Cf.

JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case presents, for the first time in this Court, issues relating to the availability of certain defenses to a prima facie violation of 2 (e) of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 730, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, 49 Stat. 1526.\n1\n The Federal Trade Commission has \n\n[360 \nU.S. 55, 57]\n\u00a0\n found that Simplicity Pattern Co., Inc., one of the Nation's largest dress pattern manufacturers, discriminated in favor of its larger customers by furnishing to them services and facilities not accorded to competing \n\n[360 \nU.S. 55, 58]\n\u00a0\n smaller customers on proportionally equal terms. The Commission held that neither the presence of \"cost justification\" nor the absence of competitive injury may constitute a defense to a 2 (e) violation.\n\nThe Court of Appeals found that competition existed between the larger and smaller customers of Simplicity and, with one judge dissenting, held that an absence of competitive injury would not constitute a \"justification\" rebutting a prima facie showing of a 2 (e) violation. Through a different majority,\n2\n however, it remanded the case on the \"cost justification\" defense under 2 (b), holding that Simplicity might rebut the prima facie case by showing that the discriminations in services and facilities were justified by differences in Simplicity's costs in dealing with the two classes of customers. 103 U.S. App. D.C. 373, 258 F.2d 673. The Commission, in No. 406, and Simplicity, in No. 447, filed cross-petitions for certiorari which we consider together. We granted both petitions because of the fundamental significance of these issues in the application of an important Act of Congress. \n358 \nU.S. 897\n. We have concluded that, given competition between the two classes of customers, neither absence of competitive injury nor the presence of \"cost justification\" \n\n[360 \nU.S. 55, 59]\n\u00a0\n defeats enforcement of the provisions of 2 (e) of the Act. The action of the Commission in issuing the cease-and-desist order is, therefore, affirmed.\n\nSimplicity manufactures and sells tissue patterns which are used in the home for making women's and children's wearing apparel. Its volume of pattern sales, in terms of sales units, is greater than that resulting from the combined effort of all other major producers.\n3\n The patterns are sold to some 12,300 retailers, with 17,200 outlets. For present purposes, these customers can be divided roughly into two categories. One, consisting largely of department and variety stores, comprises only 18% of the total number of customers, but accounts for 70% of the total sales volume. The remaining 82% of the customers are small stores whose primary business is the sale of yardgood fabrics.\n\nAbout 600 different patterns are made available to Simplicity's customers. New patterns are added at the rate of 40 per month, while three times annually the obsolete designs are discontinued so as to maintain the number of designs at a relatively constant level. The different designs are displayed in a catalogue which is changed monthly in order to reflect the changes in available designs. The patterns themselves are stored and displayed in steel cabinets. The catalogues and storage cabinets are both furnished by Simplicity.\n\nThe variety stores handle and sell a multitude of relatively low-priced articles. Each article, including dress patterns, is sold for the purpose of returning a profit and would be dropped if it failed to do so. The fabric stores, on the other hand, are primarily interested in selling yard goods; they handle patterns at no profit or even at a loss \n\n[360 \nU.S. 55, 60]\n\u00a0\n as an accommodation to their fabric customers and for the purpose of stimulating fabric sales. These differences in motive are reflected in the manner in which each type of store handles its patterns. The variety stores devote the minimum amount of display space consistent with adequate merchandising - consisting usually of nothing more than a place on the counter for the catalogues, with the patterns themselves stored underneath the counter in the steel cabinets furnished by Simplicity. In contrast, the fabric stores usually provide tables and chairs where the customers may peruse the catalogues in comfort and at their leisure.\n\nThe retail prices of Simplicity patterns are uniform at 25, 35, or 50. Similarly, Simplicity charges a uniform price, to all its customers, of 60% of the retail price. However, in the furnishing of certain services and facilities Simplicity does not follow this uniformity. It furnishes patterns to the variety stores on a consignment basis, requiring payment only as and when patterns are sold - thus affording them an investment-free inventory. The fabric stores are required to pay cash for their patterns in regular course. In addition, the cabinets and the catalogues are furnished to variety stores free while the fabric stores are charged therefor, the catalogues averaging from $2 to $3 each. Finally, all transportation costs in connection with its business with variety stores are paid by Simplicity but none is paid on fabric-store transactions.\n\nThe free services and facilities thus furnished variety store chains are substantial in value. As to four variety store chains, the catalogues which Simplicity furnished free in 1954 were valued at $128,904; the cabinets furnished free which those stores had on hand at the end of 1954 were valued at over $500,000; and their inventory of Simplicity's patterns at the end of 1954 was valued at \n\n[360 \nU.S. 55, 61]\n\u00a0\n more than $1,775,000, each of these values being based on Simplicity's usual sales price. Simplicity's president testified that it would cost over $2,000,000 annually to give its other customers the free transportation, free catalogues, and free cabinets furnished to variety stores.\n4\n\u00a0\n\n[360 \nU.S. 55, 62]\n\u00a0\n\n\nSimplicity does not dispute these findings. Assuming that the existence of competition between purchasers is a necessary element in a 2 (e) prosecution, it insists that no real competition in patterns exists between the variety and the fabric stores. It also contends that even if competition is present its conduct may be justified by a showing that no competitive injury resulted or, alternatively, that the discriminations are not unlawful if it could be shown that the differential treatment was only reflective of the differences in its costs in dealing with the two types of customers.\n\n  1. EXISTENCE OF COMPETITION.\n\n\n The unanimous conclusion of the Examiner, the Commission, and the Court of Appeals on this point was, as stated by the Court of Appeals, that the variety and fabric stores, \"operating in the same cities and in the same shopping area, often side by side, were competitors, purchasing from Simplicity at the same price and then at like prices retailing the identical product to substantially the same segment of the public.\" 103 U.S. App. D.C., at 377, 258 F.2d, at 677. Simplicity argues that \"motivation\" controls and that since the variety store sells for a profit and the fabric store for accommodation that the competition is minuscule. But the existence of competition does not depend on such motives. Regardless of the necessity the fabric stores find in the handling of patterns it does not remove their incentive to sell those on hand, especially when cash is tied up in keeping patterns on the \n\n[360 \nU.S. 55, 63]\n\u00a0\n shelves. The discriminatory terms under which they are obliged to handle them increase their losses. Furthermore, Simplicity not only takes advantage of the captive nature of the fabric stores in not granting them these advantages but compounds the damage by creating a sales outlet in the variety stores through the granting of these substantial incentives to engage in the pattern business. Without such partial subsidization the variety stores might not enter into the pattern trade at all.\n\nNor does it follow that the failure here to show specific injury to competition in patterns is inconsistent with a finding that competition in fact exists.\n5\n It may be, as Simplicity argues, that the sale of patterns is minuscule in the over-all business of a variety store, but the same is true of thousands of other items. While the giving of discriminatory concessions to a variety store on any one isolated item might cause no injury to competition with a fabric store in its over-all operation, that fact does not render nonexistent the actual competition between them in patterns. It remains, and, because of the discriminatory concessions, causes further losses to the fabric store. As this Court said in Federal Trade Comm'n v. Morton Salt Co., \n334 \nU.S. 37, 49\n (1948),\n\n  \"There are many articles in a grocery store that,  considered separately, are comparatively small parts  of a merchant's stock. Congress intended to protect  a merchant from competitive injury attributable to  discriminatory prices on any or all goods sold in interstate  commerce, whether the particular goods constituted \n\n[360 \nU.S. 55, 64]\n\u00a0\n  a major or minor portion of his stock. Since  a grocery store consists of many comparatively small  articles, there is no possible way effectively to protect  a grocer from discriminatory prices except by applying  the prohibitions of the Act to each individual  article in the store.\"\n\n\n  2. APPLICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION\n\n\n   DEFENSES OF 2 (b).\n\n\n Simplicity contends that an absence of competitive injury constitutes a defense under the justification provisions of 2 (b) and further that it should have been permitted, under that subsection, to dispel its discrimination in services and facilities by a showing of lower costs in its transactions with the variety stores. We agree with the Commission that the language of the Act, when considered in its entirety, will not support this construction.\n\nSection 2 (a) makes unlawful price discriminations\n\n \"where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially  to lessen competition or tend to create a  monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure,  destroy, or prevent competition . . . .\"\n\n\n This price discrimination provision is hedged with qualifications. An exception is made for price differentials \"which make only due allowance for differences in the cost of manufacture, sale, or delivery.\" Care was taken that price changes are not outlawed where made in response to changing market conditions. Finally, 2 (a) codifies the rule of United States v. Colgate & Co., \n250 \nU.S. 300\n (1919), protecting the right of a person in commerce to select his \"own customers in bona fide transactions and not in restraint of trade.\" \n\n[360 \nU.S. 55, 65]\n\u00a0\n\n\nSubsections (c), (d), and (e), on the other hand, unqualifiedly make unlawful certain business practices other than price discriminations.\n6\n Subsection (c) applies to the payment or receipt of commissions or brokerage allowances \"except for services rendered.\" Subsection (d) prohibits the payment by a seller to a customer for any services or facilities furnished by the latter, unless \"such payment . . . is available on proportionally equal terms to all other [competing] customers.\" Subsection (e), which as noted is the provision applicable in this case, makes it unlawful for a seller\n\n\"to discriminate in favor of one purchaser against another purchaser or purchasers of a commodity bought for resale . . . by . . . furnishing . . . any services or facilities connected with the processing, handling, sale, or offering for sale of such commodity so purchased upon terms not accorded to all purchasers on proportionally equal terms.\"\n\n\n In terms, the proscriptions of these three subsections are absolute. Unlike 2 (a), none of them requires, as proof of a prima facie violation, a showing that the illicit practice has had an injurious or destructive effect on competition.\n7\n Similarly, none has any built-in defensive matter, as does 2 (a). Simplicity's contentions boil down to an argument that the exculpatory provisions which Congress has made expressly applicable only to price discriminations are somehow included as \"justifications\" for \n\n[360 \nU.S. 55, 66]\n\u00a0\n discriminations in services or facilities by 2 (b),\n8\n which provides that\n\n \"Upon proof being made, at any hearing on a complaint under this section, that there has been discrimination in price or services or facilities furnished, the burden of rebutting the prima-facie case thus made by showing justification shall be upon the person charged with a violation of this section, and unless justification shall be affirmatively shown, the Commission is authorized to issue an order terminating the discrimination: Provided, however, That nothing herein contained shall prevent a seller rebutting the prima-facie case thus made by showing that his lower price or the furnishing of services or facilities to any purchaser or purchasers was made in good faith to meet an equally low price of a competitor, or the services or facilities furnished by a competitor.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n We hold that the key word \"justification\" can be read no more broadly than to allow rebuttal of the respective offenses in one of the ways expressly made available by Congress. Thus, a discrimination in prices may be rebutted by a showing under any of the 2 (a) provisos, or under the 2 (b) proviso\n9\n - all of which by their terms \n\n[360 \nU.S. 55, 67]\n\u00a0\n apply to price discriminations. On the other hand, the only escape Congress has provided for discriminations in services or facilities is the permission to meet competition as found in the 2 (b) proviso. We cannot supply what Congress has studiously omitted.\n10\n\u00a0\n\nSimplicity's arguments to the contrary are based essentially on the ground that it would be \"bad law and bad economics\" to make discriminations unlawful even where they may be accounted for by cost differentials or where there is no competitive injury.\n11\n Entirely aside from the fact that this Court is not in a position to review the economic wisdom of Congress, we cannot say that the legislative decision to treat price and other discriminations \n\n[360 \nU.S. 55, 68]\n\u00a0\n differently is without a rational basis. In allowing a \"cost justification\" for price discriminations and not for others, Congress could very well have felt that sellers would be forced to confine their discriminatory practices to price differentials, where they could be more readily detected and where it would be much easier to make accurate comparisons with any alleged cost savings.\n12\n Biddle Purchasing Co. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 96 F.2d 687, 692 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1938). And, with respect to the absence of competitive injury requirements, it suffices to say that the antitrust laws are not strangers to the policy of nipping potentially destructive practices before they reach full bloom. Cf. Klor's, Inc., v. Broadway-Hale Stores, \n359 \nU.S. 207\n (1959).\n13\n\u00a0\n\nOur conclusions are further confirmed by the historical setting of the Robinson-Patman amendments to 2 of the Clayton Act. As originally worded in 1914 (38 Stat. 730), 2 applied only to price discriminations, and then only where the effect of such discrimination was \"to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce.\"\n14\n Furthermore, a proviso \n\n[360 \nU.S. 55, 69]\n\u00a0\n excepted price discriminations based on \"differences in the . . . quantity of the commodity sold,\" regardless of whether the differences in quantity resulted in corresponding cost differentials.\n\nA lengthy investigation conducted in the 1930's by the Federal Trade Commission disclosed that several large chain buyers were effectively avoiding 2 by taking advantage of gaps in its coverage. Because of their enormous purchasing power, these chains were able to exact price concessions, based on differences in quantity, which far exceeded any related cost savings to the seller. Consequently, the seller was forced to raise prices even further on smaller quantity lots in order to cover the concessions made to the large purchasers. Comparable competitive advantages were obtained by the large purchasers in several ways other than direct price concessions. Rebates were induced for \"brokerage fees,\" even though no brokerage services had been performed. \"Advertising allowances\" were paid by the sellers to the large buyers in return for certain promotional services undertaken by the latter. Some sellers furnished special services or facilities to the chain buyers. Lacking the purchasing power to demand comparable advantages, the small independent stores were at a hopeless competitive disadvantage.\n15\n\u00a0\n\nThe Robinson-Patman amendments were enacted to eliminate these inequities. The exception to price discriminations based on quantitative differences was limited to those making \"only due allowance for differences in . . . cost.\" As noted above, false brokerage allowances and the paying for or furnishing of nonproportional services or facilities were banned outright. The portion \n\n[360 \nU.S. 55, 70]\n\u00a0\n of 2 (b) preceding the proviso, on which Simplicity relies, was inserted in the House bill for the sole purpose of laying down \"directions with reference to procedure including a statement with respect to burden of proof.\"\n16\n It was clearly not intended to have any independent substantive weight of its own.\n17\n\u00a0\n\nWe hold, therefore, that neither \"cost-justification\" nor an absence of competitive injury may constitute \"justification\" \n\n[360 \nU.S. 55, 71]\n\u00a0\n of a prima facie 2 (e) violation.\n18\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals must accordingly be reversed insofar as it set aside and remanded the Commission's order and affirmed as to the remainder.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The complaint was in two counts, the first being under the Federal Trade Commission Act. This count was dismissed. The second count, which is the only one before us, involves certain subsections of 2 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 13. For ready reference we quote 2 in its entirety:\n\n\"(a) That it shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, either directly or indirectly, to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality, where either or any of the purchases involved in such discrimination are in commerce, where such commodities are sold for use, consumption, or resale within the United States or any Territory thereof or the District of Columbia or any insular possession or other place under the jurisdiction of the United States, and where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them: Provided, That nothing herein contained shall prevent differentials which make only due allowance for differences in the cost of manufacture, sale, or delivery resulting from the differing methods or quantities in which such commodities are to such purchasers sold or delivered: Provided, however, That the Federal Trade Commission may, after due investigation and hearing to all interested parties, fix and establish quantity limits, and revise the same as it finds necessary, as to particular commodities or classes of commodities, where it finds that available purchasers in greater quantities are so few as to render differentials on account thereof unjustly discriminatory or promotive of monopoly in any line of commerce; and the foregoing shall then not be construed to permit differentials based on differences in quantities greater than those so fixed and established: And provided further, That nothing herein contained shall prevent persons engaged in selling goods, wares, or merchandise in commerce from selecting their own customers in bona fide transactions and not in restraint of trade: And provided \n\n[360 \nU.S. 55, 57]\n\u00a0\n further, That nothing herein contained shall prevent price changes from time to time where in response to changing conditions affecting the market for or the marketability of the goods concerned, such as but not limited to actual or imminent deterioration of perishable goods, obsolescence of seasonal goods, distress sales under court process, or sales in good faith in discontinuance of business in the goods concerned.\n\n\n\"(b) Upon proof being made, at any hearing on a complaint under this section, that there has been discrimination in price or services or facilities furnished, the burden of rebutting the prima-facie case thus made by showing justification shall be upon the person charged with a violation of this section, and unless justification shall be affirmatively shown, the Commission is authorized to issue an order terminating the discrimination: Provided, however, That nothing herein contained shall prevent a seller rebutting the prima-facie case thus made by showing that his lower price or the furnishing of services or facilities to any purchaser or purchasers was made in good faith to meet an equally low price of a competitor, or the services or facilities furnished by a competitor.\n\n\n\"(c) That it shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, to pay or grant, or to receive or accept, anything of value as a commission, brokerage, or other compensation, or any allowance or discount in lieu thereof, except for services rendered in connection with the sale or purchase of goods, wares, or merchandise, either to the other party to such transaction or to an agent, representative, or other intermediary therein where such intermediary is acting in fact for or in behalf, or is subject to the direct or indirect control, of any party to such transaction other than the person by whom such compensation is so granted or paid.\n\n\n\"(d) That it shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce to pay or contract for the payment of anything of value to or for the benefit of a customer of such person in the course of such commerce as compensation or in consideration for any services or facilities furnished by or through such customer in connection with the processing, handling, sale, or offering for sale of any products or commodities manufactured, sold, or offered for sale by such person, unless such payment or consideration is available on proportionally \n\n[360 \nU.S. 55, 58]\n\u00a0\n equal terms to all other customers competing in the distribution of such products or commodities.\n\n\n\"(e) That it shall be unlawful for any person to discriminate in favor of one purchaser against another purchaser or purchasers of a commodity bought for resale, with or without processing, by contracting to furnish or furnishing, or by contributing to the furnishing of, any services or facilities connected with the processing, handling, sale, or offering for sale of such commodity so purchased upon terms not accorded to all purchasers on proportionally equal terms.\n\n\n\"(f) That it shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, knowingly to induce or receive a discrimination in price which is prohibited by this section.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Judge Washington dissented on the \"cost-justification\" issue, while Judge Burger was in dissent on the competitive injury question.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] In dollar volume, Simplicity's percentage-of-industry total is somewhat lower, due to the fact that its prices are among the lowest in the industry.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] It should be noted that Simplicity has apparently acted entirely in good faith. While the services and facilities described in the body of the opinion are admittedly furnished free only to the variety stores, Simplicity asserts that other services and facilities are furnished only to the smaller customers. These claimed services include: A staff of 12 young ladies travels throughout the country giving fashion shows and sewing demonstrations in schools, 4-H Clubs and the like. These demonstrations are coordinated through the local fabric stores to assist the latter in pushing sales both of patterns and of fabrics. Large promotional posters, portraying fabrics and fashion trends, are furnished monthly to the fabric stores. \"Flyers,\" or brochures, designed, printed and distributed by Simplicity solely for the small merchant, tell him (in the words of Simplicity's president) \"what the proper sources of supply are in New York, what the trends are, how to trim his windows, how to run certain aspects of his department and a great deal of other material.\" A monthly publication called the \"Simplicity Pattern Book\" is sold through fabric stores at an annual loss to Simplicity of over $100,000. The publication is designed to \"glamorize and dramatize for the consumer and for the merchant the textiles and trends throughout the country.\"\n\nThese services and facilities are apparently available to the variety stores, but are not used by them because of their method of doing business. Thus, Simplicity claims that the fabric stores receive services and facilities, valued by Simplicity at more than $1,000,000 annually, which in fact if not in law are not used by the variety stores. The parties did not explore, before the Commission, the possibility that this tailoring of services and facilities to meet the different needs of two classes of customers in fact constituted \"proportionally equal terms.\" And, of course, this point was not raised in the Court of Appeals or in this Court. We note in passing, however, that the Commission has indicated a willingness to give a relatively broad scope to the standard of proportional equality under 2 (d) and 2 (e). See Lever Brothers Co., 50 F. T. C. 494, 512 (1953). (\"[ 2 (d)] does not prohibit a seller from paying for services of various types.\" A \"plan providing payment for promotional \n\n[360 \nU.S. 55, 62]\n\u00a0\n services and facilities . . . must be honest in its purpose and fair and reasonable in its application.\") See also Procter & Gamble Distributing Co., 50 F. T. C. 513 (1953); Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Co., 50 F. T. C. 525 (1953); Report of the Attorney General's National Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws 189-190 (1955). Since the issue is not properly before us, we of course do not pass on it.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Simplicity argues that the Examiner \"affirmatively found an absence of competitive injury.\" This view was apparently adopted by the Court of Appeals. 103 U.S. App. D.C., at 378, 258 F.2d, at 678. We do not so read the record, however. What the Examiner said was that \"there is no showing of competitive injury.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Subsection (f) is a corollary to 2 (a), making it unlawful \"knowingly to induce or receive\" a price discrimination barred by the latter. See Automatic Canteen Co. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, \n346 \nU.S. 61\n (1953).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Simplicity concedes this, in effect, but argues that it should be allowed under 2 (b) to \"justify\" the 2 (e) violation by making an affirmative showing of absence of competitive injury.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] In allowing a showing of \"cost-justification\" under 2 (b), the Court of Appeals negated any inference that it was thereby importing \" 2 (a) criteria as matters of defense to a Section 2 (e) charge.\" Rather, it held that \"the justification to be shown under the first clause of 2 (b) as to a 2 (e) charge of discrimination in `facilities furnished' to various customers, [would] depend upon the facts in a particular case.\" 103 U.S. App. D.C., at 381, 258 F.2d, at 681. (Italics in the original.) On this theory, the limits of the justification which could be shown would be established by litigation, on a case-to-case basis.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] See Standard Oil Co. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, \n340 \nU.S. 231\n (1951).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] The Courts of Appeals, prior to this case, had uniformly rejected the argument that 2 (e) violations were subject to a cost-justification defense or required a showing of adverse effect on competition. Elizabeth Arden, Inc., v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 156 F.2d 132 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1946) (competitive injury); Corn Products Refining Co. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 144 F.2d 211, 219 (C. A. 7th Cir. 1944), aff'd on other grounds \n324 \nU.S. 726\n (competitive injury); Southgate Brokerage Co. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 106 F.2d 607, 610 (C. A. 4th Cir. 1945) (dictum as to competitive injury); Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 106 F.2d 667 (C. A. 3d Cir. 1939) (dictum as to cost-justification); Oliver Bros., Inc., v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 102 F.2d 763, 767 (C. A. 4th Cir. 1939) (dictum as to competitive injury). It does not appear that any Court of Appeals had previously been asked to decide whether an absence of competitive injury could constitute a \"justification\" under 2 (b).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] Compare the Report of the Attorney General's National Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws (1955). The Committee recognized that as of that date subsections (c), (d) and (e) had been uniformly interpreted as not requiring a showing of competitive injury, and as not allowing a cost-justification defense. Pp. 187-193. It expressed disagreement with the desirability of this result, in view of what it deemed the \"broader antitrust objectives,\" and recommended that 2 (c) be changed by legislation and 2 (d) and (e) by \"interpretive reform.\" P. 193.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] During congressional debates on the bill, there were continual references to the subsection (c), (d) and (e) practices as \"secret\" discriminations. See, e. g., 80 Cong. Rec. 8126, 8127, 8132, 8135, 8137, 8226.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] Compare Northern Pacific R. Co. v. United States, \n356 \nU.S. 1\n (1958); United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., \n310 \nU.S. 150\n (1940), which contain examples of per se violations under the Sherman Act. It is not without significance that earlier versions of both the House and Senate bills would have outlawed even price discriminations without regard to their effect upon competition. H. R. 8442, 74th Cong., 1st Sess.; S. 3154, 74th Cong., 1st Sess.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] This language was retained in 2 (a) under the Robinson-Patman Act amendment, and the following was added, \"or to injure, destroy, or prevent competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of either of them.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] Final Report on the Chain-Store Investigation, S. Doc. No. 4, 74th Cong., 1st Sess.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] H. R. Rep. No. 2287, 74th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 16.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] As reported out of Committee, the equivalent of 2 (b) (which was 2 (e) in the House bill) applied only to price discriminations. During the floor debate, Congressman McLaughlin introduced an amendment which would add \"or services or facilities furnished\" at appropriate places in the subsection. He said, \"Mr. Chairman, this is a committee amendment agreed to unanimously by the committee. . . . It simply allows a seller to meet not only competition in price of other competitors but also competition in services and facilities furnished.\" 80 Cong. Rec. 8225. The amendment was adopted without further comment. Throughout the debate, what reference there was to this subsection (other than to the proviso) was to the effect that it was a \"procedural\" or \"burden of proof\" provision. See, e. g., 80 Cong. Rec. 8110, 9414, 9418. Congressman Patman, referring to it as a \"burden of proof\" provision, said \"Let me analyze that for you. What does that mean? It means exactly the rule of law today. It is a restatement of existing law. So far as I am concerned you can strike it out. It makes no difference.\" 80 Cong. Rec. 8231. This statement, coming from one of the authors of the bill, makes it clear beyond peradventure that the provision in question was not intended to operate as a source of substantive defenses. See also Automatic Canteen Co. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, supra, \n346 \nU.S., at 78\n.\n\nThe history of the Senate bill is not helpful. As reported out of Committee, it contained neither a provision comparable to 2 (b) nor one comparable to 2 (e). S. Rep. No. 1502, 74th Cong., 2d Sess. A provision identical to 2 (b) was adopted as a floor amendment at a time when the bill did not in terms even cover the furnishing of services and facilities. 80 Cong. Rec. 6435-6436. The short debate on the amendment is not enlightening.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] While both of these questions have been presented to us in terms of the \"justification\" clause of 2 (b), we are equally convinced that the competitive injury and cost-differential clauses of 2 (a) cannot be read directly into 2 (e). Elizabeth Arden, Inc., v. Federal Trade Comm'n, supra, note 10; Corn Products Refining Co. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, supra, note 10; Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, supra, note 10. It is true that, in reference to the cost-differential clause, we have said, \"Time and again there was recognition in Congress of a freedom to adopt and pass on to buyers the benefits of more economical processes.\" Automatic Canteen Co. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, supra, \n346 \nU.S., at 72\n. But the contexts of the statements referred to show that the benefits were to be made available in price differentials or not at all. See, e. g., 80 Cong. Rec. 8106-8107, 8111-8112, 8114, 8127-8128, 8137, 9415; H. R. Rep. No. 2287, 74th Cong., 2d Sess.

JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nWe must decide whether 315 of the Federal Communications Act of 1934 bars a broadcasting station from removing defamatory statements contained in speeches broadcast by legally qualified candidates for public office, and if so, whether that section grants the station a federal immunity from liability for libelous statements so broadcast. Section 315 reads:\n\n \"(a) If any licensee shall permit any person who is a legally qualified candidate for any public office to use a broadcasting station, he shall afford equal opportunities to all other such candidates for that office in the use of such broadcasting station: Provided, That such licensee shall have no power of censorship over the material broadcast under the provisions of this section. No obligation is imposed upon any licensee to allow the use of its station by any such candidate.\"\n1\n\u00a0\n\n\n This suit for libel arose as a result of a speech made over the radio and television facilities of respondent, WDAY, Inc., by A. C. Townley - a legally qualified candidate in the 1956 United States senatorial race in North Dakota. Because it felt compelled to do so by the requirements of 315, WDAY permitted Townley to broadcast his speech, uncensored in any respect, as a reply to previous speeches made over WDAY by two other senatorial candidates. Townley's speech, in substance, accused his opponents, together with petitioner, Farmers Educational and Cooperative Union of America, of conspiring to \"establish \n\n[360 \nU.S. 525, 527]\n\u00a0\n a Communist Farmers Union Soviet right here in North Dakota.\" Farmers Union then sued Townley and WDAY for libel in a North Dakota State District Court. That court dismissed the complaint against WDAY on the ground that 315 rendered the station immune from liability for the defamation alleged. The Supreme Court of North Dakota affirmed, stating: \"Section 315 imposes a mandatory duty upon broadcasting stations to permit all candidates for the same office to use their facilities if they have permitted one candidate to use them. Since power of censorship of political broadcasts is prohibited it must follow as a corollary that the mandate prohibiting censorship includes the privilege of immunity from liability for defamatory statements made by the speakers.\" For this reason it held that the state libel laws could not apply to WDAY. 89 N. W. 2d 102, 110. We granted certiorari because the questions decided are important to the administration of the Federal Communications Act. \n358 \nU.S. 810\n.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nPetitioner argues that 315's prohibition against censorship leaves broadcasters free to delete libelous material from candidates' speeches, and that therefore no federal immunity is granted a broadcasting station by that section. The term censorship, however, as commonly understood, connotes any examination of thought or expression in order to prevent publication of \"objectionable\" material. We find no clear expression of legislative intent, nor any other convincing reason to indicate Congress meant to give \"censorship\" a narrower meaning in 315. In arriving at this view, we note that petitioner's interpretation has not generally been favored in previous considerations of the section. Although the first, and for years the only judicial decision dealing with the censorship provision did hold that a station may remove \n\n[360 \nU.S. 525, 528]\n\u00a0\n defamatory statements from political broadcasts,\n2\n subsequent judicial interpretations of 315 have with considerable uniformity recognized that an individual licensee has no such power.\n3\n And while for some years the Federal Communications Commission's views on this matter were not clearly articulated,\n4\n since 1948 it has continuously held that licensees cannot remove allegedly libelous matter from speeches by candidates.\n5\n Similarly, the legislative history of the measure both prior to its first enactment in 1927, and subsequently, shows a deep hostility to censorship either by the Commission or by a licensee.\n6\n\u00a0\n\n[360 \nU.S. 525, 529]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMore important, it is obvious that permitting a broadcasting station to censor allegedly libelous remarks would undermine the basic purpose for which 315 was passed - full and unrestricted discussion of political issues by legally qualified candidates. That section dates back to, and was adopted verbatim from, the Radio Act of 1927. In that Act, Congress provided for the first time a comprehensive federal plan for regulating the new and expanding art of radio broadcasting. Recognizing radio's potential importance as a medium of communication of political ideas, Congress sought to foster its broadest possible utilization by encouraging broadcasting stations to make their facilities available to candidates for office without discrimination, and by insuring that these candidates when broadcasting were not to be hampered by censorship of the issues they could discuss. Thus, expressly applying this country's tradition of free expression to the field of radio broadcasting, Congress has from the \n\n[360 \nU.S. 525, 530]\n\u00a0\n first emphatically forbidden the Commission to exercise any power of censorship over radio communication.\n7\n It is in line with this same tradition that the individual licensee has consistently been denied \"power of censorship\" in the vital area of political broadcasts.\n\nThe decision a broadcasting station would have to make in censoring libelous discussion by a candidate is far from easy. Whether a statement is defamatory is rarely clear. Whether such a statement is actionably libelous is an even more complex question, involving as it does, consideration of various legal defenses such as \"truth\" and the privilege of fair comment. Such issues have always troubled courts. Yet, under petitioner's view of the statute they would have to be resolved by an individual licensee during the stress of a political campaign, often, necessarily, without adequate consideration or basis for decision. Quite possibly, if a station were held responsible for the broadcast of libelous material, all remarks evenly faintly objectionable would be excluded out of an excess of caution. Moreover, if any censorship were permissible, a station so inclined could intentionally inhibit a candidate's legitimate presentation under the guise of lawful censorship of libelous matter. Because of the time limitation inherent in a political campaign, erroneous decisions by a station could not be corrected by the courts promptly enough to permit the candidate to bring improperly excluded matter before the public. It follows from all this that allowing censorship, even of the attenuated type advocated here, would almost inevitably force a candidate to avoid controversial issues during political debates over radio and television, and hence restrict the coverage of consideration relevant to intelligent \n\n[360 \nU.S. 525, 531]\n\u00a0\n political decision. We cannot believe, and we certainly are unwilling to assume, that Congress intended any such result.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nPetitioner alternatively argues that 315 does not grant a station immunity from liability for defamatory statements made during a political broadcast even though the section prohibits the station from censoring allegedly libelous matter. Again, we cannot agree. For under this interpretation, unless a licensee refuses to permit any candidate to talk at all, the section would sanction the unconscionable result of permitting civil and perhaps criminal liability to be imposed for the very conduct the statute demands of the licensee. Accordingly, judicial interpretations reaching the issue have found an immunity implicit in the section.\n8\n And in all those cases concluding that a licensee had no immunity, 315 had been construed - improperly as we hold - to permit a station to censor potentially actionable material.\n9\n In no case has a court even implied that the licensee would not be rendered immune were it denied the power to censor libelous material.\n\nPetitioner contends, however, that the legislative history of 315 shows that Congress did not intend to grant an immunity. Some of the history supports such an inference. As it reached the Senate, the provision which became 18 of the Radio Act of 1927 provided in part that if a station permitted one candidate to use its facilities, it \n\n[360 \nU.S. 525, 532]\n\u00a0\n should \"be deemed a common carrier in interstate commerce . . .\" and could not discriminate against other political candidates or censor material broadcast by them.\n10\n In the Senate, Senator Dill - the bill's floor manager - introduced an amendment to this provision which, among other things, specifically granted a station immunity from civil and criminal liability for \"any uncensored utterances thus broadcast.\"\n11\n The amendment was adopted by the Senate, but its provision expressly granting immunity was removed by the Conference Committee without any explanation.\n12\n Section 18 was incorporated into the Communications Act of 1934 with no explanatory discussion. Subsequently, a great deal of pressure built up for legislation to remove all possible doubt as to broadcasters' liability for libel either by granting them a power to censor libelous statements or by providing an express legislative immunity. Many legislative proposals were made to accomplish these purposes,\n13\n but no legislation providing either was ever enacted. Thus, whatever adverse inference may be drawn from the failure of Congress to legislate an express immunity is offset by its refusal to permit stations to avoid liability by censoring broadcasts. And more than balancing any adverse inferences drawn from congressional failure \n\n[360 \nU.S. 525, 533]\n\u00a0\n to legislate an express immunity is the fact that the Federal Communications Commission - the body entrusted with administering the provisions of the Act - has long interpreted 315 as granting stations an immunity.\n14\n Not only has this interpretation been adhered to despite many subsequent legislative proposals to modify 315, but with full knowledge of the Commission's interpretation Congress has since made significant additions to that section without amending it to depart from the Commission's view.\n15\n In light of this contradictory legislative background we do not feel compelled to reach a result which seems so in conflict with traditional concepts of fairness.\n\nPetitioner nevertheless urges that broadcasters do not need a specific immunity to protect themselves from liability for defamation since they may either insure against any loss, or in the alternative, deny all political candidates \n\n[360 \nU.S. 525, 534]\n\u00a0\n use of station facilities.\n16\n We have no means of knowing to what extent insurance is available to broadcasting stations, or what it would cost them. Moreover, since 315 expressly prohibits stations from charging political candidates higher rates than they charge for comparable time used for other purposes, any cost of insurance would probably have to be absorbed by the stations themselves. Petitioner's reliance on the stations' freedom from obligation \"to allow use of its station by any such candidate,\" seems equally misplaced. While denying all candidates use of stations would protect broadcasters from liability, it would also effectively withdraw political discussion from the air. Instead the thrust of 315 is to facilitate political debate over radio and television. Recognizing this, the Communications Commission considers the carrying of political broadcasts a public service criterion to be considered both in license renewal proceedings, and in comparative contests for a radio or television construction permit.\n17\n Certainly Congress knew the obvious - that if a licensee could protect \n\n[360 \nU.S. 525, 535]\n\u00a0\n himself from liability in no other way but by refusing to broadcast candidates' speeches, the necessary effect would be to hamper the congressional plan to develop broadcasting as a political outlet, rather than to foster it.\n18\n\u00a0\n\nWe are aware that causes of action for libel are widely recognized throughout the States. But we have not hesitated to abrogate state law where satisfied that its enforcement would stand \"as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\"\n19\n Here, petitioner is asking us to attribute to 315 a meaning which would either frustrate the underlying purposes for which it was enacted, or alternatively impose unreasonable burdens on the parties governed by that legislation. In the absence of clear expression by Congress we will not assume that it desired such a result. Agreeing with the state courts of North Dakota that 315 grants a licensee an immunity from liability for libelous material it broadcasts, we merely read 315 in accordance with what we believe to be its underlying purpose.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 48 Stat. 1088, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 315 (a).

The North Dakota District Court, however, struck down a state statute which would have granted WDAY an immunity as in violation of a state constitutional provision saving to \"every man\" a court remedy for any injury done his \"person or reputation.\" In this situation we do not think that the record justifies the inference that WDAY could have obtained an immunity by calling it a privilege. But whatever North Dakota might hold, the question for us is whether Congress intended to subject a federal licensee to possible liability under the law of some or all of the 49 States for broadcasting in a way required by federal law.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] In re City of Jacksonville, 12 Pike and Fischer Radio Reg. 113, 125-126, 180 i-j; In re Loyola University, 12 Pike and Fischer Radio Reg. 1017, 1099.

JUSTICE STEWART join, dissenting.\n\nThe language of 315 of the Federal Communications Act, \"such licensee shall have no power of censorship over the material broadcast under the provisions of this section,\"\n1\n and the legislative history of this provision call for the conclusion reached in Part I of the Court's opinion, namely, that WDAY could not have lawfully deleted from \n\n[360 \nU.S. 525, 536]\n\u00a0\n A. C. Townley's broadcast his defamation of petitioner. But due regard for the principle of separation of powers limiting this Court's functions and respect for the binding principle of federalism, leaving to the States authority not withdrawn by the Constitution or absorbed by the Congress, are more compelling considerations than avoidance of a hardship legally imposed. Consequently the claim that WDAY cannot be held liable under constitutionally enacted state libel laws must be tested not by inquiring whether a particular result would be \"unconscionable\" but whether the result is or is not barred by federal legislation as construed and applied in accordance with settled principles of statutory and constitutional adjudication. When the question in this case is thus properly put, it is necessary to examine the three relevant legal concepts to which resort must be had in order to find that WDAY is not liable for defamatory remarks broadcast by it.\n\n(1) If 315 could be construed to contain implicitly, between the lines, a grant by Congress of immunity from state libel laws, the Court's result would follow. But it is not possible to find such implied grant of immunity. It is common ground that an express provision granting such immunity was excised from the bill which later became the Radio Act of 1927 and repeated attempts in later revisions of the Act to introduce similar provisions have failed.\n\n(2) If there were consistent administrative rulings that the Communications Act required that immunity be granted, and if that administrative ruling had been acquiesced in by Congress even by implication, the Court's result would have support.\n\n(3) If 315 alone, or together with the remainder of the Communications Act, could be said to manifest a congressional purpose to oust state law from application to licensees, or if the state law could be said to be in clear \n\n[360 \nU.S. 525, 537]\n\u00a0\n conflict with 315 or the Act as a whole, then, in either event, it could be concluded that the libel law of the State had been pre-empted insofar as its applicability to a broadcaster acting within 315 is concerned.\n\nBecause I believe that agreement with the Court's conclusion involves either disregard of the legislative and administrative history of 315 or departure from the principles which have governed this Court in determining when state law must give way to overriding federal law, I dissent from Part II of the opinion of the Court and therefore from its judgment.\n\nAn administrative agency cannot, of course, determine the constitutional issue whether a federal statute has displaced state law, certainly not by way of determining what Congress has in fact done. In In re Port Huron Broadcasting Co., 12 F. C. C. 1069, the case in which the Federal Communications Commission first held that stations could not censor, the Federal Communications Commission's dictum that stations would not be liable was not a relevant administrative interpretation of the meaning of 315 but was a finding that the States were pre-empted from this area. It was said, not that the broadcasters operating under 315 had a federally created defense, but that the state libel laws had been supplanted. \"The conclusion is inescapable that Congress has occupied the field in connection with responsibility for libelous matter in broadcasts under section 315 . . . .\" 12 F. C. C., at 1075-1076.\n\nWe have here not a course of administrative interpretation of an ambiguous statutory provision; it is not even a case of a single administrative application of a statute. This is a ruling of constitutional law - that the Supremacy Clause requires that the existence of the Communications Act of 1934 oust the States of jurisdiction to impose libel laws upon broadcasts made under the provisions of 315. Such constitutional rulings are for this Court and not for \n\n[360 \nU.S. 525, 538]\n\u00a0\n administrative agencies. I would suppose that a consistent administrative insistence on the constitutionality of 315, were that a question, would not affect this Court's consideration of its constitutionality.\n\nBut suppose that, even as to pre-emption, we are to assume that Congress should be said to defer to consistent administrative interpretation. There was no such consistency here in the FCC. The Commission has never issued a regulation nor held in an adjudicatory proceeding that there is immunity. Dictum in the Port Huron case was affirmatively embraced by only two of the five Commissioners who presided. Since Port Huron the Commission has referred to its language in that case in increasingly tentative fashion. In In re WDSU Broadcasting Corp., 7 Pike and Fischer Radio Reg. 769, 770, the FCC said of its dictum in Port Huron:\n\n\"We said in the Port Huron case that in our view the station was relieved from liability, but that whether or not this was the case, the fact remained that a licensee is prohibited from censoring material broadcast under the provisions of 315.\"\n\n\n In a regulation issued in 1958 the Commission answered the question \"If a legally qualified candidate broadcasts libelous or slanderous remarks, is the station liable therefor?\" in this way:\n\n\"In Port Huron Bctg. Co., 4 R. R. 1, the Commission expressed an opinion that licensees not directly participating in the libel might be absolved from any liability they might otherwise incur under state law, because of the operation of section 315, which precludes them from preventing a candidate's utterances.\" 23 Fed. Reg. 7820.\n\n\n Thus the FCC has demonstrated apparent waning confidence in its Port Huron dictum - from \"[t]he conclusion is inescapable\" to \"in our view the station was relieved \n\n[360 \nU.S. 525, 539]\n\u00a0\n from liability, but . . . whether or not this was the case\" to \"an opinion that licensees . . . might be absolved from any liability.\"\n\nEven if the FCC's position were of a type to which the principle of deference or acquiescence were applicable, even if that position were longer held than just the past decade, and were taken with more confidence than was true here, the history of congressional dealings with the question of liability of stations for libel would not support a conclusion that Congress had acquiesced in such a ruling. For when the last congressional discussion of an immunity provision took place in 1952, the Conference Committee, in reporting out the revised version of 315, stated it had rejected a House immunity provision\n2\n\u00a0\n\n \". . . because these subjects have not been adequately  studied by the Committees on Interstate  and Foreign Commerce of the Senate and House  of Representatives. The proposal was adopted in  the House after the bill had been reported from the  House committee. The proposal involves many difficult  problems and it is the judgment of the committee  of the conference that it should be acted on  only after full hearings have been held.\" H. R. Rep.  No. 2426, 82d Cong., 2d Sess. 21.\n\n\n This language negates rather than supports the conclusion that Congress in failing to enact proposed immunity measures was in fact acquiescing in the Port Huron dictum.\n3\n\u00a0\n\n[360 \nU.S. 525, 540]\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor these many reasons a conclusion that in failing to change 315 after the Port Huron decision Congress by its inaction effected the pre-emption which the Commission had found is an assumption wholly unsupported in fact. The attempt to use congressional acquiescence to support the constitutional ruling of supersession of state law raises political stalemate and legislative indecision\n4\n to the level of constitutional declaration. As we should go slow to read into what Congress has said the negation of state power, unless it speaks explicitly or there is obvious collision, we should even less willingly find such negation in what Congress has frankly refused to say.\n\nThe Court proceeds not only from an insupportable finding that Congress acquiesced in the Commission's Port Huron opinion. It also relies upon a determination that North Dakota's libel law could not constitutionally be applied to WDAY in this case since the State's libel \n\n[360 \nU.S. 525, 541]\n\u00a0\n laws had been superseded by federal law for broadcasts made under 315. A determination of supersession of state law rests on legal and political presuppositions which should be made explicit and not left clouded. States should not be held to have been ousted from power traditionally held in the absence of either a clear declaration by Congress that it intends to forbid the continued functioning of the state law or an obvious and unavoidable conflict between the federal and state directives. The first does not exist here. Indeed, congressional refusal to act has often been suggested as implied recognition of the opposite. Thus, it may well be urged that repeated refusal to relieve from state libel laws amounted to an affirmance that the state laws of defamation should continue in operation since the Congress debated the issue in terms of erecting a defense to these laws, and then declined to do so. In any event, the legislative history emphatically does not support the affirmative conclusion that Congress intended preclusion of state law. Congress can speak with drastic clarity when it so intends. It has not so spoken here; it has refused to speak with drastic clarity.\n\nThe nature of the conflict which necessitates striking down state law has been considered in numerous decisions of this Court. In the much-cited case of Sinnot v. Davenport, 22 How. 227, 243, this Court said:\n\n \"We agree, that in the application of this principle of supremacy of an act of Congress in a case where the State law is but the exercise of a reserved power, the repugnance or conflict should be direct and positive, so that the two acts could not be reconciled or consistently stand together.\"\n\n\n Whether denying to WDAY the power to eliminate defamatory matter from broadcasts made under compulsion of 315 while at the same time refusing to find in \n\n[360 \nU.S. 525, 542]\n\u00a0\n 315 either immunity or a negation of state power to apply libel laws to programs required by the Federal Act is or is not fair, is not the question with which this Court must, consistent with the Supremacy Clause and the long history of this Court in construing it, begin. We are dealing with political power, not ethical imperatives. The most harmonious deduction to be drawn from the many cases in which the claim has been made that state action cannot survive some contradictory command of Congress is that state action has not been set aside on mere generalities about Congress having \"occupied the field,\" or on the basis of loose talk instead of demonstrations about \"conflict\" between state and federal action. We are in the domain of government and practical affairs, and this Court has not stifled state action unless what the State has required, in the light of what Congress has ordered, would truly entail contradictory duties or make actual, not argumentative, inroads on what Congress has commanded or forbidden.\n\nIt is to be noted initially that since defamation is generally regarded as an intentional tort, it is a solid likelihood that the North Dakota courts would conclude that WDAY's compelled broadcast of Townley's speech lacked the necessary intent to communicate the defamation, and that therefore WDAY's conduct was not tortious, or, if prima facie tortious, that WDAY was privileged.\n5\n In no case has any state court held a station liable on finding that the station could not censor. Some forty States have enacted statutes granting various degrees of privilege.\n6\n\u00a0\n\n[360 \nU.S. 525, 543]\n\u00a0\n In two States, exercising the flexibility of common law principles, the courts have extended a defense of privilege to broadcasters compelled to carry broadcasts by 315.\n7\n Thus, the largely abstract assumption on the basis of which the Court makes such heavy inroad on state laws - that broadcasters will be held without having committed a volitional act - may be entirely contradicted by experience.\n\nHow treacherous it is for this Court to be speculating about state law is well illustrated by a detailed examination of North Dakota law in the situation presented by this case. A North Dakota statute extending general immunity to all broadcasts by radio and television stations was found by the District Court of North Dakota to violate the North Dakota and United States Constitutions. WDAY, the appellee before the Supreme Court of North Dakota, did not except to this finding and therefore the Supreme Court of North Dakota declined to rule on the validity of the North Dakota statute. But no inference may be drawn from the District Court's conclusions that a station broadcasting under compulsion of 315 would be liable under North Dakota law. On the contrary, the District Court found that WDAY had a valid defense not only under 315 of the Communications Act but also within the provisions of Chapter 14-02 of the North Dakota Revised Statutes of 1943. One section of this chapter extends a privilege to \"one who stands in such relation to the person interested as to afford a reasonable ground for supposing the motive for the communication innocent.\" And so, rather than being justification for a belief that under North Dakota law WDAY would be liable for defamation, the District Court's opinion \n\n[360 \nU.S. 525, 544]\n\u00a0\n is clear evidence that at least one North Dakota court believed that North Dakota law creates a privilege in favor of broadcasters who are compelled by federal law to broadcast the defamatory matter. In any event, the finding of unconstitutionality was by a lower court and not by the North Dakota Supreme Court which is, of course, the final interpreter of North Dakota law.\n\nEven granting the Court's unsupported assumption about state law, however, there is not that conflict between federal and state law which justifies displacement of state power. Conflict between the North Dakota libel law and 315 might be attributed to the fact that broadcasters, to avoid being held liable without fault, will refrain from permitting any political candidate to buy time. This result, the argument would conclude, is contrary to the congressional command that stations operate in the \"public convenience, interest, or necessity.\" 48 Stat. 1083, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 307. The Federal Communications Commission has determined that to fulfill this congressional command stations must carry some political broadcasts. But the state libel laws do not prohibit them from airing speeches by political candidates. They merely make such broadcasts potentially less profitable (or unprofitable) since the station may have to compensate someone libeled during the candidate's broadcast. The Federal Act was intended not to establish a mode of supervising the income of broadcasters - not of protecting or limiting their profits - but of insuring \"a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and world-wide wire and radio communication service\" for the benefit of \"all the people of the United States.\" 48 Stat. 1064, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 151.\n\nWe have held that the Communications Act does not govern relations between stations and third persons. Radio Station WOW, Inc., v. Johnson, \n326 \nU.S. 120\n. And \n\n[360 \nU.S. 525, 545]\n\u00a0\n we have permitted a state court to award damages for breach of a contract despite the fact that that breach was ordered by the FCC as a condition for renewal of a license. Regents of the University System of Georgia v. Carroll, \n338 \nU.S. 586\n. If North Dakota were to rule that its libel law applies to broadcasts made under compulsion of 315, it would rule that broadcasters are liable without fault. There is nothing in such liability which conflicts with the necessity of broadcasting imposed by 315. If Congress came to fear impairment of its policy on political broadcasts, Congress could act to alter the condition which it has created by declining to legislate immunity. There may be a burden, even unfairness to the stations. But there may be unfairness too, after all, in depriving a defamed individual of recovery against the agency by which the defamatory communication was magnified in its deleterious effect on his ability to earn a livelihood. Adjustment of what is fair to all should be done by a congressional change in the federal law, or in the absence of such enactment, by state law, through legislation or common-law rulings that the stations are partially or totally immune. Again, allocation of risk of loss through defamation does not necessarily imply the duty not to defame. The application of libel laws by North Dakota to WDAY merely means that since the harm could no more have been avoided by the person defamed than by WDAY, in balancing these conflicting undesirables the risk of loss should fall upon WDAY. Whether or not this would be a wise decision, it would not conflict with 315's compulsion to broadcast speeches by opposing candidates for office.\n\nIn discussing in the Federalist Papers the respective areas of federal and state constitutional powers, Hamilton wrote that state powers would be superseded by federal authority if continued authority in the States would be \"absolutely and totally contradictory and repugnant.\" \n\n[360 \nU.S. 525, 546]\n\u00a0\n \"I use these terms,\" he wrote, \"to distinguish this . . . case from another which might appear to resemble it, out which would, in fact, be essentially different; I mean where the exercise of a concurrent jurisdiction might be productive of occasional interferences in the policy of any branch of administration, but would not imply any direct contradiction or repugnancy in point of constitutional authority.\" The Federalist, No. 32, at 200 (Van Doren ed. 1945). Since this concurrent jurisdiction was \"clearly admitted by the whole tenor\" of the Constitution in Hamilton's view, \"It is not . . . a mere possibility of inconvenience in the exercise of powers, but an immediate constitutional repugnancy that can by implication alienate and extinguish a preexisting right of sovereignty.\" Id., at 203.\n\nHamilton's suggestion, emanating from the contest of constitutional creation, is disregarded in the approach taken by the Court today on a precisely analogous if not identical question, for there exists here not an explicit conflict but, at the very most, an interference with policy. Hamilton said, and this Court has in the past begun from similar presuppositions, that alienation of an area of state sovereignty is not to be implied from occasional interferences by state law with federal policy. Particularly should this rule be adhered to where the precise nature of that federal policy on the issues involved rests on the conjectures of the Court. When a state statute is assailed because of alleged conflict with a federal law, the same considerations of forbearance, the same regard for the lawmaking power of States, should guide the judicial judgment as when this Court is asked to declare a statute unconstitutional outright.\n\nIn this decision a state law is invalidated by hypothesizing congressional acquiescence and by supposing \"conflicting\" state law which we cannot be certain exists and \n\n[360 \nU.S. 525, 547]\n\u00a0\n which, if it does exist, is not incompatible with federal law when judged by the considerations governing supersession in the long course of our decisions, judged as a corpus.\n\nI would reverse the North Dakota Supreme Court and remand the case to it with instructions that 315 has left to the States the power to determine the nature and extent of the liability, if any, of broadcasters to third persons.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 48 Stat. 1088, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 315 (a).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See 98 Cong. Rec. 7401-7416.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The situation would not have appeared to Congress to be one in which acquiescence was a meaningful concept. Immediately after Port Huron the decision was criticized as being without statutory basis. Houston Post Co. v. United States, 79 F. Supp. 199. In discussing the Port Huron decision before a House Committee, FCC Chairman Coy insisted that that decision \"only represents the views \n\n[360 \nU.S. 525, 540]\n\u00a0\n of the Commission\" and that he did not think \"this decision clarifies it as far as the industry is concerned.\" Hearings before House Select Committee to Investigate the Federal Communications Commission, 80th Cong., 2d Sess. 14. After Port Huron had been argued but before the decision, a bill, S. 1333, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 15, granting immunity was reported favorably by the Senate Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, S. Rep. No. 1567, 80th Cong., 2d Sess. 13, but was never enacted. Every indication is persuasive that the question was regarded as open and highly debatable.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Both before and after Port Huron, bills to permit censorship or grant total or partial immunity have been introduced. See H. R. 9230, 74th Cong., 1st Sess.; H. R. 3038, 75th Cong., 1st Sess.; S. 814, 78th Cong., 1st Sess., 11; S. 1333, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 15; H. R. 3595, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 15; H.

The congressional declination to act partakes not of satisfaction with the Port Huron decision but of indecision about the propriety and constitutionality of the alternative solutions to the broadcasters' plea of unfairness.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] See Developments in the Law of Defamation, 69 Harv.

Held: Such a requirement may not be enforced against an individual employee, because it would restrict his statutory right to revoke an assignment after one year.

JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe Railway Labor Act\n1\n was amended in 1951 to authorize labor organizations representing employees of \n\n[359 \nU.S. 326, 327]\n\u00a0\n carriers to make \"checkoff\" agreements with the carriers for the deduction from employees' wages of periodic dues, initiation fees and assessments. Section 2 Eleventh (b), as added by 64 Stat. 1238, 45 U.S.C. 152 Eleventh (b).\n2\n The amendment contains a proviso \"[t]hat no such agreement shall be effective with respect to any individual employee until he shall have furnished the employer with a written assignment to the labor organization . . . which shall be revocable in writing after the expiration of one year . . . .\" (Emphasis supplied.) In this case the Dues Deduction Agreement between respondents Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen and Southern Pacific Company required that there be used, as a necessary form for revoking an assignment, nothing other than a writing executed on a form furnished by the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen and forwarded by that organization to the employer.\n3\n The petitioner challenges this contractual \n\n[359 \nU.S. 326, 328]\n\u00a0\n regulation as violative of the employee's statutory right to revoke the assignment. The District Court for the Northern District of California held that the requirement was valid, reasoning that although it \"may seem a bit arbitrary\" to allow revocation only by means of the form provided by the Trainmen, it was \"no burden\" and was \"easily complied with.\" 155 F. Supp. 315, 317. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit adopted the District Court's reasoning and affirmed. 256 F.2d 429. We granted certiorari to consider the important question of the scope of the proviso of 2 Eleventh (b). \n358 \nU.S. 812\n.\n\nThe petitioner is employed by respondent, Southern Pacific Company, and through March 1957 was a member of respondent Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen. He had executed an individual assignment authorizing the checkoff in his case. In March 1957, more than a year after his assignment had been in effect, petitioner decided to join the Order of Railway Conductors and Brakemen. He notified the Trainmen of his resignation by letter dated March 30, 1957, advising them that he was revoking the authorization to check off his dues and that he had sent a revocation form to the company. The same day a representative of the Conductors sent petitioner's executed revocation form to the company and handed an executed duplicate revocation form to the Secretary-Treasurer of petitioner's Lodge of the Trainmen.\n\nThe company and the Trainmen, relying on the provisions of the Dues Deduction Agreement, declined to honor the revocation forms executed by the petitioner, though they were identical with the form which the Dues Deduction \n\n[359 \nU.S. 326, 329]\n\u00a0\n Agreement provided should be obtained from the Trainmen. The company advised that \"[t]his matter is being directed to the attention of the appropriate officer of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen for handling in accordance with the Agreement.\" The Trainmen's local Secretary-Treasurer in turn wrote the petitioner that the forms he had executed and submitted were not acceptable. He said that \"the only way that you can be released from Wage Assignment Authorization is by signing a regulation A-2 card furnished by me and forwarded by me to the Company.\" He enclosed such a card for the petitioner's signature and noted \"We would be sorry to lose you as a member of the BRT and hope that you may reconsider.\" As a result of the refusal of the company and the Trainmen to treat the petitioner's forms as valid, it was too late to stop the checkoff of petitioner's April 1957 wages.\n\nThe petitioner declined to execute any further forms and commenced this suit in the District Court against the company and the Trainmen. His complaint alleged that the action was brought under the Railway Labor Act, an \"Act of Congress regulating commerce\"; in this posture the jurisdiction of the District Court was properly invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1337.\n4\n The complaint alleged that the action was brought on behalf of petitioner and others similarly situated; the parties are in dispute as to how many other employees were in fact similarly situated with petitioner, but, with the courts below, we do not find \n\n[359 \nU.S. 326, 330]\n\u00a0\n it necessary to resolve the dispute,\n5\n and with them, we decide this case on the merits. The complaint prayed for a declaration that the petitioner, under the proviso, had complied with the requirements for effecting revocation and had terminated all authority of the company to check off his wages in favor of the Trainmen. Injunctive relief was also sought. The company and the Trainmen admitted that they were continuing to treat the petitioner's assignment as unrevoked, contending that the collective bargaining authority under the 1951 amendment to make checkoff agreements included authority to agree upon the challenged provisions of the Dues Deduction Agreement. We disagree with the District Court and the Court of Appeals and hold that the restrictive provisions of the Dues Deduction Agreement are violative of the 1951 amendment.\n\nFirst. The 1951 amendment relaxed provisions of the Railway Labor Act dating from 1934 which had forbidden carriers and labor organizations from making either \"union-shop\" arrangements,\n6\n or arrangements whereby carriers \n\n[359 \nU.S. 326, 331]\n\u00a0\n would check off from employee wages amounts owed to a labor organization for dues, initiation fees and assessments.\n7\n It thus became lawful to bargain collectively for \"union-shop\" and \"checkoff\" arrangements; but this power was made subject to limitations. The limitation here pertinent is that, by force of the proviso, the authority to make checkoff arrangements does not include authority to bind individual employees to submit to the checkoff. Any agreement was to be ineffective as to an employee who did not furnish the employer with a written assignment in favor of the labor organization, and any assignment made was to be \"revocable in writing after the expiration of one year . . . .\" This failure to authorize agreements binding employees to submit to the checkoff was deliberate on the part of Congress. Proposals to \n\n[359 \nU.S. 326, 332]\n\u00a0\n that end were expressly rejected. The bills originally introduced in the House and Senate, and favorably reported by the respective House and Senate Committees, would simply have authorized carriers and labor organizations \"to make agreements providing for the deduction by such carrier or carriers from the wages of its or their employees in a craft or class and payment to the labor organization representing the craft or class of such employees, of any dues, initiation fees or assessments which may be payable to such labor organization.\" H. R. Rep. No. 2811, p. 1, and S. Rep. No. 2262, pp. 1-2, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. Indeed the House Report reveals that the choice finally made of making implementation of the checkoff a matter of individual employee assignment was at first considered and rejected; \"the committee thought that the making of such assignments . . . should remain a subject for collective bargaining.\"\n8\n But the matter had been a recurrent subject of concern particularly at the Senate Hearings, and between the time of the Committee Reports and the consideration of the bill on the Senate floor, the Senate Committee reversed its view and developed the proviso\n9\n allowing the individual employee to decide for himself whether to submit to the checkoff, and whether to revoke an authorization after the expiration of one year. See 96 Cong. Rec. 15735, 16268.\n10\n In this form the bill was passed by both Houses and approved. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 326, 333]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe structure of 2 Eleventh (b) then is simple: carriers and labor organizations are authorized to bargain for arrangements for a checkoff by the employer on behalf of the organization. Latitude is allowed in the terms of such arrangements, but not past the point such terms impinge upon the freedom expressly reserved to the individual employee to decide whether he will authorize the checkoff in his case. Similarly Congress consciously and deliberately chose to deny carriers and labor organizations authority to reach terms which would restrict the employee's complete freedom to revoke an assignment by a writing directed to the employer after one year. Congress was specifically concerned with keeping these areas of individual choice off the bargaining table. It is plainly our duty to effectuate this obvious intention of Congress, and we must therefore be careful \n\n[359 \nU.S. 326, 334]\n\u00a0\n not to allow the employee's freedom of decision to be eroded in the name of procedure, or otherwise. We see no authority given by the Act to carriers and labor organizations to restrict the employee's individual freedom of decision by such regulations as were agreed upon in the Dues Deduction Agreement. The question is not whether these restrictions might abstractly be called \"reasonable\" or not.\n\nSecond. It is argued that the requirement that the revocation notice be on a form provided by the Trainmen is necessary in the interests of orderly procedure, and that the collective agreement provision was an appropriate place to specify this procedure. We might note that the original Committee rejection of the concept of individual authorization and revocation was supported for much the same reasons - that it was inconsistent with orderly procedure - but this view did not prevail finally in the Act.\n11\n Of course, the parties may act to minimize the procedural problems caused by Congress' choice. Carriers and labor organizations may set up procedures through the collective \n\n[359 \nU.S. 326, 335]\n\u00a0\n agreement for processing, between themselves, individual assignments and revocations received, and carriers may make reasonable designations, in or out of collective bargaining contracts, of agents to whom revocations may be sent. Revocations, after all, must be sent somewhere. And doubtless forms may be established, by way of suggestion, and means for making them available set up. But here a specific procedure was established and made mandatory, imposing requirements over and above what we can perceive to be fairly those of the statute - which are simply that there be a writing, attributable to the employee and fairly expressing a revocation of his assignment, furnished the carrier.\n\nThe respondents urge that the requirement is necessary in the interests of preventing fraud and forgery, and of obviating disputes as to the authenticity of revocation instruments. Such problems are hardly peculiar to this setting. If the company suspects fraud or forgery in a revocation, it is within its power informally to check the matter with the employee. But we think it has no power, whether pursuant to action taken jointly with the labor organization in the collective bargaining agreement or to unilateral declaration, to treat as nullities revocation notices which are clearly intended as such and about whose authenticity there is no dispute.\n\nThe Trainmen next justify the procedure as a necessary protection to the employee from himself - that is, from his desire to revoke the checkoff - and from outside undue influence to do so, presumably that of a rival organization or of management. But Congress apparently foresaw and discounted any necessity for this protection when it took the matter out of the hands of the carriers and labor organizations and left it to the employee's individual choice. It did not make any provision for preliminary correspondence or dealings between the employee and the \n\n[359 \nU.S. 326, 336]\n\u00a0\n organization when the employee wanted to stop the checkoff, whether incident to terminating his affiliation or not. The complete freedom of individual choice in this area, undampened by the necessity of such preliminary dealings with the labor organization to make it effective, may seem unfortunate to labor organizations, but it is a problem with which we think Congress intended them to live.\n\nThird. There is some suggestion that, possibly apart from the provisions of the Act, because petitioner was a member of the Trainmen and represented by them in the negotiation of the bargaining agreement, he is bound here by the action of his agent, as it were, in establishing this provision. But the short answer is that the proviso makes it clear that the organization was not to function as its members' agent in waiving their statutory revocation rights; we doubt whether the right to revoke could be waived at all in advance of the time for its exercise, but in any event, a waiver through the collective agreement would, under the statute, be the last conceivably permissible. And equally lacking in merit is the suggestion that the requirement of a Trainmen-furnished form is so trivial as to make the whole controversy de minimis and perhaps deny petitioner and those in his position judicial redress. Additional paper work or correspondence, after he once has indicated his desire to revoke in writing, might well be some deterrent, so Congress might think, to the exercise of free choice by an individual worker. When one considers the problem in its industrial setting and recalls the fact that individual workmen are not as equipped for and inclined to correspondence as are business offices, any complication of the procedure necessary to withdraw or the addition of any extra steps to it may be burdensome. That involved here may deter employees from taking an action they might have taken if no preliminary contact with their lodge was necessary. And within the area that the Act leaves open for solicitation by rival organizations \n\n[359 \nU.S. 326, 337]\n\u00a0\n - as where no union shop has been established,\n12\n or within the area where even a worker under a union-shop arrangement can change affiliations, see Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Rychlik, \n352 \nU.S. 480, 492\n-494 - the matter may be far from trivial, as the facts in this case suggest. Organizational efforts are attended by persuading the recruit to drop his membership in his present union and terminate any checkoff of his wages in its favor.\n13\n There may well be a difference in the weight of persuasion necessary to enlist the worker if he cannot at once effectuate his intentions through papers furnished him on the spot by the recruiting organization. We do not say whether the \"cooling off\" period which the procedure insisted upon here creates would be wise or unwise as a matter of policy. It is enough to say that we believe the Act has not left \n\n[359 \nU.S. 326, 338]\n\u00a0\n any place for it. We think the added requirement involved here is meaningfully burdensome when considered in context; but in any event, we do not think the Act empowered carriers and labor organizations to bargain for any restrictions on the individual's right to revoke his assignment, even if later, while insisting on them, they choose to describe them as petty.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Act is c. 347, 44 Stat. 577, c. 691, 48 Stat. 1185, as amended, 45 U.S.C. 151-163. The Act was originally enacted in 1926 and considerably rewritten in 1934.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The amendment added a new paragraph to 2 of the Act, 2 Eleventh.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The contract provision is as follows: \"Both the authorization forms and the revocation of authorization forms shall be reproduced and furnished as necessary by the Organization without cost to the Company. The Organization shall assume full responsibility for the procurement and execution of the forms by employees and for the delivery of such forms to the Company.\"\n\nThe Trainmen's position, concurred in by the company, is that this provision means that no revocation cards are to be recognized \"except those reproduced by our organization.\" While this construction of the agreement is hardly an obvious one, it is the construction put on the agreement by the parties to it, the Southern Pacific and the Trainmen, and since petitioner in this suit does not question it as a matter of construction, we of course accept it here.\n\nSince there was no question of interpretation or application of the collective agreement, but rather only one of its validity under the statute, the case is not one in which resort to the grievance and Adjustment Board machinery provided by the Railway Labor Act was required. \"This dispute involves the validity of the contract, not its meaning.\" Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v.

See Mulford v. Smith, \n307 \nU.S. 38, 46\n; Turner, Dennis & Lowry Lumber Co. v. Chicago, M. & St. P. R.

After this, petitioner listed others.

No. 2262, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., Senators Taft, H. Alexander Smith, and Donnell attached a statement of supplementary views by which they reserved the right to introduce and support on the \n\n[359 \nU.S. 326, 333]\n\u00a0\n floor amendments, inter alia, which would \"cause the . . . check-off conditions of employees of industry covered by the Railway Labor Act to be in general accord with the . . . check-off conditions of employees of other industry.\" Id., at 5. These three Senators had been among those responsible for pressing an amendment to the Senate Committee version of the Taft-Hartley Act which restored to the Senate version of that Act the provision for individual option on the checkoff which they had desired during Committee deliberation, and now found in 302 (c) (4) of that Act, 61 Stat. 157, 29 U.S.C. 186 (c) (4). See S. Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 53. The provision finally enacted in the Railway Labor amendment was quite similar to that of the Taft-Hartley Act.\n\nFor the concern with the matter at the Senate hearings, see Hearings before a Subcommittee of the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, United States Senate, on S. 3295, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 74, 86, 94, 173, 188, 208. Senator Donnell was primarily concerned with the point. Id., at 74, 86, 94, 188.\n\nThere were a few references to the matter at the House hearings. See Hearings before the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, House of Representatives, on H. R. 7789, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 33, 91, 261.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] The House Report, note 8, supra, at 6, had argued: \"[T]here is a stability of employment relationships in the railroad industry not found in industry generally. The committee felt that if an employee is required to become and remain a member of a labor organization as a condition of employment with a resulting obligation to pay dues, initiation fees, and assessments, and with the slight prospect of changing employment or his union affiliation within the industry, no statutory requirement for individual assignments seemed necessary. Furthermore, the physical nature of railroad and airline operations would make a mandatory requirement of individual assignments an exceedingly cumbersome procedure. Employees of a single carrier are scattered over thousands of miles of territory and many are located in isolated spots where few other persons are employed. It would seem that a mandatory requirement for assignments from individual employees would result in confusion and lack of stability. . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] The Act makes no formal relationship between a union-shop arrangement and a checkoff arrangement; under it the parties can negotiate either one without the other, if they are so disposed. And of course, a labor organization member who is subject to a union-shop arrangement need not subscribe to the checkoff; he can maintain his standing by paying his dues personally.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] The respondents make some suggestion that petitioner was not harmed because in any event the carrier could not continue a checkoff in favor of the Trainmen after it learned that he was no longer a member. Section 2 Eleventh (c) provides that \"no [checkoff] agreement made pursuant to subparagraph (b) shall provide for deductions from his [an employee within specified categories] wages for periodic dues, initiation fees, or assessments payable to any labor organization other than that in which he holds membership.\" 64 Stat. 1238. But there is no showing when the carrier received notice of petitioner's change of membership; the papers used by him to revoke the checkoff and furnished the carrier did not refer to such a change. And of course a worker could revoke his checkoff authorization and remain a member of the same labor organization. It is clear that Congress meant to make the checkoff machinery stand on its own feet and be independent of any machinery for changing labor organizations - notice of which would ordinarily be sent only to the organizations involved.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS concur, dissenting.\n\nI would affirm the action of the District Court and the Court of Appeals in dismissing this petition for declaratory judgment and injunction. I agree, of course, that the provisions of the Railway Labor Act authorizing railroad workers to revoke their previously executed \"check-off\" agreements \"after the expiration of one year\" grant workers a right which neither Union, nor Railroad, nor both together, can take away in whole or in part. I am of the opinion, however, that the collective bargaining agreement between the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen (B. R. T.) and the Southern Pacific Company provides a procedure which substantially aids in the preservation of the employees' statutory right to revoke their assignments at will. Since the checkoff provisions of the Act were not designed primarily to aid the Railroad, it is natural that the governing contract between Railroad and Union should relieve the Railroad, as much as possible, of burdens and expenses. Necessarily, Congress in authorizing checkoff arrangements contemplated that they could be administered in a businesslike manner, without imposition of undue burden on the railroads. It seems plain to me that the provision of the contract requiring that revocation be made through the B. R. T. to the Railroad, on forms supplied by the B. R. T. is, on the \n\n[359 \nU.S. 326, 339]\n\u00a0\n whole, just and practical as applied to the Railroad, the Union and its members.\n\nBut in any event, the circumstances existing here call for no exercise of a court's discretionary power either to enter a declaratory judgment or to grant an injunction. This suit was filed April 12, 1957 - 10 days after B. R. T. in response to petitioner's letter terminating his membership and revoking his Wage Assignment Authorization mailed to petitioner for his signature the revocation form provided for in the collective bargaining contract. At the time of filing suit petitioner had no more than a highly questionable claim for one month's dues - several dollars. He also had in his possession the B. R. T. form which would have been recognized both by the B. R. T. and the Railroad. Petitioner therefore could have avoided any future deductions, and any possible damage to himself, merely by signing and mailing that form. And he could have recovered the one month's dues, if illegally deducted, by suit against the Railroad.\n\nEquity's extraordinary power to grant injunctive relief to prevent irreparable damage can hardly be sustained by the proof in this case; plainly enough petitioner could not show irreparable damage, and, in fact, did not even allege it. Similarly, he could not claim he lacked an adequate remedy at law. Nor would declaratory relief be appropriate, for as we have said:\n\n\"The declaratory judgment procedure may be resorted to only in the sound discretion of the Court and where the interests of justice will be advanced and an adequate and effective judgment may be rendered.\" Alabama Federation of Labor v. McAdory, \n325 \nU.S. 450, 462\n.\n\n\n The question we finally have here, therefore, is whether the District Court and the Court of Appeals should be reversed because they refused to use the court's process \n\n[359 \nU.S. 326, 340]\n\u00a0\n in a controversy which, in reality, is between two unions over which one's printed form shall be used to revoke an assignment. Perhaps judicial history can produce no other case in which the extraordinary relief the Court now orders granted has been accorded under comparable circumstances. For any possible injury to petitioner would have been avoided except for his stubborn refusal to sign a simple, 11-line form identical to one he had already signed. The federal courts have too much work to do in adjudicating real, genuine, meaningful cases or controversies to have their time consumed in consideration of trivial disputes like this one. I would affirm the decisions below. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 326, 341]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","53":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFIRESTONE TIRE & RUBBER v.

JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nActing on a complaint from a resident of the 4300 block of Reisterstown Road, Baltimore, Maryland, that there were rats in her basement, Gentry, an inspector of the Baltimore City Health Department, began an inspection of the houses in the vicinity looking for the source of the rats. In the middle of the afternoon of February 27, 1958, Gentry knocked on the door of appellant's detached frame home at 4335 Reisterstown Road. After receiving no response he proceeded to inspect the area outside the house. This inspection revealed that the house was in an \"extreme state of decay,\" and that in the rear of the house there was a pile later identified as \"rodent feces mixed with straw and trash and debris to approximately half a ton.\" During this inspection appellant came around the side of the house and asked Gentry to explain his presence. Gentry responded that he had evidence of rodent infestation and asked appellant for permission to inspect the basement area. Appellant refused. At no time did Gentry have a warrant authorizing him to enter. The next forenoon Gentry, in the company of two police officers, returned to appellant's house. After receiving no response to his knock, he reinspected the exterior of the premises. He then swore out a warrant for appellant's arrest alleging a violation of 120 of Art. 12 of the Baltimore City Code. That section provides:\n\n \"Whenever the Commissioner of Health shall have cause to suspect that a nuisance exists in any house, cellar or enclosure, he may demand entry therein in the day time, and if the owner or occupier shall refuse or delay to open the same and admit a free examination, he shall forfeit and pay for every such refusal the sum of Twenty Dollars.\" \n\n[359 \nU.S. 360, 362]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Appellant was arrested on March 5, and the next day was found guilty of the offense alleged in the warrant by a Police Justice for the Northern District of Baltimore and fined twenty dollars. On appeal, the Criminal Court of Baltimore, in a de novo proceeding, also found appellant guilty. The Maryland Court of Appeals denied certiorari. The case came here under a challenge, 28 U.S.C. 1257 (2), to the validity of 120 to determine whether appellant's conviction for resisting an inspection of his house without a warrant was obtained in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe Health Code of the City of Baltimore, of which 120 is an important part, deals with many of the multiform aspects of hygiene in modern urban areas. A vital portion concerns the hygiene of housing. Typical of the content and method of enforcing its provisions is the section requiring that \"[e]very dwelling and every part thereof shall be kept clean and free from any accumulation of dirt, filth, rubbish, garbage or similar matter, and shall be kept free from vermin or rodent infestation.\" Baltimore City Code, Art. 12, 112. If the occupant of a building fails to meet this standard, he is notified by the Commissioner of Health to abate the substandard conditions.\n1\n Failure to remove these hazards to community health gives rise to criminal prosecution. Ibid. The attempted inspection of appellant's home was merely to ascertain the existence of evils to be corrected upon due notification or, in default of such correction, to be made the basis of punishment.\n\nWe have said that \"[t]he security of one's privacy against arbitrary intrusion by the police\" is fundamental to a free society and as such protected by the Fourteenth \n\n[359 \nU.S. 360, 363]\n\u00a0\n Amendment. Wolf v. Colorado, \n338 \nU.S. 25, 27\n. Application of the broad restraints of due process compels inquiry into the nature of the demand being made upon individual freedom in a particular context and the justification of social need on which the demand rests.\n\nThe history of the constitutional protection against official invasion of the citizen's home makes explicit the human concerns which it was meant to respect. In years prior to the Revolution leading voices in England and the Colonies protested against the ransacking by Crown officers of the homes of citizens in search of evidence of crime or of illegally imported goods. The vivid memory by the newly independent Americans of these abuses produced the Fourth Amendment as a safeguard against such arbitrary official action by officers of the new Union, as like provisions had already found their way into State Constitutions.\n\nIn 1765, in England, what is properly called the great case of Entick v. Carrington, 19 Howell's State Trials, col. 1029, announced the principle of English law which became part of the Bill of Rights and whose basic protection has become imbedded in the concept of due process of law. It was there decided that English law did not allow officers of the Crown to break into a citizen's home, under cover of a general executive warrant, to search for evidence of the utterance of libel. Among the reasons given for that decision were these:\n\n \"It is very certain, that the law obligeth no man to accuse himself; because the necessary means of compelling self-accusation, falling upon the innocent as well as the guilty, would be both cruel and unjust; and it should seem, that search for evidence is disallowed upon the same principle. There too the innocent would be confounded with the guilty.\" Id., at col. 1073. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 360, 364]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n These were not novel pronouncements to the colonists. A few years earlier, in Boston, revenue officers had been authorized to use Writs of Assistance, empowering them to search suspected places, including private houses, for smuggled goods. In 1761 the validity of the use of the Writs was contested in the historic proceedings in Boston. James Otis attacked the Writ of Assistance because its use placed \"the liberty of every man in the hands of every petty officer.\"\n2\n His powerful argument so impressed itself first on his audience and later on the people of all the Colonies that President Adams was in retrospect moved to say that \"American Independence was then and there born.\"\n3\n Many years later this Court, in Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616\n, carefully reviewed this history and pointed out, as did Lord Camden in Entick v. Carrington, that\n\n \". . . the `unreasonable searches and seizures' condemned in the Fourth Amendment are almost always made for the purpose of compelling a man to give \n\n[359 \nU.S. 360, 365]\n\u00a0\n evidence against himself, which in criminal cases is condemned in the Fifth Amendment; and compelling a man `in a criminal case to be a witness against himself,' which is condemned in the Fifth Amendment, throws light on the question as to what is an `unreasonable search and seizure' within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\" \n116 \nU.S., at 633\n.\n\n\n Against this background two protections emerge from the broad constitutional proscription of official invasion. The first of these is the right to be secure from intrusion into personal privacy, the right to shut the door on officials of the state unless their entry is under proper authority of law. The second, and intimately related protection, is self-protection: the right to resist unauthorized entry which has as its design the securing of information to fortify the coercive power of the state against the individual, information which may be used to effect a further deprivation of life or liberty or property. Thus, evidence of criminal action may not, save in very limited and closely confined situations, be seized without a judicially issued search warrant. It is this aspect of the constitutional protection to which the quoted passages from Entick v. Carrington and Boyd v. United States refer. Certainly it is not necessary to accept any particular theory of the interrelationship of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments\n4\n to realize what history makes plain, that it was on the issue of the right to be secure from searches for evidence to be used in criminal prosecutions or for forfeitures that the great battle for fundamental liberty was fought. While these concerns for individual rights were the historic impulses behind the Fourth Amendment and its analogues in state constitutions, the application \n\n[359 \nU.S. 360, 366]\n\u00a0\n of the Fourth Amendment and the extent to which the essential right of privacy is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment are of course not restricted within these historic bounds.\n\nBut giving the fullest scope to this constitutional right to privacy, its protection cannot be here invoked. The attempted inspection of appellant's home is merely to determine whether conditions exist which the Baltimore Health Code proscribes. If they do appellant is notified to remedy the infringing conditions. No evidence for criminal prosecution is sought to be seized. Appellant is simply directed to do what he could have been ordered to do without any inspection, and what he cannot properly resist, namely, act in a manner consistent with the maintenance of minimum community standards of health and well-being, including his own. Appellant's resistance can only be based, not on admissible self-protection, but on a rarely voiced denial of any official justification for seeking to enter his home. The constitutional \"liberty\" that is asserted is the absolute right to refuse consent for an inspection designed and pursued solely for the protection of the community's health, even when the inspection is conducted with due regard for every convenience of time and place.\n\nThe power of inspection granted by the Baltimore City Code is strictly limited, more exacting than the analogous provisions of many other municipal codes. Valid grounds for suspicion of the existence of a nuisance must exist. Certainly the presence of a pile of filth in the back yard combined with the run-down condition of the house gave adequate grounds for such suspicion. The inspection must be made in the day time. Here was no midnight knock on the door, but an orderly visit in the middle of the afternoon with no suggestion that the hour was inconvenient. Moreover, the inspector has no power to force \n\n[359 \nU.S. 360, 367]\n\u00a0\n entry and did not attempt it. A fine is imposed for resistance, but officials are not authorized to break past the unwilling occupant.\n\nThus, not only does the inspection touch at most upon the periphery of the important interests safeguarded by the Fourteenth Amendment's protection against official intrusion, but it is hedged about with safeguards designed to make the least possible demand on the individual occupant, and to cause only the slightest restriction on his claims of privacy. Such a demand must be assessed in the light of the needs which have produced it.\n\nInspection without a warrant, as an adjunct to a regulatory scheme for the general welfare of the community and not as a means of enforcing the criminal law, has antecedents deep in our history. For more than 200 years Maryland has empowered its officers to enter upon ships, carriages, shops, and homes in the service of the common welfare. In pre-revolutionary days trade, on which the viability of the struggling Colonies depended, was of primary concern. Thus, at a time when the tobacco trade was a vital part of Maryland's economy, inspections of ships and carriages without a warrant could be made to enforce uniform standards for packing and shipping tobacco.\n5\n Similarly, suspected evasion of import \n\n[359 \nU.S. 360, 368]\n\u00a0\n duties on liquor and other goods could be found out by inspection of stores and homes.\n6\n Generally the power of entry was carefully limited, requiring that ground for suspicion must exist and that the inspection be conducted between \"the rising and the setting of the sun.\"\n7\n\u00a0\n\nIn 1776 the newly independent State of Maryland incorporated, as part of its basic Declaration of Rights, the principle\n\n \"That all warrants, without oath or affirmation, to search suspected places, or to seize any person or property, are grievous and oppressive; and all general warrants - to search suspected places, or to apprehend suspected persons, without naming or describing the place, or the person in special - are illegal, and ought not to be granted.\" See 3 Thorpe, Federal and State Constitutions (1909), 1688.\n\n\n This provision was a product of the same history of abuse and protest that gave birth to the Fourth Amendment.\n8\n It remains today as an essential part of Maryland's Constitution. Yet, the years following its proclamation saw not a decline but a marked increase in statutory authorization for inspection of the citizen's home. Not only were the old regulations continued, but the power of \n\n[359 \nU.S. 360, 369]\n\u00a0\n inspection was extended to new community concerns. In 1782, Commissioners were empowered to \"enter upon the lots, grounds, and possessions, of any person or persons . . .\" in order to regulate and keep in repair the common sewerage systems.\n9\n Five years later similar entries on private property were allowed for the purpose of keeping the public roads in repair.\n10\n Typical of the regulatory statutes enacted in this period was an act permitting the clerk of the market \"to examine and weigh all such bread, and to seize, for the use of the poor of the county, all such as they shall find deficient in weight or fineness, and not baked or marked as aforesaid . . . .\"\n11\n The penalty for resisting the entry of the clerk was \"five pounds current money.\" And so, when, in 1801, the power of inspection without a warrant became an instrument of the enforcement of the Baltimore health laws, no novel or untried procedures were being invoked. The ordinance now challenged derives from this 1801 ordinance. It provided:\n\n \"And be it enacted and ordained, That when, and as often as the said commissioners of health, or any of them, shall have cause to suspect a nuisance dangerous to the health of the city exists in any house, cellar or inclosure shut up from public view, they, or any one of them, may demand entry therein in the day time for the purpose of examining the same, and if the owner or occupier thereof shall refuse or delay \n\n[359 \nU.S. 360, 370]\n\u00a0\n to open the same and to admit a free examination, he shall forfeit and pay for every such refusal the sum of twenty dollars, for the use of the corporation.\"\n12\n\u00a0\n\n\n From the passage of this ordinance to the present the prevention and abatement of \"nuisances\" on private property has been one of the chief concerns of the Baltimore City Health Department.\n13\n In the latter half of the nineteenth century, in the years following the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, thousands upon thousands of inspections were made under authority of this ordinance.\n14\n Thus the system of inspection here under attack, having its beginning in Maryland's colonial history, has been an integral part of the enforcement of Baltimore's health laws for more than a century and a half. The legal significance of such a long and consistent history of state practice has been illuminated for us by Mr. Justice Holmes:\n\n \"The Fourteenth Amendment, itself a historical product, did not destroy history for the States and substitute mechanical compartments of law all exactly alike. If a thing has been practised for two hundred years by common consent, it will need a strong case for the Fourteenth Amendment to affect it, . . . .\" Jackman v. Rosenbaum Co., \n260 \nU.S. 22, 31\n. (As to the constitutional significance of a \"time-honored procedure\" see Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land and Improvement Co., 18 How. 272, and Ownbey v. Morgan, \n256 \nU.S. 94\n.) \n\n[359 \nU.S. 360, 371]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Of course, this wise reminder, that what free people have found consistent with their enjoyment of freedom for centuries is hardly to be deemed to violate due process, does not freeze due process within the confines of historical facts or discredited attitudes.\n15\n \"It is of the very nature of a free society to advance in its standards of what is deemed reasonable and right. Representing as it does a living principle, due process is not confined within a permanent catalogue of what may at a given time be deemed the limits or the essentials of fundamental rights.\" Wolf v. Colorado, \n338 \nU.S. 25, 27\n.\n\nThe power here challenged rests not only on a long history of its exercise. It is a power which was continually strengthened and applied to wider concerns through those very years when the right of individuals to be free from peremptory official invasion received increasing legislative and judicial protection. Nor is this a situation where a new body of knowledge displaces previous premises of action. There is a total want of important modification in the circumstances or the structure of society which calls for a disregard of so much history. On the contrary, the problems which gave rise to these ordinances have multiplied manifold, as have the difficulties of enforcement. The need to maintain basic, minimal standards of housing, to prevent the spread of disease and of that pervasive breakdown in the fiber of a people which is produced by slums and the absence of the barest essentials of civilized living, has mounted to a major concern of American government. The growth of cities, the crowding of populations, the increased awareness of the responsibility of the state for the living conditions of its citizens, all have combined to create problems of the \n\n[359 \nU.S. 360, 372]\n\u00a0\n enforcement of minimum standards of far greater magnitude than the writers of these ancient inspection laws ever dreamed. Time and experience have forcefully taught that the power to inspect dwelling places, either as a matter of systematic area-by-area search or, as here, to treat a specific problem, is of indispensable importance to the maintenance of community health; a power that would be greatly hobbled by the blanket requirement of the safeguards necessary for a search of evidence of criminal acts. The need for preventive action is great, and city after city has seen this need and granted the power of inspection to its health officials; and these inspections are apparently welcomed by all but an insignificant few.\n16\n Certainly, the nature of our society has not vitiated the need for inspections first thought necessary 158 years ago, nor has experience revealed any abuse or inroad on freedom in meeting this need by means that history and dominant public opinion have sanctioned.\n\nThat there is \"a total unlikeness\" between \"official acts and proceedings,\" Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616, 624\n, for which the legal protection of privacy requires a \n\n[359 \nU.S. 360, 373]\n\u00a0\n search warrant under the Fourteenth Amendment, and the situation now under consideration is laid bare by the suggestion that the kind of an inspection by a health official with which we are concerned may be satisfied by what is, in effect, a synthetic search warrant, an authorization \"for periodic inspections.\" If a search warrant be constitutionally required, the requirement cannot be flexibly interpreted to dispense with the rigorous constitutional restrictions for its issue. A loose basis for granting a search warrant for the situation before us is to enter by way of the back door to a recognition of the fact that by reason of their intrinsic elements, their historic sanctions, and their safeguards, the Maryland proceedings requesting permission to make a search without intruding when permission is denied, do not offend the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nIn light of the long history of this kind of inspection and of modern needs, we cannot say that the carefully circumscribed demand which Maryland here makes on appellant's freedom has deprived him of due process of law.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] If the nuisance constitutes an actual menace to health the Commissioner may abate it forthwith.

JUSTICE WHITTAKER, concurring.\n\nThe core of the Fourth Amendment prohibiting unreasonable searches applies to the States through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Wolf v. Colorado, \n338 \nU.S. 25\n. I understand the Court's opinion to adhere fully to that principle. And being convinced that the health inspector's request for permission to enter petitioner's premises in midday for the sole purpose of attempting to locate the habitat of disease-carrying rodents known to be somewhere in the immediate area was not a request for permission to make, and that the Code procedures followed did not amount to enforcement \n\n[359 \nU.S. 360, 374]\n\u00a0\n of, an unreasonable search within the meaning of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, I join the opinion of the Court.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN concur, dissenting.\n\nThe decision today greatly dilutes the right of privacy which every homeowner had the right to believe was part of our American heritage. We witness indeed an inquest over a substantial part of the Fourth Amendment.\n\nThe question in this case is whether a search warrant is needed to enter a citizen's home to investigate sanitary conditions. The Court holds that no search warrant is needed, that a knock on the door is all that is required, that for failure of the citizen to open the door he can be punished. From these conclusions I am forced to dissent.\n\nThe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment enjoins upon the States the guarantee of privacy embodied in the Fourth Amendment (Wolf v. Colorado, \n338 \nU.S. 25\n) - whatever may be the means established under the Fourth Amendment to enforce that guarantee. The Court now casts a shadow over that guarantee as respects searches and seizures in civil cases. Any such conclusion would require considerable editing and revision of the Fourth Amendment. For by its terms it protects the citizen against unreasonable searches and seizures by government, whatever may be the complaint. The words are broad and inclusive:\n\n \"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\" \n\n[359 \nU.S. 360, 375]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The Court said in Wolf v. Colorado, supra, at 27, that \"The security of one's privacy against arbitrary intrusion by the police - which is at the core of the Fourth Amendment - is basic to a free society.\" Now that resounding phrase is watered down to embrace only certain invasions of one's privacy. If officials come to inspect sanitary conditions, they may come without a warrant and demand entry as of right. This is a strange deletion to make from the Fourth Amendment. In some States the health inspectors are none other than the police themselves. In some States the presence of unsanitary conditions gives rise to criminal prosecutions. Baltimore City Code, Art. 12, 112 and 119 - the one involved in the present case - makes the failure to abate a nuisance a misdemeanor. The knock on the door in any health inspection case may thus lay the groundwork for a criminal prosecution. The resistance of the citizen in the present case led to the imposition of a fine. If a fine may be imposed, why not a prison term?\n\nIt is said, however, that this fine is so small as to amount only to an assessment to cover the costs of the inspection. Yet if this fine can be imposed, the premises can be revisited without a warrant and repeated fines imposed. The truth is that the amount of the fine is not the measure of the right. The right is the guarantee against invasion of the home by officers without a warrant. No officer of government is authorized to penalize the citizen because he invokes his constitutional protection.\n\nMoreover, the protection of the Fourth Amendment has heretofore been thought to protect privacy when civil litigation, as well as criminal prosecutions, was in the offing. Why otherwise the great care exercised by the Court in restricting agencies like the Federal Trade Commission in making investigations in support of their power to issue cease and desist orders? Fear of trespassing on Fourth Amendment rights was expressly made the \n\n[359 \nU.S. 360, 376]\n\u00a0\n ground for a narrow reading of statutory powers in Federal Trade Comm'n v. American Tobacco Co., \n264 \nU.S. 298, 307\n. The \"fishing expeditions\" there condemned, id., at 306, led no more directly to possible criminal prosecutions than the knock on the door in the present case.\n\nThe Court misreads history when it relates the Fourth Amendment primarily to searches for evidence to be used in criminal prosecutions. That certainly is not the teaching of Entick v. Carrington, 19 Howell's St. Tr. col. 1029. At that time - 1765 - it was the search for the nonconformist that led British officials to ransack private homes. The commands of our First Amendment (as well as the prohibitions of the Fourth and the Fifth) reflect the teachings of Entick v. Carrington, supra. These three amendments are indeed closely related, safeguarding not only privacy and protection against self-incrimination but \"conscience and human dignity and freedom of expression as well.\" See Ullmann v. United States, \n350 \nU.S. 422, 445\n et seq. (dissent); Feldman v. United States, \n322 \nU.S. 487, 499\n (dissent). It is only in that setting that Entick v. Carrington, supra, can be understood, as evidenced by Lord Camden's long review of the oppressive practices directed at the press by the Star Chamber, the Long Parliament, and the Licensing Acts. 19 Howell's St. Tr. cols. 1069-1072. It was in the setting of freedom of expression that Lord Camden denounced the general warrants. Taylor, The American Constitution (1911), p. 234, gives the correct interpretation of that historical episode:\n\n\"In the effort to destroy the freedom of the press, by a strained exercise of the prerogative a general warrant was issued in 1763 for the discovery and apprehension of the authors and printers (not named) of the obnoxious No. 45 of the North Briton, which commented in severe and offensive terms on the \n\n[359 \nU.S. 360, 377]\n\u00a0\n King's Speech at the prorogation of Parliament and upon the unpopular Peace of Paris recently (February 10, 1763) concluded. Forty-nine persons, including Wilkes, were arrested under the general warrant; and when it was ascertained that Wilkes was the author, an information for libel was filed against him on which a verdict was obtained. In suits afterward brought against the Under-Secretary of State who had issued the general warrant, Wilkes, and Dryden Leach, one of the printers arrested on suspicion, obtained verdicts for damages. When the matter came before the King's Bench in 1765, Lord Mansfield and the other three judges pronounced the general warrant illegal, declaring that `no degree of antiquity could give sanction to a usage bad in itself.'\" And see 2 Paterson, Liberty of the Subject (1877), pp. 129-132.\n\n\n This history, also recounted in Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616, 625\n-626, was, in the words of Mr. Justice Bradley, \"fresh in the memories of those who achieved our independence and established our form of government.\" The Fourth Amendment thus has a much wider frame of reference than mere criminal prosecutions.\n\nThe fallacy in maintaining that the Fourth Amendment was designed to protect criminals only was emphasized by Judge Prettyman in District of Columbia v. Little, 178 F.2d 13, 16-17, aff'd on other grounds, \n339 \nU.S. 1\n:\n\n \"The argument is wholly without merit, preposterous in fact. The basic premise of the prohibition against searches was not protection against self-incrimination; it was the common-law right of a man to privacy in his home, a right which is one of the indispensable ultimate essentials of our concept of civilization. It was firmly established in the common \n\n[359 \nU.S. 360, 378]\n\u00a0\n law as one of the bright features of the Anglo-Saxon contributions to human progress. It was not related to crime or to suspicion of crime. It belonged to all men, not merely to criminals, real or suspected. So much is clear from any examination of history, whether slight or exhaustive. The argument made to us has not the slightest basis in history. It has no greater justification in reason. To say that a man suspected of crime has a right to protection against search of his home without a warrant, but that a man not suspected of crime has no such protection, is a fantastic absurdity.\"\n\n\n Judge Prettyman added that the Fourth Amendment applied alike to health inspectors as well as to police officers - indeed to every and any official of government seeking admission to any home in the country:\n\n \"We emphasize that no matter who the officer is or what his mission, a government official cannot invade a private home, unless (1) a magistrate has authorized him to do so or (2) an immediate major crisis in the performance of duty affords neither time nor opportunity to apply to a magistrate. This right of privacy is not conditioned upon the objective, the prerogative or the stature of the intruding officer. His uniform, badge, rank, and the bureau from which he operates are immaterial. It is immaterial whether he is motivated by the highest public purpose or by the lowest personal spite.\" Id., at 17. And see 44 Ill. L. Rev. 845.\n\n\n The well-known protest of the elder Pitt against invasion of the home by the police, had nothing to do with criminal proceedings.\n\n\"The poorest man may in his cottage bid defiance to all the force of the Crown. It may be frail - its roof \n\n[359 \nU.S. 360, 379]\n\u00a0\n may shake - the wind may blow through it - the storm may enter, the rain may enter - but the King of England cannot enter - all his force dares not cross the threshold of the ruined tenement!\"\n\n\n While this statement did not specifically refer to the general warrant, it was said in reference to the danger of excise officers entering private homes to levy the \"Cyder Tax.\" 15 Hansard, Parliamentary History of England (1753-1765) p. 1307.\n\nSome of the statutes which James Otis denounced did not involve criminal proceedings. They in the main regulated customs and allowed forfeitures of goods shipped into the Colonies in violation of English shipping regulations.\n1\n The twenty-dollar forfeiture involved here is no different in substance from the ones that Otis and the colonists found so objectionable. For their objection went not to the amount or size of the forfeiture but to the lawless manner in which it was collected. \"Every man prompted by revenge, ill humour, or wantonness to inspect the inside of his neighbour's house, may get a writ of assistance.\" Tudor, Life of James Otis (1823), p. 68. It was not the search that was vicious. It was the absence of a warrant issued on a showing of probable cause that Otis denounced - the precise situation we have here:\n\n \"Now one of the most essential branches of English liberty is the freedom of one's house. A man's house is his castle; and whilst he is quiet, he is as well guarded as a prince in his castle. This writ, if it should be declared legal, would totally annihilate this privilege. Custom-house officers may enter our houses when they please; we are commanded to permit their entry. Their menial servants may enter, may break locks, bars, and every thing in their way: \n\n[359 \nU.S. 360, 380]\n\u00a0\n and whether they break through malice or revenge, no man, no court, can inquire. Bare suspicion without oath is sufficient.\" Id., at 66-67.\n\n\n The philosophy of the Fourth Amendment was well expressed by Mr. Justice Butler speaking for the Court in Agnello v. United States, \n269 \nU.S. 20, 32\n. \"The search of a private dwelling without a warrant is in itself unreasonable and abhorrent to our laws.\" We have emphasized over and again that a search without a warrant can be made only in exceptional circumstances. If a house is on fire or if the police see a fugitive enter a building, entry without a search warrant can of course be made. Yet absent such extraordinary situations, the right of privacy must yield only when a judicial officer issues a warrant for a search on a showing of probable cause. Johnson v. United States, \n333 \nU.S. 10, 14\n; Trupiano v. United States, \n334 \nU.S. 699, 705\n; McDonald v. United States, \n335 \nU.S. 451, 454\n-455. As we said in McDonald v. United States, supra, 455-456:\n\n \"The presence of a search warrant serves a high function. Absent some grave emergency, the Fourth Amendment has interposed a magistrate between the citizen and the police. This was done not to shield criminals nor to make the home a safe haven for illegal activities. It was done so that an objective mind might weigh the need to invade that privacy in order to enforce the law. The right of privacy was deemed too precious to entrust to the discretion of those whose job is the detection of crime and the arrest of criminals. Power is a heady thing; and history shows that the police acting on their own cannot be trusted. And so the Constitution requires a magistrate to pass on the desires of the police before they violate the privacy of the home. We cannot be true to that constitutional requirement and excuse \n\n[359 \nU.S. 360, 381]\n\u00a0\n the absence of a search warrant without a showing by those who seek exemption from the constitutional mandate that the exigencies of the situation made that course imperative.\"\n\n\n In the present case, the homeowner agreed to let the inspector in, if he got a search warrant. But none was ever sought. No excuse exists here for not getting a search warrant. A whole day elapsed between the first inspection and the arrest. The only reason given for not getting a warrant was the officer's convenience:\n\n \"Q. Could you not just as well have made your inspection one hour or two hours later than at the time you demanded entry?\n\n\n \"A. I could not. I had two students I had to release at three o'clock. I have to be in the office at three-thirty every day to take care of my reports.\"\n\n\n That is indeed flimsy ground for denying this home-owner the constitutional protection afforded by a search warrant.\n\nWe have as little reason for excluding this search from the Fourth Amendment as we would for limiting that Amendment to the kinds of warrants James Otis inveighed against - the writs of assistance and the general warrants. Cf. On Lee v. United States, \n343 \nU.S. 747, 762\n; Schwartz v. Texas, \n344 \nU.S. 199, 205\n. For as Chief Justice Vinson wrote in Nueslein v. District of Columbia, 73 App. D.C. 85, 87, 115 F.2d 690, 692, while the Fourth Amendment \"was written against the background of the general warrants in England and the writs of assistance in the American colonies,\" it \"gives a protection wider than these abuses.\" See 2 Ala. L. Rev. 314; 3 Vand L. Rev. 820; 63 Harv. L. Rev. 349. It was designed to protect the citizen against uncontrolled invasion of his privacy. It does not make the home a place of refuge from the law. It only requires the sanction of the judiciary rather than \n\n[359 \nU.S. 360, 382]\n\u00a0\n the executive before that privacy may be invaded. History shows that all officers tend to be officious; and health inspectors, making out a case for criminal prosecution of the citizen, are no exception.\n\nWe live in an era \"when politically controlled officials have grown powerful through an ever increasing series of minor infractions of civil liberties.\" 17 U. of Chi. L. Rev. 733, 740. One invasion of privacy by an official of government can be as oppressive as another. Health inspections are important. But they are hardly more important than the search for narcotic peddlers, rapists, kidnappers, murderers, and other criminal elements. As we have seen, searches were once in their heyday when the government was out to suppress the nonconformists. That is the true explanation of Entick v. Carrington, supra. Many today would think that the search for subversives was even more important than the search for unsanitary conditions. It would seem that the public interest in protecting privacy is equally as great in one case as in another. The fear that health inspections will suffer if constitutional safeguards are applied is strongly held by some. Like notions obtain by some law enforcement officials who take shortcuts in pursuit of criminals. The same pattern appears over and again whenever government seeks to use its compulsive force against the citizen. Legislative Committees (Watkins v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 178\n; Sweezy v. New Hampshire, \n354 \nU.S. 234\n), one-man grand juries (In re Oliver, \n333 \nU.S. 257\n), fire marshals (In re Groban, \n352 \nU.S. 330, 337\n), police (Rochin v. California, \n342 \nU.S. 165\n; On Lee v. United States, supra, 762; Leyra v. Denno, \n347 \nU.S. 556\n), sometimes seek to place their requirements above the Constitution. The official's measure of his own need often does not square with the Bill of Rights.\n\nCertainly this is a poor case for dispensing with the need for a search warrant. Evidence to obtain one was \n\n[359 \nU.S. 360, 383]\n\u00a0\n abundant. The house was in a state of extreme decay; and in the rear of the house was a pile of \"rodent feces mixed with straw and debris to approximately half a ton.\" This is not to suggest that a health official need show the same kind of proof to a magistrate to obtain a warrant as one must who would search for the fruits or instrumentalities of crime. Where considerations of health and safety are involved, the facts that would justify such an inference of \"probable cause\" to make an inspection are clearly different from those that would justify such an inference where a criminal investigation has been undertaken. Experience may show the need for periodic inspections of certain facilities without a further showing of cause to believe that substandard conditions dangerous to the public are being maintained. The passage of a certain period without inspection might of itself be sufficient in a given situation to justify the issuance of a warrant. The test of \"probable cause\" required by the Fourth Amendment can take into account the nature of the search that is being sought. This is not to sanction synthetic search warrants but to recognize that the showing of probable cause in a health case may have quite different requirements than the one required in graver situations. It can hardly be denied, unless history is ignored, that the policeman's or the inspector's knock on the door is one of these \"official acts and proceedings\" which Boyd v. United States, supra, 624, brought squarely within the Fourth Amendment. That being true, it seems to us plain that there is nothing in the Fourth Amendment that relieves the health inspector altogether from making an appropriate showing to a magistrate if he would enter a private dwelling without the owner's consent.\n\nThat problem, while important overall, is not important to the situation with which we deal. Figures submitted by the Baltimore Health Department show that citizens \n\n[359 \nU.S. 360, 384]\n\u00a0\n are mostly cooperative in granting entrance to inspectors.\n2\n There were 28,081 inspections in 1954; 25,021 in 1955; 35,120 in 1956; 33,573 in 1957; and 36,119 in 1958. And in all these instances the number of prosecutions was estimated to average one a year. Submission by the overwhelming majority of the populace indicates there is no peril to the health program. One rebel a year (cf. Whyte, The Organization Man) is not too great a price to pay for maintaining our guarantee of civil rights in full vigor.\n\nEngland - a nation no less mindful of public health than we and keenly conscious of civil liberties - has long proceeded on the basis that where the citizen denies entrance to a health inspector, a search warrant is needed. Public Health Act of 1936, 26 Geo. 5 & 1 Edw. 8, c. 49, 285-287; Vines v. Governors, 63 J. P. 244 (Q. B. 1899); Robinson v. Corporation of Sutherland, 1899. 1 Q. B. 751; Wimbledon Urban District Counsel v. Hastings, 87 L. T. Rep. (5 N. S.) 118 (K. B. 1902); Consett Urban District Council v. Crawford, 1903. 2 K.

BROOKLYN EASTERN TERMINAL(1959)\nNo. 446\nArgued: March 2, 1959Decided: April 20, 1959\n\n\n\n\n Claiming that respondent was estopped from pleading the statute of limitations because it had induced delay by representing to petitioner that he had seven years in which to sue, petitioner brought action against respondent in a Federal District Court under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, after expiration of the three-year statutory period of limitation, to recover damages for an industrial disease he allegedly contracted while working for respondent. Held: If petitioner can prove that respondent's responsible agents conducted themselves in such a way that he was justifiably misled into a good-faith belief that he could begin his action at any time within seven years after it accrued, he is entitled to have his case tried on the merits, and the District Court erred in dismissing the case on the ground that it was barred by the three-year limitation. Pp. 231-235.\n\n 253 F.2d 957, reversed.\n\nSeymour Schwartz argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief was John J. Seffern.\n\nWilliam C. Mattison argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was John J. Kennelly.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nIn 1957 petitioner brought this action under the Federal Employers' Liability Act to recover damages for an industrial disease he allegedly contracted in 1952 while working for respondent.\n1\n Although 6 of the Act provides that \"No action shall be maintained under this chapter unless commenced within three years from the day the cause of action accrued,\" petitioner claimed that respondent was estopped from raising this limitation because it had \n\n[359 \nU.S. 231, 232]\n\u00a0\n induced the delay by representing to petitioner that he had seven years in which to sue.\n2\n Respondent contended that while estoppel often prevents defendants from relying on statutes of limitations it can have no such effect in FELA cases for there the time limitation is an integral part of a new cause of action and that cause is irretrievably lost at the end of the statutory period. The District Court, after discussing two lines of cases \"in sharp conflict,\" one supporting respondent\n3\n and one supporting petitioner,\n4\n concluded with apparent reluctance that it was required by prior decisions of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to dismiss petitioner's suit.\n5\n The Court of Appeals affirmed, saying \"For the reasons well stated by [the District Court] we should not attempt to retrace our footsteps now, but may well await resolution of the conflict by the Supreme Court.\" 253 F.2d 957, 958. Since the question is important and recurring we granted certiorari. \n358 \nU.S. 814\n.\n\nTo decide the case we need look no further than the maxim that no man may take advantage of his own wrong. Deeply rooted in our jurisprudence this principle has been applied in many diverse classes of cases by both \n\n[359 \nU.S. 231, 233]\n\u00a0\n law and equity courts\n6\n and has frequently been employed to bar inequitable reliance on statutes of limitations.\n7\n In Schroeder v. Young, \n161 \nU.S. 334\n, this Court allowed a debtor to redeem property sold to satisfy a judgment, after the statutory time for redemption had expired although the statute granting the right to redeem also limited that right as to time.\n8\n The Court held that the purchasers could not rely on the limitation because one of them had told the debtor \"that he would not be pushed, that the statutory time to redeem would not be insisted upon, and [the debtor] believed and relied upon such assurance.\" The Court pointed out that in \"such circumstances the courts have held with great unanimity that the purchaser is estopped to insist upon the statutory period, notwithstanding the assurances were not in writing and were made without consideration, upon the ground that the debtor was lulled into a false security.\" \n161 \nU.S., at 344\n.\n9\n As Mr. Justice Miller expressed it in Insurance \n\n[359 \nU.S. 231, 234]\n\u00a0\n Co. v. Wilkinson, 13 Wall. 222, 233, \"The principle is that where one party has by his representations or his conduct induced the other party to a transaction to give him an advantage which it would be against equity and good conscience for him to assert, he would not in a court of justice be permitted to avail himself of that advantage. And although the cases to which this principle is to be applied are not as well defined as could be wished, the general doctrine is well understood and is applied by courts of law as well as equity where the technical advantage thus obtained is set up and relied on to defeat the ends of justice or establish a dishonest claim.\"\n\nWe have been shown nothing in the language or history of the Federal Employers' Liability Act to indicate that this principle of law, older than the country itself, was not to apply in suits arising under that statute.\n10\n Nor has counsel made any convincing arguments which might lead us to make an exception to the doctrine of estoppel in this case. To be sure language in some decisions of this Court can be taken as supporting such an exception.\n11\n\u00a0\n\n[359 \nU.S. 231, 235]\n\u00a0\n But that language is in dicta and is neither binding nor persuasive. Accordingly, we hold that it was error to dismiss this case. Despite the delay in filing his suit petitioner is entitled to have his cause tried on the merits if he can prove that respondent's responsible agents, agents with some authority in the particular matter, conducted themselves in such a way that petitioner was justifiably misled into a good-faith belief that he could begin his action at any time within seven years after it had accrued.\n\nIt is no answer to say, as respondent does, that the representations alleged were of law and not of fact and therefore could not justifiably be relied on by petitioner. Whether they could or could not depends on who made them and the circumstances in which they were made. See Scarborough v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 190 F.2d 935. Such questions cannot be decided at this stage of the proceedings.\n\nIt may well be that petitioner's complaint as now drawn is too vague, but that is no ground for dismissing his action. Cf. Conley v. Gibson, \n355 \nU.S. 41, 47\n-48. His allegations are sufficient for the present. Whether petitioner can in fact make out a case calling for application of the doctrine of estoppel must await trial.\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 35 Stat. 65, as amended, 45 U.S.C. 51-60.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Paragraph 9 of petitioner's complaint states, \"Subsequent thereto defendant's agents, servants and employees fraudulently or unintentionally misstated to plaintiff that he had seven years within which to bring an action against said defendant as a result of his industrial disease and in reliance thereon plaintiff withheld suit until the present time.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] American R.

McELROY(1959)\nNo. 180\nArgued: April 1, 1959Decided: June 29, 1959\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner, an aeronautical engineer, was general manager of a private corporation engaged in developing and producing for the Armed Forces goods involving military secrets, under contracts requiring the corporation to exclude from its premises persons not having security clearances. Under regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Defense without explicit authorization by either the President or Congress, and after administrative hearings in which he was denied access to much of the information adverse to him and any opportunity to confront or cross-examine witnesses against him, petitioner was deprived of his security clearance on the grounds of alleged Communistic associations and sympathies. As a consequence, the corporation discharged him and he was unable to obtain other employment as an aeronautical engineer. He sued for a judgment declaring that the revocation of his security clearance was unlawful and void and an order restraining the Secretaries of the Armed Forces from acting pursuant to it. Held: In the absence of explicit authorization from either the President or Congress, the Secretaries of the Armed Forces were not authorized to deprive petitioner of his job in a proceeding in which he was not afforded the safeguards of confrontation and cross-examination. Pp. 475-508.\n\n (a) Neither Executive Order No. 10290 nor Executive Order No. 10501 empowers any executive agency to fashion security programs whereby persons are deprived of their civilian employment and of the opportunity of continued activity in their chosen professions without being accorded the chance to challenge effectively the evidence and testimony upon which an adverse security determination might rest. Pp. 500-502.\n\n\n (b) Neither the National Security Act of 1947 nor the Armed Services Procurement Act of 1947, even when read in conjunction with 18 U.S.C. 798, making it a crime to communicate to unauthorized persons information concerning cryptographic or intelligence activities, and 50 U.S.C. 783 (b), making it a crime \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 475]\n\u00a0\n for an officer or employee of the United States to communicate classified information to agents of foreign governments or officers and members of \"Communist organizations,\" constitutes an authorization to create an elaborate clearance program under which persons may be seriously restrained in their employment opportunities through a denial of clearance without the safeguards of cross-examination and confrontation. Pp. 502-504.\n\n\n (c) Congressional ratification of the security clearance procedures cannot be implied from the continued appropriation of funds to finance aspects of the program fashioned by the Department of Defense. Pp. 504-505.\n\n\n (d) In this area of questionable constitutionality, this Court will not hold that a person may be deprived of the right to follow his chosen profession without full hearings where accusers may be confronted and cross-examined, when neither the President nor Congress has explicitly authorized such procedure.

Slade and Bernard Cedarbaum.\n\nDavid I. Shapiro filed a brief for the American Civil Liberties Union, as amicus curiae, urging reversal.\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case involves the validity of the Government's revocation of security clearance granted to petitioner, an aeronautical engineer employed by a private manufacturer which produced goods for the armed services. Petitioner was discharged from his employment solely as a consequence of the revocation because his access to classified information was required by the nature of his job. After his discharge, petitioner was unable to secure \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 476]\n\u00a0\n employment as an aeronautical engineer and for all practical purposes that field of endeavor is now closed to him.\n\nPetitioner was vice president and general manager of Engineering and Research Corporation (ERCO), a business devoted primarily to developing and manufacturing various mechanical and electronic products. He began this employment in 1937 soon after his graduation from the Guggenheim School of Aeronautics and, except for a brief leave of absence, he stayed with the firm until his discharge in 1953. He was first employed as a junior engineer and draftsman. Because of the excellence of his work he eventually became a chief executive officer of the firm. During his career with ERCO, he was credited with the expedited development of a complicated electronic flight simulator and with the design of a rocket launcher, both of which were produced by ERCO and long used by the Navy.\n\nDuring the post-World War II period, petitioner was given security clearances on three occasions.\n1\n These were required by the nature of the projects undertaken by ERCO for the various armed services.\n2\n On November 21, \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 477]\n\u00a0\n 1951, however, the Army-Navy-Air Force Personnel Security Board (PSB) advised ERCO that the company's clearances for access to classified information were in jeopardy because of a tentative decision to deny petitioner access to classified Department of Defense information and to revoke his clearance for security reasons.\n3\n ERCO was invited to respond to this notification. The corporation, through its president, informed PSB that petitioner had taken an extended furlough due to the Board's action. The ERCO executive also stated that in his opinion petitioner was a loyal and discreet United States citizen and that his absence denied to the firm the services of an outstanding engineer and administrative executive. On December 11, 1951, petitioner was informed by the Board that it had \"decided that access by you to contract work and information [at ERCO] . . . would be inimical to \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 478]\n\u00a0\n the best interests of the United States.\" Accordingly, the PSB revoked petitioner's clearances. He was informed that he could seek a hearing before the Industrial Employment Review Board (IERB), and he took this course.\n4\n Prior to the hearing, petitioner received a letter informing him that the PSB action was based on information indicating that between 1943 and 1947 he had associated with Communists, visited officials of the Russian Embassy, and attended a dinner given by an allegedly Communist Front organization.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nOn January 23, 1952, petitioner, with counsel, appeared before the IERB. He was questioned in detail concerning his background and the information disclosed in the IERB letter. In response to numerous and searching questions he explained in substance that specific \"suspect\" persons with whom he was said to have associated were actually friends of his ex-wife. He explained in some detail that during his first marriage, which lasted from \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 479]\n\u00a0\n 1942 through 1947, his then wife held views with which he did not concur and was friendly with associates and other persons with whom he had little in common. He stated that these basic disagreements were the prime reasons that the marriage ended in failure. He attributed to his then wife his attendance at the dinner, his membership in a bookshop association which purportedly was a \"front\" organization, and the presence in his home of \"Communist\" publications. He denied categorically that he had ever been a \"Communist\" and he spoke at length about his dislike for \"a theory of Government which has for its object the common ownership of property.\" Lastly, petitioner explained that his visits to persons in various foreign embassies (including the Russian Embassy) were made in connection with his attempts to sell ERCO's products to their Governments. Petitioner's witnesses, who included top-level executives of ERCO and a number of military officers who had worked with petitioner in the past, corroborated many of petitioner's statements and testified in substance that he was a loyal and discreet citizen. These top-level executives of ERCO, whose right to clearance was never challenged, corroborated petitioner's testimony concerning his reasons for visiting the Russian Embassy.\n\nThe Government presented no witnesses. It was obvious, however, from the questions posed to petitioner and to his witnesses, that the Board relied on confidential reports which were never made available to petitioner. These reports apparently were compilations of statements taken from various persons contacted by an investigatory agency. Petitioner had no opportunity to confront and question persons whose statements reflected adversely on him or to confront the government investigators who took their statements. Moreover, it seemed evident that the Board itself had never questioned the investigators and \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 480]\n\u00a0\n had never seen those persons whose statements were the subject of their reports.\n\nOn January 29, 1952, the IERB, on the basis of the testimony given at the hearing and the confidential reports, reversed the action of the PSB and informed petitioner and ERCO that petitioner was authorized to work on Secret contract work.\n\nOn March 27, 1953, the Secretary of Defense abolished the PSB and IERB and directed the Secretaries of the three armed services to establish regional Industrial Personnel Security Boards to coordinate the industrial security program.\n6\n The Secretaries were also instructed to establish uniform standards, criteria, and procedures.\n7\n\u00a0\n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 481]\n\u00a0\n Cases pending before the PSB and IERB were referred to these new Boards.\n8\n During the interim period between the abolishment of the old program and the implementation of the new one, the Secretaries considered themselves charged with administering clearance activities under previously stated criteria.\n9\n\u00a0\n\nOn April 17, 1953, respondent Anderson, the Secretary of the Navy, wrote ERCO that he had reviewed petitioner's case and had concluded that petitioner's \"continued access to Navy classified security information [was] inconsistent with the best interests of National Security.\" No hearing preceded this notification. He requested ERCO to exclude petitioner \"from any part of your plants, factories or sites at which classified Navy projects are being carried out and to bar him access to all Navy classified information.\" He also advised the corporation that petitioner's case was being referred to the Secretary of Defense with the recommendation that the IERB's decision of January 29, 1952, be overruled. ERCO had no choice but to comply with the request.\n10\n\u00a0\n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 482]\n\u00a0\n This led to petitioner's discharge.\n11\n ERCO informed the Navy of what had occurred and requested an opportunity to discuss the matter in view of petitioner's importance to the firm.\n12\n The Navy replied that \"[a]s far as the Navy \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 483]\n\u00a0\n Department is concerned, any further discussion on this problem at this time will serve no useful purpose.\"\n\nPetitioner asked for reconsideration of the decision. On October 13, 1953, the Navy wrote to him stating that it had requested the Eastern Industrial Personnel Security Board (EIPSB) to accept jurisdiction and to arrive at a final determination concerning petitioner's status.\n13\n Various \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 484]\n\u00a0\n letters were subsequently exchanged between petitioner's counsel and the EIPSB. These resulted finally in generalized charges, quoted in the margin, incorporating the information previously discussed with petitioner at his 1952 hearing before the IERB.\n14\n\u00a0\n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 485]\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn April 28, 1954, more than one year after the Secretary took action, and for the two days thereafter, petitioner presented his case to the EIPSB and was cross-examined in detail. The hearing began with a \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 486]\n\u00a0\n statement by the Chairman, which included the following passage:\n\n\"The transcript to be made of this hearing will not include all material in the file of the case, in that, it will not include reports of investigation conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation or other investigative agencies which are confidential. Neither will it contain information concerning the identity of confidential informants or information which will reveal the source of confidential evidence. The transcript will contain only the Statement of Reasons, your answer thereto and the testimony actually taken at this hearing.\"\n\n\n Petitioner was again advised that the revocation of his security clearance was based on incidents occurring between 1942 and 1947, including his associations with alleged Communists, his visits with officials of the Russian Embassy, and the presence in his house of Communist literature.\n\nPetitioner, in response to a question, stated at the outset of the hearing that he was then employed at a salary of $4,700 per year as an architectural draftsman and that he had been receiving $18,000 per year as Vice President and General Manager of ERCO. He later explained that \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 487]\n\u00a0\n after his discharge from ERCO he had unsuccessfully tried to obtain employment in the aeronautics field but had been barricaded from it because of lack of clearance.\n15\n\u00a0\n\nPetitioner was subjected to an intense examination similar to that which he experienced before the IERB in 1952. During the course of the examination, the Board injected new subjects of inquiry and made it evident that it was relying on various investigatory reports and statements of confidential informants which were not made available to petitioner.\n16\n Petitioner reiterated in great detail the \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 488]\n\u00a0\n explanations previously given before the IERB. He was subjected to intense cross-examination, however, concerning reports that he had agreed with the views held by his ex-wife. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 489]\n\u00a0\n\n\nPetitioner again presented a number of witnesses who testified that he was loyal, that he had spoken approvingly of the United States and its economic system, that he was a valuable engineer, and that he had made valuable and significant contributions to this country's war efforts during World War II and the Korean War.\n\nSoon after the conclusion of the hearing, the EIPSB notified petitioner that it had affirmed the Secretary's action and that it had decided that the granting of clearance to petitioner for access to classified information was \"not clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\" Petitioner requested that he be furnished with a detailed statement of findings supporting the Board's decision. He was informed, however, that security considerations \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 490]\n\u00a0\n prohibited such disclosure.\n17\n On September 16, 1955, petitioner requested review by the Industrial Personnel Security Review Board.\n18\n On March 12, 1956, almost three years after the Secretary's action and nearly one year after the second hearing, he received a letter from the Director of the Office of Industrial Personnel Security Review informing him that the EIPSB had found that from 1942-1947 petitioner associated closely with his then wife and her friends, knowing that they were active in behalf of and sympathized with the Communist Party, that during part of this period petitioner maintained a sympathetic association with a number of officials of the Russian Embassy, that during this period petitioner's political views were similar to those of his then wife, that petitioner had been a member of a suspect bookshop association, had invested money in a suspect radio station, had attended a suspect dinner, and had, on occasion, Communist publications in his home, and that petitioner's credibility as a witness in the proceedings was doubtful. The letter also stated that the doubts concerning petitioner's credibility affected the Board's evaluation of his trustworthiness and that only trustworthy persons could be afforded access to classified information.\n19\n The EIPSB determination was affirmed.\n\nAfter the EIPSB decision in 1954, petitioner filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 491]\n\u00a0\n of Columbia asking for a declaration that the revocation was unlawful and void and for an order restraining respondents from acting pursuant to it.\n20\n He also asked for an order requiring respondents to advise ERCO that the clearance revocation was void. Following the affirmance of the EIPSB order by the Industrial Personnel Review Board, petitioner moved for summary judgment in the District Court. The Government cross-filed for dismissal of the complaint or summary judgment. The District Court granted the Government's motion for summary judgment, 150 F. Supp. 958, and the Court of Appeals affirmed that disposition, 103 U.S. App. D.C. 87, 254 F.2d 944.\n\nThe Court of Appeals recognized that petitioner had suffered substantial harm from the clearance revocation.\n21\n But in that court's view, petitioner's suit presented no \"justiciable controversy\" - no controversy which the courts could finally and effectively decide. This conclusion followed from the Court of Appeals' reasoning that the Executive Department alone is competent to evaluate the competing considerations which exist in determining the persons who are to be afforded security clearances. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 492]\n\u00a0\n The court also rejected petitioner's claim that he was deprived of his livelihood without the traditional safeguards required by \"due process of law\" such as confrontation of his accusers and access to confidential reports used to determine his fitness. Central to this determination was the court's unwillingness to order the Government to choose between disclosing the identities of informants or giving petitioner clearance.\n\nPetitioner contends that the action of the Department of Defense in barring him from access to classified information on the basis of statements of confidential informants made to investigators was not authorized by either Congress or the President and has denied him \"liberty\" and \"property\" without \"due process of law\" in contravention of the Fifth Amendment. The alleged property is petitioner's employment; the alleged liberty is petitioner's freedom to practice his chosen profession. Respondents admit, as they must, that the revocation of security clearance caused petitioner to lose his job with ERCO and has seriously affected, if not destroyed, his ability to obtain employment in the aeronautics field. Although the right to hold specific private employment and to follow a chosen profession free from unreasonable governmental interference comes within the \"liberty\" and \"property\" concepts of the Fifth Amendment, Dent v. West Virginia, \n129 \nU.S. 114\n; Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, \n353 \nU.S. 232\n; Peters v. Hobby, \n349 \nU.S. 331, 352\n (concurring opinion); cf. Slochower v. Board of Education, \n350 \nU.S. 551\n; Truax v. Raich, \n239 \nU.S. 33, 41\n; Allgeyer v. Louisiana, \n165 \nU.S. 578, 589\n-590; Powell v. Pennsylvania, \n127 \nU.S. 678, 684\n, respondents contend that the admitted interferences which have occurred are indirect by-products of necessary governmental action to protect the integrity of secret information and hence are not unreasonable and do not constitute deprivations within the meaning of the Amendment. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 493]\n\u00a0\n Alternatively, respondents urge that even if petitioner has been restrained in the enjoyment of constitutionally protected rights, he was accorded due process of law in that he was permitted to utilize those procedural safeguards consonant with an effective clearance program, in the administration of which the identity of informants and their statements are kept secret to insure an unimpaired flow to the Government of information concerning subversive conduct. But in view of our conclusion that this case should be decided on the narrower ground of \"authorization,\" we find that we need not determine the answers to these questions.\n22\n\u00a0\n\nThe issue, as we see it, is whether the Department of Defense has been authorized to create an industrial security clearance program under which affected persons may lose their jobs and may be restrained in following their chosen professions on the basis of fact determinations concerning their fitness for clearance made in proceedings in which they are denied the traditional procedural safeguards of confrontation and cross-examination.\n\nPrior to World War II, only sporadic efforts were made to control the clearance of persons who worked in private establishments which manufactured materials for national defense. Report of the Commission on Government Security, 1957, S. Doc. No. 64, 85th Cong., 1st Sess. 236. During World War II the War Department instituted a \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 494]\n\u00a0\n formalized program to obtain the discharge from war plants of persons engaged in sabotage, espionage, and willful activity designed to disrupt the national defense program. Id., at 237. In 1946, the War Department began to require contractors, before being given access to classified information, to sign secrecy agreements which required consent before their employees were permitted access to Top Secret or Secret information. Id., at 238. At the outset, each armed service administered its own industrial clearance program. Id., at 239. Later, the PSB and IERB were established by the Department of Defense and the Secretaries of the armed services to administer a more centralized program. Ibid. Confusion existed concerning the criteria and procedures to be employed by these boards. Ibid. Eventually, generalized procedures were established with the approval of the Secretaries which provided in part that before the IERB \"[t]he hearing will be conducted in such manner as to protect from disclosure information affecting the national security or tending to compromise investigative sources or methods . . . .\" See \"Procedures Governing Appeals to the Industrial Employment Review Board, dated 7 November 1949,\" note 4, supra, 4 (c). After abolition of these boards in 1953, and the establishment of the IPSB, various new sets of procedures were promulgated which likewise provided for the non-disclosure of information \"tending to compromise investigative sources or methods or the indentity of confidential informants.\"\n23\n\u00a0\n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 495]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAll of these programs and procedures were established by directives issued by the Secretary of Defense or the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. None was the creature of statute or of an Executive Order issued by the President.\n24\n\u00a0\n\nRespondents maintain that congressional authorization to the President to fashion a program which denies security clearance to persons on the basis of confidential information which the individuals have no opportunity to confront and test is unnecessary because the President has inherent authority to maintain military secrets inviolate. And respondents argue that if a statutory grant of power is necessary, such a grant can readily be inferred \"as a necessarily implicit authority from the generalized provisions\" of legislation dealing with the armed services. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 496]\n\u00a0\n But the question which must be decided in this case is not whether the President has inherent power to act or whether Congress has granted him such a power; rather, it is whether either the President or Congress exercised such a power and delegated to the Department of Defense the authority to fashion such a program.\n\nCertain principles have remained relatively immutable in our jurisprudence. One of these is that where governmental action seriously injures an individual, and the reasonableness of the action depends on fact findings, the evidence used to prove the Government's case must be disclosed to the individual so that he has an opportunity to show that it is untrue. While this is important in the case of documentary evidence, it is even more important where the evidence consists of the testimony of individuals whose memory might be faulty or who, in fact, might be perjurers or persons motivated by malice, vindictiveness, intolerance, prejudice, or jealousy. We have formalized these protections in the requirements of confrontation and cross-examination. They have ancient roots.\n25\n They find expression in the Sixth Amendment which provides that in all criminal cases the accused shall enjoy the right \"to be confronted with \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 497]\n\u00a0\n the witnesses against him.\" This Court has been zealous to protect these rights from erosion. It has spoken out not only in criminal cases, e. g., Mattox v. United States, \n156 \nU.S. 237, 242\n-244; Kirby v. United States, \n174 \nU.S. 47\n; Motes v. United States, \n178 \nU.S. 458, 474\n; In re Oliver, \n333 \nU.S. 257, 273\n, but also in all types of cases where administrative and regulatory actions were under scrutiny. E. g., Southern R. Co. v. Virginia, \n290 \nU.S. 190\n; Ohio Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n301 \nU.S. 292\n; Morgan v. United States, \n304 \nU.S. 1, 19\n; Carter v. Kubler, \n320 \nU.S. 243\n; Reilly v. Pinkus, \n338 \nU.S. 269\n. Nor, as it has been pointed out, has Congress ignored these fundamental requirements in enacting regulatory legislation. Joint Anti-Fascist Committee v. McGrath, \n341 \nU.S. 168\n-169 (concurring opinion).\n\nProfessor Wigmore, commenting on the importance of cross-examination, states in his treatise, 5 Wigmore on Evidence (3d ed. 1940) 1367:\n\n \"For two centuries past, the policy of the Anglo-American system of Evidence has been to regard the necessity of testing by cross-examination as a vital feature of the law. The belief that no safeguard for testing the value of human statements is comparable to that furnished by cross-examination, and the conviction that no statement (unless by special exception) should be used as testimony until it has been probed and sublimated by that test, has found increasing strength in lengthening experience.\"\n\n\n Little need be added to this incisive summary statement except to point out that under the present clearance procedures not only is the testimony of absent witnesses allowed to stand without the probing questions of the person under attack which often uncover inconsistencies, \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 498]\n\u00a0\n lapses of recollection, and bias,\n26\n but, in addition, even the members of the clearance boards do not see the informants or know their identities, but normally rely on an investigator's summary report of what the informant \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 499]\n\u00a0\n said without even examining the investigator personally.\n27\n\u00a0\n\nWe must determine against this background, whether the President or Congress has delegated to the Department \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 500]\n\u00a0\n of Defense the authority to by-pass these traditional and well-recognized safeguards in an industrial security clearance program which can operate to injure individuals substantially by denying to them the opportunity to follow chosen private professions. Respondents cite two Executive Orders which they believe show presidential delegation. The first, Exec. Order No. 10290, 16 Fed. Reg. 9795, was entitled \"Prescribing Regulations Establishing Minimum Standards For The Classification, Transmission, And Handling, By Departments And \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 501]\n\u00a0\n Agencies of the Executive Branch, Of Official Information Which Requires Safeguarding In The Interest Of The Security Of The United States.\" It provided, in relevant part:\n\n \"PART V - DISSEMINATION OF CLASSIFIED SECURITY     INFORMATION\n\n\n \"29. General. a. No person shall be entitled to knowledge or possession of, or access to, classified security information solely by virtue of his office or position.\n\n\n \"b. Classified security information shall not be discussed with or in the presence of unauthorized persons, and the latter shall not be permitted to inspect or have access to such information.\n\n\n \"c. The head of each agency shall establish a system for controlling the dissemination of classified security information adequate to the needs of his agency.\n\n\n \"30. Limitations on dissemination - a. Within the Executive Branch. The dissemination of classified security information shall be limited to persons whose official duties require knowledge of such information. Special measures shall be employed to limit the dissemination of `Top Secret' security information to the absolute minimum. Only that portion of `Top Secret' security information necessary to the proper planning and appropriate action of any organizational unit or individual shall be released to such unit or individual.\n\n\n \"b. Outside the Executive Branch. Classified security information shall not be disseminated outside the Executive Branch by any person or agency having access thereto or knowledge thereof except under conditions and through channels authorized by \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 502]\n\u00a0\n the head of the disseminating agency, even though such person or agency may have been solely or partly responsible for its production.\"\n\n\n The second, Exec. Order No. 10501, 18 Fed. Reg. 7049, which revoked Exec. Order No. 10290, is entitled \"Safeguarding Official Information In The Interests Of The Defense Of The United States\" and provides in relevant part:\n\n\"Sec. 7. Accountability and Dissemination.\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"(b) Dissemination Outside the Executive Branch. Classified defense information shall not be disseminated outside the executive branch except under conditions and through channels authorized by the head of the disseminating department or agency, even though the person or agency to which dissemination of such information is proposed to be made may have been solely or partly responsible for its production.\"\n\n\n Clearly, neither of these orders empowers any executive agency to fashion security programs whereby persons are deprived of their present civilian employment and of the opportunity of continued activity in their chosen professions without being accorded the chance to challenge effectively the evidence and testimony upon which an adverse security determination might rest.\n28\n\u00a0\n\nTurning to the legislative enactments which might be deemed as delegating authority to the Department of Defense to fashion programs under which persons may be \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 503]\n\u00a0\n seriously restrained in their employment opportunities through a denial of clearance without the safeguards of cross-examination and confrontation, we note the Government's own assertion, made in its brief, that \"[w]ith petitioner's contention that the Industrial Security Program is not explicitly authorized by statute we may readily agree . . . .\"\n\nThe first proffered statute is the National Security Act of 1947, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 171 et seq. That Act created the Department of Defense and gave to the Secretary of Defense and the Secretaries of the armed services the authority to administer their departments. Nowhere in the Act, or its amendments, is there found specific authority to create a clearance program similar to the one now in effect.\n\nAnother Act cited by respondents is the Armed Service Procurement Act of 1947, as amended. It provides in 10 U.S.C. 2304 that:\n\n \"(a) Purchases of and contracts for property or services covered by this chapter shall be made by formal advertising. However, the head of an agency may negotiate such a purchase or contract, if -\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"(12) the purchase or contract is for property or services whose procurement he determines should not be publicly disclosed because of their character, ingredients, or components.\"\n\n\n It further provides in 10 U.S.C. 2306:\n\n \"(a) The cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost system of contracting may not be used. Subject to this limitation and subject to subsections (b)-(e), the head of an agency may, in negotiating contracts under section 2304 of this title, make any kind of contract that he considers will promote the best interests of the United States.\" \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 504]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Respondents argue that these statutes, together with 18 U.S.C. 798, which makes it a crime willfully and knowingly to communicate to unauthorized persons information concerning cryptographic or intelligence activities, and 50 U.S.C. 783 (b), which makes it a crime for an officer or employee of the United States to communicate classified information to agents of foreign governments or officers and members of \"Communist organizations,\" reflect a recognition by Congress of the existence of military secrets and the necessity of keeping those secrets inviolate.\n\nAlthough these statutes make it apparent that Congress recognizes the existence of military secrets, they hardly constitute an authorization to create an elaborate clearance program which embodies procedures traditionally believed to be inadequate to protect affected persons.\n29\n\u00a0\n\nLastly, the Government urges that if we refuse to adopt its \"inferred\" authorization reasoning, nevertheless, congressional ratification is apparent by the continued appropriation of funds to finance aspects of the program fashioned by the Department of Defense. Respondents refer us to Hearings before the House Committee on Appropriations on Department of Defense Appropriations for 1956, 84th Cong., 1st Sess. 774-781. At those hearings, the Committee was asked to approve the appropriation of funds to finance a program under which reimbursement for lost wages would be made to employees of government contractors who were temporarily denied, but later granted, security clearance. Apparently, such reimbursements \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 505]\n\u00a0\n had been made prior to that time out of general appropriations. Although a specific appropriation was eventually made for this purpose, it could not conceivably constitute a ratification of the hearing procedures, for the procedures were in no way involved in the special reimbursement program.\n30\n\u00a0\n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 506]\n\u00a0\n\n\nRespondents' argument on delegation resolves itself into the following: The President, in general terms, has authorized the Department of Defense to create procedures to restrict the dissemination of classified information and has apparently acquiesced in the elaborate program established by the Secretary of Defense even where application of the program results in restraints on traditional freedoms without the use of long-required procedural protections. Similarly, Congress, although it has not enacted specific legislation relating to clearance procedures to be utilized for industrial workers, has acquiesced in the existing Department of Defense program and has ratified it by specifically appropriating funds to finance one aspect of it.\n\nIf acquiescence or implied ratification were enough to show delegation of authority to take actions within the area of questionable constitutionality, we might agree with respondents that delegation has been shown here. In many circumstances, where the Government's freedom to act is clear, and the Congress or the President has provided general standards of action and has acquiesced in administrative interpretation, delegation may be inferred. Thus, even in the absence of specific delegation, we have no difficulty in finding, as we do, that the Department of Defense has been authorized to fashion and apply an industrial clearance program which affords affected persons the safeguards of confrontation and cross-examination. But this case does not present that situation. We deal here with substantial restraints on employment opportunities of numerous persons imposed in a manner which is in conflict with our long-accepted \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 507]\n\u00a0\n notions of fair procedures.\n31\n Before we are asked to judge whether, in the context of security clearance cases, a person may be deprived of the right to follow his chosen profession without full hearings where accusers may be confronted, it must be made clear that the President or Congress, within their respective constitutional powers, specifically has decided that the imposed procedures are necessary and warranted and has authorized their use. Cf. Watkins v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 178\n; Scull v. Virginia, \n359 \nU.S. 344\n. Such decisions cannot be assumed by acquiescence or non-action. Kent v. Dulles, \n357 \nU.S. 116\n; Peters v. Hobby, \n349 \nU.S. 331\n; Ex parte Endo, \n323 \nU.S. 283, 301\n-302. They must be made explicitly not only to assure that individuals are not deprived of cherished rights under procedures not actually authorized, see Peters v. Hobby, supra, but also because explicit action, especially in areas of doubtful constitutionality, requires careful and purposeful consideration by those responsible for enacting and implementing our laws. Without explicit action by lawmakers, decisions of great constitutional import and effect would be relegated by default to administrators who, under our system of government, are not endowed with authority to decide them.\n\nWhere administrative action has raised serious constitutional problems, the Court has assumed that Congress or the President intended to afford those affected by the action the traditional safeguards of due process. See, e. g., The Japanese Immigrant Case, \n189 \nU.S. 86, 101\n; Dismuke v. United States, \n297 \nU.S. 167, 172\n; Ex parte Endo, \n323 \nU.S. 283, 299\n-300; American Power Co. v. Securities and Exchange Comm'n, \n329 \nU.S. 90, 107\n-108; \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 508]\n\u00a0\n Hannegon v. Esquire, \n327 \nU.S. 146, 156\n; Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath, \n339 \nU.S. 33, 49\n. Cf. Anniston Mfg. Co. v. Davis, \n301 \nU.S. 337\n; United States v. Rumely, \n345 \nU.S. 41\n. These cases reflect the Court's concern that traditional forms of fair procedure not be restricted by implication or without the most explicit action by the Nation's lawmakers, even in areas where it is possible that the Constitution presents no inhibition.\n\nIn the instant case, petitioner's work opportunities have been severely limited on the basis of a fact determination rendered after a hearing which failed to comport with our traditional ideas of fair procedure. The type of hearing was the product of administrative decision not explicitly authorized by either Congress or the President. Whether those procedures under the circumstances comport with the Constitution we do not decide. Nor do we decide whether the President has inherent authority to create such a program, whether congressional action is necessary, or what the limits on executive or legislative authority may be. We decide only that in the absence of explicit authorization from either the President or Congress the respondents were not empowered to deprive petitioner of his job in a proceeding in which he was not afforded the safeguards of confrontation and cross-examination.\n\nAccordingly, the judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the District Court for proceedings not inconsistent herewith.\n\n    It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER, MR. JUSTICE HARLAN and MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER concur in the judgment on the ground that it has not been shown that either Congress or the President authorized the procedures whereby petitioner's security clearance was revoked, intimating no views as to the validity of those procedures.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Petitioner was given a Confidential clearance by the Army on August 9, 1949, a Top Secret clearance by the Assistant Chief of Staff G-2, Military District of Washington on November 9, 1949, and a Top Secret clearance by the Air Materiel Command on February 3, 1950.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] ERCO did classified contract work for the various services. In 1951, in connection with a classified research project for the Navy, it entered into a security agreement in which it undertook \"to provide and maintain a system of security controls within its . . . own organization in accordance with the requirements of the Department of Defense Industrial Security Manual . . . .\" The Manual, in turn, provided in paragraphs 4 (e) and 6:\n\n\"The Contractor shall exclude (this does not imply the dismissal or separation of any employee) from any part of its plants, factories, or sites at which work for any military department is being performed, any person or persons whom the Secretary of the military \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 477]\n\u00a0\n department concerned or his duly authorized representative, in the interest of security, may designate in writing.\n\n.   .   .   .   .\n\n\n\n\"No individual shall be permitted to have access to classified matter unless cleared by the Government or the Contractor, as the case may be, as specified in the following subparagraphs and then he will be given access to such matter only to the extent of his clearance. . . .\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The PSB was created pursuant to an interim agreement dated October 9, 1947, between the Army, Navy, and Air Force and pursuant to a memorandum of agreement between the Provost Marshal General and the Air Provost Marshal, dated March 17, 1948. \"It was a three-man board, with one representative from each of the military departments . . . .

Its charter, dated 7 November 1949 and signed by the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, contemplated that it would afford hearings to persons denied clearance. And see \"Procedures Governing Appeals to the Industrial Employment Review Board, dated 7 November 1949.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The letter read, in part:\n\n\"That over a period of years, 1943-1947, at or near Washington, D.C., you have closely and sympathetically associated with persons who are reported to be or to have been members of the Communist Party; that during the period 1944-1947 you entertained and were visited at your home by military representatives of the Russian Embassy, Washington, D.C.; that, further, you attended social functions during the period 1944-1947 at the Russian Embassy, Washington, D.C.; and on 7 April 1947 attended the Southern Conference for Human Welfare, Third Annual Dinner, Statler Hotel, Washington, D.C.

He has been employed by this corporation since 1937. His progress in the company had been consistent. He was one of our most valued and valuable employees, and was responsible for much of the work which Engineering and Research Corporation was doing. In April, 1953, the company received a letter from the Secretary of the Navy advising us that clearance had been denied to Mr. Greene and advising us that it would be necessary to bar him from access to our plant. In view of his position with the company, there was no work which he could do in light of this denial of clearance by the Navy. As a result, it was necessary for the company to discharge him. There was no other reason for Mr. Greene's discharge, and in the absence of the letter referred to, he could have continued in the employment of Engineering and Research Corporation indefinitely.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] The President of ERCO wrote to the Secretary of the Navy as follows:\n\n\"The Honorable R. B. Anderson\n\n\n\"Secretary of the Navy\n\n\n\"Washington 25, D.C.\n\n\n\"My dear Mr. Secretary:\n\n\n\"Receipt is acknowledged of your letter of April 17, 1953 in which you state that you have reviewed the case history file on William Lewis Greene and have concluded that his continued access to Navy classified security information is inconsistent with the best interests of National Security.\n\n\n\"You request this company to exclude Mr. Greene from our plants, \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 483]\n\u00a0\n factories or sites and to bar him from information, in the interests of protecting Navy classified projects and classified security information.\n\n\n\"In accordance with your request, please be advised that since receipt of your letter this company has excluded Mr. Greene from any part of our plants, factories or sites and barred him access to all classified security information.\n\n\n\"For your further information, Mr. Greene tendered his resignation as an officer of this corporation and has left the plant. We shall have no further contact with him until his status is clarified although we have not yet formally accepted his resignation.\n\n\n\"Mr. Greene is Vice President of this company in charge of engineering. His knowledge, experience and executive ability have proven of inestimable value in the past. The loss of his services at this time is a serious blow to company operations. Accordingly, we should like the privilege of a personal conference to discuss the matter further.\n\n\n\"Furthermore, you state that you are referring the case to the Secretary of Defense recommending that the Industrial Employment Review Board's decision of January 29, 1952 be overruled. If it is appropriate, we should like very much to have the privilege of discussing the matter with the Secretary of Defense.\n\n\n\"Please accept our thanks for any official courtesies which you are in a position to extend.\n\n    \"Respectfully yours,     \"Engineering and Research Corporation     \"By \/s\/ L. A. Wells\"\n\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] On May 4, 1953, pursuant to the memorandum of the Secretary of Defense dated March 27, 1953, see note 6, supra, the Secretaries of the military departments established regional Industrial Personnel Security Boards governed by generalized standards, criteria, and procedures.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] The specifications were contained in a letter to petitioner's counsel dated April 9, 1954, which was sent nineteen days before the hearing. That letter provided in part:\n\n\"Security considerations permit disclosure of the following information that has thus far resulted in the denial of clearance to Mr. Greene:\n\n\n\"1. During 1942 SUBJECT was a member of the Washington Book Shop Association, an organization that has been officially cited by the Attorney General of the United States as Communist and subversive.\n\n\n\"2. SUBJECT's first wife, Jean Hinton Greene, to whom he was married from approximately December 1942 to approximately December 1947, was an ardent Communist during the greater part of the period of the marriage.\n\n\n\"3. During the period of SUBJECT's first marriage he and his wife had many Communist publications in their home, including the `Daily Worker'; `Soviet Russia Today'; `In Fact'; and Karl Marx's `Das Kapital.'\n\n\n\"4. Many apparently reliable witnesses have testified that during the period of SUBJECT's first marriage his personal political sympathies were in general accord with those of his wife, in that he was sympathetic towards Russia; followed the Communist Party `line'; presented `fellow-traveller' arguments; was apparently influenced by Jean's wild theories'; etc. [Nothing in the record establishes that any witness \"testified\" at any hearing on these subjects and everything in the record indicates that they could have done no more than make such statements to investigative officers.]\n\n\n\"5. In about 1946 SUBJECT invested approximately $1000. in the Metropolitan Broadcasting Corporation and later became a director of its Radio Station WQQW. It has been reliably reported that many of the stockholders of the Corporation were Communists or pro-Communists and that the news coverage and radio programs of Station WQQW frequently paralleled the Communist Party `line.' [This station is now Station WGMS, Washington's \"Good Music Station.\" Petitioner stated that he invested money in the station \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 485]\n\u00a0\n because he liked classical music and he considered it a good investment.]\n\n\n\"6. On 7 April 1947 SUBJECT and his wife Jean attended the Third Annual Dinner of the Southern Conference for Human Welfare, an organization that has been officially cited as a Communist front. [This dinner was also attended by many Washington notables, including several members of this Court.]\n\n\n\"7. Beginning about 1942 and continuing for several years thereafter SUBJECT maintained sympathetic associations with various officials of the Soviet Embassy, including Major Constantine I. Ovchinnikov, Col. Pavel F. Berezin, Major Pavel N. Asseev, Col. Ilia M. Saraev, and Col. Anatoly Y. Golkovsky. [High-level executives of ERCO, as above noted, testified that these associations were carried on to secure business for the corporation.]\n\n\n\"8. During 1946 and 1947 SUBJECT had frequent sympathetic association with Dr. Vaso Syrzentic of the Yugoslav Embassy. Dr. Syrzentic has been identified as an agent of the International Communist Party. [Petitioner testified that he met this individual once in connection with a business transaction.]\n\n\n\"9. During 1943 SUBJECT was in contact with Col. Alexander Hess of the Czechoslovak Embassy, who has been identified as an agent of the Red Army Intelligence. [This charge was apparently abandoned as no adverse finding was based on it.]\n\n\n\"10. During 1946 and 1947 SUBJECT maintained close and sympathetic association with Mr. and Mrs. Nathan Gregory Silvermaster and William Ludwig Ullman. Silvermaster and Ullman have been identified as members of a Soviet Espionage Apparatus active in Washington, D.C., during the 1940's. [Silvermaster was a top economist in the Department of Agriculture and the direct superior of petitioner's ex-wife who then worked in that department.]\n\n\n\"11. SUBJECT had a series of contacts with Laughlin Currie during the period 1945-48. Currie has also been identified as a member of the Silvermaster espionage group. [Petitioner met Currie in the executive offices of the President at a time when Currie was a Special Assistant to the President.]\n\n\n\"12. During the period between 1942 and 1947 SUBJECT maintained frequent and close associations with many Communist Party \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 486]\n\u00a0\n members, including R______ S______, and his wife E______, B______ W______ and his wife M______, M______ P______, M______ L. D______, R______ N______ and I______ S______. [These persons were apparently friends of petitioner's ex-wife.]\n\n\n\"13. During substantially the same period SUBJECT maintained close association with many persons who have been identified as strong supporters of the Communist conspiracy, including S______ J. R______, S______ L______, O______ L______, E______ F______ and V______ G______. [These persons were apparently friends of his ex-wife.]\n\n\n\"It is noted that all of the above information has previously been discussed with Mr. Greene at his hearing before the Industrial Employment Review Board, and that a copy of the transcript of that hearing was made available to you in August of last year.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] Petitioner stated by affidavit in support of his motion for summary judgment that \"[a]fter my discharge from Engineering and Research Corporation, I made every possible effort to secure other employment at a salary commensurate with my experience, but I was unable to do so because all of my work history had been in the field of aeronautics. In spite of everything I could do, the best position I could obtain was a draftsman-engineer in an architectural firm. I was obliged to go to work for a salary of $4,400 per year, because the basis upon which a higher salary would be justified was experience in a field which was not particularly useful in the type of work which I was able to obtain. As a result of the actions of the defendants complained of, the field of aeronautical engineering was closed to me.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] For instance, the following questions were asked in connection with the so-called \"left wing\" radio station in which petitioner owned stock, petitioner's acquaintanceship with alleged subversives, and petitioner's business relationships with foreign governments:\n\n\"Q. We have information here, Mr. Greene, that one particular individual specifically called your attention to the fact that [Congressman] Rankin and [Senator] Bilbo had characterized this station as a Communist station, run by and for Communists?\n\n.   .   .   .   .\n\n\n\n\"Q. We have information here, this has come from an informant characterized to be of known reliability in which he refers to conversations he had with you about January of 1947 in which you told him that you had visited M______ P______ the previous evening and had become rather chummy with him, do you wish to comment on that?\n\n.   .   .   .   .\n\n\n\n\"Q. Concerning your relationship with S______ L______, we have \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 488]\n\u00a0\n information here from an informant characterized as being one of known reliability, in which S______ L______ told this informant that shortly following her Western High School speech in 1947, she remarked to you that probably many people will learn things about Russia and she quoted you as replying, `Well I hope they learn something good, at least.' Do you wish to say anything about that?\n\n.   .   .   .   .\n\n\n\n\"Q. Information we have, Mr. Greene, indicates first of all, that you didn't meet these Russians in 1942 but you met them in early 1943.\n\n.   .   .   .   .\n\n\n\n\"Q. Now, we have further information, Mr. Greene, indicating that the initiative of these contacts came from Col. Berezin.\n\n.   .   .   .   .\n\n\n\n\"Q. We have information here indicating that as a matter of fact, sir, we do know that the meeting between you and Col. Berezin was arranged through Hess and Hochfeld as you indicated. We also have information from a source identified as being one of known reliability referring to a conversation that this source had with Hess in April 1943 in which Hess stated that he had been talking to one Harry, not further identified but presumed to be Hochfeld and that Harry said to Hess that he had a young engineer who is a good friend of ours and of our cause and Harry wanted Hess to set up a meeting between Berezin and yourself. Can you give us some reason why Harry might have referred to you as a good friend of our cause?\n\n.   .   .   .   .\n\n\n\n\"Q. Of course, we can make certain assumptions as to why Col. Berezin might have wanted to meet you back in December 1942 when we look at a statement like this indicating that you were considered a good friend of their's and of their cause. Of course, some weight is lent to this assumption by the fact that your wife was strongly pro-Communist and after she left you she became very active in Communist affairs, in case you don't know that, I'll pass it on to you.\"\n\n\n And the following questions were asked of various witnesses presented \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 489]\n\u00a0\n by petitioner evidently because the Board had confidential information that petitioner's ex-wife was \"eccentric.\"\n\n\"Q. Now you were in Bill's home, that red brick house that you're talking about.\n\n.   .   .   .   .\n\n\n\n\"Q. Was there anything unusual about the house itself, the interior of it, was it dirty?\n\n.   .   .   .   .\n\n\n\n\"Q. Were there any beds in their house which had no mattresses on them?\n\n.   .   .   .   .\n\n\n\n\"Q. Did you ever hear it said that Jean slept on a board in order to keep the common touch?\n\n.   .   .   .   .\n\n\n\n\"Q. When you were in Jean's home did she dress conventionally when she received her guests?\n\n.   .   .   .   .\n\n\n\n\"Q. Let me ask you this, conventionally when somebody would invite you for dinner at their home would you expect them, if they were a woman to wear a dress and shoes and stockings and the usual clothing of the evening or would you expect them to appear in overalls?\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] The notification stated:\n\n\"Security considerations prohibit the furnishing to an appellant of a detailed statement of the findings on appeal inasmuch as the entire file is considered and comments made by the Appeal Division panel on security matters which could not for security reasons form the basis of a statement of reasons.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] This Board was created by the Secretary of Defense on February 2, 1955, and given power to review adverse decisions rendered by the regional boards.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] This was the first time that petitioner was charged or found to be untrustworthy.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] The complaint was filed before the establishment of the Industrial Personnel Security Review Board. See note 18, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 21\n] The Court of Appeals stated: \"We have no doubt that Greene has in fact been injured. He was forced out of a job that paid him $18,000 per year. He has since been reduced, so far as this record shows, to working as an architectural draftsman at a salary of some $4,400 per year. Further, as an aeronautical engineer of considerable experience he says (without real contradiction) that he is effectively barred from pursuit of many aspects of his profession, given the current dependence of most phases of the aircraft industry on Defense Department contracts not only for production but for research and development work as well. . . . Nor do we doubt that, following the Government's action, some stigma, in greater or less degree, has attached to Greene.\" 103 U.S. App. D.C. 87, 95-96, 254 F.2d 944, 952-953.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 22\n] We note our agreement with respondents' concession that petitioner has standing to bring this suit and to assert whatever rights he may have. Respondents' actions, directed at petitioner as an individual, caused substantial injuries, Joint Anti-Fascist Committee v. McGrath, \n341 \nU.S. 123, 152\n (concurring opinion), and, were they the subject of a suit between private persons, they could be attacked as an invasion of a legally protected right to be free from arbitrary interference with private contractual relationships. Moreover, petitioner has the right to be free from unauthorized actions of government officials which substantially impair his property interests. Cf. Philadelphia Co. v. Stimson, \n223 \nU.S. 605\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 23\n] The Industrial Personnel Security Review Regulation, 20 Fed. Reg. 1553, recommended by the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and approved by the Secretary of Defense, provided:\n\n\" 67.1-4. Release of information.

No classified information, nor any information which might compromise \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 495]\n\u00a0\n investigative sources or methods or the identity of confidential informants, will be disclosed to any contractor or contractor employee, or to his lawyer or representatives, or to any other person not authorized to have access to such information. In addition, in a case involving a contractor employee the contractor concerned will be advised only of the final determination in the case to grant, deny, or revoke clearance, and of any decision to suspend a clearance granted previously pending final determination in the case. The contractor will not be given a copy of the Statement of Reasons issued to the contractor employee except at the written request of the contractor employee concerned.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 24\n] See \"Charter of the Industrial Employment Review Board, dated 7 November 1949,\" note 4, supra; \"Charter of the Army-Navy-Air Force Personnel Security Board, dated 19 June 1950,\" note 3, supra; Memorandum issued by the Secretary of Defense to the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force and to the Chairman of the Munitions Board, dated March 27, 1953, notes 6, 7, 8 and 9, supra; \"The Industrial Personnel and Facility Security Clearance Program,\" effective May 4, 1953, note 13, supra; \"The Industrial Personnel Security Review Regulation,\" 20 Fed.

And see O'Brian, National Security and Individual Freedom, 62.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 26\n] For instance, in the instant case, to establish the charge that petitioner's \"personal political sympathies were in general accord with those of his wife,\" the EIPSB apparently relied on statements made to investigators by \"old\" friends of petitioner. Thus, the following questions were asked petitioner:\n\n\"Q. I'd like to read to you a quotation from the testimony of a person who had identified himself as having been a very close friend of yours over a long period of years. He states that you, as saying to him one day that you were reading a great deal of pro-Communist books and other literature. Do you wish to comment on that?\n\n.   .   .   .   .\n\n\n\n\"Q. Incidentally this man's testimony concerning you was entirely favorable in one respect. He stated that he didn't think you were a Communist but he did state that he thought that you had been influenced by Jean's viewpoints and that he had received impressions definite that it was your wife who was parlor pink and that you were going along with her.\n\n.   .   .   .   .\n\n\n\n\"Q. This same friend testified that he believed that you were influenced by Jean's wild theories and he decided at that time to have no further association with you and your wife . . . .\n\n.   .   .   .   .\n\n\n\n\"Q. . . . Here's another man who indicates that he has been a friend of yours over a long period of time who states that he was a visitor in your home on occasions and that regarding some of these visits, he met some of your wife's friends, these people we've been talking about in the past and that one occasion, he mentioned in particular, the topic of conversation was China and that you set forth in the conversation and there seemed general agreement among all of you at that time that the revolutionists in China were not actually Communists but were agrarian reformists which as you probably know is part of the Communist propaganda line of several years back. . . .\n\n.   .   .   .   .\n\n\n\n\"Q. Mr. Greene we've got some information here indicating that during the period of your marriage to your first wife that she was \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 499]\n\u00a0\n constantly finding fault with the American institutions, opposing the American Capitalistic System and never had anything but praise for the Russians and everything they attempted to do. Did you find that to be the case?\n\n.   .   .   .   .\n\n\n\n\"Q. We have a statement here from another witness with respect to yourself in which he states that you felt that the modern people in this country were too rich and powerful, that the capitalistic system of this country was to the disadvantage of the working people and that the working people were exploited by the rich.\n\n.   .   .   .   .\n\n\n\n\"Q. I have a statement from another one of your associates to the effect that you would at times, present to him a fellow-traveler argument. This man indicated to us that he was pretty well versed on the Communist Party line himself at that time and found you parroting arguments which he assumed that you got from your wife. Do you wish to comment on that?\"\n\n\n Confrontation of the persons who allegedly made these statements would have been of prime importance to petitioner, for cross-examination might have shown that these \"witnesses\" were hazy in recollecting long-past incidents, or were irrationally motivated by bias or vindictiveness.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 27\n] This is made clear by the following testimony of Jerome D. Fenton, Director, Industrial Personnel Security, Department of Defense, before the Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights of the Senate Judiciary Committee, given on November 23, 1955:\n\n\"[Q.] . . . What other type of evidence is received by the hearing boards besides the evidence of persons under oath?\n\n\n\"[A.] The reports from the various governmental investigative agencies.\n\n\n\"[Q.] And the reports of the various governmental investigations might, themselves, be hearsay, might they not?\n\n\n\"[A.] I think that is a fair statement.\n\n\n\"[Q.] In fact, they might be, as the Court of Appeals for the Ninth District [sic] said with respect to the port security program, second, \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 500]\n\u00a0\n or third, or fourth-hand hearsay, might they not? [This question refers to the opinion of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Parker v. Lester, 227 F.2d. 708.]\n\n.   .   .   .   .\n\n\n\n\"[A.] The answer is `Yes.'\n\n.   .   .   .   .\n\n\n\n\"[Q.] Can you tell me what type of help is given to the hearing board in these reports with respect to the matter of evaluation? What is the nature of the evaluation that is used for this purpose?\n\n\n\"[A.] Well, each board has a person who is called a security adviser, who is an expert in that particular area. Each screening board has one, and those individuals are well-trained people who know how to evaluate reports and evaluate information. They know how to separate the wheat from the chaff, and they assist these boards.\n\n\n\"[Q.] This expert, then, has to take the report and make his own determination in assisting the board as to the reliability of a witness that he has never seen, or perhaps hasn't even had the opportunity to see the person who interviewed the witness?\n\n\n\"[A.] Well, he has nothing to do with the witness; no.\n\n\n\"[Q.] What is that?\n\n\n\"[A.] He has not interviewed the witness; no.\"\n\n\n Hearings before Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights, Senate Judiciary Committee, on S.

Rev. 546, and Hearings before a Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on S. Res. 231, 81st Cong., 2d. Sess. 327-339 (statement of J. Edgar Hoover, Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 28\n] No better, for this purpose, is Exec. Order No. 8972, 6 Fed. Reg. 6420, filed on December 12, 1941, which empowered the Secretary of War \"to establish and maintain military guards and patrols, and to take other appropriate measures, to protect from injury or destruction national-defense material, national-defense premises, and national-defense utilities . . . .\" Even if that order is relevant authority for programs created after World War II, which is doubtful, it provides no specific authorization for non-confrontation hearings.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 29\n] As far as appears, the most substantial official notice which Congress had of the non-confrontation procedures used in screening industrial workers was embodied in S. Doc. No. 40, 84th Cong., 1st Sess., a 354-page compilation of laws, executive orders, and regulations relating to internal security, printed at the request of a single Senator, which reproduced, among other documents and without specific comment, the Industrial Personnel Security Review Regulation.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 30\n] At the hearings to which we have been referred, the following passage from the testimony of the Department of Defense representative constitutes the only description made to the Committee concerning the procedures used in the Department's clearance program:\n\n\"In connection with the procurement programs of the Department of Defense, regulations have been prescribed to provide uniform standards and criteria for determining the eligibility of contractors, contractor employees, and certain other individuals, to have access to classified defense information. The regulations also establish administrative procedures governing the disposition of cases in which a military department, or activity thereof, has made a recommendation or determination (a) with respect to the denial, suspension, or revocation of a clearance of a contractor or contractor employee; and (b) with respect to the denial or withdrawal of authorization for access by certain other individuals.\n\n\n\"While the Department of Defense assumes, unless information to the contrary is received, that all contractors and contractor employees are loyal to the Government of the United States, the responsibilities of the Military Establishment necessitate vigorous application of policies designed to minimize the security risk incident to the use of classified information by such contractors and contractor employees. Accordingly, measures are taken to provide continuing assurance that no contractor or contractor employee will be granted a clearance if available information indicates that the granting of such clearance may not be clearly consistent with the interests of national security. At the same time, every possible safeguard within the limitations of national security will be provided to ensure that no contractor or contractor employee will be denied a clearance without an opportunity for a fair hearing.\" Id., at 774.\n\n\n This description hardly constitutes even notice to the Committee of the nature of the hearings afforded. Thus the appropriation could not \"plainly show a purpose to bestow the precise authority which is claimed.\" Ex parte Endo, \n323 \nU.S. 283, 303\n, n. 24. Likewise, \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 506]\n\u00a0\n appropriations of specific amounts for the Munitions Board or its successors, agencies with multifold objectives, without any mention of the uses to which the funds could be put, cannot be considered as a ratification of the use of the specified hearing procedures.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 31\n] It is estimated that approximately three million persons having access to classified information are covered by the industrial security program. Brown, Loyalty and Security (1958), 179-180; Association of the Bar of the City of New York, Report of the Special Committee on the Federal Loyalty-Security Program (1956), 64. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 509]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring specially.\n\nWhat has been written on both sides of this case makes appropriate a further word from one who concurs in the judgment of the Court, but cannot join its opinion.\n\nUnlike my brother CLARK who finds this case \"both clear and simple,\" I consider the constitutional issue it presents most difficult and far-reaching. In my view the Court quite properly declines to decide it in the present posture of the case. My unwillingness to subscribe to the Court's opinion is due to the fact that it unnecessarily deals with the very issue it disclaims deciding. For present purposes no more need be said than that we should not be drawn into deciding the constitutionality of the security-clearance revocation procedures employed in this case until the use of such procedures in matters of this kind has been deliberately considered and expressly authorized by the Congress or the President who alone are in a position to evaluate in the first instance the totality of factors bearing upon the necessity for their use. That much the courts are entitled to before they are asked to express a constitutional judgment upon an issue fraught with such important consequences both to the Government and the citizen.\n\nAmple justification for abstaining from a constitutional decision at this stage of the case is afforded by the Court's traditional and wise rule of not reaching constitutional issues unnecessarily or prematurely. That rule indeed has been consistently followed by this Court when faced with \"confrontation\" issues in other security or loyalty cases. See Peters v. Hobby, \n349 \nU.S. 331\n; Vitarelli v. Seaton, \n359 \nU.S. 535\n; cf. Service v. Dulles, \n354 \nU.S. 363\n; Kent v. Dulles, \n357 \nU.S. 116\n. Adherence to that rule is, as I understand it, the underlying basis of today's decision, and it is on that basis that I join the judgment of the Court. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 510]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt is regrettable that my brother CLARK should have so far yielded to the temptations of colorful characterization as to depict the issue in this case as being whether a citizen has \"a constitutional right to have access to the Government's military secrets,\" and to suggest that the Court's action today requires \"the President's Cabinet members to revoke their refusal to give\" the petitioner \"access to military secrets,\" despite any views they may have as to his reliability. Of course this decision involves no such issue or consequences. The basic constitutional issue is not whether petitioner is entitled to access to classified material, but rather whether the particular procedures here employed to deny clearance on security grounds were constitutionally permissible. With good reason we do not reach that issue as matters now stand. And certainly there is nothing in the Court's opinion which suggests that petitioner must be given access to classified material.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK, dissenting.\n\nTo me this case is both clear and simple. The respondents, all members of the President's Cabinet, have, after a series of hearings, refused to give Greene further access to certain government military information which has been classified \"secret.\" The pertinent Executive Order defines \"secret\" information as\n\n\"defense information or material the unauthorized disclosure of which could result in serious damage to the Nation, such as by jeopardizing the international relations of the United States, endangering the effectiveness of a program or policy of vital importance to the national defense, or compromising important military or defense plans, scientific or technological developments important to national defense, or information revealing important intelligence \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 511]\n\u00a0\n operations.\" Exec.

Reg. 7049, 3 CFR (1949-1953 Comp.), p. 979, 1 (b).\n\n\n Surely one does not have a constitutional right to have access to the Government's military secrets.\n1\n But the Court says that because of the refusal to grant Greene further access, he has lost his position as vice president and general manager, a chief executive officer, of ERCO, whose business was devoted wholly to defense contracts with the United States,\n2\n and that his training in aeronautical engineering, together with the facts that ERCO engages solely in government work and that the Government is the country's largest airplane customer, has in some unaccountable fashion parlayed his employment with ERCO into \"a constitutional right.\" What for anyone else would be considered a privilege at best has for Greene been enshrouded in constitutional protection. This sleight of hand is too much for me.\n\nBut this is not all. After holding that Greene has constitutional protection for his private job, the Court has ordered the President's Cabinet members to revoke their refusal to give Greene access to military secrets.\n3\n It \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 512]\n\u00a0\n strikes down the present regulations as being insufficiently authorized by either the President or the Congress because the procedures fail to provide for confrontation or cross-examination at Board hearings. Let us first consider that problem.\n\n  I. THE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE.\n\n\n After full consideration the Court concludes \"that in the absence of explicit authorization from either the President or Congress the respondents were not empowered to deprive petitioner of his job in a proceeding in which he was not afforded the safeguards of confrontation and cross-examination.\" In so doing, as I shall point out, it holds for naught the Executive Orders of both President Roosevelt and President Truman and the directives pursuant thereto of every Cabinet officer connected with our defense since 1942 plus the explicit order of General Dwight D. Eisenhower as Chief of Staff in 1946. In addition, contrary to the Court's conclusion, the Congress was not only fully informed but had itself published the very procedures used in Greene's case.\n\nI believe that the Court is in error in holding, as it must, in order to reach this \"authorization\" issue, that Greene's \"right to hold specific private employment and to follow a chosen profession free from unreasonable governmental interference\" is protected by the Fifth Amendment. It cites four cases in support of this proposition and says compare four others. As I read those cases not \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 513]\n\u00a0\n one is in point.\n4\n In fact, I cannot find a single case in support of the Court's position. Even a suit for damages on the ground of interference with private contracts does not lie against the Government. The Congress specifically exempted such suits from the Tort Claims Act. 28 U.S.C. 2680 (h). But the action today may have the effect of by-passing that exemption since Greene will now claim, as has Vitarelli, see Vitarelli v. Seaton, \n359 \nU.S. 535\n (1959), reimbursement for his loss of wages. See Taylor v. McElroy, post, p. 709. This will date back to 1953. His salary at that time was $18,000 a year.\n\nIn holding that the Fifth Amendment protects Greene the Court ignores the basic consideration in the case, namely, that no person, save the President, has a constitutional right to access to governmental secrets. Even though such access is necessary for one to keep a job \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 514]\n\u00a0\n in private industry, he is still not entitled to the secrets. It matters not if as a consequence he is unable to secure a specific job or loses one he presently enjoys. The simple reason for this conclusion is that he has no constitutional right to the secrets. If access to its secrets is granted by the Government it is entirely permissive and may be revoked at any time. That is all that the Cabinet officers did here. It is done every day in governmental operation. The Court seems to hold that the access granted Greene was for his benefit. It was not. Access was granted to secure for the Government the supplies or services it needed. The contract with ERCO specifically provided for the action taken by the Cabinet officers. Greene as General Manager of ERCO knew of its provisions. If every person working on government contracts has the rights Greene is given here the Government is indeed in a box. But as was said in Perkins v. Lukens steel Co., \n310 \nU.S. 113, 127\n-128 (1940):\n\n \"Like private individuals and businesses, the Government enjoys the unrestricted power to produce its own supplies, to determine those with whom it will deal, and to fix the terms and conditions upon which it will make needed purchases. . . . Judicial restraint of those who administer the Government's purchasing would constitute a break with settled judicial practice and a departure into fields hitherto wisely and happily apportioned by the genius of our polity to the administration of another branch of Government.\"\n\n\n The Court refuses to pass on the constitutionality of the procedures used in the hearings. It does say that the hearings provided for in the program permit the restraint of \"employment opportunities through a denial of clearance without the safeguards of confrontation and cross-examination.\" I think the Court confuses administrative \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 515]\n\u00a0\n action with judicial trials. This Court has long ago and repeatedly approved administrative action where the rights of cross-examination and confrontation were not permitted. Chicago & Southern Air Lines v. Waterman Corp., \n333 \nU.S. 103\n (1948); Carlson v. Landon, \n342 \nU.S. 524\n (1952); United States v. Nugent, \n346 \nU.S. 1\n (1953); United States v. Reynolds, \n345 \nU.S. 1\n (1953); Knauff v. Shaughnessy, \n338 \nU.S. 537\n (1950); Shaughnessy v. Mezei, \n345 \nU.S. 206\n (1953); and Jay v. Boyd, \n351 \nU.S. 345\n (1956).\n\nAt no time since the programs now in vogue were established in 1942 have the rights of cross-examination and confrontation of witnesses been required. In fact the present regulations were patterned after the Employee Loyalty Program, first inaugurated upon the passage of the Hatch Act in 1939, in which the rights of confrontation and cross-examination have never been recognized. Every Attorney General since that time has approved these procedures, as has every President. And it should be noted, though several cases here have attacked the regulations on this ground, this Court has yet to strike them down.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nI shall not labor the point further than to say that in my opinion the procedures here do comport with that fairness required of administrative action in the security field. A score of our cases, as I have cited, support me in this position. Not one is to the contrary. And the action of the Court in striking down the program for lack of specific authorization is indeed strange, and hard for me to understand at this critical time of national emergency. The defense establishment should know - and now - whether its program is constitutional and, if not, wherein \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 516]\n\u00a0\n it is deficient. I am sure that it will remember that in other times of emergency - no more grave than the present - it was permitted, without any hearing whatsoever - much less with confrontation and cross-examination - to remove American citizens from their homes on the West Coast and place them in concentration camps. See Hirabayashi v. United States, \n320 \nU.S. 81\n (1943); Korematsu v. United States, \n323 \nU.S. 214\n (1944). My examination of the Japanese exclusion orders indicates clearly that the Executive Order was a general authorization just as the two here. Congress at the time only created criminal offenses for violation of exclusion or curfew orders of the military commander. Likewise we have criminal statutes here. And while the Japanese orders were in time of war, those involved here had their inception in war and have been continued during the national emergency declared by the President. No one informed in present world affairs would say that our safety is less in jeopardy today. In fact we are now spending nearly as much money to protect it as during the war period. In this light it is inescapable that the existing authorizations are entirely sufficient. Let us examine them.\n\n II. THE PRESIDENT AND THE CONGRESS HAVE GRANTED  SUFFICIENT AUTHORITY TO THE CABINET OFFICERS.\n\n\n Since 1941 the industrial security program has been in operation under express directives from the President. Within a week after the attack on Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt issued Exec. Order No. 8972, 6 Fed. Reg. 6420, Dec. 12, 1941, which authorized both the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy \"to establish and maintain military guards and patrols, and to take other appropriate measures, to protect from injury and destruction national-defense material, national-defense premises, and national-defense utilities, . . .\" (Emphasis added.) \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 517]\n\u00a0\n In 1942, under the authority of that Executive Order, the Secretary of War undertook the formulation and execution of a program of industrial security.\n6\n The procedures in operation from 1942 and 1943 are outlined in a 1946 publication of the Department of War entitled \"Suspension of Subversives from Privately Operated Facilities of Importance to the Security of the Nation's Army and Navy Programs.\"\n7\n Interestingly enough, the instructions were issued in time of peace, did not give the suspect a hearing, and were signed by the then Chief of Staff - now President - Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n\nIn 1947, the National Security Act, 61 Stat. 495, effected a reorganization of the military departments and placed the Secretary of Defense at the head of the National Military Establishment. Section 305 (a) of the Act transferred to the new organization \"[a]ll laws, orders, regulations, and other actions applicable with respect to any function . . . transferred under this Act . . . .\" Section 213 created a Munitions Board \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 518]\n\u00a0\n within the military establishment and under the supervision of the Secretary of Defense. Among its functions were\n\n\"(1) to coordinate the appropriate activities within the National Military Establishment with regard to industrial matters, including procurement . . . plans . . .; (2) to plan for the military aspects of industrial mobilization; . . . and (10) to perform such other duties as the Secretary of Defense may direct.\"\n8\n\u00a0\n\n\n In his first report to the President in 1948, Secretary of Defense Forrestal reported that:\n\n\". . . the Munitions Board is responsible for necessary action to coordinate internal security within the National Military Establishment with regard to industrial matters. This work is being planned and in some phases carried forward by the following programs:\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"c. Development of plans and directives to protect classified armed forces information in the hands of industry from potential enemies;\n\n\n \"d. Establishment of uniform methods of handling of personnel clearances and secrecy agreements . . . .\" First Report of the Secretary of Defense (1948) 102-103.\n\n\n The forerunner of the exact program now in effect was put in operation in 1948 under the supervision of that Board. And, in the Annual Report to the President, in 1949, the Secretary, then Louis Johnson, reported that\n\n \"Industrial Security. - A program to coordinate and develop uniform practices to protect classified military \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 519]\n\u00a0\n information placed in the hands of industry under procurement and research contracts was continued by the Munitions Board. Criteria were developed for the granting or denial of personnel and facility clearances in the performance of classified contracts. Work was started to establish a central security clearance register to centralize clearance data for ready reference by all departments and to prevent duplication in making clearance investigations. A joint Personnel Security Board administers this program, and the Industrial Employment Review Board hears appeals from security clearance denials.\" Second Report of the Secretary of Defense, for the Fiscal Year 1949 (1950), 85.\n\n\n Transmitted with that report to the President was the Annual Report of the Secretary of the Army, where the number of security cases processed by the Army-Navy-Air Force Personnel Board, and the number of appeals handled by the Industrial Employment Review Board were detailed.\n9\n\u00a0\n\nAgain in 1950 the Secretary of Defense informed the President, in a report required by law, of the status of the industrial security program.\n\n \"In the past 6 months, the Munitions Board activated the Industrial Employment Review Board, established procedures under which the latter will operate, and developed a set of uniform criteria stipulating the circumstances under which security clearances will be denied. The Munitions Board also established a Central Index Security Clearance File to serve as a clearing house for all individual and facility clearances and denials, [and] developed a standard security requirements check list . . . . \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 520]\n\u00a0\n Uniform standards for security investigations of facility and contractors' personnel are being developed . . . . A standard military security agreement is being coordinated to bind potential suppliers to security regulations before a classified contract is awarded, and a manual to give security guidance to industry is being prepared.\" Semiannual Report of the Secretary of Defense, July 1 to Dec. 31, 1949 (1950), 97.\n\n\n The President, in 1953, in Reorganization Plan No. 6, 67 Stat. 638, transferred all of the \"functions of the Munitions Board\" to the Secretary of Defense and dissolved that Board. Since then the program has been in operation under the authority of the Secretary. Also in 1953, the President issued Exec. Order No. 10450, Apr. 27, 1953, 18 Fed. Reg. 2489, 3 CFR (1949-1953 Comp.), p. 936. That order dealt with the criteria and procedures to be used in the Federal Loyalty Security Program, which had been instituted under Exec. Order No. 9835, 12 Fed. Reg. 1935, 3 CFR (1943-1948 Comp.), p. 630, Mar. 21, 1947. The latter order made clear that federal employees suspected of disloyalty had no right of confrontation.\n10\n And the regulations promulgated under the order provided no such right. See 13 Fed. Reg. 9365, 5 CFR (1949), 210, Dec. 31, 1948. These procedures were revised under Exec. Order No. 10450, supra, although again, confrontation and cross-examination were not provided. See \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 521]\n\u00a0\n 19 Fed. Reg. 1503, 32 CFR, p. 288, Mar. 19, 1954. Thus, it was clear that the President had not contemplated that there would be a right of confrontation in the Federal Loyalty Security Program. And the report of the Secretary of the Army - transmitted to the President by the Secretary of Defense - made clear that the criteria of Exec. Order No. 10450 were being utilized not only where the loyalty of a government employee was in doubt, but also in carrying out the industrial security program. Semiannual Report of the Secretary of the Army, Jan. 1, 1954, to June 30, 1954, 135-136.\n\nThus we see that the program has for 18 years been carried on under the express authority of the President, and has been regularly reported to him by his highest Cabinet officers. How the Court can say, despite these facts, that the President has not sufficiently authorized the program is beyond me, unless the Court means that it is necessary for the President to write out the Industrial Security Manual in his own hand.\n\nFurthermore, I think Congress has sufficiently authorized the program, as it has been kept fully aware of its development and has appropriated money to support it. During the formative period of the program, 1949-1951, the Congress, through appropriation hearings, was kept fully informed as to the activity. In 1949 D. F. Carpenter, Chairman of the Munitions Board, appeared before a Subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations to testify concerning the requested appropriation for the Board. While the report indicates much of the testimony was \"off the record,\" it does contain specific references to the program here under attack.\n11\n Significantly the appropriation bill for 1950 included an item \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 522]\n\u00a0\n of $11,300,000 for the maintenance, inter alia, of the Board.\n\nAgain, in 1950 General Timberlake, a member of the Board, testified:\n\n \"Then we are going to intensify the industrial mobilization planning within the Department of Defense, with particular emphasis on industrial security . . . .\" House of Representatives, Hearings before a Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations on the Supplemental Appropriation for 1951, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 264.\n\n\n While, again, some of the testimony was \"off the record\" it was sufficiently urgent and detailed for the Congress to appropriate additional funds for the Board for 1951.\n12\n\u00a0\n\nBy the 1953 Reorganization Plan, the functions of the Munitions Board were transferred to various Assistant Secretaries of Defense. The industrial security program was put under the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower, Personnel, and Reserve Forces. Of course, this office received an appropriation each year. These hearings, to cite but two, certainly indicate an awareness \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 523]\n\u00a0\n on the part of Congress of the existence of the industrial security program, and the continued appropriations hardly bespeak an unwillingness on the part of Congress that it be carried on. In 1955, the Eighty-fourth Congress, on the motion of Senator Wiley for unanimous consent, caused to be printed the so-called Internal Security Manual, S. Doc. No. 40, 84th Cong., 1st Sess. It is a compilation of all laws, regulations, and congressional committees relating to the national security. Contained in the volume is the \"Industrial Personnel security Review Regulation.\" i. e., a verbatim copy of the regulations set up by the Secretary of Defense on February 2, 1955. This Manual outlined in detail the hearing procedures which are here condemned by the Court. And it is important to note that the final denial of Greene's clearance was by a Board acting under these very regulations. Still not one voice was raised either within or without the Halls of Congress that the Defense Department had exceeded its authority or that contractor employees were being denied their constitutional rights. In other cases we have held that the inaction of the Congress, in circumstances much less specific than here, was a clear ratification of a program as it was then being carried out by the Executive. Why, I ask, do we not do that here where it is so vital? We should not be \"that blind Court . . . that does not see what `[a]ll others can see and understand . . . .'\" United States v. Rumely, \n345 \nU.S. 41, 44\n (1953).\n\nWhile it certainly is not clear to me, I suppose that the present fastidiousness of the Court can be satisfied by the President's incorporating the present industrial security program into a specific Executive Order or the Congress' placing it on the statute books. To me this seems entirely superfluous in light of the clear authorization presently existing in the Cabinet officers. It also subjects the Government to multitudinous actions - and perhaps large \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 524]\n\u00a0\n damages - by reason of discharges made pursuant to the present procedures.\n\nAnd I might add a nota bene. Even if the Cabinet officers are given this specific direction, the opinion today, by dealing so copiously with the constitutional issues, puts a cloud over both the Employee Loyalty Program and the one here under attack. Neither requires that hearings afford confrontation or cross-examination. While the Court disclaims deciding this constitutional question, no one reading the opinion will doubt that the explicit language of its broad sweep speaks in prophecy. Let us hope that the winds may change. If they do not the present temporary debacle will turn into a rout of our internal security.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] My brother HARLAN very kindly credits me with \"colorful characterization\" in stating this as the issue. While I take great pride in authorship, I must say that in this instance I merely agreed with the statement of the issue by the Solicitor General and his co-counsel in five different places in the Brief for the United States. See pp. 2, 17, 19, 29, 59.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] ERCO agreed in its government contract, as was well known to Greene, to exclude any individual from any part of its plant at which work under the contract was being performed who had not been cleared by the Navy for access to military secrets.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Brother HARLAN states that I suggest \"that the Court's action today requires `the President's Cabinet members to revoke their refusal to give' the petitioner `access to military secrets,' despite any views they may have as to his reliability . . . .\" Government officials, well versed in the application of this Court's judgments to the practicalities \n\n[360 \nU.S. 474, 512]\n\u00a0\n of government operation, say that the relief which Greene seeks here - and which the Court now grants - is \"in substance, a mandatory injunction requiring that the Government show him (or, in practice, allow contractors to show him) defense secrets, notwithstanding the judgment of the executive branch that such disclosure might jeopardize the national safety.\" Brief for the United States, 48.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Dent v. West Virginia, \n129 \nU.S. 114\n (1889), held that a West Virginia statute did not deprive one previously practicing medicine of his rights without due process by requiring him to obtain a license under the Act. Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, \n353 \nU.S. 232\n (1957), likewise a license case, did not pass upon the \"right\" or \"privilege\" to practice law, merely holding that on the facts the refusal to permit Schware to take the examination was \"invidiously discriminatory.\" In Peters v. Hobby, \n349 \nU.S. 331\n (1955), the Court simply held the action taken violated the Executive Order involved. The concurring opinion, DOUGLAS, J., p. 350, went further but alone on the question of \"right.\" The Court did not discuss that question, much less pass upon it. Slochower v. Board of Education, \n350 \nU.S. 551\n (1956), held that the summary dismissal without further evidence by New York of a school teacher because he had pleaded the Fifth Amendment before a United States Senate Committee violated due process. The case merely touched on the \"right\" to plead the Fifth Amendment, not to \"property\" rights. Truax v. Raich, \n239 \nU.S. 33\n (1915); Allgeyer v. Louisiana, \n165 \nU.S. 578\n (1897); and Powell v. Pennsylvania \n127 \nU.S. 678\n (1888), were equal protection cases wherein discrimination was claimed. Greene alleges no discrimination.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] See Bailey v. Richardson, 86 U.S. App. D.C. 248, 182 F.2d 46, affirmed by an equally divided Court, \n341 \nU.S. 918\n (1951); Peters v. Hobby, \n349 \nU.S. 331\n (1955).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Report of the Commission on Government Security (1957), S. Doc.

The basic criterion was \"good cause to suspect an employee of subversive activity . . .,\" the latter being defined as \"sabotage, espionage, or any other wilful activity intended to disrupt the national defense program.\" The basic procedure for removal was set out in \u00a7 10:\n\n\"10. When adequate investigation has revealed that there is good cause to suspect an employee of subversive activity on a national defense project of importance to Army or Navy procurement, the vital success of the project, as well as the security of the loyal employees, may require that the Army or Navy, without revealing the nature or source of its evidence, request the immediate removal of such individual from the project. To this end the cooperation of the organizations representative of organized labor is solicited for the following program: . . .\"\n\n\n Clearly this procedure did not anticipate confrontation or cross-examination.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] The National Security Act Amendments of 1949, 63 Stat. 578, amended 213 so as to delete subparagraph 10.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Annual Report of the Secretary of the Army for the Fiscal Year 1949 (1950), 192.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Part IV, 2 of Exec.

Under consideration at the time was a proposal for a fund to reimburse contractor employees who had been suspended during a security check and subsequently cleared. General Moore testified that, in the past, such reimbursement had been made by the service secretaries out of their contingency funds. Then followed this colloquy:\n\n\"Mr. Mahon.

Held: The Court of Appeals should have passed upon the validity of the consecutive sentences. Pp. 327-330.\n\n (a) The 15 sentences here involved may not be treated as one \"gross sentence\" to imprisonment for a period of 5 to 15 years, because the recorded judgment explicitly imposed a separate sentence of from 20 months to the then permissible maximum of 5 years on each of the 15 counts. Pp. 328-329.\n\n\n (b) Because of the way the judgment is worded, imprisonment for an aggregate period of 5 to 15 years can be sustained in this case only if each of the consecutive sentences on Counts 2, 4 and 7 is valid.

Petitioner sought certiorari on the grounds that the sentences invalidly multiply punishments for single offenses, and that the Court of Appeals erred in failing to determine the validity of the several sentences and in holding that imprisonment for an aggregate period of 5 to 15 years is authorized by its finding that \"at least 5 of the sentences that were to run `concurrently with' the 3 consecutive sentences [are valid].\" We granted the writ to determine those questions. \n357 \nU.S. 934\n.\n\nThe Government contends here that the several sentences are in reality but one \"gross sentence\" to imprisonment for a period of 5 to 15 years, and that the holding of the Court of Appeals that at least 5 of the \"concurrent\" sentences are valid supports the judgment,\n2\n but it concedes that \"If the sentence [may] not be considered as a gross sentence, at least as to the 12 counts which were to be concurrent with 2, 4, and 7, . . . the case would have to be remanded to the Court of Appeals to pass on the validity of counts 2, 4, and 7 [and if] it found any one of them invalid, that court would then have to remand to the District Court for resentencing, since, assuming that \n\n[358 \nU.S. 326, 329]\n\u00a0\n the other counts cannot be considered in gross, it is not clear which of them, taken individually, were to be concurrent with 2, which with 4, and which with 7.\"\n\nThe question whether, in these circumstances, the law permits the imposition of a single \"gross sentence\" upon several counts exceeding the maximum sentence that may lawfully be imposed upon any one of such counts is not presented here, for we think the Government's contention that these 15 sentences were, or may be treated as, one \"gross sentence\" to imprisonment for a period of 5 to 15 years is unsupportable and is contradicted by the plain words of the recorded judgment. \"The only sentence known to the law is the sentence or judgment entered upon the records of the court.\" Hill v. United States, \n298 \nU.S. 460, 464\n. The judgment entered on the records of the court in this case explicitly imposed a separate sentence of from 20 months to the then permissible maximum of 5 years\n3\n on each of the 15 counts. It is therefore plain that the court did not impose one \"gross sentence\" to imprisonment for a period of 5 to 15 years.\n\nThe judgment makes the separate sentences on Counts Two, Four, and Seven to run consecutively. Thus, if each is valid, they in sequence authorize imprisonment for an aggregate period of 5 to 15 years. But the judgment makes the separate sentences on the other 12 counts to run concurrently with each other (hence for a total period of 20 months to 5 years) and \"with the sentences imposed on Counts Two, Four and Seven,\" without saying whether \n\n[358 \nU.S. 326, 330]\n\u00a0\n those \"concurrent\" sentences are to run with the sentence on Count Two, with the consecutive sentence on Count Four, or with the consecutive sentence on Count Seven. It is therefore evident that the Court of Appeals was in error in concluding that the 5 \"concurrent\" sentences which it thought were valid alone support an aggregate period of imprisonment of 5 to 15 years.\n\nThe rule that reversal is not required if any one of several concurrent sentences is valid and alone supports the sentence and judgment, Hirabayashi v. United States, \n320 \nU.S. 81, 85\n, and cases cited; Pinkerton v. United States, \n328 \nU.S. 640, 642\n, n. 1; United States v. Sheridan, \n329 \nU.S. 379, 381\n; Roviaro v. United States, \n353 \nU.S. 53, 59\n, n. 6; Lawn v. United States, \n355 \nU.S. 339, 359\n, does not aid the Government, for no one of the \"concurrent\" sentences, or even all of them together, could, even if geared to a particular (though invalid) consecutive sentence, support imprisonment for more than 20 months to 5 years. If any one of the consecutive sentences on Counts Two, Four or Seven be invalid it cannot be said that such of the \"concurrent\" sentences as are valid will run with such invalid consecutive sentence, and thus support that much of the aggregate term of imprisonment, because the trial judge did not make the concurrent sentences to run with any particular one of the consecutive sentences. It is therefore clear, under the present sentences, that imprisonment for an aggregate period of 5 to 15 years can be sustained only if each of the consecutive sentences on Counts Two, Four, and Seven is valid. Hence it is necessary for the Court of Appeals to pass upon the validity of the consecutive sentences. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated and the cause is remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Narcotic Drugs Import and Export Act, 2 (c), 65 Stat. 767, 21 U.S.C. 174; the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 4704 (a), 4705 (a), and 7237 (a), 68A.

ROSS ISLAND SAND & GRAVEL CO.(1959)\nNo. 52\nArgued: December 11, 1958Decided: January 12, 1959\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner was injured while working on a barge used in connection with the dredging of sand and gravel in a lagoon opening into a navigable river. His employer had rejected the State Workmen's Compensation Act, which provides that, in such cases, an injured employee may maintain in the courts a negligence action for damages. Petitioner brought such an action in a state court. Held: Though his employer had accepted its coverage, nothing in the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act prevents petitioner from recovering in the state court. Pp. 272-273.\n\n 214 Ore. 1, 320 P.2d 668, reversed and cause remanded.\n\nDwight L. Schwab argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief was Herbert C. Hardy.\n\nRay H. Lafky, Assistant Attorney General, argued the cause for the State of Oregon, as amicus curiae, urging reversal. With him on the brief was Robert Y. Thornton, Attorney General.\n\nArno H. Denecke argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was Robert T. Mautz.\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\nBy its terms, the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act does not apply \"if recovery for the disability or death through workmen's compensation proceedings may . . . validly be provided by State law.\" 3, 44 Stat. 1426, 33 U.S.C. 903 (a) (emphasis supplied). In Davis v. Department of Labor, \n317 \nU.S. 249\n, we recognized that in some cases it was impossible to predict in advance of trial whether a worker's injury occurred in an operation which, although maritime in nature, was so \"local\" as to allow state compensation laws validly to apply under the limitations of Southern Pacific Co. v. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 272, 273]\n\u00a0\n Jensen, \n244 \nU.S. 205\n. As to cases within this \"twilight zone,\" Davis, in effect, gave an injured waterfront employee an election to recover compensation under either the Longshoremen's Act or the Workmen's Compensation Law of the State in which the injury occurred. It seems plain enough that petitioner's injury occurred in the \"twilight zone,\" and that recovery for it \"through workmen's compensation proceedings,\" could have been, and in fact was, validly \"provided by State law\" - the Oregon Workmen's Compensation Act. Ore. Rev. Stat. 656.002-656.990. Therefore, the Longshoremen's Act did not bar petitioner's claim under state law. But since his employer had elected to reject them the automatic compensation provisions of the Oregon Workmen's Compensation Act did not apply to the claim. Section 656.024 of that law provides, however, that when an employer has elected to reject the Act's automatic compensation provisions his injured employee may maintain in the courts a negligence action for damages. Of course, the employee could not do this if the case were not within the \"twilight zone,\" for then the Longshoremen's Act would provide the exclusive remedy. Since this case is within the \"twilight zone,\" it follows from what we held in Davis that nothing in the Longshoremen's Act or the United States Constitution prevents recovery.\n\nThe judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the Supreme Court of Oregon for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART, whom MR. JUSTICE HARLAN joins, dissenting.\n\nThis case poses a difficult and important issue of first impression. The Court decides it, I think, incorrectly. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 272, 274]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe petitioner was injured while working on a barge in navigable waters within the State of Oregon. The respondent employer had secured payment of compensation under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. 901 et seq., but had elected not to be covered by the Oregon Workmen's Compensation Law, Ore. Rev. Stat. 656.002 et seq. Compensation benefits under the federal statute were clearly available at all times to the petitioner. Instead of accepting these benefits, however, he brought an action for personal injuries in an Oregon state court, the Oregon statute permitting such an action against an employer not participating in the state workmen's compensation plan.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nThe trial court entered judgment for the employer, notwithstanding a jury award in the petitioner's favor, and the judgment was affirmed by the Oregon Supreme Court, which held that the petitioner's sole remedy was under the federal statute. 214 Ore. 1, 320 P.2d 668. It is that decision which is today reversed.\n\nThe creation in Davis v. Department of Labor of a \"twilight zone\" was a practical solution to a practical problem, a problem stemming from Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, \n244 \nU.S. 205\n, and one which 25 years of post-Jensen history had failed to solve. The problem was how to assure to injured waterfront employees the simple, prompt, and certain protection of workmen's compensation which Congress had clearly intended to give in enacting the federal statute. See \n317 \nU.S., at 254\n. The Davis decision in effect told the injured employee that in a doubtful case he would be assured of workmen's compensation whether he proceeded under a state workmen's compensation act or the federal statute. See Moores's \n\n[358 \nU.S. 272, 275]\n\u00a0\n Case, 323 Mass. 162, 80 N. E. 2d 478, aff'd per curiam, sub nom. Bethlehem Steel Co. v. Moores, \n335 \nU.S. 874\n.\n\nEven accepting the premise that the circumstances surrounding Hahn's accident brought it within the twilight zone, no one had supposed until today that either Davis or the federal statute allowed an employee to spurn federal compensation and submit his claim to a state court jury.\n2\n Chappell v. C. D. Johnson Lumber Corp., 112 F. Supp. 625, reversed on other grounds, 216 F.2d 873.\n\nIn the interest of a clear legislative purpose to provide the certainty and security of workmen's compensation, the \"illogic\" of a twilight zone was permitted.\n3\n Such illogic should not be utilized to frustrate that very purpose. I would affirm the judgment.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The employer in such a case is deprived of the traditional common-law defenses. Ore. Rev. Stat. 656.024.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The pertinent provision of 33 U.S.C. 903 (a) is as follows: \"(a) Compensation shall be payable under this chapter in respect of disability or death of an employee, but only if the disability or death results from an injury occurring upon the navigable waters of the United States (including any dry dock) and if recovery for the disability or death through workmen's compensation proceedings may not validly be provided by State law.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The twilight zone and its background have been much criticized and discussed.

JUSTICE STEWART took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, concurring.\n\n\nThe suggestion that this and related decisions mean that we have eliminated \"all meaningful judicial supervision over jury verdicts\" in FELA cases prompts me to file this opinion and bring up to date the compilation which I made in Wilkerson v. McCarthy, \n336 \nU.S. 53, 68\n, 71-73. The Wilkerson case was decided January 31, 1949. The attached Appendix presents a statistical summary\n1\n of our stewardship of these FELA cases from that date to October 19, 1959.\n\n\nOf the 110 petitions for certiorari filed during this period of more than 10 years, 73 were filed by employees and 37 were filed by employers. Of these, 33 were granted, each at the instance of an employee who complained of the lower court's withholding the case from the jury or overturning a jury verdict in his favor. Thirty cases were reversed for usurpation of the jury function; and in each of three the lower court's decision was sustained.\n\n\nOf the 77 petitions denied, 32 were by employees who sought reversal of a lower court's decision to withhold the case from the jury or to upset a jury's verdict. Eight \n\n[361 \nU.S. 15, 17]\n\u00a0\n more employees wanted this Court to overturn jury verdicts rendered in the employers' favor.\n\n\nOf the petitions filed by employers, 35 asked this Court to reverse a lower court decision upholding a jury verdict or holding that the case should have been submitted to a jury. Employers in two other petitions complained of the lower court's action in setting aside a jury verdict and granting a new trial.\n\n\nIt is apparent from the decisions where we refused to review cases in which lower courts withheld cases from the jury or set aside jury verdicts (or where, having granted certiorari, we sustained the lower courts in that action) that the system of judicial supervision still exists in this as in other types of cases.\n\n\nIt is suggested that the Court has consumed too much of its time in reviewing these FELA cases. An examination of the 33 cases in which the Court has granted certiorari during the period of over 10 years covered by the attached Appendix reveals that 16 of these cases were summarily reversed without oral argument and without full opinions. Only 17 cases were argued during this period of more than a decade and, of these, 5 were disposed of by brief per curiam opinions. Only 12 cases in over 10 years were argued, briefed and disposed of with full opinions by the Court. We have granted certiorari in these cases on an average of less than 3 per year and have given plenary consideration to slightly more than 1 per year. Wastage of our time is therefore a false issue.\n\n\nThe difference between the majority and minority of the Court in our treatment of FELA cases concerns the degree of vigilance we should exercise in safeguarding the jury trial - guaranteed by the Seventh Amendment and part and parcel of the remedy under this Federal Act when suit is brought in state courts. See Bailey v. Central \n\n[361 \nU.S. 15, 18]\n\u00a0\n Vermont R. Co., \n319 \nU.S. 350, 354\n; Dice v. Akron, C. & Y. R. Co., \n342 \nU.S. 359, 363\n. Whether that right has been impaired in a particular instance often produces a contrariety of views. Yet the practice of the Court in allowing four out of nine votes to control the certiorari docket is well established and of long duration.\n2\n Without it, the vast discretion which Congress allowed us in granting or denying certiorari might not be tolerable. Every member of the Court has known instances where he has strongly protested the action of the minority in bringing a case or type of case here for adjudication. He may then feel that there are more important and pressing matters to which the Court should give its attention. That is, however, a price we pay for keeping our promise to Congress\n3\n to let the vote of four Justices bring up any case here on certiorari.\n\n\n[NOTE: For dissenting opinion of MR.

Moreover, petitions seeking review of judgments of state courts granting new trials are not included because we usually treat them as not being \"final\" judgments. See 28 U.S.C. 1257; Bruce v. Tobin, \n245 \nU.S. 18\n.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] When the Act of February 13, 1925 (43 Stat. 936), which broadened our certiorari jurisdiction, was before the Congress, Mr. Justice Van Devanter, speaking for the Court, made explicit that the \"rule of four\" governs the grant of petitions for certiorari. He testified before the Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee as follows: \". . . if there were five votes against granting the petition and four in favor of granting it, it would be granted, because we proceed upon the theory that when as many as four members of the court, and even three in some instances, are impressed with the propriety of our taking the case the petition should be granted. This is the uniform way in which petitions for writs of certiorari are considered.\" Hearings on S. 2060, Feb. 2, 1924, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 29. And see Hearings on H. R. 8206, Dec. 18, 1924, 68th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 8.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The \"rule of four\" was given as one of the reasons why the Congress thought that the increase of our discretionary jurisdiction was warranted. The House Report stated: \"Lest it should be thought that the increase of discretionary jurisdiction might impair the administration of justice and lead to partial \n\n[361 \nU.S. 15, 19]\n\u00a0\n hearings and not secure a decision by the whole court, it is proper to call attention to the very thorough and complete system by which discretionary jurisdiction is exercised. In granting or refusing a prayer for a certiorari the petitioner gets the judgment of the whole court. The application is not disposed of by a single justice. The luminous and informing statement of Mr. Justice Van Devanter tells the whole story: \"`While the authority of the Supreme Court to take cases on petition for certiorari is spoken of as a discretionary jurisdiction, this does not mean that the court is authorized merely to exercise a will in the matter but rather that the petition is to be granted or denied according to a sound judicial discretion. What actually is done may well be stated here with some particularity. The party aggrieved by the decision of the circuit court of appeals and seeking a further review in the Supreme Court is required to present to it a petition and accompanying brief, setting forth the nature of the case, what questions are involved, how they were decided in the circuit court of appeals, and why the case should not rest on the decision of that court. The petition and brief are required to be served on the other party, and time is given for the presentation of an opposing brief. When this has been done copies of the printed record as it came from the circuit court of appeals and of the petition and briefs are distributed among the members of the Supreme Court, and each judge examines them and prepares a memorandum or note indicating his view of what should be done. \"`In conference these cases are called, each in its turn, and each judge states his views in extenso or briefly as he thinks proper; and when all have spoken any difference in opinion is discussed and then a vote is taken. I explain this at some length because it seems to be thought outside that the cases are referred to particular judges, as, for instance, that those coming from a particular circuit are referred to the justice assigned to that circuit, and that he reports on them, and the others accept his report. That impression is wholly at variance with what actually occurs. \"`We do not grant or deny these petitions merely according to a majority vote. We always grant the petition when as many as four think that it should be granted and sometimes when as many as three think that way. We proceed upon the theory that, if that number out of the nine are impressed with the thought that the case is one that ought to be heard and decided by us, the petition should be granted.'\" H. R. Rep. No. 1075, 68th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 3.\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER joins, dissenting.\n\n\nThe opening of a new Term that confronts the Court with the usual volume of important and exacting business impels me to reiterate the view that cases involving only factual issues and which are of no general importance have no legitimate demands upon our energies, already taxed to the utmost. See Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., \n352 \nU.S. 500, 524\n, 559 (dissenting opinions). The extreme character of the adjudication which has been made in this case also deserves something more than merely noting my dissent on the merits, for I do not think that the reversal of this judgment is to be justified even under the philosophy of Rogers.\n\n\nPetitioner was injured while engaged, as a member of a \"wreck train crew,\" in retracking two derailed boxcars on the line of another railroad during the early morning of a \"sleety, wet and sloppy\" day. The operation involved the use on each car of a derrick and four outriggers. Each outrigger was supported from beneath by wooden blocks. The first derailed car was successfully retracked. The equipment then had to be moved for a similar operation \n\n[361 \nU.S. 15, 26]\n\u00a0\n on the second car. In this process petitioner wrenched his back while attempting to remove one of the wooden blocks which had become embedded in mud. Being unable to brace his right foot on the narrow surface of the ground between the block and one of the railroad crossties, petitioner placed that foot on the tie itself. In answer to interrogatories the jury found that respondent had been negligent in that \"the tie of the track [petitioner] was required to walk was elevated a substantial distance above the ground level and was covered with grease or oil, thereby affording unstable footing.\" A verdict in the sum of $25,000 was returned, which on review was set aside by the Ohio Supreme Court.\n\n\nThe Court does not reach the question as to the applicability of the Ohio rule that this specification of negligence excluded appellate consideration of any others asserted by petitioner. I can hardly believe that the Court quarrels with the state court's ruling that as a matter of law the \"position of the crosstie, slightly elevated above the roadbed\" could not support the jury's finding of negligence because such state of affairs was a common and notorious one. Hence justification for the overturning of this judgment must rest upon what the record shows as to the presence of grease on the crosstie and as to the respondent's culpability for that alleged condition.\n\n\nUnless liability in FELA cases may be predicated upon mere conjecture, this record for me is manifestly deficient. The only evidence that there was grease on the crosstie was petitioner's statement on cross-examination that he found some grease on the sole of the shoe of his right foot, and the testimony of a section foreman of the other railroad that grease was used on that railroad's switches, which were customarily lubricated at least twice a week. Petitioner had not mentioned on direct examination, in \n\n[361 \nU.S. 15, 27]\n\u00a0\n his pre-trial deposition, or in a written account of the accident made shortly after it occurred, that he had encountered grease at any stage of the operation, and even on cross-examination did not claim that he had seen grease anywhere in the vicinity, still less on the particular crosstie where his foot had rested. With respect to the foreman's testimony, there is no evidence at all in the record before us as to the position of any of the switches in relation to the crosstie in question - whether any of them were adjacent to it or far removed.\n\n\nBut even if this evidence be considered as justifying the jury's conclusion that there was grease on this particular crosstie, there was, in the words of the Ohio court, no evidence whatever that respondent \"placed it there, knew about it, or, in the exercise of ordinary care, should have known about it.\" Evidence as to how long the alleged greasy condition of this crosstie had existed was wholly lacking. The tie on the day in question was covered with mud. And the section foreman of the other railroad testified that there was nothing untoward about the condition of the area when he inspected it the next morning. How in these circumstances it could \"with reason\" be said that the respondent failed in some duty of inspection is beyond me.\n\n\nI cannot understand how on this record even the \"scintilla\" rule of Rogers and its progeny, see dissenting opinion in Sinkler v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., \n356 \nU.S. 326, 332\n, can be thought to justify the overturning of this judgment. I fear that this decision confirms my growing suspicion that the real but unarticulated meaning of Rogers is that in FELA cases anything that a jury says goes, with the consequence that all meaningful judicial supervision over jury verdicts in such cases has been put at an end. See separate memorandum in Gibson v. Thompson, \n355 \nU.S. 18, 19\n. If so, I think the time has \n\n[361 \nU.S. 15, 28]\n\u00a0\n come when the Court should frankly say so. If not, then the Court should at least give expression to the standards by which the lower courts are to be guided in these cases. Continuance of the present unsatisfactory state of affairs can only lead to much waste motion on the part of lower courts and defense lawyers.\n\n\nI would affirm. \n\n[361 \nU.S. 15, 29]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","71":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHARRIS v. UNITED STATES(1959)\nNo. 11\nArgued: Decided: March 2, 1959\n\n\n\n\n A two-count indictment charged petitioner with (1) the purchase of 224 grains of heroin from an unstamped package, in violation of 26 U.S.C. 4704 (a); and (2) receiving and concealing this same drug, knowing it to have been unlawfully imported, in violation of 21 U.S.C. 174. At the trial, the Government introduced into evidence the heroin itself and testimony that petitioner had been in possession of it; and petitioner offered no explanation of his possession of the same. Held: In view of the separate statutory presumptions, proof of possession of unstamped heroin, in the absence of explanation, was sufficient to support a conviction by the jury on each of the counts as covering entirely separate offenses; and consecutive sentences of five years' imprisonment on each count were valid where based upon such separate offenses under different sections of the narcotics laws. Pp. 19-24.\n\n 248 F.2d 196, affirmed.\n\nSidney M. Glazer argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief were Morris A. Shenker and Bernard J. Mellman.\n\nJohn L. Murphy argued the cause for the United States. On the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Anderson, Beatrice Rosenberg and Jerome M. Feit.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nIn this narcotics case a two-count indictment charged petitioner with (1) the purchase of 224 grains of heroin from an unstamped package, in violation of 26 U.S.C. 4704 (a);\n1\n and (2) receiving and concealing this same \n\n[359 \nU.S. 19, 20]\n\u00a0\n drug knowing it to have been unlawfully imported, in violation of 21 U.S.C. 174.\n2\n The Government introduced into evidence the heroin itself, and testimony that petitioner had been in possession of it. On each count it relied, for proof of the elements of the offense, on the statutory presumptions provided by Congress. While petitioner took the stand, his defense was an alibi and there was therefore a total absence of any explanation by him of his possession of the prohibited drug. Upon being found guilty on each count by a jury, on an instruction that proof of possession of unstamped heroin, in the absence of explanation, might support a conviction on each of the charges in view of the separate statutory presumptions, petitioner was sentenced to consecutive sentences of five years' imprisonment and a $1 fine on each count. Attack is made not only on the validity of the instructions but also on the consecutive sentences. The \n\n[359 \nU.S. 19, 21]\n\u00a0\n Court of Appeals affirmed, 248 F.2d 196 (C. A. 8th Cir., 1957). In view of the importance of the question in the enforcement of the narcotic laws, we granted certiorari. \n357 \nU.S. 935\n (1958). We agree with the Court of Appeals. This disposition requires neither a detail of the facts which may be found in the opinion of the Court of Appeals, supra, nor of the court's instructions, of which petitioner now complains.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nCongress provided in 1919 that buying narcotics, except in or from the original stamped package, was an offense\n4\n punishable by fine of not more than $2,000 and imprisonment for not more than five years.\n5\n The 1919 Act specifically provided that \"the absence of appropriate tax-paid stamps . . . shall be prima facie evidence of a violation of this section by the person in whose possession same may be found.\"\n6\n Long before, on February 9, 1909, Congress had provided that receiving and concealing unlawfully imported narcotics should likewise be an offense. The Act provided that once the defendant on trial \"is shown to have, or to have had, possession of [the narcotic drug] such possession shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction unless the defendant shall explain the possession to the satisfaction of the jury.\"\n7\n\u00a0\n\nPetitioner does not challenge the power of the Congress to adopt these statutes, nor does he attack the separateness of the offenses created, the distinct punishments provided, nor the presumptions therein authorized. But he says that where the presumptions are coupled with a single act of possession of unstamped narcotics cumulative sentences are not permissible and the ones here imposed must \n\n[359 \nU.S. 19, 22]\n\u00a0\n fall under the doctrine of Blockburger v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 299\n (1932). We think not.\n\nAs we see it, Gore v. United States, \n357 \nU.S. 386\n (1958), controls the question here. There, consecutive sentences were upheld on three counts of an indictment charging (1) sale of narcotics not pursuant to a written order form; (2) purchase, sale and distribution not in or from a stamped package; and (3) transportation and concealment of illegally imported narcotics. The three offenses derived from one transaction, a sale of narcotics. It will be noted that two of the offenses there charged are present here where the one fact proved by direct evidence is possession, rather than a sale. The Court reasoned that \"three violations of three separate offenses created by Congress at three different times,\" indicated a clear and continuing purpose on its part \"of dealing more and more strictly with, and seeking to throttle more and more by different legal devices, the traffic in narcotics. Both in the unfolding of the substantive provisions of law and in the scale of punishments, Congress has manifested an attitude not of lenity but of severity toward violation of the narcotics laws.\" Supra, at 391.\n8\n We see no significant differences between the two cases. The direct proof in Gore was of a sale of heroin without a written order charged in one of the three counts upon which the consecutive sentences were based. Resort to the statutory presumptions was made to establish the other two counts on which those sentences were assessed. Here the direct evidence proved possession of the unstamped drug, and resort was made to the statutory presumptions for support of the two offenses charged. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 19, 23]\n\u00a0\n\n\nPetitioner insists that each offense here requires proof of only the single fact of possession, which brings it within the rule in Blockburger, supra. However, petitioner completely overlooks the fact that the \"acts or transactions\" prohibited by the respective statutes cannot be equated to possession alone. Let us analyze the offenses. Under the first count of the indictment, the prosecution must prove a purchase of narcotics, other than in or from the original stamped package. In order to establish these ultimate facts, the prosecutor may put on direct evidence of possession of the unstamped heroin and the statutory presumption of 4704 (a) then has the effect of establishing, prima facie, that there was in fact a purchase and that the purchase was other than in or from the original stamped package. In this case, the heroin itself was introduced in evidence, thus the jury could determine whether or not it was stamped. Similarly, under the second count, the prosecution was obligated to prove three ultimate facts: (1) that the heroin was received and concealed; (2) that it had been imported contrary to law; and (3) that petitioner knew of the unlawful importation. After putting on direct evidence of the possession, the prosecution was aided by the statutory presumption of 174 that the ultimate facts of the violation - entirely different, it must be noted, from those of the first count - were also present.\n\nThus, the violation, as distinguished from the direct evidence offered to prove that violation, was distinctly different under each of the respective statutes. Instead of limiting his proof to an alibi, petitioner could, by offering evidence tending to controvert one presumption or the other as to the ultimate facts, have earned an acquittal on either count and still have been found guilty on the other. Furthermore, to take advantage of the presumption of 174 it is necessary only to prove possession \n\n[359 \nU.S. 19, 24]\n\u00a0\n by direct evidence; whereas to take advantage of the presumption of 4704 (a) it is necessary to prove by direct evidence that the narcotic was unstamped as well as that it was in the defendant's possession. It follows, even if the Blockburger test were applicable, that the offenses were separate and that consecutive sentences could be imposed on each count.\n\nWe have considered the other contentions raised by petitioner and found them to be without merit. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nCHIEF JUSTICE WARREN concurs in the result.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR.

P.(1959)\nNo. 127\nArgued: Decided: June 8, 1959\n\n\n\n\n Appellees sued in a three-judge Federal District Court for a declaratory judgment that five Virginia statutes enacted in 1956 and never construed by the Virginia courts were unconstitutional and to enjoin their enforcement. Appellants moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the District Court should not exercise its jurisdiction to enjoin the enforcement of state statutes that have not been authoritatively construed by the state courts. The District Court found two of the statutes vague and ambiguous and withheld judgment on them, retaining jurisdiction, pending construction by the state courts; but it declared the other three unconstitutional and enjoined their enforcement against appellees. Held: As to the three statutes which it held unconstitutional, the District Court should have abstained from deciding the merits of the issues tendered to it and should have retained jurisdiction until the Virginia courts had been afforded a reasonable opportunity to construe them. Pp. 168-179.\n\n (a) The federal courts should not adjudicate the constitutionality of state enactments fairly open to interpretation until the state courts have been afforded a reasonable opportunity to pass upon them. Pp. 176-177.\n\n\n (b) The three statutes here involved leave reasonable room for a construction by the Virginia courts which might avoid in whole or in part the necessity for federal constitutional adjudication, or at least materially change the nature of the problem. Pp. 177-178.\n\n\n (c) These enactments should be exposed to state construction or limiting interpretation before the federal courts are asked to decide upon their constitutionality, so that federal judgment will be based on something that is a complete product of the State, each enactment as phrased by its legislature and as construed by its highest court. P. 178. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 167, 168]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n (d) Appellants having represented to this Court that they would never prosecute appellees for conduct engaged in during the pendency of these proceedings, the judgment of the District Court is vacated and the case remanded to that Court with instructions to afford appellees a reasonable opportunity to bring appropriate proceedings in the Virginia courts, meanwhile retaining its own jurisdiction of the case, and for further proceedings consistent with the opinion of this Court. P. 179.\n\n\n 159 F. Supp. 503, judgment vacated and cause remanded.\n\nDavid J. Mays and J. Segar Gravatt argued the cause for appellants. With them on the brief were Henry T. Wickham and Clarence F. Hicks.\n\nThurgood Marshall argued the cause for appellees. With him on the brief were Robert L. Carter, Oliver W. Hill, Spottswood W. Robinson III, William T. Coleman, Jr., Jack Greenberg, Constance Baker Motley and Louis H. Pollak.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nIn this case a three-judge District Court was convened pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2281 to hear federal constitutional challenges against five Virginia statutes. It declared three invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment, and permanently enjoined the appellants from enforcing them against the appellees; the other two statutes it found vague and ambiguous and accordingly retained jurisdiction pending a construction by the state courts. 159 F. Supp. 503. Only the former disposition was appealed. The appeal raises two questions: First, whether in the circumstances of this case the District Court should have abstained from a constitutional adjudication, retaining the cause while the parties, through appropriate proceedings, afforded the Virginia courts an opportunity to construe the three statutes in light of state and federal constitutional requirements. Second, if such an abstention \n\n[360 \nU.S. 167, 169]\n\u00a0\n was not called for, whether the District Court's constitutional holdings were correct. Because of our views upon the first question we do not reach the second.\n\nNational Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Incorporated (Fund), appellees herein, are organizations engaged in furthering the rights of colored citizens. Both are membership corporations organized under the laws of New York, and have registered under the laws of Virginia as foreign corporations doing business within the State. NAACP's principal relevant activities in Virginia are appearing before legislative bodies and commissions in support of, or opposition to, measures affecting the status of the Negro race within the State, and furnishing assistance to Negroes concerned in litigation involving their constitutional rights. Fund performs functions similar to those of NAACP in the field of litigation, but is precluded by its charter from attempting to influence legislation. The revenues of NAACP are derived both from membership dues and general contributions, those of Fund entirely from contributions.\n\nNAACP and Fund brought this action against the Attorney General of Virginia and a number of other Commonwealth officials, appellants herein, for declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to Chapters 31, 32, 33, 35 and 36 of the Acts of the Virginia Assembly, passed in 1956. 4 Va. Code, 1958 Supp., 18-349.9 to 18-349.37; 7 Va. Code, 1958, 54-74, 54-78, 54-79. The complaint, alleging irreparable injury on account of these enactments, sought a declaration that each infringed rights assured under the Fourteenth Amendment and an injunction against its enforcement. Jurisdiction was predicated upon the civil rights statutes, 42 U.S.C. 1981, 1983, 28 U.S.C. 1343, diversity of citizenship, 28 U.S.C. 1332, and the presence of a federal question, 28 U.S.C. 1331.\n\n\n[360 \nU.S. 167, 170]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Attorney General and his codefendants moved to dismiss the action on the ground, among others, that the District Court should not \"exercise its jurisdiction to enjoin the enforcement of state statutes which have not been authoritatively construed by the state courts.\" The District Court, recognizing \"the necessity of maintaining the delicate balance between state and federal courts under the concept of separate sovereigns,\" stated that \"the constitutionality of state statutes requiring special competence in the interpretation of local law should not be determined by federal courts in advance of a reasonable opportunity afforded the parties to seek an adjudication by the state court,\" but considered that relief should be granted where \"the statute is free from ambiguity and there remains no reasonable interpretation which will render it constitutional . . . .\" 159 F. Supp., at 522, 523. On this basis, the court, one judge dissenting, held Chapters 31, 32, and 35 unconstitutional, and permanently enjoined their enforcement against NAACP and Fund. Chapters 33 and 36, on the other hand, the court unanimously found vague and ambiguous. It accordingly retained jurisdiction as to those Chapters, without reaching their constitutionality, allowing the complaining parties a reasonable time within which to obtain a state interpretation.\n\nThe Commonwealth defendants, proceeding under 28 U.S.C. 1253, appealed to this Court the lower court's disposition of Chapters 31, 32, and 35. We noted probable jurisdiction. \n358 \nU.S. 807\n. NAACP and Fund did not appeal the disposition of Chapters 33 and 36.\n\nThe three Virginia statutes before us are lengthy, detailed, and sweeping. Chapters 31 and 32 are registration statutes. Chapter 31 deals with the rendering of financial assistance in litigation. It proscribes the public solicitation of funds, and the expenditure of funds from whatever source derived, for the commencement or further \n\n[360 \nU.S. 167, 171]\n\u00a0\n prosecution of an \"original proceeding,\" by any person, broadly defined to include corporations and other entities, which is neither a party nor possessed of a \"pecuniary right or liability\" in such proceeding, unless a detailed annual filing is made with the State Corporation Commission. If such person is a corporation, the filing must include among other things, (1) certified copies of its charter and by-laws; (2) \"a certified list of the names and addresses of the officers, directors, stockholders, members, agents and employees or other persons acting for or in [its] behalf;\" (3) a certified statement of the sources of its income, however derived, including the names and addresses of contributors or donors if required by the Commission; (4) a detailed certified statement of the corporation's expenditures for the preceding year, the objects thereof, and whatever other information relative thereto may be required by the Commission; and (5) a certified statement of the \"counties and cities in which it proposes to or does finance or maintain litigation to which it is not a party.\" Correspondingly broad disclosures are required of individuals who fall within the statutory proscription.\n\nViolation of this Chapter is punishable as a misdemeanor for individuals, and by a fine of not more than $10,000 for corporations, plus a mandatory denial or revocation of authority to do business within the State in the case of a foreign corporation. An individual \"acting as an agent or employee\" of a corporation or other entity with respect to activity violative of the Chapter is deemed guilty of a misdemeanor. And directors, officers, and \"those persons responsible for the management or control of the affairs\" of a corporation or other entity are made jointly and severally liable for whatever fines might be imposed on it.\n\nChapter 32 deals with activities relating to the passage of racial legislation, with advocacy of \"racial integration or segregation,\" and also with the raising and expenditure \n\n[360 \nU.S. 167, 172]\n\u00a0\n of funds in connection with racial litigation. Declaring that the \"continued harmonious relations between the races are . . . essential to the welfare, health and safety of the people of Virginia,\" the Chapter finds it \"vital to the public interest\" that registration be made with the State Corporation Commission by \"persons, firms, partnerships, corporations and associations whose activities are causing or may cause interracial tension and unrest.\" Specifically, under 2 of this Chapter, annual filings are required of\n\n\"[e]very person, firm, partnership, corporation or association, whether by or through its agents, servants, employees, officers, or voluntary workers or associates, who or which engages as one of its principal functions or activities in the promoting or opposing in any manner the passage of legislation by the General Assembly in behalf of any race or color, or who or which has as one of its principal functions or activities the advocating of racial integration or segregation or whose activities cause or tend to cause racial conflicts or violence, or who or which is engaged or engages in raising or expending funds for the employment of counsel or payment of costs in connection with litigation in behalf of any race or color, in this State . . . .\"\n\n\n The extent of such filing is comparable to that required by Chapter 31. The information so furnished is a matter of public record, to \"be open to the inspection of any citizen at any time during the regular business hours of\" the State Corporation Commission.\n\nFailure to register subjects individuals to punishment as for a misdemeanor, and corporations to a fine not exceeding $10,000. Like Chapter 31, Chapter 32 also makes \"responsible\" persons liable jointly and severally for corporate fines. Further, \"[e]ach day's failure to \n\n[360 \nU.S. 167, 173]\n\u00a0\n register and file the information required . . . shall constitute a separate offense and be punished as such.\" The Chapter is not applicable to persons or organizations which carry on the proscribed activities through matter which may qualify as second-class mail in the United States mails, or by radio or television, nor to persons or organizations acting in connection with any political campaign.\n\nChapter 35 is a \"barratry\" statute. Barratry is defined as \"the offense of stirring up litigation.\" A \"barrator\" is thus a person or organization which \"stirs up litigation.\" Stirring up litigation means \"instigating,\" which in turn \"means bringing it about that all or part of the expenses of the litigation are paid by the barrator,\" or by those, other than the plaintiffs, acting in concert with him, \"unless the instigation is justified.\" An instigation is \"justified\" when \"the instigator is related by blood or marriage to the plaintiff whom he instigates, or . . . is entitled by law to share with the plaintiff in money or property that is the subject of the litigation or . . . has a direct interest [\"personal right or a pecuniary right or liability\"] in the subject matter of the litigation or occupies a position of trust in relation to the plaintiff; or . . . is acting on behalf of a duly constituted legal aid society approved by the Virginia State Bar which offers advice or assistance in all kinds of legal matters to all members of the public who come to it for advice or assistance and are unable because of poverty to pay legal fees.\"\n\nIndividuals guilty of barratry as defined in the Chapter are punishable as for a misdemeanor and \"shall\" have their licenses \"to practice law or any other profession . . . revoked for such period as provided by law.\" Corporations are subject to a fine of not more than $10,000 and, if they are foreign, mandatory revocation of their authority to do business within the State. Moreover, a \"person who aids and abets a barrator by giving money or rendering \n\n[360 \nU.S. 167, 174]\n\u00a0\n services to or for the use or benefit of the barrator for committing barratry shall be guilty of barratry and punished . . . .\" A host of exceptions to which the Chapter is not applicable is provided;\n1\n none of these has thus far been asserted to include, or to be capable of including, appellees.\n\nThe majority below held Chapters 31 and 32\n2\n unconstitutional on similar grounds, centering its treatment of both around 2 of Chapter 32, the material provisions of which have already been set forth, p. 172, supra. In essence 2 was found to infringe rights assured under the Fourteenth Amendment, in that, taken in conjunction with the registration requirements of the statute, (1) the clause relating to the promoting or opposing of racial legislation invaded rights of free speech because it was not restricted to lobbying activities;\n3\n (2) the clause directed \n\n[360 \nU.S. 167, 175]\n\u00a0\n at advocacy of racial \"integration or segregation\" had the same infirmity because it was not supported by a compelling state interest or some clear and present danger;\n4\n (3) the clause referring to activities causing or tending to cause racial conflicts or violence was too vague and indefinite to satisfy constitutional requirements;\n5\n and (4) the clause aimed at the raising and expending of funds in connection with racial litigation unduly burdened the right of access to the courts, and did not serve an interest which could support a disclosure as broad as the one demanded.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nChapter 35, the \"barratry\" statute, was held to offend due process, in that it was found to be aimed not at the legitimate regulation of the practice of law but at preventing NAACP and Fund from continuing \"their legal operations.\" In addition, the court held the Chapter to violate equal protection by unjustifiably discriminating between the racial litigation activities of the appellees and the general litigation efforts of \"approved\" legal aid societies.\n\nThese constitutional holdings were made in the context of findings that Chapters 31, 32, and 35, as well as Chapters 33 and 36 not presently before us, were passed by the Virginia Legislature \"to nullify as far as possible the effect of the decision of the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education, \n347 \nU.S. 483\n . . . as parts of the general plan of massive resistance to the integration of \n\n[360 \nU.S. 167, 176]\n\u00a0\n schools of the state under the Supreme Court's decrees.\" 159 F. Supp., at 511, 515. In the view we take of this case we do not reach appellants' objections to these findings.\n\nAccording every consideration to the opinion of the majority below, we are nevertheless of the view that the District Court should have abstained from deciding the merits of the issues tendered it, so as to afford the Virginia courts a reasonable opportunity to construe the three statutes in question. In other words, we think that the District Court in dealing with Chapters 31, 32, and 35 should have followed the same course that it did with respect to Chapters 33 and 36.\n\nThis now well-established procedure is aimed at the avoidance of unnecessary interference by the federal courts with proper and validly administered state concerns, a course so essential to the balanced working of our federal system. To minimize the possibility of such interference a \"scrupulous regard for the rightful independence of state governments . . . should at all times actuate the federal courts,\" Matthews v. Rodgers, \n284 \nU.S. 521, 525\n, as their \"contribution . . . in furthering the harmonious relation between state and federal authority . . . .\" Railroad Comm'n v. Pullman Co., \n312 \nU.S. 496, 501\n. In the service of this doctrine, which this Court has applied in many different contexts, no principle has found more consistent or clear expression than that the federal courts should not adjudicate the constitutionality of state enactments fairly open to interpretation until the state courts have been afforded a reasonable opportunity to pass upon them. See, e. g., Railroad Comm'n v. Pullman Co., supra; Chicago v. Fieldcrest Dairies, Inc., \n316 \nU.S. 168\n; Spector Motor Service, Inc., v. McLaughlin, \n323 \nU.S. 101\n; American Federation of Labor v. Watson, \n327 \nU.S. 582\n; Shipman v. DuPre, \n339 \nU.S. 321\n; Albertson v. Millard, \n345 \nU.S. 242\n; \n\n[360 \nU.S. 167, 177]\n\u00a0\n Government & Civic Employees v. Windsor, \n353 \nU.S. 364\n. This principle does not, of course, involve the abdication of federal jurisdiction, but only the postponement of its exercise; it serves the policy of comity inherent in the doctrine of abstention; and it spares the federal courts of unnecessary constitutional adjudication. See Chicago v. Fieldcrest Dairies, Inc., supra, at 172-173.\n\nThe present case, in our view, is one which calls for the application of this principle, since we are unable to agree that the terms of these three statutes leave no reasonable room for a construction by the Virginia courts which might avoid in whole or in part the necessity for federal constitutional adjudication, or at least materially change the nature of the problem.\n\nIt certainly cannot be said that Chapter 35 does not require a construction by the state courts. As appellants asserted here and in the court below, the Chapter might well be read as requiring a \"stirring up\" of litigation in the conventional common-law sense, in addition to the \"unjustified\" payment of litigation expenses. Were it to be so read, the statute might then not even apply to these appellees since the lower court found the evidence \"uncontradicted that the initial steps which have led to the institution and prosecution of racial suits in Virginia with the assistance of the Association and the Fund have not been taken until the prospective plaintiffs made application to one or the other of the corporations for help.\" 159 F. Supp., at 533. Further the \"personal right\" component of \"direct interest\" in the statutory definition of \"justified\" instigation (see p. 173, supra) might lend itself to a construction which would embrace nonparty Negro contributors to litigation expense, including NAACP because of the relationship of that organization to its members. Cf. NAACP v. Alabama, \n357 \nU.S. 449\n.\n\nThe possibility of limiting interpretation, characteristic of constitutional adjudication, also cannot be ignored. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 167, 178]\n\u00a0\n Government & Civic Employees v. Windsor, supra. The \"advocacy\" clause of Chapter 32, for example, might be construed as reaching only that directed at the incitement of violence. Cf. Yates v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 298\n. Similar construction might be employed with respect to the clause in that Chapter relating to the influencing of legislation \"in any manner,\" cf. United States v. Harriss, supra; United States v. Rumely, \n345 \nU.S. 41\n. And, in connection with these and the membership and contributor list requirements of Chapters 31 and 32, cf. NAACP v. Alabama, supra, we note that Chapter 32 contains a separability clause, and that the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia treats legislative acts as separable, where possible, even in the absence of such an express provision. See Woolfolk v. Driver, 186 Va. 174, 41 S. E. 2d 463.\n\nWe do not intimate the slightest view as to what effect any such determinations might have upon the validity of these statutes. All we hold is that these enactments should be exposed to state construction or limiting interpretation before the federal courts are asked to decide upon their constitutionality, so that federal judgment will be based on something that is a complete product of the State, the enactment as phrased by its legislature and as construed by its highest court. The Virginia declaratory judgment procedure, 2 Va. Code, 1950, 8-578 to 8-585, which the appellees are now pursuing with reference to Chapters 33 and 36, also provides an expeditious avenue here. And of course we shall not assume that the Virginia courts will not do their full duty in judging these statutes in light of state and federal constitutional requirements.\n\nBecause of its findings, amply supported by the evidence, that the existence and threatened enforcement of these statutes worked great and immediate irreparable injury on appellees, the District Court's abstention with respect to Chapters 33 and 36 proceeded on the assumption \n\n[360 \nU.S. 167, 179]\n\u00a0\n \"that the defendants will continue to cooperate, as they have in the past, in withholding action under the authority of the statutes until a final decision is reached . . . .\" 159 F. Supp., at 534. In this Court counsel for the appellants has given similar assurances with respect to the three statutes presently before us, assurances which we understand embrace also the intention of these appellants never to proceed against appellees under any of these enactments with respect to activities engaged in during the full pendency of this litigation. While there is no reason to suppose that such assurances will not be honored by these or other Virginia officials not parties to this litigation, the District Court of course possesses ample authority in this action, or in such supplemental proceedings as may be initiated, to protect the appellees while this case goes forward.\n\nAccordingly, the judgment below will be vacated and the case remanded to the District Court, with instructions to afford the appellees a reasonable opportunity to bring appropriate proceedings in the Virginia courts, meanwhile retaining its own jurisdiction of the case, and for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"This article shall not be applicable to attorneys who are parties to contingent fee contracts with their clients where the attorney does not protect the client from payment of the costs and expense of litigation, nor shall this article apply to any matter involving annexation, zoning, bond issues, or the holding or results of any election or referendum, nor shall this article apply to suits pertaining to or affecting possession of or title to real or personal property, regardless of ownership, nor shall this article apply to suits involving the legality of assessment or collection of taxes or the rates thereof, nor shall this article apply to suits involving rates or charges or services by common carriers or public utilities, nor shall this article apply to criminal prosecutions, nor to the payment of attorneys by legal aid societies approved by the Virginia State Bar, nor to proceedings to abate nuisances. Nothing herein shall be construed to be in derogation of the constitutional rights of real parties in interest to employ counsel or to prosecute any available legal remedy under the laws of this State.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Chief Judge Hutcheson, the dissenting judge, did not reach the constitutionality of any of these statutes, because of his views on the \"abstention\" issue.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] In this, the District Court relied on United States v. Harriss, \n347 \nU.S. 612\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The lower court cited, among other cases, American Communications Assn. v. Douds, \n339 \nU.S. 382\n; Schenck v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 47\n; Dennis v. United States, \n341 \nU.S. 494\n; Buchanan v. Warley, \n245 \nU.S. 60\n; Grosjean v. American Press Co., \n297 \nU.S. 233\n; Thomas v. Collins, \n323 \nU.S. 516\n; and distinguished Bryant v. Zimmerman, \n278 \nU.S. 63\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Citing United States v. Harriss, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] On the latter ground, the court distinguished such cases as Cantwell v. Connecticut, \n310 \nU.S. 296\n, and Burroughs v. United States, \n290 \nU.S. 534\n; and cited Thomas v. Collins, supra.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN concur, dissenting.\n\nThe rule invoked by the Court to require the Federal District Court to keep hands off this litigation until the state court has construed these laws is a judge-made rule. It was fashioned in 1941 in the decision of Railroad Comm'n v. Pullman Co., \n312 \nU.S. 496\n, as a device to avoid needless decisions under the Federal Constitution where a resolution of state law questions might make those adjudications unnecessary. Since that time, the rule of the Pullman case has been greatly expanded. It \n\n[360 \nU.S. 167, 180]\n\u00a0\n has indeed been extended so far as to make the presence in federal court litigation of a state law question a convenient excuse for requiring the federal court to hold its hand while a second litigation is undertaken in the state court. This is a delaying tactic that may involve years of time and that inevitably doubles the cost of litigation. When used widespread, it dilutes the stature of the Federal District Courts, making them secondary tribunals in the administration of justice under the Federal Constitution.\n\nWith all due deference, this case seems to me to be the most inappropriate one of all in which to withhold the hand of the Federal District Court. Congress has ordained in the Civil Rights Act that \"All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State . . . to sue, be parties, give evidence . . . as is enjoyed by white citizens . . . .\" 42 U.S.C. 1981. It has subjected to suit \"Every person who, under color of any statute, . . . subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person . . . to the deprivation of any rights . . . secured by the Constitution and laws . . .\" 42 U.S.C. 1983; and has given the District Courts \"original jurisdiction\" of actions \"to redress the deprivation, under color of any State law, . . . of any right . . . secured by the Constitution of the United States or any Act of Congress providing for equal rights of citizens . . . .\" 28 U.S.C. 1343. The latter section was invoked here. From the time when Congress first implemented the Fourteenth Amendment by the comprehensive Civil Rights Act of 1871 the thought has prevailed that the federal courts are the unique tribunals which are to be utilized to preserve the civil rights of the people. Representative Dawes, in the debate on the 1871 bill, asked \"what is the proper method of thus securing the free and undisturbed enjoyment of these rights?\" Looking to the Act which eventually \n\n[360 \nU.S. 167, 181]\n\u00a0\n became law he answered, \"The first remedy proposed by this bill is a resort to the courts of the United States.\n*\n Is that a proper place in which to find redress for any such wrongs? If there be power to call into the courts of the United States an offender against these rights, privileges and immunities; and hold him to account there, . . . I submit . . . that there is no tribunal so fitted, where equal and exact justice would be more likely to be meted out in temper, in moderation, in severity, if need be, but always according to the law and fact, as that great tribunal of the Constitution.\" Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess. 476 (1871).\n\nIt seems plain to me that it was the District Court's duty to provide this remedy, if the appellees, who invoked that court's jurisdiction under the Civil Rights Act, proved their charge that the appellants, under the color of the Virginia statutes, had deprived them of civil rights secured by the Federal Constitution. See Hague v. C. I. O., \n307 \nU.S. 496, 530\n-532.\n\nJudge Soper, speaking for the three-judge District Court, said that the five statutes against which the suits were directed \"were enacted for the express purpose of impeding the integration of the races in the public schools\" of Virginia. 159 F. Supp. 503, 511. He reviewed at length the legislative history of the five Virginia statutes (id., 511-515) concluding that \"they were \n\n[360 \nU.S. 167, 182]\n\u00a0\n passed to nullify as far as possible the effect of the decisions\" of this Court in Brown v. Board of Education, \n347 \nU.S. 483, 349\n U.S. 294. Id., 511. They were indeed \"parts of the general plan of massive resistance\" which Virginia inaugurated against those decisions. Id., 515.\n\nOf course Virginia courts were not parties to the formulation of that legislative program. But they are interpreters of Virginia laws and bound to construe them, if possible, so that the legislative purpose is not frustrated. Where state laws make such an assault as these do on our decisions and a State has spoken defiantly against the constitutional rights of the citizens, reasons for showing deference to local institutions vanish. The conflict is plain and apparent; and the federal courts stand as the one authoritative body for enforcing the constitutional right of the citizens.\n\nThis Court has had before it other state schemes intended to emasculate constitutional provisions or circumvent our constitutional decisions. In Guinn v. United States, \n238 \nU.S. 347\n, a \"Grandfather Clause\" in an Oklahoma suffrage statute, exempting citizens who were qualified to vote on January 1, 1866, and their lineal descendants, from the requirements of a literacy test was said to have \"no discernible reason other than the purpose to disregard the prohibitions of the [Fifteenth] Amendment,\" and was struck down because in \"direct and positive disregard\" of that Amendment. Id., pp. 363, 365. Oklahoma sought to avoid the effects of that decision (rendered in 1915) by requiring all qualified voters in 1916 to register within a named 12-day period, else the right to vote would be lost to them permanently. Persons who voted in the 1914 election were, however, exempt from the requirement. The new statute was invalidated, this Court noting that the Fifteenth Amendment barred \"sophisticated as well as simple-minded\" \"contrivances by a state to thwart equality in \n\n[360 \nU.S. 167, 183]\n\u00a0\n the enjoyment of the right to vote.\" Lane v. Wilson, \n307 \nU.S. 268, 275\n. The Boswell Amendment to the Alabama Constitution required prospective voters to understand and explain a section of the Alabama Constitution to the satisfaction of a registrar. A three-judge court found it to be a device in purpose and in practice to perpetuate racial distinctions in regulation of suffrage. We affirmed the judgment without requiring any submission of the amendment to the state courts to see how they might narrow it. Schnell v. Davis, \n336 \nU.S. 933\n, affirming 81 F. Supp. 872. All these cases originated in federal courts and implicated state laws evasive of our decisions; and we decided them without rerouting them through the state courts.\n\nA similar history is evidenced by the \"White Primary\" cases. It starts with Nixon v. Herndon, \n273 \nU.S. 536\n, where a Texas statute prohibiting Negroes from participating in Democratic Party primary elections was characterized as a \"direct and obvious infringement\" of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. As a result of that decision, the Texas Legislature enacted a new statute authorizing the State Executive Committee of a political party to prescribe the qualifications for voters in its primary elections. Pursuant thereto the Democratic Party Committee adopted a resolution limiting the voting privilege to white Democrats. Finding that the Committee was an arm of the State, and that it discharged its power in such a way as to \"discriminate invidiously between white citizens and black\" this Court overturned the restriction. Nixon v. Condon, \n286 \nU.S. 73, 89\n. In Smith v. Allwright, \n321 \nU.S. 649\n, we held that approval by the state party convention of the discriminating prohibition did not save it. And see Terry v. Adams, \n345 \nU.S. 461\n. These cases too originated in federal courts and were aimed at state laws at war with our decisions. Here, again, we decided them without \n\n[360 \nU.S. 167, 184]\n\u00a0\n making the parties first repair to the state courts for a construction of the state statutes.\n\nWe need not - we should not - give deference to a state policy that seeks to undermine paramount federal law. We fail to perform the duty expressly enjoined by Congress on the federal judiciary in the Civil Rights Acts when we do so.\n\nTo return to the present case: the error, if any, of the District Court was not in passing on the constitutionality of three of the five Virginia statutes now before us but in remitting the parties to the Virginia courts for a construction of the other two.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] It was not until 1875 that Congress gave the federal courts general jurisdiction over federal-question cases. 18 Stat. 470. The choice made in the Civil Rights Acts of 1870 and 1871 to utilize the federal courts to insure the equal rights of the people was a deliberate one, reflecting a belief that some state courts, which were charged with original jurisdiction in the normal federal-question case, might not be hospitable to claims of deprivation of civil rights. Whether or not that premise is true today, the fact remains that there has been no alteration of the congressional intent to make the federal courts the primary protector of the legal rights secured by the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments and the Civil Rights Acts. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 167, 185]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","73":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHEFLIN v. UNITED STATES(1959)\nNo. 137\nArgued: Decided: February 24, 1959\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner was indicted and convicted on three counts charging violations of the Federal Bank Robbery Act, 18 U.S.C. 2113, by taking property by force and violence and assaulting and jeopardizing the lives of several persons in the course of the taking, in violation of 2113 (d), receiving the stolen property, in violation of 2113 (c), and conspiring to violate the Act. He was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment on the first of these counts, three years on the conspiracy count and a year and a day on the count charging receipt of the stolen property, the three sentences to run consecutively. While still in custody under the admittedly valid 10-year sentence, he moved for correction of the sentence, claiming that he could not be lawfully convicted under both subsection (c) and (d) of 2113 for feloniously receiving and feloniously taking the same property. Held:\n\n 1. Relief under 28 U.S.C. 2255 is available only to attack a sentence under which the prisoner is in custody; but relief was available to petitioner under Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which authorizes the correction of an illegal sentence \"at any time.\" Pp. 417-418.\n\n\n 2. The separate sentence under 18 U.S.C. 2113 (c) for receiving the stolen property was invalid, since that subsection was not designed to increase the punishment for one who robs a bank but only to provide punishment for those who receive the loot from the robber. Prince v. United States, \n352 \nU.S. 322\n. Pp. 419-420.\n\n\n 251 F.2d 69, reversed.\n\nJerome A. Cooper, acting under appointment by the Court, \n358 \nU.S. 803\n, argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner.\n\nTheodore George Gilinsky argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Anderson and Beatrice Rosenberg. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 415, 416]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner and two others were indicted and convicted under three counts charging violations of the Federal Bank Robbery Act, 18 U.S.C. 2113. One count charged taking the property by force and violence, and assaulting and jeopardizing the lives of several persons in the course of the taking, in violation of 2113 (d).\n1\n Another count charged that they did \"receive, possess, conceal, store, and dispose\" of the stolen money in violation of 2113 (c).\n2\n A third count charged a conspiracy. The sentence imposed\n3\n was 10 years on the first count mentioned above, 3 years on the conspiracy count to begin to run on expiration of the first, and 1 year and 1 day on the count charging receipt of the stolen property, this sentence to begin to run on expiration of the sentence on the conspiracy count.\n\nAll these events took place before our decision in Prince v. United States, \n352 \nU.S. 322\n. Shortly thereafter petitioner instituted this proceeding under 28 U.S.C. 2255,\n4\n\u00a0\n\n[358 \nU.S. 415, 417]\n\u00a0\n complaining that he could not be lawfully convicted under both subsections (c) and (d) of 2113, i. e., of feloniously receiving and feloniously taking the same property. The District Court denied the motion. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 251 F.2d 69. We granted certiorari (\n357 \nU.S. 935\n) because of an apparent conflict between that decision and the Prince case.\n\nI. There is a preliminary question of jurisdiction. Petitioner is now in custody under the 10-year sentence which admittedly is valid. Since he has not completed that sentence nor the consecutive conspiracy sentence, it is argued that relief by way of 2255 may not be had.\n\nWe reviewed in United States v. Hayman, \n342 \nU.S. 205\n, the history of 2255 and emphasized that its purpose was to minimize some of the difficulties involved in the use of habeas corpus. It is now argued that when consecutive \n\n[358 \nU.S. 415, 418]\n\u00a0\n sentences are imposed, 2255, no more than habeas corpus (McNally v. Hill, \n293 \nU.S. 131, 138\n), can be used to question a sentence which the prisoner has not begun to serve. The Court is divided on that issue. Some think that when 2255 says \"A motion for such relief may be made at any time,\" it means what it says. To them the correction of sentence, if made, will affect \"the right to be released,\" protected by 2255, even though that right will not be immediately realized. A majority, however, are of the view, shared by several Courts of Appeals,\n5\n that 2255 is available only to attack a sentence under which a prisoner is in custody. Yet in their view relief under Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure\n6\n is available (at least where matters dehors the record are not involved), the only question here being whether the sentence imposed was illegal on its face.\n7\n\u00a0\n\n[358 \nU.S. 415, 419]\n\u00a0\n\n\nII. We held in Prince v. United States, supra, that the crime of entry into a bank with intent to rob was not intended by Congress to be a separate offense from the consummated robbery. We ruled that entering with intent to steal, which is \"the heart of the crime,\" id., at 328, \"merges into the completed crime if the robbery is consummated.\" Ibid. We gave the Act that construction because we resolve an ambiguity in favor of lenity when required to determine the intent of Congress in punishing multiple aspects of the same criminal act.\n\nSubsection (c) of 2113, with which we are now primarily concerned, came into the law in 1940. The legislative history is meagre. The Senate Report (S. Rep. No. 1801, 76th Cong., 3d Sess.) is captioned \"Punishment for Receivers of Loot From Bank Robbers.\" The Report states, \"This bill would add another subsection to further make it a crime, with less severe penalties (maximum $5,000 fine and 10 years imprisonment, or both) to willfully become a receiver or possessor of property taken in violation of the statute,\" p. 1. Similarly the House Report states \"Present law does not make it a separate substantive offense knowingly to receive or possess property stolen from a bank in violation of the Federal Bank Robbery Act, and this bill is designed to cover the omission.\" H. R. Rep. No. 1668, 76th Cong., 3d Sess., p. 1.\n\nThis clue to the purpose of Congress argues strongly against the position of the Government. From these Reports it seems clear that subsection (c) was not designed to increase the punishment for him who robs a bank but only to provide punishment for those who receive the loot from the robber. We find no purpose of Congress to pyramid penalties for lesser offenses following the robbery. It may be true that in logic those who divide up the loot following a robbery receive from robbers and thus multiply the offense. But in view of the legislative history \n\n[358 \nU.S. 415, 420]\n\u00a0\n of subsection (c) we think Congress was trying to reach a new group of wrongdoers, not to multiply the offense of the bank robbers themselves.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This subsection provides:\n\n\"Whoever, in committing, or in attempting to commit, any offense defined in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, assaults any person, or puts in jeopardy the life of any person by the use of a dangerous weapon or device, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than twenty-five years, or both.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] This subsection states:\n\n\"Whoever receives, possesses, conceals, stores, barters, sells, or disposes of, any property or money or other thing of value knowing the same to have been taken from a bank, or a savings and loan association, in violation of subsection (b) of this section shall be subject to the punishment provided by said subsection (b) for the taker.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] This was a corrected sentence imposed after the appeal, as reported in Heflin v. United States, 223 F.2d 371.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Section 2255 reads in relevant part as follows:\n\n\"A prisoner in custody under sentence of a court established by Act of Congress claiming the right to be released upon the ground \n\n[358 \nU.S. 415, 417]\n\u00a0\n that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack, may move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence.\n\n\n\"A motion for such relief may be made at any time.\n\n\n\"Unless the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief, the court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon the United States attorney, grant a prompt hearing thereon, determine the issues and make findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect thereto. If the court finds that the judgment was rendered without jurisdiction, or that the sentence imposed was not authorized by law or otherwise open to collateral attack, or that there has been such a denial or infringement of the constitutional rights of the prisoner as to render the judgment vulnerable to collateral attack, the court shall vacate and set the judgment aside and shall discharge the prisoner or resentence him or grant a new trial or correct the sentence as may appear appropriate.\n\n\n\"A court may entertain and determine such motion without requiring the production of the prisoner at the hearing. . . .\" 62 Stat. 967, amended 63 Stat. 105.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] United States v. Bradford, 194 F.2d 197; United States v. McGann, 245 F.2d 670; United States ex rel. Bogish v. Tees, 211 F.2d 69, 71; Fooshee v. United States, 203 F.2d 247; Duggins v. United States, 240 F.2d 479; Crow v. United States, 186 F.2d 704; Oughton v. United States, 215 F.2d 578; Hoffman v. United States, 244 F.2d 378; Miller v. United States, 256 F.2d 501.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Rule 35 provides in part:\n\n\"The court may correct an illegal sentence at any time.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Since the motion under Rule 35 is made in the original case, the time within which review by certiorari of the Court of Appeals decision should be sought is 30 days. Supreme Court Rule 22 (2). The petition for writ of certiorari in this case was not filed until after the passage of 30 days from the judgment below. Nevertheless, because successive motions may be made under Rule 35 and because no jurisdictional statute is involved, the majority agrees to dispense with the requirements of our Rule in order to avoid wasteful circuity. To those of us who deem that 2255 is available, there is no question but that the petition was in time. It was filed within the 90-day period provided by 28 U.S.C. 2101 (c) governing this type of suit. For a motion under 2255, like a petition for a writ of habeas corpus (Riddle v. Dyche, \n262 \nU.S. 333, 336\n), is not a proceeding in the original criminal prosecution but an independent civil suit.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART, whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, MR. JUSTICE CLARK, MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, and MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER join, concurring.\n\nWhile joining the Court's opinion, I think it clear that a motion for relief under 28 U.S.C. 2255 is available only to attack a sentence under which a prisoner is in custody. That is what the statute says. That is what the legislative history shows. That is what federal courts, faced almost daily with the statute's application, have unanimously concluded. Personal notions as to the kind of a post-conviction statute that Congress might have enacted or should enact are, of course, entirely irrelevant to the inquiry.\n\nFirst. The words which Congress has used are not ambiguous. Section 2255 provides that: \"A prisoner in custody under sentence . . . claiming the right to be released . . . may move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence.\" The statute further provides: \"A motion for such relief may be made at any time.\" This latter provision simply means that, as in habeas corpus, there is no statute of limitations, no res judicata, and that the doctrine of laches is inapplicable.\n\nSecond. The legislative history of 2255 is reviewed at length in the opinion which Mr. Chief Justice Vinson wrote for the Court in United States v. Hayman, \n342 \nU.S. 205\n. No chronicle of the genesis and purpose of a legislative enactment could be more authentic, because almost the entire legislative history is to be found in the deliberations and recommendations of the Judicial Conference \n\n[358 \nU.S. 415, 421]\n\u00a0\n of the United States, over which Mr. Chief Justice Vinson then presided. The opinion in Hayman clearly shows that \"the sole purpose\" of the statute \"was to minimize the difficulties encountered in habeas corpus hearings by affording the same rights in another and more convenient forum.\" \n342 \nU.S., at 219\n. Those difficulties are detailed in the opinion. There is not one word to indicate any intent to alter the basic principle of habeas corpus that relief is available only to one entitled to be released from custody.\n\nThe very office of the Great Writ, its only function, is to inquire into the legality of the detention of one in custody. It is unnecessary to paraphrase here Mr. Justice Stone's penetrating discussion in McNally v. Hill, \n293 \nU.S. 131\n, or to incorporate the thorough review of legal history there contained. It will suffice to note only the Court's conclusion: \"Without restraint of liberty, the writ will not issue. Equally, without restraint which is unlawful, the writ may not be used. A sentence which the prisoner has not begun to serve cannot be the cause of restraint which the statute makes the subject of inquiry.\" (Citations omitted.) \n293 \nU.S., at 138\n.\n\nThird. It is something of an understatement simply to say that these views are \"shared by several Courts of Appeals.\" So far as I have been able to find, these courts, at least since the Hayman decision, have been unanimous in holding that a motion under 2255 may be filed only by a prisoner claiming the right to be released. These are the courts continually faced with problems arising under 2255, and many of them have given careful consideration to this very issue. United States v. Bradford, 194 F.2d 197 (C. A. 2d Cir.); United States v. McGann, 245 F.2d 670 (C. A. 2d Cir.); United States ex rel. Bogish v. Tees, 211 F.2d 69, 71 (C. A. 3d Cir.); Fooshee v. United States, 203 F.2d 247 (C. A. 5th Cir.); Duggins v. United \n\n[358 \nU.S. 415, 422]\n\u00a0\n States, 240 F.2d 479 (C. A. 6th Cir.); Juelich v. United States, 257 F.2d 424 (C. A. 6th Cir.); Oughton v. United States, 215 F.2d 578 (C. A. 9th Cir.); Williams v. United States, 236 F.2d 894 (C. A. 9th Cir.); Hoffman v. United States, 244 F.2d 378 (C. A. 9th Cir.); Toliver v. United States, 249 F.2d 804 (C. A. 9th Cir.); Miller v. United States, 256 F.2d 501 (C. A. 9th Cir.); Smith v. United States, 259 F.2d 125 (C. A. 9th Cir.).\n\nAlthough believing that relief in this case was not available under 2255, I think, and indeed the Government concedes, that relief was available to the petitioner by virtue of Rule 35 of the Fed. Rules Crim. Proc. That rule provides: \"The court may correct an illegal sentence at any time.\" The rule became effective more than two years before the enactment of 2255 and has an entirely different history. It was a codification of existing law and was intended to remove any doubt created by the decision in United States v. Mayer, \n235 \nU.S. 55, 67\n, as to the jurisdiction of a District Court to correct an illegal sentence after the expiration of the term at which it was entered.\n*\n\u00a0\n\nWhether Rule 35 covers the broader field of collateral attack where a hearing to consider matters dehors the record is necessary, we need not here determine. The Rule certainly covers a case like the present one where the claim is that the sentence imposed was illegal on its face. For this reason, and because I agree with the Court's construction of the Federal Bank Robbery Act, I concur in the opinion and the judgment.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] See Judge Shackelford Miller's discussion of the relationship between 2255 and Rule 35 in Duggins v. United States, 240 F.2d 479 (C. A. 6th Cir.). \n\n[358 \nU.S. 415, 423]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","74":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHENRY v. UNITED STATES(1959)\nNo. 17\nArgued: Decided: November 23, 1959\n\n\n\n\n Without a warrant for search or arrest, federal officers who were investigating a theft from an interstate shipment of whiskey twice observed cartons being placed in a motorcar in a residential district, followed and stopped the car, arrested petitioner and another man who were in it, searched the car, and found and seized cartons containing radios stolen from an interstate shipment. At petitioner's trial for unlawfully possessing radios stolen from an interstate shipment, his timely motion to suppress the evidence so seized was overruled and he was convicted. Held: On the record in this case, the officers did not have probable cause for the arrest when they stopped the car; the search was illegal; the articles seized were not admissible in evidence; and the conviction is reversed. Pp. 98-104.\n\n 259 F.2d 725, reversed.\n\nEdward J. Calihan, Jr. argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner.\n\nKirby W. Patterson argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Wilkey and Beatrice Rosenberg.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner stands convicted of unlawfully possessing three cartons of radios valued at more than $100 which had been stolen from an interstate shipment. See 18 U.S.C. 659. The issue in the case is whether there was probable cause for the arrest leading to the search that produced the evidence on which the conviction rests. A timely motion to suppress the evidence was made by \n\n[361 \nU.S. 98, 99]\n\u00a0\n petitioner and overruled by the District Court; and the judgment of conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeals on a divided vote. 259 F.2d 725. The case is here on a petition for a writ of certiorari, \n359 \nU.S. 904\n.\n\nThere was a theft from an interstate shipment of whisky at a terminal in Chicago. The next day two FBI agents were in the neighborhood investigating it. They saw petitioner and one Pierotti walk across a street from a tavern and get into an automobile. The agents had been given, by the employer of Pierotti, information of an undisclosed nature \"concerning the implication of the defendant Pierotti with interstate shipments.\" But, so far as the record shows, he never went so far as to tell the agents he suspected Pierotti of any such thefts. The agents followed the car and saw it enter an alley and stop. Petitioner got out of the car, entered a gangway leading to residential premises and returned in a few minutes with some cartons. He placed them in the car and he and Pierotti drove off. The agents were unable to follow the car. But later they found it parked at the same place near the tavern. Shortly they saw petitioner and Pierotti leave the tavern, get into the car, and drive off. The car stopped in the same alley as before; petitioner entered the same gangway and returned with more cartons. The agents observed this transaction from a distance of some 300 feet and could not determine the size, number or contents of the cartons. As the car drove off the agents followed it and finally, when they met it, waved it to a stop. As he got out of the car, petitioner was heard to say, \"Hold it; it is the G's.\" This was followed by, \"Tell him he [you] just picked me up.\" The agents searched the car, placed the cartons (which bore the name \"Admiral\" and were addressed to an out-of-state company) in their car, took the merchandise and petitioner and Pierotti to their office and held them for about two hours when the agents learned that the cartons contained \n\n[361 \nU.S. 98, 100]\n\u00a0\n stolen radios. They then placed the men under formal arrest.\n\nThe statutory authority of FBI officers and agents to make felony arrests without a warrant is restricted to offenses committed \"in their presence\" or to instances where they have \"reasonable grounds to believe that the person to be arrested has committed or is committing\" a felony. 18 U.S.C. 3052. The statute states the constitutional standard, for it is the command of the Fourth Amendment that no warrants for either searches or arrests shall issue except \"upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\"\n\nThe requirement of probable cause has roots that are deep in our history. The general warrant,\n1\n in which the name of the person to be arrested was left blank, and the writs of assistance, against which James Otis inveighed,\n2\n both perpetuated the oppressive practice of allowing the police to arrest and search on suspicion. Police control took the place of judicial control, since no showing of \"probable cause\" before a magistrate was required. The Virginia Declaration of Rights, adopted June 12, 1776, rebelled against that practice:\n\n \"That general warrants, whereby any officer or messenger may be commanded to search suspected places without evidence of a fact committed, or to seize any person or persons not named, or whose offence is not particularly described and supported by evidence, are grievous and oppressive, and ought not to be granted.\" \n\n[361 \nU.S. 98, 101]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The Maryland Declaration of Rights (1776), Art. XXIII, was equally emphatic:\n\n\"That all warrants, without oath or affirmation, to search suspected places, or to seize any person or property, are grievous and oppressive; and all general warrants - to search suspected places, or to apprehend suspected persons, without naming or describing the place, or the person in special - are illegal, and ought not to be granted.\"\n\n\n And see North Carolina Declaration of Rights (1776), Art. XI; Pennsylvania Constitution (1776), Art. X; Massachusetts Constitution (1780), Pt. I, Art. XIV.\n\nThat philosophy later was reflected in the Fourth Amendment. And as the early American decisions both before\n3\n and immediately after\n4\n its adoption show, common rumor or report, suspicion, or even \"strong reason to suspect\"\n5\n was not adequate to support a warrant for arrest. And that principle has survived to this day. See United States v. Di Re, \n332 \nU.S. 581, 593\n-595; Johnson v. United States, \n333 \nU.S. 10, 13\n-15; Giordenello v. United States, \n357 \nU.S. 480, 486\n. Its high water was Johnson v. United States, supra, where the smell of opium coming from a closed room was not enough to support an arrest and search without a warrant. It was against this background that two scholars recently wrote, \"Arrest on mere suspicion collides violently with the basic human right of liberty.\"\n6\n\u00a0\n\n[361 \nU.S. 98, 102]\n\u00a0\n\n\nEvidence required to establish guilt is not necessary. Brinegar v. United States, \n338 \nU.S. 160\n; Draper v. United States, \n358 \nU.S. 307\n. On the other hand, good faith on the part of the arresting officers is not enough. Probable cause exists if the facts and circumstances known to the officer warrant a prudent man in believing that the offense has been committed. Stacey v. Emery, \n97 \nU.S. 642, 645\n. And see Director General v. Kastenbaum, \n263 \nU.S. 25, 28\n; United States v. Di Re, supra, at 592; Giordenello v. United States, supra, at 486. It is important, we think, that this requirement be strictly enforced, for the standard set by the Constitution protects both the officer and the citizen. If the officer acts with probable cause, he is protected even though it turns out that the citizen is innocent. Carroll v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 132, 156\n. And while a search without a warrant is, within limits, permissible if incident to a lawful arrest, if an arrest without a warrant is to support an incidental search, it must be made with probable cause. Carroll v. United States, supra, at 155-156. This immunity of officers cannot fairly be enlarged without jeopardizing the privacy or security of the citizen. We turn then to the question whether prudent men in the shoes of these officers (Brinegar v. United States, supra, at 175) would have seen enough to permit them to believe that petitioner was violating or had violated the law. We think not. \n\n[361 \nU.S. 98, 103]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe prosecution conceded below, and adheres to the concession here,\n7\n that the arrest took place when the federal agents stopped the car. That is our view on the facts of this particular case. When the officers interrupted the two men and restricted their liberty of movement, the arrest, for purposes of this case, was complete. It is, therefore, necessary to determine whether at or before that time they had reasonable cause to believe that a crime had been committed. The fact that afterwards contraband was discovered is not enough. An arrest is not justified by what the subsequent search discloses, as Johnson v. United States, supra, holds.\n\nIt is true that a federal crime had been committed at a terminal in the neighborhood, whisky having been stolen from an interstate shipment. Petitioner's friend, Pierotti, had been suspected of some implication in some interstate shipments, as we have said. But as this record stands, what those shipments were and the manner in which he was implicated remain unexplained and undefined. The rumor about him is therefore practically meaningless. On the record there was far from enough evidence against him to justify a magistrate in issuing a warrant. So far as the record shows, petitioner had not even been suspected of criminal activity prior to this time. Riding in the car, stopping in an alley, picking up packages, driving away - these were all acts that were outwardly innocent. Their movements in the car had no mark of fleeing men or men acting furtively. The case might be different if the packages had been taken from a terminal or from an interstate trucking platform. But they were not. As we have said, the alley where the packages were picked up was in a residential section. \n\n[361 \nU.S. 98, 104]\n\u00a0\n The fact that packages have been stolen does not make every man who carries a package subject to arrest nor the package subject to seizure. The police must have reasonable grounds to believe that the particular package carried by the citizen is contraband. Its shape and design might at times be adequate. The weight of it and the manner in which it is carried might at times be enough. But there was nothing to indicate that the cartons here in issue probably contained liquor. The fact that they contained other contraband appeared only some hours after the arrest. What transpired at or after the time the car was stopped by the officers is, as we have said, irrelevant to the narrow issue before us. To repeat, an arrest is not justified by what the subsequent search discloses. Under our system suspicion is not enough for an officer to lay hands on a citizen. It is better, so the Fourth Amendment teaches, that the guilty sometimes go free than that citizens be subject to easy arrest.\n\nThe fact that the suspects were in an automobile is not enough. Carroll v. United States, supra, liberalized the rule governing searches when a moving vehicle is involved. But that decision merely relaxed the requirements for a warrant on grounds of practicality. It did not dispense with the need for probable cause.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BLACK concurs in the result.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Declared illegal by the House of Commons in 1766. 16 Hansard, Parl.

The report states that 111,274 were arrested on suspicion (but not in connection with any specific offense) and subsequently released without prosecution. This was at the rate of 280.4 per 100,000 inhabitants. The grand total of persons arrested - both for a specific offense (but excluding traffic offenses) and on suspicion alone - and released without being held for prosecution was 264,601. This was at the rate of 666.7 per 100,000 inhabitants.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] An alternative theory that the arrest took place at a subsequent time was discussed by the Government only to make clear that it would press that position on the facts of another case now pending here, No. 52, Rios v. United States.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK, whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, dissenting.\n\nThe Court decides this case on the narrow ground that the arrest took place at the moment the Federal Bureau of Investigation agents stopped the car in which petitioner was riding and at that time probable cause for it did not exist. While the Government, unnecessarily it seems to me, conceded that the arrest was made at the \n\n[361 \nU.S. 98, 105]\n\u00a0\n time the car was stopped, this Court is not bound by the Government's mistakes.\n*\n\u00a0\n\nThe record shows beyond dispute that the agents had received information from co-defendant Pierotti's employer implicating Pierotti with interstate shipments. The agents began a surveillance of petitioner and Pierotti after recognizing them as they came out of a bar. Later the agents observed them loading cartons into an automobile from a gangway up an alley in Chicago. The agents had been trailing them, and after it appeared that they had delivered the first load of cartons, the suspects returned to the same platform by a circuitous route through streets and alleys. The agents then saw petitioner load another set of cartons into the car and drive off with the same. A few minutes later the agents stopped the car, alighted from their own car, and approached the petitioner. As they did so, petitioner was overheard to say: \"Hold it; it is the G's,\" and \"Tell him he [you] just picked me up.\" Since the agents had actually seen the two suspects together for several hours, it was apparent to them that the statement was untrue. Upon being questioned, the defendants stated that they had borrowed the car from a friend. During the questioning and after petitioner had stepped out of the car one of the agents happened to look through the door of the car which petitioner had left open and saw three cartons stacked up inside which resembled those petitioner had just loaded into the car from the gangway. The agent saw that the cartons bore Admiral shipping labels and were addressed to a company in Cincinnati, Ohio. Upon further questioning, the agent was told that the cartons \n\n[361 \nU.S. 98, 106]\n\u00a0\n were in the car when the defendants borrowed it. Knowing this to be untrue, the agents then searched the car, arrested petitioner and his companion, and seized the cartons.\n\nThe Court seems to say that the mere stopping of the car amounted to an arrest of the petitioner. I cannot agree. The suspicious activities of the petitioner during the somewhat prolonged surveillance by the agents warranted the stopping of the car. The sighting of the cartons with their interstate labels in the car gave the agents reasonable ground to believe that a crime was in the course of its commission in their very presence. The search of the car and the subsequent arrest were therefore lawful and the motion to suppress was properly overruled.\n\nIn my view, the time at which the agents were required to have reasonable grounds to believe that petitioner was committing a felony was when they began the search of the automobile, which was after they had seen the cartons with interstate labels in the car. The earlier events certainly disclosed ample grounds to justify the following of the car, the subsequent stopping thereof, and the questioning of petitioner by the agents. This interrogation, together with the sighting of the cartons and the labels, gave the agents indisputable probable cause for the search and arrest.\n\nWhen an investigation proceeds to the point where an agent has reasonable grounds to believe that an offense is being committed in his presence, he is obligated to proceed to make such searches, seizures, and arrests as the circumstances require. It is only by such alertness that crime is discovered, interrupted, prevented, and punished. We should not place additional burdens on law enforcement agencies.\n\nI would affirm the judgments on the rationale of Brinegar v. United States, \n338 \nU.S. 160\n (1949), and Carroll v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 132\n (1925).\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] It may be that the Government is doing some wishful thinking in regard to the relaxation of the standards incident to the \"probable cause\" requirement by making this a test case. We should not lend ourselves to such indulgence. \n\n[361 \nU.S. 98, 107]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","75":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHERD & CO. v.

JUSTICE WHITTAKER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe question presented by this case is whether the provisions of 4 (5) of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (46 U.S.C. 1304 (5)) or the parallel provisions of an ocean bill of lading, limiting the liability of an ocean \"carrier\" to a shipper to $500 per package of cargo, also apply to and likewise limit the liability of a negligent stevedore.\n\nRespondents, having sold and agreed to deliver certain goods to a Spanish company, arranged for their ocean carriage on the S. S. Castillo Ampudia from Baltimore, Maryland, to Valencia, Spain. The goods, consisting of 62 cases, were transported from Detroit by flatcar to a point on the Baltimore pier alongside the S. S. Castillo Ampudia and were there taken in charge by her agent for loading and shipment. A bill of lading was prepared by respondents, on forms of the carrier, and was submitted to and signed by an agent of the carrier. The value of the goods was not declared by respondents or inserted in the bill of lading.\n\nPetitioner, an independent stevedoring company, was orally engaged by the carrier to load the cargo aboard the ship, and while endeavoring to load one of the cases, containing a press weighing 19 tons, petitioner's employees caused it to fall into the harbor and to be extensively damaged. Respondents then brought this tort action in the United States District Court against petitioner to recover their damages which they alleged had been caused by petitioner's negligence. Petitioner's answer denied the allegations of negligence, and asserted, alternatively, that if the damage was caused by its negligence its liability was limited to $500 by the limitation-of-liability provisions of the Carriage of Goods \n\n[359 \nU.S. 297, 299]\n\u00a0\n by Sea Act\n1\n and by the parallel provisions of the bill of lading.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nAfter trial, the District Court held that the damage to the press was caused by petitioner's negligence; that the limitation-of-liability provisions of the bill of lading were, in express terms, applicable only to the carrier, and did not apply to nor limit the liability of the stevedore;\n3\n and that \n\n[359 \nU.S. 297, 300]\n\u00a0\n respondents were entitled to recover the full amount of their damages from petitioner (145 F. Supp. 554). It accordingly rendered judgment for respondents in the amount of $47,992.04 (155 F. Supp. 296). On appeal, the Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed on the question here presented. 256 F.2d 946. It held that neither the limitation-of-liability provisions of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act\n4\n (Note 1) nor of the bill of lading (Note 2) were applicable to, or limited the liability of, the stevedoring company, and that it was therefore liable for the full damage caused by its negligence. The court expressly disagreed with and declined to follow the majority opinion of the Fifth Circuit in A. M. Collins & Co. v. Panama R. Co., 197 F.2d 893, saying that it thought the dissenting opinion in that case presented the correct view. The question being of importance to the shipping industry, we granted certiorari to resolve this conflict. \n358 \nU.S. 812\n.\n\nPetitioner's contentions are twofold. First, it contends that the liability-limiting provisions of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act and of the bill of lading should be construed to limit its liability as well as that of the carrier. Second, it contends that even if it be held that those provisions limit only the liability of the \"carrier,\" it is nevertheless protected by the carrier's limitation under the theory and holding of the majority opinion in the Collins case. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 297, 301]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWith regard to petitioner's first contention, we look first to the provisions, legislative history and environment of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 46 U.S.C. 1300-1315, and next to the limiting provisions of the bill of lading, to determine whether Congress by the Act, or the shippers and the carrier by the bill of lading, evidenced any intention to limit the liability of negligent agents of a carrier.\n\nThe Act is clearly phrased. It defines the term \"carrier\" to include \"the owner or the charterer who enters into a contract of carriage with the shipper.\" 1301 (a). It imposes particularized duties and obligations upon, and grants stated immunities to, the \"carrier.\" 1302, 1303, 1304. Respecting limitation of the amount of liability for loss of or damage to goods, it says that \"neither the carrier nor the ship\" shall be liable for more than $500 per package. 1304 (5). It makes no reference whatever to stevedores or agents. The legislative history of the Act shows that it was lifted almost bodily from the Hague Rules of 1921, as amended by the Brussels Convention of 1924, 51 Stat. 233.\n5\n The effort of those Rules was to establish uniform ocean bills of lading to govern the rights and liabilities of carriers and shippers inter se in international trade. Ibid. Those Rules do not advert to stevedores or agents of a carrier. The debates and Committee Reports in the Senate and the House upon the bill that became the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act likewise do not mention stevedores or agents.\n6\n There is, thus, nothing in the language, the legislative history \n\n[359 \nU.S. 297, 302]\n\u00a0\n or environment of the Act that expressly or impliedly indicates any intention of Congress to regulate stevedores or other agents of a carrier, or to limit the amount of their liability for damages caused by their negligence. It must be assumed that Congress knew that generally agents are liable for all damages caused by their negligence. Yet Congress, while limiting the amount of liability of \"the carrier [and] the ship,\" did not even refer to stevedores or agents of a carrier. \"We can only conclude that if Congress had intended to make such an inroad on the rights of claimants [against negligent agents] it would have said so in unambiguous terms\" and \"in the absence of a clear Congressional policy to that end, we cannot go so far.\" Brady v. Roosevelt S. S. Co., \n317 \nU.S. 575, 581\n, 584.\n\nLooking to the limitation-of-liability provisions of the bill of lading, we see that they, like 1304 (5) of the Act and its legislative history, do not advert to stevedores or agents. Instead they deal only with the \"Carrier's liability\" to the shippers. They say that \"the Carrier's liability, if any, shall be determined on the basis of $500 per package.\" There is, thus, nothing in those provisions to indicate that the contracting parties intended to limit the liability of stevedores or other agents of the carrier for damages caused by their negligence. If such had been a purpose of the contracting parties it must be presumed that they would in some way have expressed it in the contract. Since they did not do so, it follows that the provisions of the bill of lading did \"not cut off [respondent's] remedy against the agent that did the wrongful act.\" Sloan Shipyards Corp. v. Emergency Fleet Corp., \n258 \nU.S. 549, 568\n.\n\nWe therefore conclude that there is nothing in the provisions, legislative history and environment of the Act, or in the limitation-of-liability provisions of the bill of lading, to indicate any intention, of Congress by the Act, \n\n[359 \nU.S. 297, 303]\n\u00a0\n or of the contracting parties by the bill of lading, to limit the liability of negligent agents of the carrier.\n\nWe now turn to petitioner's second contention that even if, as we hold, the Act and the bill of lading granted limitation of liability only to the \"carrier,\" petitioner is nevertheless protected by the carrier's limitation under the theory and holding of the majority opinion in the Collins case. The premise of the majority opinion in that case is that all agents of the carrier who perform any part of the work undertaken by the carrier in the contract of carriage, evidenced by the bill of lading, are, by reason of that fact alone, protected by the provisions of the contract limiting the liability of the carrier, though such agents are not parties to nor express beneficiaries of the contract. Applying that theory in accordingly limiting the liability of a negligent stevedore, the majority said:\n\n\"A stevedore so unloading, in every practical sense, does so by virtue of the bill of lading and, though not strictly speaking a party thereto, is, while liable as an agent for its own negligence, at the same time entitled to claim the limitation of liability provided by the bill of lading to the furtherance of the terms of which its operations are directed,\" 197 F.2d, at 896.\n\n\n We are unable to agree with that conclusion, for we think it runs counter to a long-settled line of decisions of this Court. From its early history this Court has consistently held that an agent is liable for all damages caused by his negligence, unless exonerated therefrom, in whole or in part, by a statute or a valid contract binding on the person damaged. In Osborn v. Bank of the United States, 9 Wheat. 738, 843, it was said that an agent \"is responsible for his own act, to the full extent of the injury [caused thereby].\" In Reid v. Fargo, \n241 \nU.S. 544\n, this Court held, on facts very similar to those \n\n[359 \nU.S. 297, 304]\n\u00a0\n here, that, though the carrier's liability was limited by the bill of lading to $100, the negligent agent, a stevedoring company, was liable to the shipper for the full amount of damage caused by its negligence.\n7\n In Sloan Shipyards Corp. v. Emergency Fleet Corp., \n258 \nU.S., at 567\n, it was said that an \"agent, because he is agent, does not cease to be answerable for his acts.\" In Brady v. Roosevelt S. S. Co., \n317 \nU.S., at 580\n-581, this Court said that \"The liability of an agent for his own negligence has long been embedded in the law,\" that \"withdrawal of the right to sue the agent for his torts would result at times in a substantial dilution of the rights of claimants,\" and that withdrawal of that right would be \"such a basic change in one of the fundamentals of the law of agency [as] should hardly be left to conjecture.\" This Court has several times held that an agent's only shield from liability \"for conduct harmful to the plaintiff . . . is a constitutional rule of law that exonerates him.\" Sloan Shipyards Corp. v. Emergency Fleet Corp., \n258 \nU.S., at 567\n; Brady v. Roosevelt S. S. Co., \n317 \nU.S., at 584\n. Any such rule of law, being in derogation of the common law, must be strictly construed, for \"[n]o statute is to be construed as altering the common law, farther than its words import. It is not to be construed as making any innovation \n\n[359 \nU.S. 297, 305]\n\u00a0\n upon the common law which it does not fairly express.\" Shaw v. Railroad Co., \n101 \nU.S. 557, 565\n; see Texas & Pacific R. Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., \n204 \nU.S. 426, 437\n. Similarly, contracts purporting to grant immunity from, or limitation of, liability must be strictly construed and limited to intended beneficiaries, for they \"are not to be applied to alter familiar rules visiting liability upon a tortfeasor for the consequences of his negligence, unless the clarity of the language used expresses such to be the understanding of the contracting parties.\" Boston Metals Co. v. The Winding Gulf, \n349 \nU.S. 122, 123\n-124 (concurring opinion).\n\nThe holding of the majority in Collins that the liability of a negligent agent of a carrier, though not limited by any statute or contract, is nevertheless limited by and to the extent of the limitation granted by the shipper to the carrier in the bill of lading, simply because the agent is performing some part of the work thereby undertaken by the carrier, is clearly contrary to the above-cited decisions of this Court.\n8\n\u00a0\n\n[359 \nU.S. 297, 306]\n\u00a0\n\n\nPetitioner claims that its position is supported by the decision of the House of Lords in Elder, Dempster & Co., Ltd., v. Paterson, Zochonis & Co., Ltd., 1924. A. C. 522, 18 Ll. L. Rep. 319. There, Elder, Dempster & Co. had chartered a ship, on time charter, from the shipowners. The plaintiff company shipped a number of casks of palm oil by that ship from West African ports to England. The casks were crushed by other cargo negligently laid over them, and a large part of the oil was lost. The bill of lading contained a clause which, so far as here pertinent, provided that \"The shipowners . . . shall not be liable . . . for . . . any damage arising from . . . stowage. . . .\" The plaintiff company sued both the charterer \n\n[359 \nU.S. 297, 307]\n\u00a0\n and the shipowners. The principal question was whether the damage was caused by unseaworthiness (which was not within the exemption clause) or by bad stowage (which was within that clause). The House of Lords decided that the loss was due to bad stowage and held, but for differing reasons, that the exemption clause applied to and protected both the charterer and the shipowners.\n\nA careful reading of the several lengthy opinions of their lordships in that case discloses that the question whether a provision in the bill of lading limiting the liability of the carrier likewise limits the liability of its negligent agent, though the agent is neither a party to nor an express beneficiary of the bill of lading, was not involved in or decided by that case. Nor has any English case ever held that a bill of lading that expressly limits the liability of only the carrier nevertheless applies to and limits the liability of its negligent agent. See Scrutton, Charterparties (16th ed. 1955), 286-287, note (g). It is true that in Gilbert Stokes & Kerr, Prop., Ltd., v. Dalgety & Co., Ltd., 81 Ll. L. Rep. 337 (1948), and Waters Trading Co., Ltd., v. Dalgety & Co., Ltd., 1951. 2 Ll. L. Rep. 385, the Supreme Court of New South Wales held that stevedores, who negligently performed a part of the work undertaken by the carrier in the bill of lading, were entitled to the limitation of liability given to the carrier by the limiting provisions of the bill of lading, though the stevedores were neither parties to nor express beneficiaries of the bill of lading. However, in Wilson v. Darling Island Stevedoring & Lighterage Co., Ltd., 1956. 1 Ll. L. Rep. 346, 1956. Argus Law Rep. 311, 29 Austral. L. J. 740 - an appeal involving facts indistinguishable from those involved in the two New South Wales cases, which was prosecuted for the avowed purpose of challenging the correctness of those decisions - the High Court of Australia, after extensively reviewing the Elder, Dempster \n\n[359 \nU.S. 297, 308]\n\u00a0\n case and many other English decisions, found that there was no English case that supported the two New South Wales decisions mentioned, and it held that they were wrongly decided and overruled them, saying:\n\n\"The stevedore is a complete stranger to the contract of carriage, and it is no concern of his whether there is a bill of lading or not, or, if there is, what are its terms. He is engaged by the shipowner and by nobody else, and the terms on which he handles the goods are to be found in his contract with the shipowner and nowhere else. The shipowner has no authority whatever to bind the shipper or consignee of cargo by contract with the stevedore, and there is, in my opinion, no principle of law - deducible from the Elder Dempster Case or from any other case - which compels the inference of any contract between the shipper or consignee and the stevedore. If the stevedore negligently soaks cargo with water and ruins it, I can find neither rule of law nor contract to save him from the normal consequences of his tort.\" Opinion of Fullager, J., 29 Austral. L. J., at 751.\n\n\n Under the common law as declared by this Court, petitioner was liable for all damages caused by its negligence unless exonerated therefrom, in whole or in part, by a constitutional rule of law. No statute has limited its liability, and it was not a party to nor a beneficiary of the contract of carriage between the shipper and the carrier, and hence its liability was not limited by that contract. It follows that petitioner's common-law liability for damages caused by its negligence was in no way limited, and the judgment below so holding was correct and must be\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The limitation-of-liability provisions of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act appear in 46 U.S.C. 1304 (5), which, so far as pertinent, provides:\n\n(5) \"Neither the carrier nor the ship shall in any event be or become liable for any loss or damage to or in connection with the transportation of goods in an amount exceeding $500 per package lawful money of the United States . . . unless the nature and value of such goods have been declared by the shipper before shipment and inserted in the bill of lading.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The parallel limitation-of-liability provisions contained in the bill of lading are found in 30 and 37 thereof which, so far as pertinent, provide:\n\n\"30. In consideration of a choice of freight rates having been offered to the shipper by the Carrier, it is agreed that in case of loss of, or damage to . . . goods of an actual value exceeding $500 . . . per package . . . the value of such goods, shall be deemed to be $500 per package . . . and the Carrier's liability, if any, shall be determined on the basis of a value of $500 per package . . . unless the nature of such goods and a value higher than $500 per package . . . shall have been declared in writing by the shipper upon delivery to the Carrier and noted on the face hereof and unless payment of the extra freight charge incident thereto shall have been made or promised . . ., in which case such declared value, or the actual value if less, shall be the basis for computing damages and any partial loss or damage shall be adjusted pro rata. . . .\"\n\n\n\"37. This bill of lading shall have effect subject to the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act of the U.S. A. and the Carrier and the ship shall be entitled to all of the rights and immunities set forth in said Act.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 46 U.S.C. 1301 (e) provides: \"The term `carriage of goods' covers the period from the time when the goods are loaded on to the time when they are discharged from the ship.\" The district \n\n[359 \nU.S. 297, 300]\n\u00a0\n judge was of the view that the casualty occurred before the press had been \"loaded on\" the ship, and that therefore the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act was not applicable because its effective period had not begun.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The court held that inasmuch as nothing in the Act purports to limit the liability of a stevedore, there was no need to review the holding of the District Court that its effective period had not begun. See Note 3.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The Hague Rules as amended by the Brussels Convention were, in turn, based in part upon the pioneering Harter Act of 1893, 27 Stat. 445, 46 U.S.C. 190-196. See H. R. Rep. No. 2218, 74th Cong., 2d Sess. 7.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] S. Rep. No. 742, 74th Cong., 1st Sess.; H. R. Rep. No. 2218, 74th Cong., 2d Sess.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Though the Reid case involved very similar facts, we do not consider that it alone is dispositive of this case because it does not clearly enough appear that the negligent stevedore specifically raised, or that this Court actually decided, the question whether the negligent stevedore was entitled to invoke the limitation of liability given by the shipper to the carrier in the bill of lading. However, it would seem that there is some basis for respondents' argument that the members of the Bar understood that case to hold that the stevedore was not so entitled, for that principle does not appear to have been challenged in any reported American opinion during the 36 years between the decision of the Reid case in 1916 and the decision of the Collins case in 1952.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Apart from the disapproving opinions of the District Court (145 F. Supp. 554) and of the Court of Appeals (256 F.2d 946) in this case, the Collins case has been cited three times in the present context, twice approvingly and once disapprovingly, and seven times in somewhat different contexts.\n\nIt was first cited approvingly in Ford Motor Co. v. Jarka Corp., 134 N. Y. S. 2d 52 (Mun. Ct. of New York City), where the court, relying on Collins and two New South Wales cases, Waters Trading Co., Ltd., v. Dalgety & Co., Ltd., 1951. 2 Ll. L. Rep. 385, and Gilbert Stokes & Kerr, Prop., Ltd., v. Dalgety & Co., Ltd., 81 Ll. L. Rep. 337, held that a covenant in a bill of lading limiting the liability of the carrier to $500 per package likewise limited the liability of a negligent stevedoring company, which was not a party to nor an express beneficiary of the bill of lading. However the two New South Wales cases relied on by the court have recently been overruled by the High Court of Australia in Wilson v. Darling Island Stevedoring \n\n[359 \nU.S. 297, 306]\n\u00a0\n & Lighterage Co., Ltd., 1956. 1 Ll. L. Rep. 346, 1956. Argus Law Rep. 311, 29 Austral. L. J. 740.\n\nIt was next cited approvingly in Autobuses Modernos, S. A., v. The Federal Mariner, 125 F. Supp. 780 (D.C. E. D. Pa.). The court held, citing Collins, that a stevedoring company whose negligence in loading cargo joined with that of the carrier to cause damage to the cargo was entitled to the benefits of the $500 limitation given to the carrier in the bill of lading.\n\nIt was cited disapprovingly in International Milling Co. v. The Perseus, 1958. A. M. C. 526 (D.C. E. D. Mich.). The court held that the negligent master of a ship was not entitled to invoke the limitation of liability given by the shipper to the carrier in the contract of carriage, saying that it was \"unable to agree with the reasoning of the majority of the court in the Collins case.\" 1958. A. M. C., at 529.\n\nThe opinions in which the Collins ease has been cited in different contexts are United States v. The South Star, 210 F.2d 44 (C. A. 2d Cir.); J. B. Effenson Co. v.

LYONS(1959)\nNo. 57\nArgued: Decided: June 29, 1959\n\n\n\n\n While petitioner was a Captain in the Navy and Commander of the Boston Naval Shipyard, he withdrew recognition of the Federal Employees Veterans Association, of which respondents were officers, and sent an official report of his action, reciting his dissatisfaction with the activities of the Association, to the Chief of the Bureau of Ships and the Chief of Industrial Relations of the Department of the Navy. In accordance with the policy and usual practice of the Navy, he also sent copies of the report to the members of the Massachusetts congressional delegation. Respondents sued him in a Federal District Court for libel, alleging malice. In defense, he pleaded absolute privilege. Held:\n\n 1. The validity of petitioner's claim of absolute privilege in the performance of his duties as an officer of the Federal Government must be judged by federal standards, to be formulated by the courts in the absence of legislative action by Congress. P. 597.\n\n\n 2. On the record in this case, it appears that the sending of copies of the report to the Massachusetts congressional delegation, the only publication before this Court, was in the discharge of petitioner's official duties and in relation to matters committed to him for determination.

Dawson argued and reargued the cause, and filed a brief, for respondents. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 593, 594]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis is a companion case to Barr v. Matteo, ante, p. 564, decided today. Petitioner Howard in 1955 was a Captain in the United States Navy and Commander of the Boston Naval Shipyard. Respondent Lyons was National Commander of the Federal Employees Veterans Association, Inc., and respondent McAteer a local officer of that Association. Both respondents were at all material times civilian employees at the Boston Naval Shipyard, and for several years before September 8, 1955, the Association was recognized by the shipyard as an employees' representative group. On that date petitioner withdrew official recognition of the Association - an action which is not here challenged.\n\nRespondents brought suit in the Massachusetts District Court, invoking diversity jurisdiction, and making the following allegations: that on September 8, 1955, petitioner circulated a statement defaming them; that the statement purported to be an official memorandum to the Chief of the Bureau of Ships and the Chief of Navy Industrial Relations, but was released by petitioner \"outside of his official duties\" to various newspapers and wire services and to the members of the Massachusetts delegation in the Congress of the United States; that in circulating the statement petitioner acted \"maliciously, wilfully, wickedly, recklessly and falsely and with malice aforesight [sic]\"; and that the statement was intended to and did injure the reputation of respondents.\n\nA copy of the statement complained of was filed with the complaint. It is in the form of an official report directed to the Chief of the Bureau of Ships and the Chief of Industrial Relations of the Department of the Navy, reciting petitioner's dissatisfaction with the activities \n\n[360 \nU.S. 593, 595]\n\u00a0\n of the Federal Employees Veterans Association at the shipyard and announcing his intention to withdraw the recognition previously accorded it.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nPetitioner answered, stating that the statement complained of was in fact an official communication, and that in sending copies of it to the Massachusetts congressional delegation he was acting within the scope of his duties and pursuant to Department of the Navy policy; and denying that outside of his official duties he had released copies of the communication to the newspapers. He thereupon moved for summary judgment, attaching to the motion his own affidavit essentially repeating the statements from his answer above summarized, and an affidavit from the Commandant of the First Naval District. That affidavit stated that the Commandant was petitioner's commanding officer; that the making of reports to the Bureau of Ships relative to any significant personnel action at the shipyard was one of petitioner's official duties; that also among those duties was the furnishing of copies of such \n\n[360 \nU.S. 593, 596]\n\u00a0\n reports to the Massachusetts congressional delegation; and that the dissemination of the report of September 8, 1955, to the newspapers had been made through official channels and approved by the acting Commandant of the First Naval District.\n\nThe District Court granted summary judgment for petitioner, holding that the uncontradicted affidavits conclusively showed that the statement complained of was published by petitioner \"in the discharge of his official duties and in relation to matters committed to him for determination,\" and that it was therefore absolutely privileged. On respondents' appeal, the Court of Appeals held that the sending of the official report to petitioner's superior officers was protected by an absolute privilege, and noted that reliance on the dissemination to the newspapers had been abandoned by respondents on appeal in the face of petitioner's sworn statement that he had not been responsible for that publication. As to the publication to the Massachusetts congressional delegation, however, the court, one judge dissenting, refused to allow more than a qualified privilege, although recognizing that \"it is true that these members of Congress did have an official interest in being kept advised of important developments in labor relations at the Boston Naval Shipyard,\" and that \"the Commander of the Boston Naval Shipyard might have conceived it to be a proper exercise of his official functions to see to it that the members of Congress should receive copies of such official report . . . .\" Accordingly, it reversed the judgment of the District Court and remanded the case for trial. 250 F.2d 912.\n\nWe granted certiorari to consider petitioner's contention that the Court of Appeals had erred in failing to recognize his plea of absolute privilege in respect of the publication to members of Congress. \n357 \nU.S. 903\n. Respondents did not cross-petition for certiorari. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 593, 597]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAt the outset, we take note of a question which the Court of Appeals, on its view of the case, did not find it necessary to resolve - whether the extent of the privilege in respect of civil liability for statements allegedly defamatory under state law which may be claimed by officers of the Federal Government, acting in the course of their duties, is a question as to which the federal courts are bound to follow state law. We think that the very statement of the question dictates a negative answer. The authority of a federal officer to act derives from federal sources, and the rule which recognizes a privilege under appropriate circumstances as to statements made in the course of duty is one designed to promote the effective functioning of the Federal Government. No subject could be one of more peculiarly federal concern, and it would deny the very considerations which give the rule of privilege its being to leave determination of its extent to the vagaries of the laws of the several States. Cf. Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 363\n. We hold that the validity of petitioner's claim of absolute privilege must be judged by federal standards, to be formulated by the courts in the absence of legislative action by Congress.\n\nOur decision in Barr v. Matteo, ante, p. 564, governs this case. As has been observed, petitioner and his commanding officer both stated in uncontradicted affidavits that the sending of copies of the report here at issue to members of the Massachusetts congressional delegation was part of petitioner's official duties. Although of course such an averment by the defendant cannot foreclose the courts from examination of the question, we think that the affidavit of petitioner's commanding officer, and a Memorandum of Instructions issued by the Secretary of the Navy which petitioner has with our leave filed in this Court,\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[360 \nU.S. 593, 598]\n\u00a0\n plainly show that the District Court was correct in finding that the circulation of the report to the Massachusetts congressional delegation was \"in the discharge of [petitioner's] . . . official duties and in relation to matters committed to him for determination.\"\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BLACK concurs for the reasons stated in his concurring opinion in Barr v. Matteo, ante, p. 576.\n\n [For dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, see ante, p. 586.]\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] No purpose would be served by setting out the entire, lengthy report. It is adequately summarized in the Court of Appeals' opinion as follows:\n\n\"This letter alleged that plaintiff Lyons by name, and the other plaintiff by description, `exercise a predominant influence' in the organizational activities; that this organization has been giving wide distribution to a newsletter or bulletin; that this bulletin has become more and more unfairly critical of the shipyard administration, for the purpose of not only thwarting the aims of the shipyard administration in the accomplishment of its mission, but also to further personal aims and self-interests of the individuals in control of the labor organization; that these `editorial expletives' have adversely affected the general morale of employees of the shipyard, who are entitled to be protected against such `overt subversion' by any labor group `whose methods and whose motives are unethical, uninhibited, and lack the integrity of purpose that could reasonably be expected.'\" 250 F.2d 912, 913.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] SECNAV Instruction 5730.5, issued February 3, 1955, paragraph 12: \"Congressional Notification of Actions of Interest. Members of \n\n[360 \nU.S. 593, 598]\n\u00a0\n Congress are very anxious to keep in touch with what is going on in their respective states and districts. Navy agencies shall keep them advised, if possible in advance, of any new actions or curtailment of actions which may affect them.\"\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS joins, dissenting.\n\nI cannot agree that Captain Howard's action in sending a copy of his report to the Massachusetts Congressional Delegation was absolutely privileged.\n1\n In its argument in this case, the Government consistently distinguished this case from Barr v. Matteo, ante, p. 564, decided today, by characterizing Captain Howard as a man who was acting under strict orders and who had no discretion.\n\nUntil reargument in this Court, the only indications that it was mandatory for Captain Howard to report matters of this sort to Congress were the bald assertions to that effect in Captain Howard's affidavit and in the affidavit of his superior, Admiral Schnackenberg, in the District Court. No naval regulation was cited and no \n\n[360 \nU.S. 593, 599]\n\u00a0\n other authority was offered. It is significant that, in the same affidavit, when Captain Howard was explaining why he had transmitted copies of the report to a superior, he was able to cite chapter and verse of the U.S. Navy Public Information Manual as authority for that action.\n\nFor the first time on reargument in this Court, the Government produced the letter from the Secretary of the Navy referred to in the Court's opinion. The paragraph relied on is nothing more than a general policy statement applicable only to \"Navy agencies.\"\n2\n The letter was in no way directed toward labor problems - and the quoted portion is but a few lines in a five-page letter sent to a general distribution list and apparently never inserted in the Federal Register or any Navy Manual. Obviously, this letter was not cited by Captain Howard because he was unaware of its existence - or its applicability.\n\nThe short explanation is that the Captain thought that since the plaintiffs had attacked the administration of the shipyard by sending copies of their newsletters and charges to Congress, he should send Congress his side of the story. This he had a right to do but in doing so he should have no greater privilege than his critic. The plaintiffs in this case at most received qualified privilege for their complaints to Congress,\n3\n yet the Captain's answer is given absolute privilege. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 593, 600]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs my dissent in Barr v. Matteo indicates, the burden of proof is on the defendant to sustain his claim of privilege, ante, p. 579. I do not read this record as placing a mandatory duty on Captain Howard to make the report in question to Congress.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nI would affirm.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] I agree with the Court in its determination that federal law controls this matter.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] \"Navy agencies\" is defined in paragraph 2b of the same letter as follows:\n\n\"This term includes the Civilian Executive Assistants to the Secretary, the Naval Professional Assistants to the Secretary and the Heads of Offices and Boards of the Navy Department.\"\n\n\n Surely it was never intended that every naval officer who thought that he knew something in which Congress might be interested, was required to contact Congress directly.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See, e. g., Sweeney v. Higgins, 117 Me. 415, 104 A. 791; Tyree v. Harrison, 100 Va. 540, 42 S. E. 295; Hancock v. Mitchell, 83 W. Va. 156, 98 S. E. 65.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] On this record, I cannot believe that Captain Howard would have been derelict in his duty if he had not sent the report to Congress - and it has never been suggested that such action would have warranted disciplinary measures. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 593, 601]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","80":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nILLINOIS v.

These charges were preferred by the Bar Association of Hawaii before the Territorial Supreme Court; that Court referred the charges to the Ethics Committee of the Bar Association, which held a hearing, and found the charges sustained. The Territorial Supreme Court, upon review of the record, also sustained the charges, and ordered that petitioner be suspended from the practice of law for one year. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. Held: The record does not support the charge and the findings growing out of petitioner's speech, and the judgment is reversed.

With him on the brief was Morio Omori, Special Deputy Attorney General of the Territory of Hawaii.\n\nJoseph A. Forer filed a brief for the National Lawyers Guild, as amicus curiae, urging reversal.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN announced the judgment of the Court, and delivered an opinion, in which THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE BLACK, and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS join.\n\nThis case is here on writ of certiorari, \n358 \nU.S. 892\n, to review petitioner's suspension from the practice of law for one year, ordered by the Supreme Court of the Territory of Hawaii, 41 Haw. 403, and affirmed on appeal by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, 260 F.2d 189.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nPetitioner has been a member of the Territorial Bar in Hawaii since 1941. For many months beginning in late 1952 she participated, in the United States District Court at Honolulu, as one of the defense counsel in the trial of an indictment against a number of defendants for conspiracy under the Smith Act, 18 U.S.C. 2385. The trial was before Federal District Judge Jon Wiig and a jury. Both disciplinary charges against petitioner had to do with the Smith Act trial. One charge related to a speech she made about six weeks after the trial began. The speech was made on the Island of Hawaii, at Honokaa, a village some 182 miles from Honolulu, Oahu, on a Sunday morning. The other charge related to interviews she had with one of the jurors after the trial concluded. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 624]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Bar Association of Hawaii preferred the charges\n2\n which were referred by the Territorial Supreme Court to the Association's Legal Ethics Committee for investigation. The prosecutor who represented the Government at the Smith Act trial conducted the investigation and presented the evidence before the Committee. The Committee submitted the record and its findings to the Territorial Supreme Court. Because the suspension seems to us to depend on it, see pp. 637-638, infra, we deal first with the charge relating to the speech. The gist of the Committee's findings was that the petitioner's speech reflected adversely upon Judge Wiig's impartiality and fairness in \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 625]\n\u00a0\n the conduct of the Smith Act trial and impugned his judicial integrity. The Committee concluded that petitioner \"in imputing to the Judge unfairness in the conduct of the trial, in impugning the integrity of the local Federal courts and in other comments made at Honokaa, was guilty of violation of Canons 1 and 22 of the Canons of Professional Ethics of the American Bar Association\n3\n and \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 626]\n\u00a0\n should be disciplined for the same.\" The Territorial Supreme Court held that \". . . she engaged and participated in a willful oral attack upon the administration of justice in and by the said United States District Court for the District of Hawaii and by direct statement and implication impugned the integrity of the judge presiding therein . . . and thus tended to also create disrespect for the courts of justice and judicial officers generally. . . . She has thus committed what this court considers gross misconduct.\" 41 Haw., at 422-423.\n\nWe think that our review may be limited to the narrow question whether the facts adduced are capable of supporting the findings that the petitioner's speech impugned Judge Wiig's impartiality and fairness in conducting the Smith Act trial and thus reflected upon his integrity in the dispensation of justice in that case. We deal with the Court's findings, not with \"misconduct\" in the abstract. Although the opinions in the Court of Appeals and the argument before us have tended in varying degrees to treat the petitioner's suspension as discipline imposed for obstructing or attempting to obstruct the administration of justice, in a way to embarrass or influence the tribunal trying the case, such was neither the charge nor the finding of professional misconduct upon which the suspension was based. Since no obstruction or attempt at obstruction of the trial was charged, and since it is clear to us that the finding upon which the suspension rests is not supportable by the evidence adduced, we have no occasion \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 627]\n\u00a0\n to consider the applicability of Bridges v. California, \n314 \nU.S. 252\n; Pennekamp v. Florida, \n328 \nU.S. 331\n; or Craig v. Harney \n331 \nU.S. 367\n, which have been extensively discussed in the briefs. We do not reach or intimate any conclusion on the constitutional issues presented.\n\nPetitioner's clients included labor unions, among them the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union. Some of the defendants in the Smith Act trial were officers and members of that union and their defense was being supported by the union. The meeting at Honokaa was sponsored by the ILWU and was attended in large part by its members. The petitioner spoke extemporaneously and no transcript or recording was made of her speech. Precisely what she did say is a matter of dispute. Neither the Territorial Supreme Court nor the Court of Appeals saw the witnesses, but both courts, on reading the record, resolved matters of evidentiary conflict in the fashion least favorable to the petitioner. For the purposes of our review here, we may do the same. The version of the petitioner's speech principally relied upon by the Court of Appeals, 260 F.2d, at 197-198, is derived from notes made by a newspaper reporter, Matsuoka, who attended the meeting and heard what the petitioner said. These were not Matsuoka's original notes - the originals were lost - but an expanded version prepared by him at the direction of his newspaper superiors after interest in the speech was aroused by Matsuoka's account of it in the newspaper.\n4\n We \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 628]\n\u00a0\n set forth the notes in full as an Appendix to this opinion, and summarize them here, as an account of what petitioner said. The summary will illumine the basis of our conclusion that the finding that the petitioner's speech impugned the integrity of Judge Wiig or reflected upon his impartiality and fairness in presiding at the Smith Act trial is without support. The fact finding below does not remove this Court's duty of examining the evidence to see whether it furnishes a rational basis for the characterization put on it by the lower courts. See Fiske v. Kansas, \n274 \nU.S. 380\n. Speculation cannot take over where the proofs fail. We conclude that there is no support for any further factual inference than that petitioner was voicing strong criticism of Smith Act cases and the Government's manner of proving them, and that her references to the happenings at the Honolulu trial were illustrative of this, and not a reflection in any wise upon Judge Wiig personally or his conduct of the trial.\n\nPetitioner said that the Honolulu trial was really an effort to get at the ILWU. She wanted to tell about some \"rather shocking and horrible things that go on at the trial.\" The defendants, she said, were being tried for reading books written before they were born. Jack Hall, one of the defendants, she said, was on trial because he had read the Communist Manifesto. She spoke of the nature of criminal conspiracy prosecutions, as she saw \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 629]\n\u00a0\n them, and charged that when the Government did not have enough evidence \"it lumps a number together and says they agreed to do something.\" \"Conspiracy means to charge a lot of people for agreeing to do something you have never done.\" She generally attacked the FBI, saying they spent too much time investigating people's minds, and next dwelt further on the remoteness of the evidence in the case and the extreme youth of some of the defendants at the time to which the evidence directly related. She said \"no one has a memory that good, yet they use this kind of testimony. Why? Because they will do anything and everything necessary to convict.\" Government propaganda carried on for 10 years before the jurors entered the box, she charged, made it \"enough to say a person is a communist to cook his goose.\" She charged that some of the witnesses had given prior inconsistent testimony but that the Government went ahead and had them \"say things in order to convict.\" \"Witnesses testify what Government tells them to.\" The Government, she claimed, read in evidence for two days Communist books because one of the defendants had once seen them in a duffel bag. Unless people informed on such defendants, the FBI would try to make them lose their jobs. \"There's no such thing as a fair trial in a Smith Act case. All rules of evidence have to be scrapped or the Government can't make a case.\" She related how in another case (in the territorial courts) she was not allowed to put in evidence of a hearsay nature to exonerate a criminal defendant she was representing,\n5\n but in \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 630]\n\u00a0\n the present case \"a federal judge sitting on a federal bench permits Crouch [a witness] to testify about 27 years ago, what was said then . . . here they permit a witness to tell what was said when a defendant was five years old.\" She then declared, \"There's no fair trial in the case. They just make up the rules as they go along.\" She gave the example of the New York Smith Act trial before Judge Medina, see Dennis v. United States, \n341 \nU.S. 494\n, where she claimed \"The Government can't make a case if it tells just what they did so they widened the rules and tell what other people did years ago, including everything including the kitchen sink.\" She declared, \"Unless we stop the Smith trial in its tracks here there will be a new crime. People will be charged with knowing what is included in books - ideas.\" Petitioner said in conclusion that if things went on the freedom to read and freedom of thought and action would be subverted. She urged her auditors to go out and explain what a vicious thing the Smith Act was.\n\nThe specific utterances in the speech that the Legal Ethics Committee and the Supreme Court found as furnishing the basis for the findings that petitioner impugned Judge Wiig's integrity were the references (which we have quoted in full above) to \"horrible and shocking\" things at the trial; the impossibility of a fair trial; the necessity, if the Government's case were to be proved, of scrapping the rules of evidence; and the creation of new crimes unless the trial were stopped at once. We examine these points in particular, though of course we must do so in the context of the whole speech. In so doing we accept as obviously correct the ruling of the courts below that petitioner's remarks were not a mere generalized discourse \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 631]\n\u00a0\n on Smith Act prosecutions but included particular references to the case going on in Honolulu.\n\nI. We start with the proposition that lawyers are free to criticize the state of the law. Many lawyers say that the rules of evidence relative to the admission of statements by those alleged to be co-conspirators are overbroad or otherwise unfair and unwise;\n6\n that there are dangers to defendants, of a sort against which trial judges cannot protect them, in the trial of numerous persons jointly for conspiracy;\n7\n and that a Smith Act trial is apt to become \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 632]\n\u00a0\n a trial of ideas.\n8\n Others disagree. But all are free to express their views on these matters, and no one would say that this sort of criticism constituted an improper attack on the judges who enforced such rules and who presided at the trials. This is so, even though the existence of questionable rules of law might be said in a sense to produce unfair trials.\n9\n Such criticism simply cannot be equated with an attack on the motivation or the integrity or the competence of the judges. And surely permissible criticism may as well be made to a lay audience as to a professional; oftentimes the law is modified through popular criticism;\n10\n Bentham's strictures on the state of the common law and Dickens' novels come to mind.\n11\n And needless to say, a lawyer may criticize the law-enforcement agencies of the Government, and the prosecution, even to the extent of suggesting wrongdoing on their part, without by that token impugning the judiciary. Simply to charge, for example, the prosecution with the knowing use of perjured testimony in a case is \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 633]\n\u00a0\n not to imply in the slightest any complicity by the judge in such actions. To charge that the Government makes overmuch use of the conspiracy form of criminal prosecution, and this to bolster weak cases, is not to suggest any unseemly complicity by the judiciary in the practice.\n12\n\u00a0\n\nIn large part, if not entirely, Matsuoka's notes of petitioner's speech do not reveal her as doing more than this. She dwelt extensively on the nature of Smith Act trials and on conspiracy prosecutions. The Honolulu trial, to be sure, was the setting for her remarks, but they do not indicate more than that she referred to it as a typical, present example of the evils thought to be attendant on such trials. The specific statements found censurable (without which the bringing of the charge would have been inconceivable) are not in the least inconsistent with this, even though they must be taken to relate to the trial in progress. These specific statements are hardly damning by themselves, and clearly call for the light examination in context may give them; so examined, they do not furnish any basis for a finding of professional misconduct. She said that there were \"horrible\" and \"shocking\" things going on at the trial, but this remark, introductory to the speech, of course was in the context of what she further said about conspiracy prosecutions, Smith Act trials, and the prosecution's conduct. Petitioner's statement that a fair trial was impossible in context obviously related to the state of law and to the conduct of the prosecution and the FBI, not to anything that Judge Wiig personally was doing or failing to do. It occurred immediately after an account of the FBI's alleged pressuring of witnesses. The same seems clearly the case with the remark about the necessity of scrapping \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 634]\n\u00a0\n the rules of evidence.\n13\n The statement that if the trial went on to a conviction, new crimes - those of thought or ideas - would be created\n14\n could hardly be thought to reflect on the trial judge's integrity no matter how divorced from context it be considered. How any of this reflected on Judge Wiig, except insofar as he might be thought to lose stature because he was a judge in a legal system said to be full of imperfections, is not shown. To say that \"the law is a ass, a idiot\" is not to impugn the character of those who must administer it. To say that prosecutors are corrupt is not to impugn the character of judges who might be unaware of it, or be able to find no method under the law of restraining them. Judge Wiig was not by name mentioned in the speech, and there was virtually none of petitioner's complaints that was phrased in terms of what \"the judge\" was doing. For aught that appears from petitioner's speech, Judge Wiig might have been totally out of sympathy, as a personal matter, with the Smith Act, the practice of trying criminal offenses on a conspiracy basis, and the rules of evidence in conspiracy trials, but felt bound to apply the law as laid down by higher courts.\n15\n\u00a0\n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 635]\n\u00a0\n\n\nEven if some passages can be found which go so far as to imply that Judge Wiig was taking an erroneous view of the law - perhaps the comparison made between the case in the Territorial Courts where a hearsay statement was excluded and the admission of evidence in the Smith Act case might be of this nature, and much is made of it here though the Committee and the courts below made nothing of it - we think there was still nothing in the speech warranting the findings. If Judge Wiig was said to be wrong on his law, it is no matter; appellate courts and law reviews say that of judges daily, and it imputes no disgrace. Dissenting opinions in our reports are apt to make petitioner's speech look like tame stuff indeed. Petitioner did not say Judge Wiig was corrupt or venal or stupid or incompetent. The public attribution of honest error to the judiciary is no cause for professional discipline in this country. See In re Ades, 6 F. Supp. 467, 481. It may be said that some of the audience would infer improper collusion with the prosecution from a charge of error prejudicing the defense. Some lay persons may not be able to imagine legal error without venality or collusion, but it will not do to set our standards by their reactions. We can indulge in no involved speculation as to petitioner's guilt by reason of the imaginations of others.\n\nBut it is said that while it may be proper for an attorney to say the law is unfair or that judges are in error as a general matter, it is wrong for counsel of record to say so during a pending case. The verbalization is that it is impermissible to litigate by day and castigate by night. See 260 F.2d, at 202. This line seems central to the Bar Association's argument, as it appears to have been to the \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 636]\n\u00a0\n reasoning of the court below,\n16\n and the dissent here is much informed by it, but to us it seems totally to ignore the charges made and the findings. The findings were that petitioner impugned the integrity of Judge Wiig and made an improper attack on his administration of justice in the Honolulu trial. A lawyer does not acquire any license to do these things by not being presently engaged in a case. They are equally serious whether he currently is engaged in litigation before the judge or not. We can conceive no ground whereby the pendency of litigation might be thought to make an attorney's out-of-court remarks more censurable, other than that they might tend to obstruct the administration of justice. Remarks made during the course of a trial might tend to such obstruction where remarks made afterwards would not. But this distinction is foreign to this case, because the charges and findings in no way turn on an allegation of obstruction of justice, or of an attempt to obstruct justice, in a pending case. To the charges made and found, it is irrelevant whether the Smith Act case was still pending. Judge Wiig remained equally protected from statements impugning him, and petitioner remained equally free to make critical statements that did not cross that line. We find that hers cannot be said to have done so. Accordingly, the suspension order, based on the charge relating to the speech, cannot stand.\n\nII. Petitioner was also charged by the Committee, and found by the Supreme Court, to have misconducted herself by interviewing a juror shortly after the completion \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 637]\n\u00a0\n of the Smith Act trial. The juror had become mentally unsettled, in an obvious fashion, very shortly after the rendition of the verdict and apparently as a result of his participation on the jury. It was at this point that petitioner, having been first requested by his sister, several times interviewed him, and spoke with members of his family. The Supreme Court recognized that it had been common practice for attorneys in the Territory to interrogate jurors after the rendition of their verdicts and their discharges. Nevertheless, it found her action professional misconduct. The versions of the witnesses as to exactly what transpired at the interviews varied considerably, but the court made no findings of fact on the matter, and it is difficult to grasp the basis on which it singled petitioner's juror interviews out for censure against the pattern of a common practice of such interviews in the Territory.\n17\n While there is clearly some delicacy involved in approaching a juror who has become mentally unsettled, evidence that a juror was incompetent at the time of the rendition of the verdict might be admissible to impeach a verdict where evidence of the jury's mental and reasoning processes is not. While the interviews \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 638]\n\u00a0\n were undertaken under unusual circumstances, it is difficult to say whether the circumstances furnish more or less justification than is present in the average juror interview - which we do not read the Supreme Court's opinion as holding censurable, except as to the future.\n18\n The Legal Ethics Committee had charged petitioner with concealment of facts in her affidavit as to the juror interview filed with Judge Wiig in support of her motion for a new trial for the Smith Act defendants, but we do not find anything in the Supreme Court's opinion agreeing with these charges.\n\nBut we need not explore further what the basis was for the Territorial Supreme Court's finding on this charge. As to it, the court said that the suspension order it rendered on the charge relating to the speech would suffice.\n19\n The Court of Appeals was of opinion that if the charge as to the speech were insupportable, in the present posture of the case the suspension could not stand, 260 F.2d, at 202, and we agree. We cannot read the Supreme Court's opinion as imposing any penalty solely by reason of the interview with the juror. Accordingly, we do not believe it would be appropriate in the posture of the case for us finally to adjudicate the validity of the finding of misconduct by reason of the interviews.\n\nIII. The Court of Appeals expressed doubt as to its jurisdiction to hear the appeal from the Territorial Supreme Court, and respondent here urges that that court \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 639]\n\u00a0\n was without jurisdiction. Since our jurisdiction to bear the case on the merits must stand or fall with that of the Court of Appeals, we examine the objections. They are without merit. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has jurisdiction of appeals from final judgments of the Supreme Court of the Territory of Hawaii, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1293, in \"civil cases where the value in controversy exceeds $5,000, exclusive of interest and costs.\"\n20\n The suspension order would have the effect of removing petitioner from the practice of law for at least one year, and she filed an uncontroverted affidavit that her annual net income from the practice of law had been for years, and would continue foreseeably, in excess of $5,000.\n21\n It is insisted that petitioner's right cannot be reduced to monetary terms, because it is \"priceless,\" and so it is, in a manner of speaking; but besides the professional aspects of her status, her continuance in a specific form of gainful employment is in issue, see Bradley v. Fisher, 13 Wall. 335, 355, and hence the jurisdictional amount was present.\n\nFinally, we find no inhibition as to the scope of review we have given the judgment of the Territorial Court. The Territorial Court is one created under the sovereignty of the National Government, O'Donoghue v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 516, 535\n, and hence this Court (once the \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 640]\n\u00a0\n jurisdictional Act is satisfied) is not limited as it would be in reviewing the judgment of the highest court of a State. Of course this Court and the Courts of Appeals must give the Territorial Courts freedom in developing principles of local law, and in interpreting local legislation. See Bonet v. Texas Co., \n308 \nU.S. 463\n; DeCastro v. Board of Commissioners, \n322 \nU.S. 451, 454\n-458. But it hardly needs elaboration to make it clear that the question of the total insufficiency of the evidence to sustain a serious charge of professional misconduct, against a backdrop of the claimed constitutional rights of an attorney to speak as freely as another citizen, is not one which can be subsumed under the headings of local practice, customs or law.\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\n [For concurring opinion of MR.

JUSTICE BRENNAN.\n\n\nTHE EXPANDED NOTES OF THE REPORTER, MATSUOKA, RELATIVE   TO PETITIONER'S SPEECH.\n\n\n\"She followed Samuel M. Bento, who said he wanted to say good morning to the Tribune-Herald, pointing generally toward the paper's reporter from Hilo and the \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 641]\n\u00a0\n paper's Honokaa correspondent who were sitting side by side. Mrs. Sawyer preceded Jack W. Hall. She began speaking at 11 a.m. and ended 11:30 a.m.\n\n\n\"Notes on what she said in the order of how she proceeded: The trial is really a trial of Jack Hall to which has been added six others. It's to get at the ILWU.\n\n\n\"Said she wanted to tell about some rather shocking and horrible things that go on at the trial.\n\n\n\"She was appointed some years ago (3 or 4 years ago) by a court to defend a man who had no money to hire his own counsel. He was charged with pimping and procuring. The complaining witness in the case was a woman who had been in business 20 years in the territory who claimed she had reformed and repented but this vicious man had driven her back again into the business.

Likened this to pukas in the Smith act.\n\n\n\"Said men in power are trying to put men in jail because of their thoughts. and books written before he was born.\n\n\n\"One of the reasons Jack Hall is on trial is because it is said he once got a book, the Communist Manifesto, written in 1898, before Jack Hall was a gleam in his father's eye.\n\n\n\"She quoted from manifesto: a spectre is haunting Europe; the spectre is communism. she explained spectre means ghost. said spectre still seems to be haunting people today.\n\n\n\"She turned next to conspiracy. noted there was a conspiracy trial in 1937 of filipino brothers. conspiracy to advocate violence and criminal sindicalism. explained conspiracy means agreement. government never has \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 642]\n\u00a0\n used conspiracy when it had a case. when it hasn't got enough evidence it lumps a number together and says they agreed to do something. the government does not say . . advocated overthrow but says they agreed to. conspiracy means to charge a lot of people for agreeing to do something you have never done.\n\n\n\"touched on myth of agents of fbi. they're supposed to be extra special. radio programs, movies, publicity tell how wonderful they are. but when you see hundreds of tax fraud cases go by and when they spend most of their time investigating people's minds it's time to cut them down to size. said she had told this to a honolulu gathering. labor day? fbi agents should be called federal cops. said has slogan: put away your thoughts here come the federal cops. cops push people around.\n\n\n\"paul crouch. difficult to understand why he's witness. but he was here in 1924; because he was once in Hawaii, so guess that's why. he testified what he did in russia in 1927. he told what he was told by generals etc. usually you cannot testify on what people told you when there is no chance for those to be cross examined. aileen fujimoto was four years old then. what has crouch's galloping over the plains of russia got any bearing on her. jack hall was 13. but the government goes on with testimony for two weeks on what crouch did between 1927 and 1941 without ever mentioning the defendants. \"he told of infiltration of the armed forces and plots . . . it used to be the idea that a man is responsible for what he did and said - not what someone else did. not a single one of the defendants was of age at the time he's talking about. the jury is not going to pay attention to what \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 643]\n\u00a0\n Crouch says but it's the old smear. The prosecution says crouch did this and that and we (prosecution) say the defendants are communist party members so they must have done the same.\n\n\n\"but government propaganda has been going on for 10 years before the jurors went into the jury box.\n\n\n\"it's enough to say a person is a communist to cook his goose. the government says there was an agreement to violate the smith act which was passed in 1940. then the defendants agreed to violate it before it was passed. crouch said he was at a communist meeting in 1941 and saw five or six people there. it was the first time he'd seen them. but he was satisfied when he came to honolulu 12 years later that one was Koji Ariyoshi. she urged audience try to recall what they did 12 years ago. said she can't recall details. god knows no one has a memory that good. yet they use this kind of testimony.\n\n\n\"why? because they will do anything and everything necessary to convict.\n\n\n\"some of the witnesses testified differently from what they testified previously. the government knows this but deliberately goes ahead and have him say things in order to convict. mentioned izuka in reinecke trial testimony. said something about izuka saying he didn't know the party advocated overthrow of government until he got out of party.\n\n\n\"witnesses testify what government tells them to. just as they read portions of books like overthrow the government and leave out the rest which says czarist government showing it dealt with russia. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 644]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Johnson testimony. said he came back from san francisco with communist books and literature in a duffle bag. he said when he got to Honolulu he told Jack Hall the names of some of the books. then the government for two days reads from books supposed to have been in the duffel bag. they're not dealing with what jack hall said. on cross examination Johnson said he did not tell the names of the books but just showed jack hall the duffel bag. so jack hall violated the smith act because he saw a duffel bag with some books on overthrowing the government in it. it's silly. why does the government use your money and mine to put people in jail for thoughts\n\n\n\"the government has carried on a barrage of propaganda for many years and expects people in the jury to have hysteria just hearing about communist is enough to jail. said has a friend who worked for sears roebuck and has family of three children and wife. he made a terrible mistake one time. in 1941 he lived in the same house as jack hall. the fbi wanted him to testify. he said i feel jack hall is one of the finest people i have known. apparently the fbi didn't like this. so they suggested to sears and roebuck to fire him because he wouldn't cooperate with the government.\n\n\n\"he wasn't fired so they went to the Los Angeles and Chicago offices of sears and roebuck and convinced them he had to be fired. he was fired because he refused to be a stool pigeon and informer. the government gets away with it by making people fear that if they don't do as it wants they'll be branded red and lose their jobs.\n\n\n\"there's no such thing as a fair trial in a smith act case. all rules of evidence have to be scrapped or the government can't make a case. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 645]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"referred to her habeas corpus move in the palakiko - majors case.\n\n\n\"said a woman came to her with report she heard vernon stevens say he bet a confession out of one of them. she testified but the supreme court refused to let the evidence in because vernon stevens was not here and had no chance to deny this. with the same situation a federal judge sitting on a federal bench permits crouch to testify about 27 years ago. what was said then. in the previous case it was the life and death of one. and yet here they permit a witness to tell what was said when a defendant was five years old.\n\n\n\"there's no fair trial in the case. they just make up the rules as they go along. the first smith act case was in 1949 of the new york top leaders. attorneys contended they should have the right to say what they did from 1924. medina permitted them to say what the defendants themselves did from 1934 on. but the government can't make a case if it tells just what they did so they widened the rules and tell what other people did years ago, including everything including the kitchen sink.\n\n\n\"unless we stop the smith trial in its tracks here there will be a new crime. people will be charged with knowing what is included in books. ideas.\n\n\n\"mentioned los angeles trial in which someone said there was no evidence that someone had instructed persons not to read some books.\n\n\n\"said there'll come a time when the only thing to do is to keep your children from learning how to read. then not \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 646]\n\u00a0\n only will unions be destroyed by [sic] so will freedom of thoughts and action. there'll be dark ages of thought control when people won't be able to speak freely in taverns and other places.\n\n\n\"she urged audience to go out and explain what a vicious thing the smith act is. people are tried for books written years ago.\"\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The affirmance was by a 4-3 vote. The appeal was heard en banc by 9 judges but was decided by 7 because of the retirement of one judge and the death of another.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] At the conclusion of the Smith Act trial, District Judge Wiig requested the local Bar Association to investigate the conduct of petitioner. The Bar Association took no action as the Attorney General of the Territory conducted an investigation. As the Rules of the Supreme Court of the Territory then stood, only the Attorney General or a person aggrieved could file charges of unprofessional conduct against an attorney. After investigating the matter, the Attorney General did not file a complaint. A Committee of the Bar Association then proceeded to study the question of bringing charges against petitioner, and, in the words of the then President of the Association:\n\n\"The committee subsequently made a report to the Executive Board of the Association, ruling that a complaint be filed against Mrs. Bouslog. However, under the rules then in existence - that is, the rules of the Supreme Court, the Bar Association could not be a complainant. Consequently, the matter was again referred to the Committee on Legal Ethics to study amendments to the Rules of the Supreme Court, and the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Ethics took the matter up with the Chief Justice. And as I recall, the amendment to Rule 19 - that is the rule on complaints for unprofessional conduct - I think was amended in April of 1954.\n\n\n\"Thereafter, the chairman of the Committee on Legal Ethics submitted a proposed draft of the Complaint. The Executive Board studied the draft, recommended certain changes, and then, finally, the form of the complaint was, as filed, was [sic] agreed upon, and I, as president of the Bar Association, was authorized to file that complaint in the name of the Bar Association.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Canon 1 is entitled \"The Duty of the Lawyer to the Courts.\" It reads:\n\n\"It is the duty of the lawyer to maintain towards the Courts a respectful attitude, not for the sake of the temporary incumbent of the judicial office, but for the maintenance of its supreme importance. Judges, not being wholly free to defend themselves, are peculiarly entitled to receive the support of the Bar against unjust criticism and clamor. Whenever there is proper ground for serious complaint of a judicial officer, it is the right and duty of the lawyer to submit his grievances to the proper authorities. In such cases, but not otherwise, such charges should be encouraged and the person making them should be protected.\"\n\n\n Canon 22 is entitled \"Candor and Fairness.\" It reads:\n\n\"The conduct of the lawyer before the Court and with other lawyers should be characterized by candor and fairness.\n\n\n\"It is not candid or fair for the lawyer knowingly to misquote the contents of a paper, the testimony of a witness, the language or the argument of opposing counsel, or the language of a decision or a textbook; or with knowledge of its invalidity, to cite as authority a decision that has been overruled, or a statute that has been repealed; or in argument to assert as a fact that which has not been proved, or in those jurisdictions where a side has the opening and closing arguments to mislead his opponent by concealing or withholding positions in his opening argument upon which his side then intends to rely.\n\n\n\"It is unprofessional and dishonorable to deal other than candidly with the facts in taking the statements of witnesses, in drawing affidavits and other documents, and in the presentation of causes.\n\n\n\"A lawyer should not offer evidence which he knows the Court should reject, in order to get the same before the jury by argument for its admissibility, nor should he address to the Judge arguments upon any point not properly calling for determination by him. Neither should he introduce into an argument, addressed to the \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 626]\n\u00a0\n court, remarks or statements intended to influence the jury or bystanders.\n\n\n\"These and all kindred practices are unprofessional and unworthy of an officer of the law charged, as is the lawyer, with the duty of aiding in the administration of justice.\"\n\n\n We do not perceive any specification by the Committee of the respect in which Canon 22 was thought to have been violated by petitioner's speech, and such a violation does not occur to us.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The portion of the article, in the Hilo Tribune-Herald, that deals with petitioner's speech is as follows:\n\n\"Mrs. Sawyer, speaking for a half hour, spoke of `some rather shocking and horrible things that go on at the trial.'\n\n\n\"There's `no such thing as a fair trial in a Smith act case,' she charged. `All rules of evidence have to be scrapped or the government can't make a case.' \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 628]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"They `just make up the rules as they go along,' she told her listeners.\n\n\n\"`Unless we stop the Smith act trial in its tracks here' there will be a `new crime' that of knowing what's in books and will lead to `dark ages of thought control,' asserted the chic and attractive woman lawyer.\n\n\n\"She referred to reading by the prosecution of books `supposed to have been in a duffel bag' owned by a witness, Henry Johnson. She urged her listeners to tell others `what a vicious thing the Smith Act is.' Persons are `tried for books written years ago' by others, she said.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The case was Application of Palakiko and Majors, 39 Haw. 167, aff'd sub nom. Palakiko v. Harper, 209 F.2d 75. The case was a habeas corpus application, in which petitioner sought to put in evidence the statement of a woman that a police officer had said that he had beaten a confession out of petitioner's client. The Territorial Supreme Court held a lengthy evidentiary hearing on the petition, which covered many other matters, and at it excluded \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 630]\n\u00a0\n the evidence in question. The court's opinion does not discuss the point, but it is mentioned in the Court of Appeals' opinion on affirmance. 209 F.2d, at 102-103.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] One of the classic statements of this point of view is Mr. Justice Jackson's concurring opinion in Krulewitch v. United States, \n336 \nU.S. 440, 453\n: \"But the order of proof of so sprawling a charge [as conspiracy] is difficult for a judge to control. As a practical matter, the accused often is confronted with a hodgepodge of acts and statements by others which he may never have authorized or intended or even known about, but which help to persuade the jury of the existence of the conspiracy itself. In other words, a conspiracy often is proved by evidence that is admissible only upon assumption that conspiracy existed. The naive assumption that prejudicial effects can be overcome by instructions to the jury . . . all practicing lawyers know to be unmitigated fiction.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] \"The unavailing protest of courts against the growing habit to indict for conspiracy in lieu of prosecuting for the substantive offense itself, or in addition thereto, suggests that loose practice as to this offense constitutes a serious threat to fairness in our administration of justice. . . .\n\n\"The interchangeable use of conspiracy doctrine in civil as well as penal proceedings opens it to the danger, absent in the case of many crimes, that a court having in mind only the civil sanctions will approve lax practices which later are imported into criminal proceedings. . . .\n\n\n\"[T]he order of proof of so sprawling a charge is difficult for a judge to control. . . .\n\n\n\"There are many practical difficulties in defending against a charge of conspiracy which I will not enumerate. . . .\n\n\n\"[A survey conducted] which accords with our observation, will hardly convince one that a trial of this kind is the highest exemplification \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 632]\n\u00a0\n of the working of the judicial process.\" Jackson, J., concurring in Krulewitch v.

Fujimoto v. United States, 251 F.2d 342.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] Lower federal court judges have in the past questioned conspiracy indictment practice. See the statement of the 1925 Conference \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 635]\n\u00a0\n of Senior Circuit Judges, as quoted in Annual Report of the Attorney General, 1925, pp. 5-6; L. Hand, J., in United States v. Falcone, 109 F.2d 579, 581.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] For example, the petitioner argued in the Court of Appeals that a law professor at Yale had made criticisms in more pungent terms than hers. Said the court: \"We would uphold Professor Rodell's right to say from his Yale vantage point just about what he wants to say. But when he speaks he is not simultaneously harassing the very court in which he is trying an unfinished case.\" 260 F.2d, at 200.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] The court said: \"It appears from the transcript which we have examined pursuant to the pretrial order herein, that her first visit to said David Fuller [the juror] was made by the respondent licensee upon request by his sister. It also appears that it has not been uncommon, if not in fact common practice, heretofore and within the Territory of Hawaii, for attorneys as well as others to interrogate jurors, after rendition of verdict by them, as to what may have been decisive in reaching a verdict.\n\n\"However, even if she relied upon the request of his sister when she first visited David Fuller, and upon a belief that it was common practice, locally, to interrogate trial jurors after verdict, such reliance thereon is not acceptable as excuse for her repeated visits to and studied interrogation of Fuller under the circumstances and as set forth in her affidavit, incorporated in the bill of particulars. . . .\" 41 Haw., at 423-424.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] The court gave a warning to the future conduct of the Bar that interrogation of jurors as to occurrences in the jury room and as to the reasons why the jury reached its verdict would be at the peril of the interrogator. 41 Haw., at 425.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] \"However, in the instant matter, this court will let its hereinbefore expressed disciplinary order - suspending the said respondent licensee from the practice of law in the territorial courts for one year and requiring her to pay costs - suffice, although also deeming gross misconduct her said repeated interviews with and interrogations of David Fuller.\" Ibid.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] \"The courts of appeals for the First and Ninth Circuits shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the supreme courts of Puerto Rico and Hawaii, respectively in all cases involving the Constitution, laws or treaties of the United States or any authority exercised thereunder, in all habeas corpus proceedings, and in all other civil cases where the value in controversy exceeds $5,000, exclusive of interest and costs.\" 28 U.S.C. 1293.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 21\n] \"Where the power of any court of appeals to review a case depends on the amount or value in controversy, such amount or value, if not otherwise satisfactorily disclosed upon the record, may be shown and ascertained by the oath of a party to the case or by other competent evidence.\" 28 U.S.C. 2108.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, concurring.\n\nAssuming that there is a specific law of some kind in Hawaii which purports to authorize petitioner's suspension or disbarment upon the charges against her, I agree with MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, for the reasons he gives, that the charges were not proved. My agreement is not to be considered however as indicating a belief that Hawaii has such a law, that it would be valid if it existed, or that petitioner was given the kind of trial which federal courts must constitutionally afford before imposing such a drastic punishment as was inflicted on petitioner.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART, concurring in the result.\n\nIf, as suggested by my Brother FRANKFURTER, there runs through the principal opinion an intimation that a lawyer can invoke the constitutional right of free speech to immunize himself from even-handed discipline for proven unethical conduct, it is an intimation in which I do not join. A lawyer belongs to a profession with inherited standards of propriety and honor, which experience has shown necessary in a calling dedicated to the accomplishment of justice. He who would follow that calling must conform to those standards.\n\nObedience to ethical precepts may require abstention from what in other circumstances might be constitutionally \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 647]\n\u00a0\n protected speech. For example, I doubt that a physician who broadcast the confidential disclosures of his patients could rely on the constitutional right of free speech to protect him from professional discipline.\n\nIn the present case, if it had been charged or if it had been found that the petitioner attempted to obstruct or prejudice the due administration of justice by interfering with a fair trial, this would be the kind of a case to which the language of the dissenting opinion seems largely directed.\n*\n But that was not the charge here, and it is not the ground upon which the petitioner has been disciplined. Because I agree with the conclusion that there is not enough in this record to support the charge and the findings growing out of the petitioner's speech in Honokaa, I concur in the Court's judgment.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] See Canon 20 of the Canons of Professional Ethics of the American Bar Association. \"Newspaper publications by a lawyer as to pending or anticipated litigation may interfere with a fair trial in the Courts and otherwise prejudice the due administration of justice. Generally they are to be condemned. If the extreme circumstances of a particular case justify a statement to the public, it is unprofessional to make it anonymously. An ex parte reference to the facts should not go beyond quotation from the records and papers on file in the court; but even in extreme cases it is better to avoid any ex parte statement.\" Canons of Professional and Judicial Ethics, American Bar Association, 1957.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, whom MR. JUSTICE CLARK, MR. JUSTICE HARLAN and MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER join, dissenting.\n\nPetitioner was suspended from the practice of law in the Territory of Hawaii for one year. The charges on which the suspension order was based related (1) to a speech made by petitioner at Honokaa, Hawaii, while a criminal trial was in progress, in Honolulu, in which she \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 648]\n\u00a0\n was attorney of record and an active lawyer for the defense, and (2) to petitioner's interview of a juror, after the trial had terminated in a verdict of guilty. The judge presiding at the trial requested the Bar Association to investigate Mrs. Sawyer's conduct. Following investigation, charges and a recommendation of disciplinary action were filed with the Hawaii Supreme Court which referred the matter to its Legal Ethics Committee. Following a full hearing the Committee, in the main, agreed with the charges of the Bar Association and submitted its conclusion to the Hawaii Supreme Court which made a de novo examination of the record, resulting in the order now before us. The suspension order was based upon the Honokaa speech. although the Hawaii Supreme Court also found that the interview of the juror, in view of the circumstances under which it was made, constituted professional misconduct. The Court today finds the conclusions of the Hawaii Supreme Court, on which the suspension order is based, wanting in a reasonable foundation and directs the Hawaii court to readmit Mrs. Sawyer to the practice of law. Since this Court finds that the suspension order was grounded on the speech, it leaves unreviewed the finding of professional misconduct growing out of the juror interview. When the case goes back to Hawaii, the Hawaii Supreme Court is apparently free to take further disciplinary action. Putting to one side the charge of misconduct relating to the interview of the juror, I think the judgment below should stand since the suspension based on the misconduct relating to the Honokaa speech is fully supported by the record.\n\n\"We think,\" says the opinion of MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, \"that our review may be limited to the narrow question whether the facts adduced are capable of supporting the findings that the petitioner's speech impugned Judge \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 649]\n\u00a0\n Wiig's impartiality and fairness in conducting the Smith Act trial and thus reflected upon his integrity in the dispensation of justice in that case.\" The limited reach of this question is illumined by the limited use made of the evidence in the record in MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN'S opinion. If the record contained no more than the portions of it that are drawn upon in MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN'S opinion, one would be led to conclude that the sole question in the case was whether the verbal content of the petitioner's speech, in disregard of all else, supported the findings of the Hawaii Supreme Court on which petitioner's suspension was based. Such is not the issue that the record as an entirety presents. In the law as elsewhere the answer to a problem largely depends on the way the question it presents is put. A wrong question is not likely to beget a right answer.\n\n\n Brother BRENNAN'S formulation of the problem before us and the resulting restriction on its use of the record, misconceive the findings upon which petitioner's suspension was based and neglect important aspects of the relevant evidence. As a result, the Court seriously impairs the responsibility of the bar and, more particularly, of criminal lawyers engaged in the conduct of trials, by encouraging cases to be tried on the hustings and in the press, instead of within a court-room and subject to its constitutionally circumscribed safeguards.\n\nSince the case must be seen in its true scope and perspective, it is important to state in full the findings of the Hawaii Supreme Court relevant to the speech:\n\n \"It is the finding and conclusion of this court that the allegations contained in the complaint of the Bar Association of Hawaii, more particularly paragraphs `I,' `II,' and `III' thereof . . . have been sustained by convincing proof, by credible evidence of more than a mere preponderance; that the said respondent \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 650]\n\u00a0\n licensee, a member of the Bar of this court and an attorney at law, duly licensed and admitted to practice before all of the courts of the Territory of Hawaii . . . did, as charged in said paragraph II, being then an attorney of record for a defendant in a then pending case in the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii . . . during the course of trial of said case, to wit, on or about December 14, 1952, say during a speech to a public gathering in Honokaa, Hawaii, that horrible and shocking things were going on at said trial; that a fair trial was impossible; that all of the rules of evidence were being scrapped so the government could make its case; that the rules of evidence and procedure were made up as the case proceeded; and that unless the trial was stopped in its tracks certain new crimes would be created. . . .\n\n\n \"Upon its finding and conclusion as stated supra, this court deems that in saying what she did in her speech to a public gathering at Honokaa, Hawaii, on December 14, 1952 . . . when there was then pending . . . a case under the Smith Act . . . she engaged and participated in a willful oral attack upon the administration of justice in and by the said United States District Court for the District of Hawaii and by direct statement and implication impugned the integrity of the judge presiding therein and in the said pending case . . . and thus tended to also create disrespect for the courts of justice and judicial officers generally, contra to the obligations and duties assumed, as incident to the license, by her and by every person to whom a license has or shall have been issued by this court to practice in the courts of the Territory of Hawaii. She has thus committed what this court considers gross misconduct.\" 41 Haw. 403, at 421-423. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 651]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n These conclusions, which essentially adopted the charges and conclusions of the Legal Ethics Committee,\n1\n rested on a de novo examination of the record of a full hearing before the Legal Ethics Committee, \"unprejudiced\" by the findings of that Committee or of the Bar Association. A majority of the Court of Appeals agreed \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 652]\n\u00a0\n that the record supported the conclusions. 260 F 2d 189. Of course we are not a court of first instance in reviewing these findings. We are not empowered to set aside the conclusions of the Supreme Court of Hawaii, affirmed by the Court of Appeals, if its conclusions find reasonable support - that is, if conscientious judges could not unreasonably have reached such a conclusion on the strength of the evidence disclosed by the record and the inferences fairly to be drawn from it.\n\nThus, the real issue before us is whether evidence supports the conclusion that Mrs. Sawyer in her speech, in the full setting and implications of what she said, engaged in a willful attack on the administration of justice in the particular trial in which she was then actively participating, and patently impugned, even if by clear implication rather than by blatant words, the integrity of the presiding judge, and thereby violated the obligations of one in her immediate situation, judged by conventional professional standards, so as to be reasonably deemed to have committed what the Hawaii Supreme Court termed \"misconduct.\"\n\nOne of the elements of the misconduct found by the Hawaii Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals was, without doubt, the attack on the integrity of the judge \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 653]\n\u00a0\n presiding at the trial in which she was engaged. Surely that does not mean she must have referred to Judge Wiig by name. Nor does it mean, as the opinion of MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN seems to assume, that any evidence which does not consist of a direct attack on the judge is irrelevant to the ultimate question: could the Hawaii Supreme Court have found petitioner guilty of misconduct as set forth in its opinion?\n\nBy carefully isolating various portions of the Matsuoka notes,\n2\n concentrating on them as a self-contained, insulated document, the opinion of MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN labors to put a neutral, if indeed not an innocently attractive, patina on Mrs. Sawyer's remarks. But the speech must be interpreted in its entirety, not distorted as an exercise in disjointed parsing. It must be placed in its context of time and circumstances. Nor can we neglect the fact that what people say is what others reasonably hear and are meant to hear. When this is done what emerges is no abstract attack on the state of the law, no analysis of the dubieties of Smith Act trials with which even judges may agree or, at all events, which critics have an unquestioned right to make, no Dickensian strictures on the injustices of legal proceedings, but a plainly conveyed attack on the conduct of a particular trial, presided over by a particular judge, involving particular defendants in whose defense Mrs. Sawyer herself was professionally engaged. There is ample support for the reasonable conclusion that, in making the fairness of the conduct of this particular trial the target of her appeal to a crowd outside while the trial was proceeding inside the court-room, Mrs. Sawyer was including in her assault the judicial officer who both in fact and in common understanding bears ultimate responsibility for the fairness and evenhandedness of judicial proceedings - the \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 654]\n\u00a0\n presiding judge. In examining this record sight must never be lost of the limited scope of our reviewing power. We are only concerned with whether the findings have fair support in the record. If the findings are so supported we have the right to strike down the suspension only if it transgresses constitutional limits. We must indeed have in mind, as the opinion of MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN reminds us, the entire \"context\" of this speech. We must endeavor to understand the complete utterance in its setting, as it sounded and was meant to sound to its auditors in Honokaa, Hawaii, on December 14, 1952.\n\nThe Honokaa meeting was sponsored by a committee for the defense of Jack Hall, one of the principal defendants in the Smith Act trial then under way in Honolulu,\n3\n in which Mrs. Sawyer was one of the group of lawyers for the defense. It was publicly announced and advertised that the topic of the meeting would be the Smith Act trial in Honolulu. The general public was invited and members of the press were present, as well they might be expected to be at a meeting where among the principal speakers were a defendant and a defense attorney in a highly controversial trial. It was controversial, not an obscure, run-of-the-mill trial; it had been receiving front-page publicity in the Hawaii press for weeks.\n4\n The defendant Hall himself was one of the principal speakers and Mrs. Sawyer was on the platform. Her function was, as stated by Mr. Hall, \"to explain the legal aspects of the prosecution.\" Certainly this setting precludes a naive \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 655]\n\u00a0\n conclusion that Mrs. Sawyer was delivering herself of an abstract dissertation on Smith Act trials, using illustrations from the Honolulu trial merely as \"typical present examples\" of the evils of such prosecutions. The enveloping environment of her talk, intensified by much other evidence, gives substantial support to the conclusion that Mrs. Sawyer was, in the main, discussing and attacking the Honolulu trial and that her more general condemnations were directed toward, and designed to have particular applicability to, that trial.\n\nThe fullest account of the speech is found in the notes made by Matsuoka, a newspaperman covering the meeting. These notes, though not themselves contemporaneous, are a slightly expanded version of handwritten contemporaneous notes which Matsuoka took and used as the basis for his news story of the meeting.\n5\n Matsuoka testified that the notes were full and accurate and contained \"almost everything\" of what Mrs. Sawyer said. It is significant that more than half of the notes contain comments directly and solely relating to the Honolulu \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 656]\n\u00a0\n trial.\n6\n However, these notes were not the only evidence of the content of the speech. Several persons who had been in the audience at Honokaa testified before the Legal Ethics Committee, and their testimony was part of the record considered by the Hawaii Supreme Court. This testimony lends substantial support to the finding that the basic intent and purport of the speech was to attack the conduct of the trial in which Mrs. Sawyer had been engaged on the day she made her speech and would again be engaged the next morning.\n\nThus, Matsuoka testified that Mrs. Sawyer spoke about\n\n \"The Smith Act trial; that was under way in Honolulu. She said she wanted to tell the people about some of the shocking, horrible things that went on, and that the Smith Act trial could not be a fair one, and that they just had to go around and make rules to fit the situation. That was, I think, the general trend.\"\n\n\n Another witness testified that\n\n\"She said that the trial was against Jack Hall, and six others were just brought in, and that its purpose was to get at the ILWU; she said that Jack Hall was being tried on something that he read many years ago, and she said that in the Smith Act trial there were no rules, and that they were making up the rules as they went along, and she said that the F. B. I. could be called Federal cops, and that when the government  - they were stressing this case, and when \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 657]\n\u00a0\n the government - that witnesses were afraid to testify, and they testified usually what the government wanted them to testify.\"\n\n\n Here is another quotation from the testimony before the Hawaii court:\n\n \"Q. Will you tell the Committee what Mrs. Bouslog said?\n\n\n \"A. Well, that the defendant in the Smith Act trial cannot get a fair trial.\n\n\n \"Q. What Smith Act trial was she talking about?\n\n\n \"A. The one in Honolulu.\"\n\n\n When to this evidence is added the setting we have described, and the fact that to those who read the Hawaii papers \"the\" Smith Act trial, was the notorious, much-exploited trial of the \"Hawaii Seven,\" how can one reasonably escape, on the basis of the record which determines our adjudication, the conclusion that Mrs. Sawyer was directly castigating the administration of the very trial in which she was then professionally engaged?\n7\n So viewed the specific statements which she made lose the aura of innocence the Court has cast about them and support the finding that Mrs. Sawyer was guilty of professional misconduct in attacking the administration of justice in the Honolulu trial and impugning the integrity of its presiding judge.\n\nMatsuoka's notes reveal that Mrs. Sawyer began her speech by announcing that the Honolulu trial was \"to get at the ILWU [International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 658]\n\u00a0\n Union].\" She next said that \"she wanted to tell about some rather shocking and horrible things that go on at the trial.\" The opinion of MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN views these remarks as merely \"introductory\" to her later \"general\" comments, neglecting the fact that most of her later comments were not general at all but related directly to the trial of Hall, and similarly neglecting the entire milieu in which the speech was delivered. The remarks were \"introductory,\" but introductory in that they set the tone and temper of all that followed. There is ample testimony that her audience so understood the remarks. Their understanding was justified by what she said, and that they so reasonably understood what she said establishes the reasonableness of the conclusion that she intended them so to understand. This is the way the speech was remembered by one of her audience.\n\n\"I think she gave a very excellent speech, and what I can remember quite well was that she said she would like to tell the audience of the horrible and shocking things that went on at the Smith Act trial in Honolulu, and she also gave several illustrations, but, I am sorry, I cannot remember them . . . .\"\n\n\n Another witness when asked if Mrs. Sawyer had said that there were shocking and horrible things going on, responded that those phrases had been specifically directed at the \"Jack Hall trial.\" Again, after testifying that Mrs. Sawyer had said the trial at Honolulu was not a fair trial, still another witness went on to say that \"she gave various examples of things, that I don't recall, that were going on, in what she called the horrifying, shocking trial.\"\n\nThat this theme of \"horrifying and shocking\" so forcefully impressed itself on the people to whom she spoke strips the words of any neutral interpretation, and certainly justifies, if it does not compel, the inference that it formed the motif for the entire speech. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 659]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThis evidence establishes more than that Mrs. Sawyer was attacking the conduct of the Honolulu trial at large. It clearly reflects on the judge who was permitting or participating in these \"shocking and horrible\" things; at the lowest it allows the inference to be drawn, as the Hawaii Supreme Court did draw the inference, that she did so reflect. To suggest that the only reasonable inference we may draw from her speech is that petitioner was indicting the general state of the law or merely reflecting on the prosecution, is to deny the obvious fact that when a lawyer harangues a lay audience, wholly unskilled in drawing subtle distinctions for exculpatory purposes, about the horrible and shocking things going on in a judicial proceeding, he inevitably reflects upon the total conduct of that trial and upon the integrity of all, not excluding the judge, responsible for the conduct of the trial. Certainly if we, as lawyers, were addressed by a doctor on the theme of the horrible and shocking things that go on at X hospital, and the speaker dwelt on specific examples of conduct at that particular hospital, we would not assume that merely the general sad state of medicine was being impugned rather than the doctors and the administrators at that hospital.\n\nPetitioner also declared in her speech that \"there's no fair trial in the case. they just make up the rules as they go along.\" And again, \"there's no such thing as a fair trial in a smith act case. all rules of evidence have to be scrapped or the government can't make a case.\" By an evaporating reading these comments are made to say that they \"obviously related to the state of the law, and to the conduct of the prosecution and the FBI . . . .\" But the materials used to illustrate these charges were specific examples of the unconscionable use of evidence drawn from this particular trial, as the defendant Hall himself pointed out at the hearing before the Legal Ethics Committee. In fact, a large part of the speech was taken up \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 660]\n\u00a0\n with such specific examples. To say that petitioner was attacking the \"state of the law,\" or the \"prosecution,\" or, what is more to the point, to suggest that this is the only conclusion the Hawaii court could reasonably draw, rejects the obvious force of the evidence that her references throughout were to the manner in which this particular trial was being conducted\n8\n and disregards, it cannot be too often emphasized, the whole tone, nature and setting of her speech.\n\nTo be sure, petitioner often did not specify who was guilty of the sins which she charged were being committed at this trial; the sins of unfairness, of ignoring or making up the rules, of doing \"anything and everything necessary to convict.\" When such broadside attacks are made a court is not compelled to make the ingenuous assumption that they were directed only at those who are legitimately subject to such attack, when it is made by a trial lawyer in the midst of a case in a haranguing speech to a public gathering. It takes no master of psychology to know that if the speaker does not discriminate neither will the audience. Inevitably the accusation covers all those who in the common understanding have responsibility. Whatever secret reservations the speaker may have when he speaks does not infuse what he conveys. Even the most sophisticated audience is not so trained in withholding judgment that the heavy and repeated charges of unfairness in the conduct of this trial impliedly relieved the presiding judge, who bears basic responsibility \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 661]\n\u00a0\n for judicial proceedings, of all responsibility for this unfairness.\n\nMore than that, the attack on the judge presiding at the trial does not rest merely on implication. It was direct and clear. Again the remarks about unfairness and the rules that were \"made up\" must be read not in isolation but in context. After outlining several examples of what she considered to be the outrageous evidence being admitted in this case, petitioner made her remark that there was \"no such thing as a fair trial in a smith act case. all rules of evidence have to be scrapped or the government can't make a case.\" Matsuoka's notes reveal that she then proceeded to illustrate this remark by relating that in an earlier case of hers, in which, the voluntariness of an accused's confession had been in issue, \"a woman came to her with report she heard vernon stevens [Stevens was a police officer] say he bet [sic] a confession out of one of them. she testified but the supreme court [of Hawaii] refused to let the evidence in because vernon stevens was not here and had no chance to deny this. with the same situation a federal judge sitting on a federal bench permits crouch\n9\n to testify about 27 years ago. what was said then. in the previous case it was the life and death of one. and yet here they permit a witness to tell what was said when a defendant was five years old.\" This graphic illustration was followed by the remark that \"there's no fair trial in the case. they just make up the rules as they go along.\" Crouch was a witness in the Honolulu trial whose testimony had been \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 662]\n\u00a0\n attacked earlier in the speech, and the \"federal judge\" was Judge Wiig who was presiding over that trial. This portion of the speech dispels any illusions that the condemnatory remarks made by petitioner could not reasonably be thought to relate to the conduct of this trial. In the context of the entire speech it is inescapably a direct reflection on the fairness and integrity of this particular judge in this particular case. This was no abstract assault on the rigors of hearsay. Petitioner attacked the fairness of the trial and the scrapping of the rules of evidence. She then pointed to a ruling of Judge Wiig which she said was highly prejudicial and hardly left doubt that it was made in this particular trial. She then repeated her charge that the trial was unfair and the rules made up. To suggest that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from these remarks is that the conduct of the prosecution or the law of evidence in the abstract was impugned, is really asking too much from judges, even if we accept Mr. Justice Holmes' view that judges \"are apt to be naif, simple-minded men.\" Holmes, Collected Legal Papers, p. 295. The attacks on fairness and the misuse of rules are made vivid by the illustration used - and that illustration directly involved Judge Wiig.\n10\n\u00a0\n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 663]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt is true that the charges which were found proven as the basis of the suspension did not state in terms that petitioner intended to obstruct justice. To reverse the two courts below on this ground is to resurrect the worst niceties of long-interred common-law pleading. The charges on the basis of which the petitioner was found guilty of misconduct are not to be read with \"the inability of the seventeenth century common law to understand or accept a pleading that did not exclude every misinterpretation capable of occurring to intelligence fired with a desire to pervert.\" Paraiso v. United States, \n207 \nU.S. 368, 372\n. It was found that her attacks on the fairness of the trial and the integrity of the judge at a \"public\" meeting, while she was actively engaged in the conduct of the defense, rose to the level of \"gross misconduct.\" This is not a charge of an attack made in a private conversation between friends. Whether there has been professional misconduct must depend upon the situation in which improper remarks were uttered. Thus, we would have to ignore what the Hawaii court had before it and was compelled to consider, did we not take into account the severely aggravating circumstances under which this speech was made. This attack was made at a public gathering announced as such. It was advertised as a discussion of the Smith Act trial then under way. That trial was a matter of great controversy and public interest \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 664]\n\u00a0\n and was being reported daily on the front page of the Honolulu newspapers.\n11\n It is true that the speech was made on the Island of Hawaii, not on Oahu where the trial took place. However, Hawaii in 1952 was not the inaccessible wilds of Africa in the time of Dr. Livingston, but part of a community bound together by modern means of communication and transportation, and news could be, and was in this very case, transmitted instantaneously by radiophone to Honolulu. See the Honolulu Star Bulletin for Dec. 15, 1952, p. 5. The news story of petitioner's speech was in the Honolulu newspapers the next day. Ibid. The speech was made at a time when motions concerning the very evidence which petitioner was castigating were still sub judice. The attacks on fairness, the descriptions of the trial as horrible and shocking, were made while the jury was open and receptive to media of communication, to the impregnating atmosphere to which juries, certainly in this country, are subjected. Even though petitioner may not have had a provable desire, the specific intent, to affect the pending trial and its outcome, are we really required to attribute to the petitioner a child-like unawareness of the inevitability that her remarks would be reported and find their way to judge or jury, as they did? The very next day the speech came to the judge's attention and registered so powerfully that he felt called upon to defend his conduct of the trial in open court.\n\nThe record is thus replete with evidence to support the conclusion that virtually the entire speech constituted a direct attack on the judicial conduct of this trial during its progress by one of the lawyers for the defense. When a lawyer attacks the fairness, the evenhandedness, and \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 665]\n\u00a0\n the integrity of the proceedings in a trial in which he himself is actively engaged, in the inflammatory, public fashion that this record reveals, supplemented with specific attack on the presiding judge, how can the conclusion be escaped that it was not rules of law in the abstract which were assailed, but the manner in which the processes of justice in the particular case were being conducted? More particularly, such an attack inescapably impugns the integrity of the judge. It is he who truly embodies the law as the guardian of the rights of defendants to justice under law. If a record is to be considered in its entirety, and not to be read through exculpatory glasses, the proof will be found to be conclusive that the findings of the Hawaii Supreme Court are supported by the evidence, and that, in relation to a pending trial, those findings constituted a fair basis for the conclusion that petitioner has \"committed . . . gross misconduct.\"\n\nHaving arrived at this conclusion, our task is at an end, and the order suspending Mrs. Sawyer from the practice of law for one year should be affirmed. But throughout the opinion of MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN runs the strong intimation that if the findings are supportable, a suspension based on them would be unconstitutional. This must be the import of the opinion's discussion of a lawyer's right to criticize law. For if we find that the evidence supports the findings, no matter what we think of the wisdom of suspending an attorney on the basis of such findings, we can only reverse if the Constitution so commands. Nor does it matter whether the suspension was based on an act of the Hawaii Legislature or was an exercise of the judicial power of the Hawaii Supreme Court. The controlling question is the power of a Territory, like a State, as a whole, whatever the organ through which a State speaks. Rippey v. Texas, \n193 \nU.S. 504, 509\n; Castillo v. McConnico, \n168 \nU.S. 674, 683\n; Missouri v. Dockery, \n191 \nU.S. 165, 171\n; Iowa-Des Moines National \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 666]\n\u00a0\n Bank v. Bennett, \n284 \nU.S. 239, 244\n; Skiriotes v. Florida, \n313 \nU.S. 69, 79\n. (There is no basis for suggesting that Congress has restricted the judicial power of Hawaii so as to bar the action taken by the Supreme Court of Hawaii.)\n\nThe problem raised by this case - is the particular conduct in which this petitioner engaged constitutionally protected from the disciplinary proceedings of courts of law? - cannot be disposed of by general observations about freedom of speech. Of course, the free play of the human mind is an indispensable prerequisite of a free society. And freedom of thought is meaningless without freedom of expression. But the two great Justices to whom we mostly owe the shaping of the constitutional protection of freedom of speech, Mr. Justice Holmes and Mr. Justice Brandeis, did not erect freedom of speech into a dogma of absolute validity nor enforce it to doctrinaire limits. Time, place and circumstances determine the constitutional protection of utterance. The First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment, insofar as it protects freedom of speech, are no exception to the law of life enunciated by Ecclesiastes: \"For everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven.\" And one of the instances specifically enumerated by the Preacher controls our situation: \"[A] time to keep silence, and a time to speak.\" Eccles. 3:1, 7. Of course, a lawyer is a person and he too has a constitutional freedom of utterance and may exercise it to castigate courts and their administration of justice. But a lawyer actively participating in a trial, particularly an emotionally charged criminal prosecution, is not merely a person and not even merely a lawyer. If the prosecutor in this case had felt hampered by some of the rulings of the trial judge, and had assailed the judge for such rulings at a mass meeting, and a conviction had followed, and that prosecutor had been disciplined for such conduct according to the \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 667]\n\u00a0\n orderly procedure for such disciplinary action, is it thinkable that this Court would have found that such conduct by the prosecutor was a constitutionally protected exercise of his freedom of speech, or, indeed, would have allowed the conviction to stand?\n\nOnly the other day, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Swan, Madden and Hincks, JJ.) severely rep-rimanded a United States attorney for a speech in response to a prior invitation by alumni of a law school but made while he was conducting an important criminal trial, although the speech contained no reference to the pending case or to any of its defendants but merely \"expatiated on the menace of organized crime.\" United States v. Stromberg, 268 F.2d 256, decided June 15, 1959. Even under the most favoring circumstances - an able, fearless, and fastidiously impartial judge, competent and scrupulous lawyers, a befittingly austere court-room atmosphere - trial by jury of a criminal case where public feeling is deeply engaged is no easy accomplishment, as every experienced lawyer knows, if due regard is to be had to the letter and spirit of the Constitution for such a trial. It is difficult enough to seal the court-room, as it were, against outside pressures. The delicate scales of justice ought not to be willfully agitated from without by any of the participants responsible for the fair conduct of the trial. To be sure, a prosecutor carries a somewhat heavier responsibility in the maintenance of the standards of criminal justice than does counsel for the defense. But the difference in responsibility is surely not so vast that counsel for defense has a constitutionally guarded freedom to conduct himself as this petitioner has been found to do, when that same conduct would bring condign punishment for the prosecutor.\n\nWhat we are concerned with is the specific conduct, as revealed by this record, of a particular lawyer, and not whether like findings applied to an abstract situation \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 668]\n\u00a0\n relating to an abstract lawyer would support a suspension. All the circumstances we have set forth must determine judgment. Here was a public meeting addressed by counsel for the defense, haranguing a crowd on the unfairness to the defendant of the proceedings in court, with the high probability indeed almost certainty under modern conditions that the goings-on of the meeting would come to the attention of the presiding judge and the jury. It took place in a case in which public interest and public tempers had been aroused. When the story of the meeting came to the attention of the judge, he felt obliged publicly to defend his conduct. It is hard to believe that this Court should hold that a member of the legal profession is constitutionally entitled to remove his case from the court in which he is an officer to the public and press, and express to them his grievances against the conduct of the trial and the judge. \"Legal trials,\" said this Court, \"are not like elections, to be won through the use of the meeting-hall, the radio, and the newspaper.\" Bridges v. California, \n314 \nU.S. 252, 271\n.\n\nEven in the absence of the substantial likelihood that what was said at a public gathering would reach the judge or jury, conduct of the kind found here cannot be deemed to be protected by the Constitution. An attorney actively engaged in the conduct of a trial is not merely another citizen. He is an intimate and trusted and essential part of the machinery of justice, an \"officer of the court\" in the most compelling sense. He does not lack for a forum in which to make his charges of unfairness or failure to adhere to principles of law; he has ample chance to make such claims to the courts in which he litigates. As long as any tribunal bred in the fundamentals of our legal tradition, ultimately this Court, still exercises judicial power those claims will be heard and heeded. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 669]\n\u00a0\n\n\nCertainly courts are not, and cannot be, immune from criticism, and lawyers, of course, may indulge in criticism. Indeed, they are under a special responsibility to exercise fearlessness in doing so. But when a lawyer goes before a public gathering and fiercely charges that the trial in which he is a participant is unfair, that the judge lacks integrity, the circumstances under which he speaks not only sharpen what he says but he imparts to his attack inflaming and warping significance. He says that the very court-room into which he walks to plead his case is a travesty, that the procedures and reviews established to protect his client from such conduct are a sham. \"We are a society governed by law, whose integrity it is the lawyer's special role to guard and champion.\" In re Howell, 10 N. J. 139, 142, 89 A. 2d 652, 653 (concurring opinion). No matter how narrowly conceived this role may be, it has been betrayed by a lawyer who has engaged in the kind of conduct here found by the Hawaii court. Certainly this Court, the supreme tribunal charged with maintaining the rule of law, should be the last place in which these attacks on the fairness and integrity of a judge and the conduct of a trial should find constitutional sanction.\n\nI would affirm the judgment.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] After the Bar Association had filed a complaint against Mrs. Sawyer, a complaint that was essentially in terms of findings of fact as to what she had said at Honokaa, a full investigation was made by the Legal Ethics Committee. This Committee then reported its findings of fact, conclusions and charges to the Hawaii Supreme Court which heard argument and made a de novo examination of the record. It is clear that these charges fully encompassed the basis for the Hawaii Supreme Court's own findings and that Mrs. Sawyer was fully and fairly apprised of the charges against her and the factual matters that were in dispute.\n\nThe Report of the Legal Ethics Committee, insofar as it was relevant to the speech, charged as follows:\n\n\"The Legal Ethics Committee . . . has investigated a complaint filed by the Bar Association of Hawaii and makes this report of the charges, facts and conclusions of the Committee pursuant to Rule 19.\n\n\n\"The Charges:\n\n\n\"The two charges made in this complaint have to do with (1) the alleged improper conduct of Mrs. Harriet Bouslog Sawyer, referred to in this report as `Mrs. Bouslog,' in making a speech at Honokaa, Hawaii, on December 14, 1952, and (2) the alleged improper conduct in connection with her interview of the juror David P. Fuller, as more fully set forth in the Bill of Particulars dated September 29, 1954.\n\n\n\"The Facts:\n\n\n\"The Committee finds that Mrs. Bouslog was one of the attorneys appearing for certain defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii entitled `United States of America, Plaintiff, against Charles Kazuyuki Fujimoto, et als., Defendants,' being Criminal 10495 in that Court; that on December 14, 1952, during the course of the trial, she made a speech at a public gathering at Honokaa, at which she said, among other things, that horrible and shocking things were going on at the trial; that there was no fair \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 652]\n\u00a0\n trial in the case; that they just made up the rules as they went along; that unless the Smith Act trial was stopped in its tracks in Honolulu there would be a new crime.\n\n.   .   .  .  .\n\n\n\n\"Conclusions and Recommendations:\n\n\n\"The Committee is of the unanimous opinion that the Bar Association of Hawaii has sustained the allegations in paragraphs II and III of its complaint and that Mrs. Bouslog, in imputing to the Judge unfairness in the conduct of the trial, in impugning the integrity of the local Federal courts and in other comments made at Honokaa, was guilty of violation of Canons 1 and 22 of the Canons of Professional Ethics of the American Bar Association and should be disciplined for the same.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Matsuoka notes are reprinted at 260 F.2d 205-207.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See Fujimoto v. United States, 251 F.2d 342.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See, e. g., the Honolulu Star Bulletin for the month of December. In fact, the same day on which Mrs. Sawyer's speech was reported, a banner, lead headline announced the latest court-room developments, while the story of the action taken by the court in response to the speech occupied the front page for the next few days. See the Honolulu Star Bulletin for Dec. 15, 1952, et seq.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The nature of the expansion was explained in the following colloquy between counsel and Matsuoka at the hearing before the Legal Ethics Committee:\n\n\"Q. You stated that the transcription of these notes were somewhat expanded from your original notes?\n\n\n\"A. Yes.\n\n\n\"Q. Would that also be true of the newspaper article?\n\n\n\"A. When I say expanded, I mean, like, when I take notes, I would not say, `Robert Dodge yesterday,' I would say, `Dodge,' or something like that, and expand that to make it understandable to the reader.\n\n\n\"Q. By expanding, not adding to it?\n\n\n\"A. No, not adding to.\n\n\n\"Q. Or an addition, or anything of that kind, but filling out what your notes indicated, is that it?\n\n\n\"A. That's right, by expanding on it.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] It is fair to say that approximately 80 of the about 140 lines of the Matsuoka notes as reprinted in the record deal specifically with this particular trial and the evidence which was being introduced in Honolulu. Of course, as we have explained above, many of the more general comments could, in the context of this speech, be reasonably taken to refer to the Honolulu trial.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Petitioner's lawyer had no doubt regarding the meaning and purport of the speech.\n\n\"I will say to the Committee right now - I have read these speeches and I would agree with the conclusion implicit in Mr. Dodge's question; namely that this was a talk about what was going on in the Smith Act trial here in Honolulu. Now, let's not fool ourselves about that. We're lawyers here.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Mrs. Sawyer herself, in explaining her remarks to the court, pointed out that part of her speech \"was devoted to a discussion of the evidence on which the prosecution in this case is seeking to convict Jack Hall and the other six defendants in this case. . . .\"\n\nThe record discloses that other witnesses also understood that her references were to the \"rules being made up as they went along\" at this particular trial.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] The fact that the notorious Crouch was involved is, of course, wholly irrelevant to the issues in this case. Any grievances arising out of Crouch's testimony were properly to be pursued in the orderly course of justice in trial and appellate courts and eventually here. See Communist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Board, \n351 \nU.S. 115\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Certainly Mrs. Sawyer's explanation of these remarks does not help us rationally to avoid Holmes' characterization. After a discussion of the refusal of the Hawaii Supreme Court to admit the evidence in the previous trial referred to by Mrs. Sawyer, petitioner was asked:\n\n\"Mr. Barlow: In other words, would it be fair to say that you paralleled that with the phrase that Mr. Matsuoka attributes to you: `With the same situation, a Federal judge, sitting on a Federal Bench, permits Crouch to testify about 27 years ago what was said then'?\n\n\n\"The Witness: I used the Palakiko-Majors case as a contrast to Mr. Crouch's testimony and the hearsay testimony in the conspiracy case. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 663]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Q. That Judge Wiig was allowing in the present Smith Act case, is that right?\n\n\n\"A. The motions hadn't been argued yet.\n\n\n\"Q. No, but that Judge Wiig was allowing in the present Smith Act case?\n\n\n\"A. Yes, he was.\n\n\n\"Q. That is what you were critical about? Is that right?\n\n\n\"A. I was reporting. I left that to the audience.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] See, e. g., the Honolulu Star Bulletin for the month of December. There are also references throughout the record to the notorious nature of the trial.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK, dissenting.\n\nWhile I join in the dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, I think it appropriate to add a few words by way of emphasis. Three different fact finders, including an administrative body, the Supreme Court of Hawaii, and a United States Court of Appeals, have agreed on the facts and conclusions of fact as shown by this record. Mrs. Sawyer, while of counsel in a Smith Act case then on trial before a jury, and Jack Hall, the chief defendant in the case, each made a speech before a large public \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 670]\n\u00a0\n gathering sponsored by a committee for Hall's defense. In Mrs. Sawyer's speech, she charged \"that horrible and shocking things were going on at said trial; that a fair trial was impossible; that all of the rules of evidence were being scrapped so the Government could make its case; that the rules of evidence and procedure were made up as the case proceeded; and that unless the trial was stopped in its tracks certain new crimes would be created.\" No one, least of all Mrs. Sawyer, denies that she said what she was charged with saying. Hawaii has declared her action gross misconduct violative of the Canons of Professional Ethics as adopted by its court.\n\nBut this Court says, strangely enough, that these facts are not \"capable of supporting the findings\" that in so doing Mrs. Sawyer \"impugned the integrity of the judge presiding . . . in the said pending case . . . and thus tended to also create disrespect for the courts of justice and judicial officers generally.\" 41 Haw., at 422. The principal opinion says that Mrs. Sawyer's conduct was merely an innocent general attack on the Smith Act and judicial trials held thereunder.\n\nBut this broad brush leaves the whitewash too thin. For not only Mrs. Sawyer's testimony but also the statement of her own lawyer stand out clear and unanswerable. At the initial hearing in Hawaii, Mrs. Sawyer's then counsel said that hers \"was a talk about what was going on in the Smith Act trial here in Honolulu. Now let's not fool ourselves about that.\" Her present counsel has talked the Court into doing just that and in so doing has also made a fool of our judicial processes.\n\nTo say that there is no reasonable support in the evidence for Hawaii's conclusion, as disclosed by a fair reading of the record some six and a half years later and some 5,000 miles away, is only to say that the 12 concurring officials, all of whom are trained in the law and who under oath made and passed upon these findings at trial and \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 671]\n\u00a0\n on appeal, arrived at a conclusion no reasonable man could reach. By thus at this late date second-guessing those constituted authorities who in regular course have decided the facts to the contrary, the Court impugns the intelligence of the 12 individuals so participating and scatters to the winds the sincere effort of the Supreme Court of Hawaii to preserve and protect its own integrity and respect as well as that of the law. I regret that the highest court in our land has today set these winds into motion - particularly in our farthest outpost - when respect for the courts, the bar, and the law, as well as for orderly procedure, is so much needed in the world. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 622, 672]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","82":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nIN THE MATTER OF DISBARMENT OF CROW(1959)\nNo. 594\nArgued: Decided: June 1, 1959\n\n\n  It is having been reported to the Court that John Harvey Crow, of Urbana, State of Ohio, has been disbarred from the practice of law in all the courts of the State of Ohio by judgment of the Common Pleas Court, Champagne County, State of Ohio, duly entered on the 16th day of August, A. D. 1956, and this Court by order or March 23, 1959, having suspended the said John Harvey Crow from the practice of law in this Court and directed that a rule issue requiring him to show cause why he should not be disbarred;\n  And it appearing that the said rule was duly issued and erv ed upon the respondent, who had filed a return thereto; now, upon consideration of the rule to show cause and the return aforesaid;\n  It is ordered that the said John Harvey Crow be, and he is hereby disbarred, and that his name be stricken from the roll of attorneys admitted to practice before the Bar of this Court.\n  Mr. Justice STEWART took no part in the consideration or decision of this matter.\n\n\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BLACK concurs, dissenting.\n  The disposition made of this disbarment proceeding does not conform to our practice. While admission to membership in our Bar is dependent on membership in a Bar of a State or other like political unit (Rule 5), dis- \n\n[359 \nU.S. 1007\n, 1008]\n\u00a0\n barment there does not automatically result in disbarment here. When a State disbars a lowyer, we suspended him and issue a rule to show cause why he should not be disbarred. He then has an opportunity to make a return, after which (or on expiration of 40 days if no response is made) 'the court will enter an appropriate order.' Rule 8.\n  If a return is made challenging the Fairness of the state proceedings that resulted in his disbarment there, it is our practice to appoint a committee to make an inquiry into the matter and submit a report and recommendation to us. That was done in Matter of Capshaw. Journal, February 12, 1945; . The committee there appointed reported and, acting on that report, we entered an order of disbarment. Journal, May 19, 1947; .\n  Crow has made a return in this case denying the charges against him, alleging they were 'manufactured.' He challenges the reliability of the witnesses who spoke against him, he insists that the testimony of some witnesses refutes the charges; he maintains that persons with dishonorable motives induced witnesses to testify falsely against him; he alleges that one of the judges who sat in the disbarment proceedings should have been disqualified.\n  Three of the charges relate to Crow's conduct in divorce proceedings. The Fourth involves a charge that $100 given him by a client for posting a bond was fourth involves a charge that $100 given\n  The charges are serious but no more so than those involved in the Capshaw case. It is for us to make our own determination as to the fitness of an attorney to remain on our rolls. State proceedings of disbarment, though presumptively correct, are not binding. See Sell- \n\n[359 \nU.S. 1007\n, 1009]\n\u00a0\n ing Radford, \n243 \nU.S. 46\n. This is not the first time that state disbarment proceedings have been challenged as lacking in procedural due process. See Isserman v. Ethics Committee, \n345 \nU.S. 927\n (dissent). Sometimes we can act on the face of the record as where no serious issues of fact are involved. See In re Isserman, \n345 \nU.S. 286\n, reversed \n348 \nU.S. 1\n. But the important questions presented here turn on factual issues. The return in this case contains allegations which, if proved, would suggest that the requirements of fair procedure, without which no citizen can be deprived of his livelihood, were not satisfied in the Ohio proceedings.\n  These complaints and Crow makes may prove to be as fanciful as he thinks the charges against him are. But we should act only after a report of a committee that reflects none of the feeling and prejudices of the community which has condemned Crow. \n\n\n\n","83":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nINGRAM v. UNITED STATES(1959)\nNo. 457\nArgued: April 30, 1959Decided: June 29, 1959\n\n\n\n\n The four petitioners and certain others were convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. 371 by conspiring to evade and defeat the payment of the federal taxes imposed on lottery operations. All of them had participated in the conduct of, and in an attempt to conceal, lottery operations which were violations of state law. Two of the petitioners were proprietors of the enterprise and were liable for the federal wagering taxes, and they failed to pay them. The other two were mere employees who were not liable for the payment of such taxes, and there was nothing in the record to show that they knew that the taxes had not been paid. Held:\n\n 1. The evidence was sufficient to support a conclusion that the two petitioners who were proprietors of the business were parties to an agreement to attempt to defeat or evade payment of the federal wagering taxes imposed upon them, and their convictions are sustained. Pp. 676-677.\n\n\n 2. Since there is nothing in the record to show that the two petitioners who were mere employees knew of the proprietors' liability for these taxes, the record is insufficient to show that they were parties to a conspiracy to evade and defeat the payment of such taxes, and their convictions cannot stand. Pp. 677-681.\n\n\n 259 F.2d 886, affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n\nWesley R. Asinof argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioners.\n\nJ. Dwight Evans, Jr. argued the cause for the United States. On the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Anderson, Beatrice Rosenberg and J. F. Bishop.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe petitioners and twenty-two others were indicted and tried for conspiracy to evade and defeat the payment \n\n[360 \nU.S. 672, 673]\n\u00a0\n of the federal taxes imposed on lottery operations. The petitioners and six others were convicted.\n1\n Their convictions were affirmed by the Court of Appeals. 259 F.2d 886. Certiorari was granted to examine the scope of the conspiracy statute in the context of these provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. \n358 \nU.S. 905\n.\n\nAt the trial it was established by overwhelming evidence that the petitioners had engaged with numerous others in a closely organized and large-scale operation of the numbers game in Atlanta, Georgia, during the years \n\n[360 \nU.S. 672, 674]\n\u00a0\n 1954 to 1957, the period covered by the indictment.\n2\n That activity is a criminal offense under Georgia law.\n3\n The evidence also established in intricate detail that the participants in this large-scale enterprise had, through a variety of carefully planned stratagems, made every effort to conceal its operation.\n4\n Finally, the evidence showed that none of the petitioners had paid any of the federal taxes in question. There was no direct evidence to show that any of the petitioners knew of these taxes.\n\nIn addition to the conspiracy count, the indictment under which the petitioners were tried also contained two additional counts charging them with the substantive offenses of willful failure to pay the special tax imposed by 4411 of the Internal Revenue Code,\n5\n in violation of 7203 of the Code,\n6\n and of failure to register as required by 4412 of the Code,\n7\n in violation of 7272 of the \n\n[360 \nU.S. 672, 675]\n\u00a0\n Code.\n8\n The trial took place subsequent to the announcement of this Court's decision in United States v. Calamaro, \n354 \nU.S. 351\n, and the district judge correctly instructed the jury that conviction of the substantive offenses would be justified only as to any defendants found to be \"writers,\" \"bankers,\" or to have \"a proprietary interest in such lottery operation.\" Two of the petitioners, Ingram and Jenkins, were found guilty on both substantive counts and do not question these convictions, conceding the sufficiency of the evidence to show that Ingram was the banker and that Jenkins had a proprietary interest in the enterprise. The evidence showed that the other two petitioners, Smith and Law, were relatively minor clerical functionaries at the headquarters of the operation, and they were acquitted on the substantive counts.\n\nIn sum, what this record presents then is a picture of a large-scale and profitable gambling business conducted in Atlanta over a period of several years by petitioners Ingram and Jenkins. The business involved many participants, including the petitioners Smith and Law. It was a business made criminal by the laws of Georgia, and everyone in the organization participated in trying to keep its operation secret. Ingram and Jenkins were liable for the federal taxes imposed by 4401 and 4411 of the Internal Revenue Code and willfully failed to pay them. They were required by 4412 of the Code to register with the official in charge of the Internal Revenue District, and they failed to do so. Smith and Law were not themselves subject to any of the taxes here involved. The question presented is whether this factual foundation is sufficient to support a conviction of the petitioners, or any of them, for conspiracy to attempt to evade or defeat federal taxes, \n\n[360 \nU.S. 672, 676]\n\u00a0\n \"the gravest of offenses against the revenues.\" Spies v. United States, \n317 \nU.S. 492, 499\n. We hold that it was sufficient as to Ingram and Jenkins, and insufficient as to Smith and Law.\n\nAs to Ingram and Jenkins, the record is clear. They were entrepreneurs in a vast and profitable gambling business. They were clearly liable for the special taxes and registration requirements that the Federal Government has imposed upon the operators of that kind of business. United States v. Kahriger, \n345 \nU.S. 22\n. Not only did they willfully fail and neglect to pay these taxes, but they conspired to conceal the operation of the business and the source of the income upon which the tax is imposed.\n\nIn Spies v. United States this Court had occasion to consider the quantum and type of evidence required to support a conviction for the substantive offense of attempting to defeat or evade federal taxes as contrasted with the lesser proof required to convict of the misdemeanor of willfully failing to file a return or to pay a tax. It was there said:\n\n\"Willful but passive neglect of the statutory duty may constitute the lesser offense, but to combine with it a willful and positive attempt to evade tax in any manner or to defeat it by any means lifts the offense to the degree of felony.\n\n\n \"Congress did not define or limit the methods by which a willful attempt to defeat and evade might be accomplished and perhaps did not define lest its effort to do so result in some unexpected limitation. Nor would we by definition constrict the scope of the Congressional provision that it may be accomplished `in any manner.' By way of illustration, and not by way of limitation, we would think affirmative willful attempt may be inferred from conduct such as keeping a double set of books, making false entries or \n\n[360 \nU.S. 672, 677]\n\u00a0\n alterations, or false invoices or documents, destruction of books or records, concealment of assets or covering up sources of income, handling of one's affairs to avoid making the records usual in transactions of the kind, and any conduct, the likely effect of which would be to mislead or to conceal. If the tax-evasion motive plays any part in such conduct the offense may be made out even though the conduct may also serve other purposes such as concealment of other crime.\" \n317 \nU.S., at 499\n.\n\n\n In Spies, the Court was dealing with the substantive offense, not with a conspiracy to commit it. But the evidence of agreement between Ingram and Jenkins to operate this gambling enterprise, which operation made them liable for federal taxes, and to conceal its operation and its income is clear on this record, and is virtually conceded by the petitioners. The evidence was sufficient to support a conclusion that they were engaged not only in a conspiracy to operate and conceal their gambling enterprise, but that they were also parties to an agreement to attempt to defeat or evade the federal taxes imposed upon the operators of such a business.\n\nAs to Smith and Law, the case is quite a different one. While the record clearly supports a finding that Smith and Law were participants in a conspiracy to operate a lottery and to conceal that operation from local law enforcement agencies, we find no warrant for a finding that they were, like Ingram and Jenkins, parties to a conspiracy with a purpose illegal under federal law. Certainly there is nothing in the record to show that Smith and Law knew that Ingram and Jenkins had not paid the taxes, a fact obviously within the knowledge of the latter.\n\nIt is fundamental that a conviction for conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. 371 cannot be sustained unless there is \"proof \n\n[360 \nU.S. 672, 678]\n\u00a0\n of an agreement to commit an offense against the United States.\" Pereira v. United States, \n347 \nU.S. 1, 12\n. There need not, of course, be proof that the conspirators were aware of the criminality of their objective, but an essential ingredient of the proof was knowledge on the part of Smith and Law that Ingram and Jenkins were liable for federal taxes by reason of the gambling operation. \"Without the knowledge, the intent cannot exist.\" Direct Sales Co. v. United States, \n319 \nU.S. 703, 711\n.\n\n\"[C]onspiracy to commit a particular substantive offense cannot exist without at least the degree of criminal intent necessary for the substantive offense itself.\"\n9\n The substantive offense which Smith and Law were accused of conspiring to commit was the willful evasion of federal taxes, an offense which, even presuming knowledge of the tax law, obviously cannot be committed in the absence of knowledge of willfulness. Spies v. United States, supra. Cf. United States v. Falcone, \n311 \nU.S. 205\n.\n\n\n Indulging, as of course we must, in that view of the evidence most favorable to the Government, we simply cannot discern adequate foundation in the present record for a finding that Smith and Law had such knowledge of Ingram's and Jenkins' wagering tax liability. The record is completely barren of any direct evidence of such knowledge. It was not shown, for example, that any reference had ever been made by any of the petitioners to possible tax liability, or that they had filed a return or paid a tax in previous years. The Government relied instead upon evidence which, it asserts, circumstantially proved the requisite knowledge on the part of Smith and Law. These circumstances were simply the intimate connection of Smith and Law with the operation of the lottery itself, \n\n[360 \nU.S. 672, 679]\n\u00a0\n their cooperation in conducting it secretly,\n10\n and their apparent knowledge that it was conducted at a profit. The Government points out that not only would payment of the taxes have decreased the profits to be derived from operation of the lottery, but in addition would have required registration, including the names and addresses of the bankers and writers, with the local internal revenue office and the posting of a wagering tax stamp at the place of business. 26 U.S.C. (Supp. V) 4412, 6806 (c). The information contained in the registration would have been available to local law enforcement officials. 26 U.S.C. (Supp. V) 6107.\n\nYet these circumstances actually are colorless as to the vital issue of knowledge on the part of Smith and Law that their superiors owed federal wagering taxes. Certainly the secrecy of the operation did not go to show that knowledge. This is not a case where efforts at concealment would be reasonably explainable only in terms of motivation to evade taxation. Here, the criminality of the enterprise under local law provided more than sufficient reason for the secrecy in which it was conducted. A conspiracy, to be sure, may have multiple objectives. United States v. Rabinowich, \n238 \nU.S. 78, 86\n, and if one of its objectives, even a minor one, be the evasion of \n\n[360 \nU.S. 672, 680]\n\u00a0\n federal taxes, the offense is made out, though the primary objective may be concealment of another crime. See Spies v. United States, supra, at 499. But the fact that payment of the federal taxes by Ingram and Jenkins might have resulted in disclosure of the lottery and subsequent prosecution of Smith and Law by local authorities would permit an inference that concealment of the lottery was motivated by a purpose to evade payment of federal taxes only if, independently, there were proof that Smith and Law knew of the tax liability. Evidence that Smith and Law might have wanted the taxes to be evaded if they had known of them, and that they engaged in conduct which could have been in furtherance of a plan to evade the taxes if they had known of them, is not evidence that they did know of them.\n\nWhat was said in Direct Sales Co. v. United States on behalf of a unanimous Court is of particular relevance here:\n\n\"Without the knowledge, the intent cannot exist. . . . Furthermore, to establish the intent, the evidence of knowledge must be clear, not equivocal. . . . This, because charges of conspiracy are not to be made out by piling inference upon inference, thus fashioning . . . a dragnet to draw in all substantive crimes.\" \n319 \nU.S., at 711\n.\n\n\n Smith and Law were not liable for the wagering tax. United States v. Calamaro, supra. They could not, therefore, have been convicted of the crime which they were charged with having conspired to commit. To sustain their conviction on this record would make of the crime of conspiracy just that \"dragnet to draw in all substantive crimes\" against which the Court warned in Direct Sales. Cf. Gebardi v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 112\n. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 672, 681]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAccordingly, while affirming the convictions of Ingram and Jenkins, we hold that the motions for acquittal of Smith and Law should have been sustained by the District Court, and that the Court of Appeals was in error in affirming their convictions.\n\n    Judgment accordingly.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BLACK took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 4401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 provides:\n\n\"(a) Wagers. - There shall be imposed on wagers, as defined in section 4421, an excise tax equal to 10 percent of the amount thereof.\n\n.  .  .   .   .\n\n\n\n\"(c) Persons liable for tax. - Each person who is engaged in the business of accepting wagers shall be liable for and shall pay the tax under this subchapter on all wagers placed with him.

Among the items found on that occasion were some 2,400 scratch pads of the type used in numbers operations, thousands of coin wrappers, a police alarm radio, with a secret code of police calls, two high-frequency radios, and six fictitious automobile registrations with license tags. Petitioner Ingram was alleged to have stated in 1955 that the \"business is down to about\" $3,500 per day.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Georgia Code (1953 Revision), 26-6502.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] There was extensive evidence, for example, that participants in the enterprise used false license plates on their automobiles, took evasive routes to the \"check-up headquarters\" of the operation, used false names on occasion, and attempted to bribe local law enforcement officers.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] See Note 1, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] This section of the Code provides: \"Any person required under this title to pay any . . . tax, . . . who willfully fails to pay such . . . tax; . . . shall . . . be guilty of a misdemeanor . . . .\" 68A Stat. 851.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] This section of the Code provides: \"Each person required to pay a special tax under this subchapter shall register with the official in charge of the internal revenue district - . . . .\" 68A Stat. 527.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] This section of the Code provides: \"Any person who fails to register with the Secretary or his delegate as required by this title . . . shall be liable to a penalty of $50.\" 68A Stat. 866.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] See \"Developments in the Law - Criminal Conspiracy,\" 72 Harv.

United States, \n344 \nU.S. 604\n; and Krulewitch v. United States, \n336 \nU.S. 440\n, do not, as petitioners appear to contend, prevent the jury from treating this subsidiary objective as an element of the conspiracy. Those cases hold only that the life of the conspiracy cannot be extended by evidence of concealment after the conspiracy's criminal objectives have been fully accomplished. \". . . [A] vital distinction must be made between acts of concealment done in furtherance of the main criminal objectives of the conspiracy, and acts of concealment done after these central objectives have been attained, for the purpose only of covering up after the crime.\" Grunewald v. United States, supra, at 405.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\nThe constitutional validity of the occupational tax provisions on persons engaged in the business of accepting wagers has been established by United States v. Kahriger, \n345 \nU.S. 22\n. In construing those provisions, however, we have held that no weight can be given to the suggestion that they must be interpreted on the premise that their enactment was \"`in part motivated by a congressional desire to suppress wagering.'\" United States v. Calamaro, \n354 \nU.S. 351\n. In that case we held that only \"writers,\" \"bankers,\" or those who have \"a proprietary interest\" in a lottery operation are subject to the taxing statutes, and that therefore only those persons can be held for violation of their substantive provisions.\n\nIn this case the Government has in effect sought to by-pass Calamaro by the simple expedient of indicting persons connected with a lottery operation not for the substantive offenses proscribed by the Internal Revenue Code, but instead for conspiring with those members of the lottery operation who are personally subject to the relevant excise taxes to evade payment of those taxes. Two essential elements of the crime, first, knowledge that the taxes are due, and, second, a \"willful and positive \n\n[360 \nU.S. 672, 682]\n\u00a0\n attempt to evade tax in any manner or to defeat it by any means,\" Spies v. United States, \n317 \nU.S. 492, 499\n, are sought to be established here by the naked fact that the lottery operation was carefully concealed by all who participated in it. Since lotteries are unlawful in virtually every State, more particularly in Georgia where this enterprise was carried on, and therefore require concealment if they are to continue to operate, to permit a conviction on such evidence alone would relegate Calamaro to the status of an unmeaningful relic. The opinion of the Court convincingly demonstrates why the evidence in the case does not support a finding by the jury that petitioners Smith and Law knew that a tax was owing by petitioners Ingram and Jenkins, and that they undertook acts of concealment for the purpose, in whole or in part, of aiding an evasion of that tax.\n\nBut I think that the very considerations which lead the Court to reverse the conviction of Smith and Law equally require a reversal as to Ingram and Jenkins. An indispensable element of the crime of tax evasion is knowledge that a tax is imposed. This knowledge may be proved directly or circumstantially. Here there is no direct proof, and the sole circumstantial evidence relied on by the Government is the fact of concealment of the lottery operation. But if, as the Court holds, \"certainly the secrecy of the operation did not go to show . . . knowledge\" by Smith and Law that their superiors were liable for a federal tax, I am at a loss to understand how this factor can at the same time suffice to show knowledge on the part of petitioners Ingram and Jenkins that they themselves were liable for a federal tax. The latter no less than the former must be shown to have actual knowledge that a tax is owing before they can be convicted of a conspiracy to evade that tax, and the Court's reasoning plainly demonstrates to me that the Government has made no such showing in this case. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 672, 683]\n\u00a0\n\n\nI think that sight has been lost of the fact that this is a prosecution for conspiracy to violate a federal taxing statute, not for violation of local gambling laws. An overwhelming showing has been made that petitioners were participants in a large lottery enterprise, but that does not suffice to support conviction of the crime with which they are here charged. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 672, 684]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","84":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nINMAN v.

On the brief were C. G. Roetzel and John L. Rogers, Jr.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner brought this action under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, 35 Stat. 65, 45 U.S.C. 51, for personal injuries sustained in the course of his employment. Petitioner for some seven years had been a railroad crossing watchman for respondent at \"Bettes Corners\" in Akron, Ohio. He filed suit claiming damages for an injury he received when an intoxicated automobile driver ran into him one midnight while he was on duty flagging traffic for a passing train. Bettes Corners is a heavily traveled vehicular intersection where Tallmadge Avenue, running east and west, is intersected by Home Avenue, which runs northeast and southwest. Three sets of railroad tracks cut diagonally across the intersection in a northwest-southeast direction. The driver of the automobile, heading northeast on Home Avenue, was turning \n\n[361 \nU.S. 138, 139]\n\u00a0\n left into Tallmadge Avenue when the accident occurred. Petitioner claims that the railroad \"was negligent in failing to use ordinary care to provide . . . a reasonable safe place to work\" at the crossing. He says that his duties - including the flagging of traffic, maintenance of a lookout for other trains, and the reporting of hotboxes on the passing ones - required him to face the train tracks and created a likelihood of his being struck by automobiles at the intersection.\n\nThe evidence of the manifold duties of petitioner is clear. The evidence of his exposure to injury by traffic includes the layout of Bettes Corners, the cut of the railroad tracks across it, and the duties petitioner was required to perform. Petitioner says that the layout of the crossing was hazardous for one performing the duties assigned to him. In support of this, he points to the answer of one witness as to the action of the car which struck him. This witness stated that, \"like a lot of them I seen there, jumping the gun\" at the crossing, the driver of this car, on seeing the tail light of the train approaching, drove around the line of cars on the street adjacent to the train and, as he was turning left onto the other street, hit petitioner, who was standing near the passing train and flagging the traffic. There is no claim that the intersection was dark or that the regular railroad crossing warning, lights, bells, etc., were not properly working at the time. Nor is it disputed that the petitioner was waving a lighted lantern in each hand. Likewise the intoxicated condition of the driver is not in controversy, nor is the fact that he passed through a traffic stop sign immediately before hitting petitioner and violated other local traffic safety measures designed to protect persons from injury at the crossing.\n\nThe trial court submitted the issue of negligence to the jury, which found the railroad negligent \"in part\" because it failed to afford \"enough protection.\" Judgment for \n\n[361 \nU.S. 138, 140]\n\u00a0\n petitioner was entered on the verdict for $25,000. The Court of Appeals of Ohio reversed, finding that \"there was a complete failure of proof to establish the negligence.\" It said that it was not \"reasonably foreseeable\" that petitioner \"would be injured by the actions of a drunken driver, violating five traffic statutes . . . .\" 108 Ohio App. 124, 131, 161 N. E. 2d 60, 66. After the Supreme Court of Ohio dismissed the appeal, 168 Ohio St. 335, 154 N. E. 2d 442, we granted certiorari, \n359 \nU.S. 958\n.\n\nIn Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., \n352 \nU.S. 500\n (1957), we laid down the rule that \"[j]udicial appraisal of the proofs to determine whether a jury question is presented is narrowly limited to the single inquiry whether, with reason, the conclusion may be drawn that negligence of the employer played any part at all in the injury or death.\" Id., at 506-507. In measuring Ohio's disposition of the case here by the Rogers yardstick, we must affirm. The Act does not make the employer an insurer. Here petitioner had been working at Bettes Corners for seven years, performing these same duties under like circumstances and, for some three years, on this identical midnight shift. No accidents had occurred during that long period. In light of this background, we believe that the evidence here was so thin that, on a judicial appraisal, the conclusion must be drawn that negligence on the part of the railroad could have played no part in petitioner's injury.\n\nThe contention of petitioner is that the witness' remark, \"like a lot of them I seen there, jumping the gun,\" was testimony of other occurrences at the crossing similar to the one here involved. The burden of proving that the crossing was an unsafe place to work was on petitioner. It depended on some type of testimony showing the hazards at the crossing. There is no evidence of complaint to the railroad, nor is there other testimony of similar occurrences in the record. In making \n\n[361 \nU.S. 138, 141]\n\u00a0\n the judicial appraisal of this tenuous proof, Ohio's Court of Appeals held it not sufficient. It found that there was \"no evidence of prior occurrences of the kind here under consideration\" in the record. Indeed, unless these 11 words of the witness can be said with reason to be sufficient, there is none. Under such circumstances, they are too slender a reed for us to say that the decision of Ohio's court is erroneous.\n\nWe therefore conclude, in light of these considerations, that the judgment must be\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER.\n\nThe opinion of my Brother CLARK demonstrates, insofar as demonstration is possible in law, that this case should never have been brought here. In accordance with the views that I expressed in Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., \n352 \nU.S. 500, 524\n (1957), and in which I have since persisted, the appropriate disposition would be dismissal of the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted. If these views were enforced under the special circumstances of this case, affirmance by an equally divided Court would result. Thereby this case would be cast into the limbo of unexplained adjudications, and the lower courts, as well as the profession, would be deprived of knowing the circumstances of this litigation and the basis of our disposition of it. Since I have registered my conviction on what I believe to be the proper disposition of the case, it is not undue compromise with principle for me to join Brother CLARK'S opinion in order to make possible a Court opinion.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER, concurring.\n\nI heartily join the Court's opinion. But I derive no pleasure from implying, contrary to the views of my Brothers in the minority, that there was such complete want of evidence of negligence by respondent that \"reasonable \n\n[361 \nU.S. 138, 142]\n\u00a0\n men\" could not differ about it, for, at the very least, I regard my Brothers who dissent as reasonable men.\n\nNotwithstanding this, it seems to me that the facts of this case make it crystal clear that the Court's opinion lacks not a whit in fully comporting with the standards of care of the mythical \"reasonable man,\" for, like the Ohio Court of Appeals, I simply cannot see any substantial evidence - or even a scintilla or an iota of evidence - of negligence on the part of respondent that caused, or directly contributed in any degree to cause, petitioner's unfortunate injury.\n\nReduced to substance, the simple facts are that petitioner, a crossing flagman, while standing in a well-lighted intersection alongside a passing train in the nighttime and swinging a lighted red lantern in each hand, was struck, knocked down and run over by a drunken driver. What, I ask, did respondent do or omit that caused or contributed to cause that casualty? How could it have prevented the casualty? Petitioner says that respondent failed to provide him with \"enough protection.\" About the only way, as I perceive, that respondent could protect its crossing flagmen against injury from such lawless conduct by third persons would be to provide them with military tanks and make sure they stay in them while within or moving about crossing-intersections in the performance of their duties - and I am not even sure that this method, though ironclad, would be certain protection to a flagman against lawless injury by third persons, for someone might shoot him, an act not very different, it seems to me, from the drunken driver's conduct which injured petitioner in this case, and for which injuries he insists, and four members of this Court agree, a jury should be permitted to require respondent to pay damages. How this can be thought to square with any known concept of \"negligence\" by respondent is beyond me. \n\n[361 \nU.S. 138, 143]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN concur, dissenting.\n\nPetitioner, a nighttime crossing watchman stationed at respondent's railroad intersection, was seriously injured about midnight when an automobile driven by an intoxicated person ran into him from behind while he was flagging traffic for a passing train. The jury found on a special interrogatory that respondent was negligent in not providing \"enough protection.\"\n\nThe crossing is at Tallmadge and Home Avenues. Tallmadge runs east and west; Home, northeast and southwest. Three of respondent's tracks, running northwest and southeast, extend through the intersection of these two streets, and its trains move over the parallel tracks in opposite directions and often near the same time.\n\nThere was evidence that at the approach of a train petitioner had duties of the following character: (1) He was supposed to flag highway traffic moving in four directions to a stop, using lanterns and a whistle provided for that purpose. (2) If a second train was to pass at or about the time of another, he had to look for it before clearing the highway traffic. (3) He was to look for hotboxes on all passing trains and signal the conductor if he discovered any. (4) If a train was going east, he was to stand on the west side of the tracks the better to see trains coming from the west.\n\nOn the night in question petitioner received a signal that an eastbound train was approaching. Accordingly, he stationed himself a few feet west of the tracks, blowing the whistle and swinging the red lantern first toward Tallmadge Avenue traffic and then toward Home Avenue traffic. Then he stationed himself facing the tracks, his back to Tallmadge Avenue traffic.\n\nAlthough respondent's tracks intersect Tallmadge and Home Avenues where those two streets cross, it is possible \n\n[361 \nU.S. 138, 144]\n\u00a0\n for a car going north on Home to make a left turn into Tallmadge even while a train is passing. There is, however, a stop sign on Home; and petitioner rightfully had halted all highway traffic. Nevertheless an intoxicated driver came through the stop sign on Home and made a squealing left turn into Tallmadge, hitting petitioner and injuring him.\n\nThere was evidence that at the time of the accident (1) the caboose of the passing train was just making the crossing; (2) the railroad block signal could not be seen from where petitioner stood; (3) another train from the opposite direction on the adjoining track was due to reach the crossing at any moment and petitioner was looking for its headlight; (4) petitioner remained standing with his back to the highway traffic as he was obliged to do if he performed these manifold duties; (5) this traffic was heavy in both streets; (6) on prior occasions cars had \"jumped the gun\" at this same intersection.\n\nIt may be that if the duty of the petitioner had been restricted to stopping traffic on the approach of a train and waving it on when the train had passed, there would be on this record (unlike that in Cahill v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co., \n351 \nU.S. 183\n)\n1\n no evidence of negligence on respondent's part. Petitioner's duties were much broader, as I have indicated. Yet the Court holds there was no jury question as to whether the place chosen for the performance of those several duties was a reasonably safe one in light of all the circumstances, including the volume of traffic at that intersection. Plainly respondent is not an insurer. It is under no duty to remove all possibilities of injury to its employees or to make, at any cost, the place of work as safe as one's living room. But whether a particular hazard is of sufficient weight and moment to induce a reasonable person to guard against it and whether that \n\n[361 \nU.S. 138, 145]\n\u00a0\n danger could be removed or diminished by safety measures reasonably available are matters for the jury to determine. The jury might find that the assignment of part of petitioner's duties to someone else or the installation of mechanical devices to stop traffic would have been undertaken by a reasonable person under the circumstances. It is not clear beyond argument of reasonable men that the respondent could not have foreseen an injury to petitioner by a reckless motorist or that it took every precaution that reasonableness under the circumstances required.\n\nThe nature of this congested crossing with three sets of railroad tracks cutting diagonally across its four corners and the multiple duties required of petitioner at this hour of the night, were sufficient in my view for a jury to find that petitioner was too busy to protect himself from the vehicular traffic and that the employer did not use reasonable care in furnishing him with a safe place to work, as required by the Act. Bailey v. Central Vermont R. Co., \n319 \nU.S. 350\n. The very close division in this Court on that issue reinforces my conclusion.\n\nThere is no reason why a negligent actor should be insulated from the consequences of his negligence merely because a third party's reckless or criminal act was the immediate cause of the injury. On the contrary, we have unanimously held that the fact that the danger to the employee under the Act lies in intentional or criminal conduct of third parties is not determinative. If foreseeable, there is a duty to make reasonable provisions against such events. Lillie v. Thompson, \n332 \nU.S. 459\n. The instructions on this point seem to me to be adequate.\n2\n The \n\n[361 \nU.S. 138, 146]\n\u00a0\n Court appears to place great stress on the lack of evidence of prior accidents at this intersection and the fact that petitioner worked there for seven years before being hit by an automobile. But certainly the duty to make a reasonable effort to provide a safe place of work is not conditioned upon an employee's first being injured or killed. Moreover, the liability of the railroad under the Act attaches even though the injury was caused only \"in part\" by its negligence. Such is the command of 1 of the Act, as repeatedly applied. See Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., \n352 \nU.S. 500, 506\n-507; Cahill v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co., supra.\n\nThough I think affirmance of the judgment is error, I am happy that we have a full Court turning its attention to an important question of law - whether trial by jury, guaranteed by the Seventh Amendment and an integral part of the remedy provided by Congress under this Act, has been honored by the courts. Moreover, as my Brother FRANKFURTER points out, affirmance of the judgment below by an equally divided Court would deprive the decision of all precedential value, so important in this as in other fields. Furthermore, the withdrawal of a Justice from a decision on the merits after certiorari has been granted impairs the integrity of the practice of allowing the vote of four Justices to bring up any case on certiorari.\n3\n Participation by the whole Court at least in some of these cases (cf. Reynolds v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., \n336 \nU.S. 207, 209\n) is partial performance of our pledge to Congress.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] For the opinion below see 224 F.2d 637.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] \"After an accident has happened it is usually easy to see how it could have been avoided but negligence is not a matter to be judged after an occurrence. It is always a question of what reasonably prudent persons under like or similar circumstances would or should have anticipated in the exercise of ordinary care. Where \n\n[361 \nU.S. 138, 146]\n\u00a0\n there is no danger reasonably to be anticipated or apprehended, there is no duty to guard against something that in the minds of reasonable men does not exist. However, if such expectation carries a realization that a given set of circumstances is suggestive of danger, then failure to take appropriate safety measures constitutes negligence.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See the legislative history in Harris v.

U.S.(1959)\nNo. 18\nArgued: November 13, 1958Decided: January 12, 1959\n\n\n\n\n1. \nThe Government's civil complaint charging appellants with a combination and conspiracy in unreasonable restraint of trade and commerce among the States in the promotion, broadcasting and televising of professional world championship boxing contests, as well as a conspiracy to monopolize and monopolization of the same, in violation of 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, was sustained by this Court as stating a cause of action, and the case was remanded for trial on the merits. \n348 \nU.S. 236\n. After a trial, the District Court, in an opinion incorporating detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law based on the principles laid down by this Court, found that the allegations of the complaint had been sustained, and adjudged that appellants had violated 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. Held: The District Court's findings are not clearly erroneous, and its judgment on the merits is affirmed. Pp. 244-252.\n\n (a) The District Court's finding that the relevant market was the promotion of championship boxing contests, in contrast to all professional boxing contests, was not clearly erroneous and it is sustained. Pp. 249-252.\n\n\n2. \nAfter further hearings on the nature and extent of the relief necessary to protect the public interest, the District Court entered a final judgment dissolving the two international boxing clubs, directing the individual appellants to divest themselves of their stock in Madison Square Garden and granting injunctive relief designed to open up the market in the business of promoting professional world championship boxing matches. Held: The relief granted was not beyond the allowable discretion of the District Court and its judgment is affirmed. Pp. 253-263.\n\n (a) At the time of the final decree, the Joe Louis agreements had lapsed; the exclusive-contract practice had been abandoned at least temporarily; the leases on Yankee Stadium, the Polo Grounds and St. Nicholas Arena in New York had been given up; and the appellants had no control over the new heavyweight champion; \n\n[358 \nU.S. 242, 243]\n\u00a0\n but this Court agrees with the District Court that the additional evidence taken by it showed that appellants still possessed all of the power of monopoly and restraint. Pp. 254-255.\n\n\n (b) Even if the individual appellants' stock in Madison Square Garden was lawfully acquired and was not the fruit of the conspiracy, it had been utilized to effect the purposes of the conspiracy and could be so used again, and the record supports the District Court's conclusion that they should be required to divest themselves of this stock in order to break up the unlawful combination and restore competition in championship boxing contests - without being granted the alternative options requested by them. Pp. 255-259.\n\n\n (c) Since the two international boxing clubs were formed pursuant to the conspiracy and were the means used to effectuate it, the requirement that they be dissolved was justified. Pp. 259-261.\n\n\n (d) The District Court having found that one of the means used in effectuating the conspiracy was the ownership and control of arenas and stadia, the requirement of the decree that Madison Square Garden and the Chicago Stadium be rented to any qualified promoter at a reasonable rental, subject to specified conditions, was justified. Pp. 261-262.\n\n\n (e) Practical considerations justify the prohibition against exclusive contracts with contestants, even though they apply not only to championship bouts but to all professional boxing contests, thus going beyond the \"relevant market\" considered for the purposes of determining the Sherman Act violations. P. 262.\n\n\n 150 F. Supp. 397, affirmed.\n\nKenneth C. Royall argued the cause for appellants. On the brief were Mr. Royall and John F. Caskey for the Madison Square Garden Corporation et al., and Charles Sawyer for the International Boxing Club, Inc., of Illinois, et al.\n\nPhilip Elman argued the cause for the United States. On the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Hansen and Charles H. Weston. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 242, 244]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis civil Sherman Act\n1\n case was here four years ago on direct appeal from a dismissal by the District Court, which had held that the Act did not apply to the business of professional boxing. We reversed, finding that \"the complaint states a cause of action [under the Act] and that the Government is entitled to an opportunity to prove its allegations,\" and remanded the case for trial on the merits. United States v. International Boxing Club, \n348 \nU.S. 236\n (1955). The complaint charged the appellants with a combination and conspiracy in unreasonable restraint of trade and commerce among the States in the promotion, broadcasting, and televising of professional world championship boxing contests, as well as a conspiracy to monopolize and monopolization of the same. After a trial, the District Court, in an opinion incorporating detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law based on the principles laid down in our earlier opinion, found that the allegations of the complaint had been sustained. 150 F. Supp. 397. After further hearings on the nature and extent of the relief necessary to protect the public interest, the court entered its final judgment dissolving two of the corporate appellants, directing divestiture of certain stock owned by the individual appellants and granting injunctive relief designed to open up the market in the business of promoting professional world championship boxing matches.\n\nThe appellants, while not attacking any specific finding as clearly erroneous, claim that the proof did not show that they violated either Section 1 or 2 of the Act. In this regard appellants level their strongest blows at the District Court's definition of the relevant market. Out of the entire field of professional boxing, the District Court carved a market in championship contests alone, holding \n\n[358 \nU.S. 242, 245]\n\u00a0\n it to be the relevant market at which the conspiracy was aimed. In the alternative, appellants insist that the relief granted the Government was \"unnecessarily punitive,\" even if liability is assumed. On a direct appeal to this Court we noted probable jurisdiction, \n356 \nU.S. 910\n (1958). We have concluded that the findings of the District Court are not clearly erroneous and that in view of our former holding on the sufficiency of the complaint the judgment on the merits was properly entered. As to the relief granted we find that the court did not exceed the limits of allowable discretion in framing a decree \"that will, so far as practicable, cure the ill effects of the illegal conduct, and assure the public freedom from its continuance.\" United States v. United States Gypsum Co., \n340 \nU.S. 76, 88\n (1950).\n\nOur previous decision herein having decided that the promotion of professional championship boxing contests on an interstate basis constituted trade and commerce among the States, within the meaning of the Sherman Act, there is no contest here either on the findings or the law on that point. Since on that appeal we discussed in some detail the allegations of the complaint, which the trial court has now found amply proven by the evidence, we shall only summarize the findings here.\n\n   THE FINDINGS.\n\n\n The conspiracy began in January 1949, when appellants Norris and Wirtz, who owned and controlled the Chicago Stadium, the Detroit Olympia Arena and the St. Louis Arena, made an agreement with Joe Louis, the then heavyweight boxing champion of the world. Wishing to retire, Louis agreed to give up his title after obtaining from each of the four leading contenders\n2\n exclusive promotion rights including rights to radio, television and \n\n[358 \nU.S. 242, 246]\n\u00a0\n movie revenues. Upon securing these exclusive contracts Louis assigned them to the appellant International Boxing Club, Illinois, which was organized by Norris and Wirtz for the purpose of promoting boxing for the combination in Illinois. They paid Louis $150,000 cash plus an employment contract and a 20% stock interest in I. B. C., Illinois.\n\nIn March 1949 Norris and Wirtz approached appellant Madison Square Garden, in which they had for many years owned 50,000 shares of stock. It was the \"foremost sports arena in New York City and is the best known arena of its kind in the United States, if not the world.\"\n3\n However, its facilities were tied up by an exclusive lease it had granted to Mike Jacobs' interests - the leading professional boxing promoter in the field at that time. Norris and Wirtz proposed that they should all \"work together now and keep the events for our buildings and not create a competitive situation that would be harmful to all.\" In order to effectuate this program, appellant Madison Square Garden bought out Mike Jacobs' interests, including, in addition to his lease on Madison Square Garden, his exclusive leases to Yankee Stadium and the St. Nicholas Arena and his contract with the then welterweight champion Sugar Ray Robinson. These contracts were assigned to International Boxing Club, New York, organized for the purpose of promoting boxing for the combination in New York.\n\nOnce Jacobs' interests had been acquired, there remained only one substantial competitor in the field of \n\n[358 \nU.S. 242, 247]\n\u00a0\n promoting championship boxing matches. That was Tournament of Champions, Inc., owned in part by the Columbia Broadcasting System. It owned an exclusive lease on the Polo Grounds as well as an exclusive promotion contract covering the next two fights of the then middleweight champion of the world. In May 1949 Madison Square Garden bought all of the stock of Tournament of Champions at a cost of $100,000 plus 25% of the net profits on the next two middleweight championship matches. The assets thus acquired were likewise assigned to I. B. C., New York. By a simultaneous separate agreement, Columbia Broadcasting System agreed for a five-year period not to invest in or promote any professional boxing matches in return for a first refusal right to the broadcasting of certain boxing matches staged for a like period in Madison Square Garden.\n\nThis series of agreements, consummated within four months' time, gave appellants exclusive control of the promotion of boxing matches in three championship divisions, i. e., heavyweight, middleweight, and welterweight. Not satisfied with this temporary control, however, appellants perpetuated their hold on championship bouts by requiring each contender for the title to grant to them an exclusive promotion contract to his championship fights, including film and broadcasting, for a period of from three to five years. Over the facilities for the staging of contests appellants exercised like control, owning or managing the \"key\" arenas and stadia in the Nation.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nTightening the ropes around the ring thus built, Norris and Wirtz increased their stockholdings in Madison Square Garden to where they controlled it and were able \n\n[358 \nU.S. 242, 248]\n\u00a0\n to \"dictate its policies and boxing activities.\" This has continued their control over I. B. C., New York, the stock of which is now wholly owned by Madison Square Garden.\n5\n They are the sole stockholders of Chicago Stadium Corporation which in turn is the sole stockholder of I. B. C., Illinois. Their control over this boxing empire is revealed by the fact that Norris is president of each of the four top corporations, i. e., Madison Square Garden, I. B. C., New York, Chicago Stadium Corporation, and I. B. C., Illinois. He and Wirtz are directors in all four, while I. B. C., Illinois and I. B. C., New York, which have owned all of the promotion contracts with the contenders, have a joint board of directors.\n\nThe effect of the conspiracy is obvious. Using the facilities of I. B. C., Illinois, and I. B. C., New York, appellants entered into exclusive promotion contracts with title aspirants, requiring exclusive handling agreements in the event the contender became champion. In amassing their empire, appellants obtained control of champions in three divisions. The choice given a contender thereafter was clear, i. e., to sign with appellants or not to fight. With appellants in control of the key arenas and stadia of the country through Madison Square Garden, Chicago Stadium Corporation, and others, an event could not be successfully staged in any of these areas, the most fruitful in the Nation, without their \n\n[358 \nU.S. 242, 249]\n\u00a0\n consent. The exercise of this power brought immediate results. From June 1949, when appellants staged their first championship fight, until May 15, 1953, the date of the amended complaint, they staged or controlled the promotion of 36 of the 44 championship battles held in this country, giving them approximately 81% of that field. In two of the classifications, heavyweight and middleweight, the combine staged all of the contests. The power of the combine to exclude competitors in the championship field is graphically shown by their promotion of 25 out of 27 fights in all divisions, a total of 93%, during the two-and-a-half-year period ending with the filing of the amended complaint. This power extended to the sale of film and broadcasting rights - most valuable adjuncts to successful promotion in the business.\n\nAppellants launch a vigorous attack on the finding that the relevant market was the promotion of championship boxing contests in contrast to all professional boxing events. They rely primarily on United States v. du Pont & Co., \n351 \nU.S. 377\n (1956). That case, involving an alleged monopoly of the market in cellophane, held that the relevant market was not cellophane alone but the entire field of flexible packaging materials. In testing for the relevant market in Sherman Act cases, the Court said:\n\n \". . . no more definite rule can be declared than  that commodities reasonably interchangeable by consumers  for the same purposes make up that `part  of the trade or commerce,' monopolization of which  may be illegal.\" Du Pont, supra, at 395.\n\n\n The appellants argue that the \"physical identity of the products here would seem necessarily to put them in one and the same market.\" They say that any boxing contest, whether championship or not, always includes one ring, two boxers and one referee, fighting under the same rules before a greater or lesser number of spectators \n\n[358 \nU.S. 242, 250]\n\u00a0\n either present at ringside or through the facilities of television, radio, or moving pictures.\n\nWe do not feel that this conclusion follows. As was also said in du Pont, supra, at 404:\n\n \"The `market' . . . will vary with the part of commerce under consideration. The tests are constant. That market is composed of products that have reasonable interchangeability for the purposes for which they are produced - price, use and qualities considered.\"\n\n\n With this in mind, the lower court in the instant case found that there exists a \"separate, identifiable market\" for championship boxing contests. This general finding is supported by detailed findings to the effect that the average revenue from all sources for appellants' championship bouts was $154,000, compared to $40,000 for their nonchampionship programs; that television rights to one championship fight brought $100,000, in contrast to $45,000 for a nontitle fight seven months later between the same two fighters; that the average \"Nielsen\" ratings\n6\n over a two-and-one-half-year period were 74.9% for appellants' championship contests, and 57.7% for their nonchampionship programs (reflecting a difference of several million viewers between the two types of fights); that although the revenues from movie rights for six of appellants' championship bouts totaled over $600,000, no full-length motion picture rights were sold for a nonchampionship contest; and that spectators pay \"substantially more\" for tickets to championship fights than for \n\n[358 \nU.S. 242, 251]\n\u00a0\n nontitle fights. In addition, numerous representatives of the broadcasting, motion picture and advertising industries testified to the general effect that a \"particular and special demand exists among radio broadcasting and telecasting [and motion picture] companies for the rights to broadcast and telecast [and make and distribute films of] championship contests in contradistinction to similar rights to non-championship contests.\"\n7\n\u00a0\n\nIn view of these findings, we cannot say that the lower court was \"clearly erroneous\" in concluding that nonchampionship fights are not \"reasonably interchangeable for the same purpose\" as championship contests. A determination of the \"part of the trade or commerce\" encompassed by the Sherman Act involves distinctions in degree as well as distinctions in kind. One prime example of this is the application of the Act to trade or commerce in a localized geographical area. See e. g., Schine Theatres v. United States, \n334 \nU.S. 110\n (1948); United States v. Griffith, \n334 \nU.S. 100\n (1948); cf. Times-Picayune v. United States, \n345 \nU.S. 594\n (1953); United States v. Columbia Steel Co., \n334 \nU.S. 495\n (1948). The case which most squarely governs this case is United States v. Paramount Pictures, \n334 \nU.S. 131\n (1948). There, the charge involved, inter alia, extensive motion picture theatre holdings. The District Court had refused to order a divestiture of such holdings on the grounds that no \"national monopoly\" had been intended or obtained. This Court felt that such a finding was not dispositive of the issue, saying:\n\n\"First, there is no finding as to the presence or absence of monopoly on the part of the five majors \n\n[358 \nU.S. 242, 252]\n\u00a0\n [defendants] in the first-run field for the entire country, in the first-run field in the 92 largest cities of the country, or in the first-run field in separate localities. Yet the first-run field, which constitutes the cream of the exhibition business, is the core of the present cases. Section 1 of the Sherman Act outlaws unreasonable restraints irrespective of the amount of trade or commerce involved (United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., \n310 \nU.S. 150, 224\n, 225, n. 59), and  2 condemns monopoly of `any part' of trade or commerce.\" Paramount, supra, at 172-173. (Emphasis in the original.)\n\n\n Similarly, championship boxing is the \"cream\" of the boxing business, and, as has been shown above, is a sufficiently separate part of the trade or commerce to constitute the relevant market for Sherman Act purposes.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nWe have also examined the remainder of this characteristically lengthy record. When the case was here previously appellants did not deny that the allegations of the complaint stated a cause of action against them, provided their activity came within the meaning of the Sherman Act. We held that the complaint stated a cause of action. The District Court has now found these allegations to have been proven. With the case in this posture, appellants have an almost insurmountable burden. They must show that the findings, or at least the basic ones, are \"clearly erroneous.\" Rule 52 (a), Rules of Civil Procedure. This they have not been able to do. It follows that the decree entered on the merits adjudging the appellants to have violated both 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act must be affirmed. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 242, 253]\n\u00a0\n\n\n    THE RELIEF.\n\n\n In approaching the question of relief we must remember that our function is not to sit as a trial court. Besser Mfg. Co. v. United States, \n343 \nU.S. 444, 449\n-450 (1952); United States v. National Lead Co., \n332 \nU.S. 319\n (1947); cf. United States v. Crescent Amusement Co., \n323 \nU.S. 173, 185\n (1944). As was said in International Salt Co. v. United States, \n332 \nU.S. 392, 400\n-401 (1947):\n\n \"The framing of [antitrust] decrees should take place in the District rather than in Appellate Courts. They are invested with large discretion to model their judgments to fit the exigencies of the particular case.\"\n\n\n The yardstick which the trial court should apply in monopolization cases is well stated by the Court in Schine Theatres v. United States, \n334 \nU.S. 110, 128\n-129 (1948). The decree should (1) put \"an end to the combination or conspiracy when that is itself the violation\"; (2) deprive \"the antitrust defendants of the benefits of their conspiracy\"; and (3) \"break up or render impotent the monopoly power which violates the Act.\"\n\nThe relief granted by a trial court in an antitrust case and brought here on direct appeal, thus by-passing the usual appellate review, has always had the most careful scrutiny of this Court. Though the records are usually most voluminous and their review exceedingly burdensome, we have painstakingly undertaken it to make certain that justice has been done. See e. g., United States v. Paramount Pictures, supra; Schine Theatres v. United States, supra; United States v. National Lead Co., supra. That we have done here. We have finally concluded that the relief granted was not beyond the allowable discretion of the District Court. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 242, 254]\n\u00a0\n\n\n The Bounds of the Relief Ordered.\n\nAt the time of the final decree the Joe Louis agreements had elapsed; the exclusive-contract practice had been at least temporarily abandoned; the leases on Yankee Stadium, the Polo Grounds and St. Nicholas Arena in New York had been given up and the appellants had no control over the new heavyweight champion, Floyd Patterson. Nevertheless, the additional evidence taken by the District Court showed that they still possessed all of the power of monopoly and restraint. In this we agree. The appellants had exercised a strangle hold on the industry for a long period. It was evident at the time of the decree that, statistically, they still dominated the staging of championship bouts and completely controlled the filming and broadcasting of those contests. They had gained this leadership through the elimination by purchase of all of their major competitors in the field; by the control of contending boxers through exclusive agreements; and by the staging of events through the ownership or lease of key stadia and arenas. This illegal activity gave appellants an odorous monopoly background which was known and still feared in the boxing world. In addition, Norris and Wirtz still possessed the major tools, so well used previously, necessary to continue their control. They owned or controlled the key arena and stadium in New York and Chicago, the most lucrative communities in boxing; they continued to control all of the championship bouts staged there; they commanded the filming and broadcasting of all championship fights - the cream of the business - wherever staged; and though on the surface they owned no stock directly in the two I. B. C. corporations, each was the wholly owned subsidiary of corporations which Norris and Wirtz did control and manage.\n\nIn this setting the District Court ordered Norris and Wirtz to divest themselves, within a five-year period, of \n\n[358 \nU.S. 242, 255]\n\u00a0\n all stock which they owned \"directly or indirectly\" in Madison Square Garden. In addition, both of the International Boxing Clubs, Illinois and New York, were ordered dissolved. The Chicago Stadium and Madison Square Garden were each enjoined from staging more than two championship bouts annually. All exclusive agreements for the promotion of boxing events, including nonchampionship, were banned. Madison Square Garden was ordered for a period of five years to lease its premises when available at a \"fair and reasonable\" rental to any duly qualified promoter applying in writing therefore. Failure to agree on terms would require submission to the courts for determination. Like requirement was imposed on Chicago Stadium Corporation, provided Norris-and-Wirtz control continued.\n\nThe District Judge concluded that it was necessary to include each of these provisions in the decree in order to put an end to the combination, deprive the appellants of the benefit of their conspiracy and break up their monopoly power. At the conclusion of the final hearing on relief he observed that prior to 1949 the Norris-Wirtz group was in Chicago while the Madison Square Garden enterprise was in New York. They were \"two separate entities,\" one promoting contests in the mid-West and the other in New York. He declared that \"in order to destroy this monopoly we have to return the situation as nearly as possible to the economic conditions as they existed in 1949\" and, further, \"I can see no way in this case . . . that a proper decree can be formulated unless that power that Wirtz and Norris have in Madison Square Garden is curtailed. They have to get out of the control.\"\n\n The Order of Divestiture.\n\nAppellants contend that since the stock owned by Norris and Wirtz was not acquired pursuant to the conspiracy, was not the fruit of illegal activity and was not \n\n[358 \nU.S. 242, 256]\n\u00a0\n proven to be the lever by which Madison Square Garden was persuaded to join the conspiracy, divestiture was but punishment rather than a necessary corrective remedy. They further say that the sale, even though made in the manner outlined in the decree,\n9\n would result in great loss to Norris and Wirtz. They contend that it was arbitrary for the District Court not to permit them to exercise an option, as proposed by them, of a choice between Madison Square Garden and the Chicago Stadium, both of which they still control.\n\nIt may be that the stock in Madison Square Garden was not the fruit of the conspiracy; but even if lawfully acquired it may be utilized as part of the conspiracy to effect its ends. See United States v. Paramount Pictures, supra, at 152. Moreover, since the inception of the conspiracy Norris and Wirtz have increased their holdings to over 219,000 shares. It was this stock ownership and their control of stock voting power that the trial court found dictated the election of the officers and directors of Madison Square Garden and gave to Norris and Wirtz the unquestioned control and management of its activities. Although reluctant at first to require a divestiture of this stock, the trial judge ultimately became convinced that it was the sine qua non of the relief. During the hearing he said:\n\n \"The great evil I found was the combination that  Wirtz and Norris caused and created by joining up  with Madison Square Garden. I regard Wirtz and  Norris as one and Madison Square Garden as another,  a separate entity and business interest. The evil \n\n[358 \nU.S. 242, 257]\n\u00a0\n  primarily sprung from their combination, their concerted  efforts and action. That has to be broken up.\"  (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n What is perhaps equally significant is that through the exercise of this power Norris and Wirtz elected the officers and board of directors of I. B. C., New York - a joint board with I. B. C., Illinois, which they also controlled through the Chicago Stadium Corporation. This joint board was the bridge over which the conspiracy was made effective. Over it the control of the promotion of championship boxing contests was secured. That this control remained effective up to the very date of the final hearing, June 24, 1957, is shown by the following statement by the court on that date:\n\n \"The unlawful combination of the defendants still possesses and exercises its monopolistic control in the field of championship contests. It appears that since May 15, 1953 there have been held in the United States 37 championship contests, excluding one bantamweight contest. The defendants admit that they had promotional control over 24 of the 37 championship contests which were held or of 65 per cent of the market, but we find that the defendants were not financial strangers to the other 13 championship contests which were held in cities other than New York and Chicago. Because the defendants are licensed by state authorities to promote only in New York and Illinois, they could not be the persons actually designated as the promoter of the 13 championship contests, but all five of the championship contests which originated in cities other than Chicago or New York on Friday nights were televised on IBC's-New York Friday night television series.\n\n\n \"We find, too, that all of the 37 championship contests in this period from May 15, 1953, save \n\n[358 \nU.S. 242, 258]\n\u00a0\n only the five outdoor contests, were televised on either the defendants' Wednesday or Friday night television series, and that the profits of the sale of the telecasting rights inured to the benefit of the defendants.\"\n\n\n As this was some two and a half years after our opinion in the former appeal on January 31, 1955, it appears that appellants had continued exercising their unlawful control long after they well knew that this activity was within the coverage of the Sherman Act. In view of the fact that no denial was made on that appeal of the sufficiency of the Government's complaint it is reasonable to assume that appellants, subsequent to our opinion, knew that their conduct violated the Sherman Act, obedience to which is so important to our free enterprise system. Still they continued their illegal activity. In fact from all appearances it is continuing to this day. Such conduct, in addition to the interlocking nature of the ownership at the time of the final decree, fully justified the District Court's conclusion that the \"dissolution of the combination can only be accomplished by an immediate and complete severance of the interlocking ownership of Norris and Wirtz in Madison Square Garden. . . . [T]here must be a complete divestiture of the stockholdings of Norris and Wirtz in the Garden. The Government has established Norris and Wirtz control the Garden Corporation.\" Moreover, this was the only effective means at hand by which competition in championship events might be restored. It was intended to return the parties as near as possible to the status quo existing prior to the conspiracy.\n\nFor these reasons, we do not see why it was incumbent upon the court to give Norris and Wirtz certain options requested at the time of the decree. We shall mention only two. The first was that they have the right to exercise a choice of retaining either Madison Square Garden \n\n[358 \nU.S. 242, 259]\n\u00a0\n or the Chicago Stadium. But this would not be conducive to the re-establishment of competition between the two interests, which the District Court considered a necessity. Nor would it eliminate the \"great evil\" the trial court found in the Norris-Wirtz-Garden combination. Another requested option was that Norris and Wirtz be permitted to retain their control of Madison Square Garden and the latter be enjoined from promoting championship boxing events. But this would have eliminated the world's principal boxing center - \"the premier sports arena in the world,\" as appellants characterized it - from promoting such events in competition with Norris and Wirtz.\n\nIn short, the Government in its effort to free the professional boxing business of monopoly and unreasonable restraints would have won the battle but lost the war under either of the proffered alternatives. As this Court said in United States v. Crescent Amusement Co., \n323 \nU.S. 173, 189\n-190 (1944):\n\n \"Common control was one of the instruments in  bringing about unity of purpose and unity of action  and in making the conspiracy effective. If that  affiliation continues, there will be tempting opportunity  . . . to act in combination . . . . The proclivity  in the past to use that affiliation for an unlawful  end warrants effective assurance that no such  opportunity will be available in the future.\"\n\n\n The Dissolution of the Two International Boxing Clubs.\n\nAdmittedly these corporations were formed pursuant to and were the means used to effectuate the conspiracy. As the trial judge said:\n\n\"These corporations are the promotional arms of the defendants, conceived and used to enable defendants \n\n[358 \nU.S. 242, 260]\n\u00a0\n to restrain and monopolize promotion of championship boxing contests. Their assets are of but nominal value except for the goodwill attaching to their names by virtue of the conspiracy.\"\n\n\n The conditions existing here even subsequent to our former opinion confirm the need for such dissolution. Both corporations continued to share equally the profits the combination reaped from the staging of championship boxing contests. This also included revenues from championship contests promoted by others but televised by the combination. They continue even now as the bridge between the choice arenas Norris and Wirtz own or control and the boxers with whom they have exclusive promotion contracts. Through interlocking officers and directorates the two I. B. C.'s thus effectively hold the combination together. It is antitrust policy to decree dissolution \"where the creation of the combination is itself the violation.\" United States v. Crescent Amusement Co., supra, at 189, and cases there cited. This is one of those situations where the injunctive process affords too little relief too late.\n\nAppellants argue that this is punitive; that the parent companies, under the decree, are left free to organize new corporations to handle their respective boxing promotions and, hence, dissolution is a useless act. The trial court felt, however, and we agree, that continued operation under the old I. B. C. charters might lead to a situation nominis umbra not conducive to the elimination of the old illegal practices. New corporations, if formed, would start off with clean slates free from numerous written and oral agreements and understandings now existent and known throughout the industry. Hence dissolution might well have the salutary effect of completely clearing new horizons that the trial judge was attempting to create in the boxing world, especially when effected in conjunction \n\n[358 \nU.S. 242, 261]\n\u00a0\n with the stock divestiture provision. Moreover, there would be little inconvenience and nominal expense even if, as appellants contend, they \"as a practical matter must [form new corporations] if they are to promote any boxing at all.\" This we think a poor excuse for not completely eliminating, by dissolution, these old trappings of monopoly and restraint.\n\n The Compulsory Leasing Provisions.\n\nThe District Court, having found that one of the means used in effectuating the conspiracy was the ownership and control of arenas and stadia, entered a compulsory leasing provision in the decree as to Madison Square Garden and the Chicago Stadium Corporation.\n10\n\u00a0\n\nThe appellants' main concern with this provision of the decree is the requirement that in the event the terms of a lease cannot be agreed upon the matter will be submitted to the District Court. Appellants fear that this is not only an undesirable but an impractical activity for a District Court. But they have suggested no alternative to relieve the court of this burden. Obviously, such a provision may result in some disputes which must be settled. Until experience in the enforcement of the provision proves the reference to be too burdensome we see no reason to disturb it. If experience proves it unworkable the parties, under the decree, may apply to the court for \n\n[358 \nU.S. 242, 262]\n\u00a0\n appropriate relief. See Lorain Journal Co. v. United States, \n342 \nU.S. 143, 156\n-157 (1951); International Salt Co. v. United States, supra, at 401.\n\n Exclusive Contracts With Contestants.\n\nAppellants object to the prohibition against exclusive contracts applying to all professional boxing contests. They question the Government's enlarging its base from championship bouts to all professional boxing. But human nature being what it is there is sound reason to say that exclusive contracts with boxers in nontitle contests would surely affect those same boxers when and if they arrive at the title. Such arrangements would give appellants, so experienced in the boxing field, a decided advantage over the independent promoter. Such a prohibition is fully justified at least until the effects of the conspiracy are fully dissipated. For the same reason we see no fault in the five-year prohibition against exclusive rights to a return bout.\n\nThe trial court recognized that these restrictions went beyond the \"relevant market\" which has been considered for purposes of determining the Sherman Act violations, but felt that \"[t]he relief here must be broader than the championship field because the evil to be remedied is broader.\" This Court has recognized that sometimes \"relief, to be effective, must go beyond the narrow limits of the proven violation.\" United States v. United States Gypsum Co., supra, 340 U.S., at p. 90; Timken Co. v. United States, \n341 \nU.S. 593, 600\n (1951). When this sort of relief is granted, we must of course be especially wary lest the trial court overstep the correspondingly narrower limits of its discretion, but, for the reasons set out above, we feel that no such misuse of the trial court's power is present here.\n\nWe have considered the other objections of appellants to the decree and find them unsubstantial as presently \n\n[358 \nU.S. 242, 263]\n\u00a0\n posed. In the event experience proves that some of the provisions are so severe as to require modification or amendment, the parties may apply to the District Court as provided in paragraph 25 of the decree. The judgment should be affirmed.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE STEWART took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 15 U.S.C. 1 et seq.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Ezzard Charles, Joe Walcott, Lee Savold, and Gus Lesnevich.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The importance of Madison Square Garden in the present context is shown by the fact that of all the championship contests staged during the 12 years immediately preceding 1949, 45% were held in New York City, of which 75% were in Madison Square Garden. The balance of the New York championship bouts, with one exception, were held in Yankee Stadium, the Polo Grounds, or St. Nicholas Arena.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Between 1937 and 1948, 50% of all championship contests were staged in either Madison Square Garden, Yankee Stadium, the Polo Grounds, St. Nicholas Arena, Chicago Stadium, Detroit Olympia Arena, or the St. Louis Arena.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] At the time the I. B. C.'s were formed, Joe Louis owned 20% of the stock of each and the other 80% was split evenly between Norris and Wirtz on one hand and Madison Square Garden on the other. At some point thereafter, Louis ceased to be a stockholder and his share was split evenly between Norris-Wirtz and Madison Square Garden. At the time of the final decree, apparently as the result of an effort to make a showing of separateness of control, the Norris-Wirtz interests owned all of the stock in I. B. C., Illinois, and Madison Square Garden owned all of the stock in I. B. C., New York. The trial court found that the two interests nevertheless still shared equally in the combined profits of both I. B. C.'s.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] According to the District Court, the \"Nielsen Average Audience rating is a percentage which purports to show the number of residential television sets that were tuned in to the program expressed as a percentage of the total residential television sets, whether turned off or on, which were in areas into which the program was telecast.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Approximately 25% of the revenue produced by the appellants' championship fights during the period covered by the complaint was derived through the sale of radio, television and motion picture rights.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] By analogy, it bears those sufficiently \"peculiar characteristics\" found in automobile fabrics and finishes such as to bring them within the Clayton Act's \"line of commerce.\" United States v. du Pont & Co., \n353 \nU.S. 586, 593\n-595 (1957).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Norris and Wirtz were given five years to sell their stock in Madison Square Garden, which stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. During this time, the stock is to be held by two trustees named by the court. If the stock is not sold within five years, the trustees are ordered to sell it within the next two years.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] This provision of the decree, applying only to championship contests, ordered appellants to lease their respective buildings upon seasonable written request by a qualified promoter, if the proposed rent is reasonable, if the applicant furnishes adequate security, and if at the time of the application the building is neither already under lease to another for the specified day nor in conflict at that time with \"any well-established event\" which has been regularly conducted therein. If the parties cannot agree on what constitutes adequate security or a reasonable rental, either party may apply to the court for a determination thereof.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, dissenting in part.\n\nWhile I have heretofore expressed views in favor of the almost controlling deference to be paid to a District Court's considered formulation of the provisions appropriate to a decree designed to remedy adjudicated violations of the antitrust laws, those views have not prevailed, see the opinions in United States v. Paramount Pictures, \n334 \nU.S. 131\n, and this Court has felt free to modify and eliminate provisions of an antitrust decree, particularly when a single judge has imposed an unconventional and drastic remedy. The main issue dealt with in MR. JUSTICE HARLAN'S dissent, while a narrow one, is, in my view, important. While divestiture has been decreed by the district judge, the mandatory disposition of the stock has been delayed for five years, and the stock placed in trusteeship. During this five-year period a series of detailed controls have been imposed, under the supervision of the District Court, in order to prevent appellants Norris and Wirtz from exercising the power their stock ownership has given them over the operations of Madison Square Garden. The ownership itself has been sterilized. I think it not an unreasonable forecast that, even were we to postpone for five years the decision whether to order the divestiture or continue the trusteeship, appellants Norris and Wirtz would not find it profitable to continue their sterilized ownership of the Garden stock. However, \n\n[358 \nU.S. 242, 264]\n\u00a0\n there is no compelling reason to order them to do what sound business judgment may compel. One has the right to assume that, in view of this Court's unanimous affirmance of the findings below that appellants were in violation of the Sherman Law, they will scrupulously obey the decree and not even by the subtlest indirection seek to avoid our decision. Therefore I think it is needless now to determine that divestiture must take place five years hence, rather than wait upon the event in order to determine whether divestiture should then be ordered.\n\nAccordingly, I join MR. JUSTICE HARLAN'S opinion.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER and MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER join, dissenting in part.\n\nI am unable to subscribe to the Court's approval of those parts of the decree below which ordered (1) the divestiture of the stockholdings of Norris and Wirtz in Madison Square Garden Corporation and (2) the dissolution of the New York and Illinois International Boxing Clubs. On the other aspects of the case I agree with the results the Court has reached.\n\n   DIVESTITURE.\n\n\n As a starting point I accept the conclusion of the District Court that competition in the promotion and exhibition of professional championship boxing could not be effectively restored so long as Norris and Wirtz remained in control of Madison Square Garden's activities in this field. Because of the pre-eminence of the Garden as a site for boxing contests, the District Court found that its control by Norris and Wirtz constituted the fulcrum of the antitrust violations which were adjudged. That finding is supported by the evidence, and in turn justifies the court's conclusion that the elimination of their \n\n[358 \nU.S. 242, 265]\n\u00a0\n influence in the Garden was prerequisite to restoring competition.\n\nIt by no means follows, however, that the order divesting Norris and Wirtz of their Garden stockholdings was an appropriate method of accomplishing that objective in the circumstances of this case. Unless past pronouncements of this Court cautioning against the indiscriminate use of divestiture as a remedy in antitrust cases, see Timken Co. v. United States, \n341 \nU.S. 593\n, are to be taken less seriously than they should be, it seems to me that the Court has too lightly given approval to the use of that drastic measure here.\n\nFirst. It is not at all clear to me just why the District Court, which in the early stages of the hearings on relief expressed itself strongly against divestiture, ultimately reached the conclusion that such a course was necessary. Indeed the record can be read as indicating the court's belief that the five-year trusteeship of the stock, though designed to alleviate some of the hardships of a forced sale, would at the same time effectively remove Norris and Wirtz from control over the Garden's affairs and therefore in conjunction with the other provisions of the decree result in restoring competitive conditions, whether or not the correlative requirement of sale was carried out within the five-year period.\n1\n The decree itself supports this \n\n[358 \nU.S. 242, 266]\n\u00a0\n reading. For despite the evident realization that the stock might not be sold within five years, the provisions of the decree especially aimed at opening up competition for the use of the Garden are all geared to this period. If in fact the District Court though this five-year insulation of Norris and Wirtz from managerial and policy-making activities at the Garden would combine with the other restrictions to restore competition, justification for divestiture must then be found in a purpose to prevent a relapse into noncompetitive conditions after the five years have elapsed, something which the District Court quite properly considered to be a function of the decree. On this premise I am at a loss to see why continuance of the trusteeship, and, if necessary, the concomitant restrictions on the Garden's activities, should not have been considered adequate to serve that end.\n\nSecond. If I am mistaken in thus divining the thinking of the District Court, I still consider that in the circumstances of this case divestiture was at least ordered prematurely. Determination whether that drastic remedy was required should have been postponed until the expiration of the trusteeship period so that the necessity for its application could then be judged in light of the effectiveness of the other sanctions of the decree. I recognize that various contingencies can be conjured up to support the view that divestiture, rather than trusteeship, holds the more solid promise of assuring the preservation of competition. Nevertheless I think that rejection of a continuance of the trusteeship in favor of divestiture should, in the peculiar setting of this case, be based on experience rather than speculative apprehension. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 242, 267]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThree factors seem to me especially compelling toward such a course. In the first place, this cannot properly be considered a case of reprehensible immoral conduct or willful lawbreaking.\n2\n Not until January 31, 1955, when this Court handed down its opinion in United States v. International Boxing Club, \n348 \nU.S. 236\n, did it become known that professional boxing was even subject to the federal antitrust laws. In view of this Court's earlier decisions in the baseball cases, Federal Baseball Club v. National League, \n259 \nU.S. 200\n, and Toolson v. New York Yankees, Inc., \n346 \nU.S. 356\n, I think it reasonable to say that in 1949 when this alleged conspiracy began most well-informed lawyers believed that professional boxing, like professional baseball, was beyond antitrust stricture. Hence the appellants had every reason to believe their actions were innocent when taken. Putting the matter somewhat differently, we should be slow in lending approval to the use of such a drastic remedy as this in a case where the appellants have never had the opportunity to demonstrate their willingness to comply with the law once they have learned that it applies to their activities. In my opinion, the thrust of this factor is not blunted by arguing, as the Court does, that appellants should voluntarily have done something to unscramble their relationships during the two and a half years that elapsed between the Court's decision in the original International Boxing case and the entry of the present decree. That sort of squeeze play should not be expected of those already involved in a lawsuit. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 242, 268]\n\u00a0\n\n\nFurther, divestiture here is brought to bear upon a large investment much of which was acquired long before the conduct charged in this case began, and the balance of which was obtained prior to the announcement of the International Boxing decision. The \"unlawful fruits\" doctrine accordingly offers no justification for this divestiture. Although recognizing this to be true, the Court states that the Garden stock was nonetheless utilized as means of accomplishing the antitrust violations. But this is just another way of saying that divestiture is a necessary element of effective relief; it affords no independent justification for the employment of that remedy.\n\nLastly, the divestiture order reaches far beyond the subject matter of the action. It permanently removes Norris and Wirtz from all interest in the Garden, over 90% of whose activities are entirely unrelated to professional boxing.\n\nThird. It is true, of course, that the trial court's considered judgment on what is necessary to dissipate the effects and prevent recurrence of an adjudged antitrust violation is entitled to much deference from this Court. But by the same token this Court, before it is asked to put its stamp of approval on such a drastic remedy as divestiture, is entitled to have a clear and unambiguous expression of the district court's reasoning in choosing such a course. Especially is this so where, as here, this Court is the sole reviewing authority and in consequence has not had the benefit of an intermediate review of the issues by a Court of Appeals. In my opinion this record leaves much to be desired in this regard. The most I can make of it, taking the case for divestiture most favorably to the Government, is that the District Court would have been justified in reserving that issue for consideration at the time the five-year trusteeship of the Norris and Wirtz stock expired. Certainly no adequate case for a present order of divestiture has been made out. In this view of \n\n[358 \nU.S. 242, 269]\n\u00a0\n the matter it becomes unnecessary to discuss at this time the various \"options\" alternative to divestiture which were rejected by the District Court.\n\n   DISSOLUTION.\n\n\n I can find no adequate basis for the order dissolving the two International Boxing Clubs. My difficulty with this aspect of the relief is sufficiently shown by the fact that, as I read the record, it would be permissible for Madison Square Garden and the Norris and Wirtz interests in Chicago to create new corporations carrying exactly the same name as the two present organizations. The only justification offered by the Government for this aspect of the decree is that the two clubs were instrumentalities of the antitrust conspiracy and that their dissolution was but an expedient for insuring that all of their illegal agreements had been put to an end. But since all such agreements, both written and oral, are already canceled by other provisions of the decree, and since there is no suggestion that the sweeping relief granted by the District Court has any loopholes which would permit these organizations to function improperly, this justification is hardly convincing. In these circumstances dissolution appears to me to be not only punitive but futile, something not promotive of sound antitrust law enforcement.\n\nI would remand the case to the District Court with instructions to modify its decree by striking the provisions for compulsory sale of the Norris and Wirtz stock in the Madison Square Garden Corporation, reserving the issue of divestiture for further proceedings at the end of the five-year trusteeship period, and eliminating the requirement of dissolution of the two International Boxing Clubs.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Apart from its divestiture and dissolution provisions, the decree imposes wide-ranging and pervasive restrictions on appellants' activities in boxing promotion and exhibition. It renders void all exclusive contracts which they may presently have with boxers. It prohibits the making of new exclusive contracts, with the exception that, after five years, exclusive provision may be made for return bouts. Similarly, exclusive leases with stadia not owned by appellants are proscribed. So, too, are such arrangements with television and radio broadcasters. Further, appellants are restrained, for a period of five years, from promoting more than four championship boxing programs annually, two by Madison Square Garden and two, cumulatively, by Norris and Wirtz. During that five-year period also, the compulsory \n\n[358 \nU.S. 242, 266]\n\u00a0\n leasing provisions discussed in the Court's opinion are to be in effect. Finally, the decree removes Norris and Wirtz as officers and directors of Madison Square Garden, and enjoins them from holding such positions in the future.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The District Court put the matter in this way: \"I don't charge them [Norris and Wirtz] with malicious intentional and moral wrong doing, nor do I proceed to formulate the decree on such a basis. They are guilty, if anything, of a moral, prohibitive wrong which was in doubt as to whether it was even prohibitive at the time some of these acts were done, and serious doubt, but most people held it was not.\" \n\n[358 \nU.S. 242, 270]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","86":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nIRVIN v. DOWD(1959)\nNo. 63\nArgued: January 15, 1959Decided: May 4, 1959\n\n\n\n\n In an Indiana State Court, petitioner was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. He escaped from custody and, while he was still at large, his counsel made a timely motion for a new trial, specifying 415 grounds of error constituting an alleged denial of federal constitutional rights. The trial court, in denying the motion, noted that petitioner was an escapee when the motion was made and decided. After his return to custody, petitioner filed a timely appeal to the State Supreme Court from the judgment of conviction, assigning as the only error the denial of the motion for a new trial. Under Indiana law, the appeal presented the State Supreme Court with two issues: (1) Whether the motion for a new trial was correctly denied because petitioner was an escapee at the time it was made, or (2) whether it was correctly denied because the trial did not, as petitioner alleged, deprive him of his constitutional rights. The Indiana Supreme Court discussed both issues in its opinion affirming the denial of the motion for a new trial. Subsequently, petitioner applied to a Federal District Court for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. 2241. The District Court dismissed the writ on the ground that petitioner had not exhausted his state remedies, as required by 28 U.S.C. 2254, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. Both Courts considered that the judgment of the Indiana Supreme Court rested on a holding that petitioner's motion for a new trial was properly denied because he was an escapee at the time it was made. Held:\n\n 1. The opinion of the Indiana Supreme Court is more reasonably read as resting the judgment on the holding that the petitioner's constitutional claim is without merit. In this way, the State Supreme Court discharged its obligation to \"guard, enforce, and protect every right granted or secured by the Constitution of the United States.\" Robb v. Connolly. \n111 \nU.S. 624, 637\n. Pp. 403-404.\n\n\n 2. The doctrine of exhaustion of state remedies, which was codified in 28 U.S.C. 2254, does not bar resort to federal habeas \n\n[359 \nU.S. 394, 395]\n\u00a0\n corpus if the petitioner has obtained a decision on his constitutional claims from the highest court of a State, even though, as here, that court could have based its decision on another ground. Brown v. Allen, \n344 \nU.S. 443\n, distinguished. Pp. 404-406.\n\n\n 3. The question is not reached whether federal habeas corpus would have been available to petitioner had the Indiana Supreme Court rested its decision on the escape ground. P. 406.\n\n\n 4. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded to that Court, which may decide the merits of petitioner's constitutional claim or remand to the District Court for further consideration of that claim. Pp. 406-407.\n\n\n 251 F.2d 548, reversed.\n\nJames D. Lopp and Theodore Lockyear, Jr. argued the cause for petitioner. With them on the brief was James D. Nafe.\n\nRichard M. Givan, Assistant Attorney General of Indiana, argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was Edwin K. Steers, Attorney General of Indiana.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner brought this habeas corpus proceeding in the District Court for the Northern District of Indiana under 28 U.S.C. 2241,\n1\n claiming that his conviction for murder in the Circuit Court of Gibson County, Indiana, was obtained in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 394, 396]\n\u00a0\n The District Court dismissed the writ, 153 F. Supp. 531, under the provision of 28 U.S.C. 2254 that habeas corpus \"shall not be granted unless it appears that the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the state . . . .\"\n2\n The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed. 251 F.2d 548. We granted certiorari, \n356 \nU.S. 948\n.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nThe constitutional claim arises in this way. Six murders were committed in the vicinity of Evansville, Indiana, two in December 1954, and four in March 1955. The crimes, extensively covered by news media in the locality, aroused great excitement and indignation throughout Vanderburgh County, where Evansville is located, and adjoining Gibson County, a rural county of approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The petitioner was arrested on April 8, 1955. Shortly thereafter, the Prosecutor of Vanderburgh County and Evansville police \n\n[359 \nU.S. 394, 397]\n\u00a0\n officials issued press releases, which were intensively publicized, stating that the petitioner had confessed to the six murders. The Vanderburgh County Grand Jury soon indicted the petitioner for the murder which resulted in his conviction. This was the murder of Whitney Wesley Kerr allegedly committed in Vanderburgh County on December 23, 1954. Counsel appointed to defend petitioner immediately sought a change of venue from Vanderburgh County, which was granted, but to adjoining Gibson County. Alleging that the widespread and inflammatory publicity had also highly prejudiced the inhabitants of Gibson County against the petitioner, counsel, on October 29, 1955, sought another change of venue, from Gibson County to a county sufficiently removed from the Evansville locality that a fair trial would not be prejudiced. The motion was denied, apparently because the pertinent Indiana statute allows only a single change of venue.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nThe voir dire examinations of prospective jurors began in Gibson County on November 14, 1955. The averments as to the prejudice by which the trial was allegedly environed find corroboration in the fact that from the first day of the voir dire considerable difficulty was experienced in selecting jurors who did not have fixed opinions that the petitioner was guilty. The petitioner's \n\n[359 \nU.S. 394, 398]\n\u00a0\n counsel therefore renewed his motion for a change of venue, which motion was denied. He renewed the motion a second time, on December 7, 1955, reciting in his moving papers: \"in the voir dire examination of 355 jurors called in this case to qualify as jurors 233 have expressed and formed their opinion as stated in said voir dire, that the defendant is guilty . . . .\" Again the motion was denied. Alternatively, on each of eight days over the four weeks required to select a jury, counsel sought a continuance of the trial on the ground that a fair trial at that time was not possible in the prevailing atmosphere of hostility toward the petitioner. All of the motions for a continuance were denied. The State Prosecutor, in a radio broadcast during the second week of the voir dire examination, stated that \"the unusual coverage given to the case by the newspapers and radio\" caused \"trouble in getting a jury of people who are not [sic] unbiased and unprejudiced in the case.\"\n\nThe petitioner's counsel exhausted all 20 of his peremptory challenges, and when 12 jurors were ultimately accepted by the court also unsuccessfully challenged all of them for alleged bias and prejudice against the petitioner, complaining particularly that four of the jurors, in their voir dire examinations, stated that they had an opinion that petitioner was guilty of the murder charged.\n5\n\u00a0\n\n[359 \nU.S. 394, 399]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlso, at the trial, the State's Prosecuting Attorney took the stand as part of his presentation of the State's case, and over petitioner's objection was allowed to testify that the petitioner, five days after his arrest, on April 13, 1955, had orally confessed the murder of Kerr to him. The Prosecuting Attorney was also permitted in summation, again over petitioner's objection, to vouch his own testimony by commenting to the jury, \"I testified myself what was told me.\"\n\nThe opinions of the Indiana Supreme Court and the District Court held the constitutional claim to be without merit. Irvin v. State, 236 Ind. 384, 392-394, 139 N. E. 2d 898, 902; Irvin v. Dowd, 153 F. Supp. 531, 535-539. On the other hand, Chief Judge Duffy of the Court of Appeals, concurring in the affirmance of the dismissal by the District Court, reached a contrary conclusion: \"Irvin was not accorded due process of law in the trial which resulted in his conviction and death sentence. In my judgment, he did not receive a fair trial because some of the jury had preconceived opinions as to defendant's guilt, and also because of the conduct of the prosecuting attorney.\" 251 F.2d 548, 554.\n\nThe Gibson County jury returned its verdict on December 20, 1955, and assessed the death penalty. Indiana law allows 30 days from the date of the verdict within which to file a motion for a new trial in the trial court. Burns' Ind. Stat. Ann., 1956 Replacement Vol., \n\n[359 \nU.S. 394, 400]\n\u00a0\n 9-1903. The petitioner's counsel, on January 19, 1956, the 30th day, filed such a motion specifying 415 grounds of error constituting the alleged denial of constitutional rights. However, the petitioner had escaped from custody the night before, January 18, 1956, and on January 23, 1956, the trial court overruled the motion, noting that the petitioner had been an escapee when the motion was filed and was still at large. The petitioner was captured in California about three weeks later and, on February 17, 1956, was confined in the Indiana State Prison.\n\nUnder Indiana law the denial of the new trial was not appealable, but was reviewable by the Indiana Supreme Court only if assigned as error in the event of an appeal from the judgment of conviction. The State Supreme Court has held:\n\n \"The statute [providing for appeal] does not authorize an appeal from every ruling which a court may make against a defendant in a criminal action, but only authorizes an appeal `from any judgment . . . against him,' and provides for review, upon such appeal, of decisions and rulings of the court made in the progress of the case. This court has construed the statute as authorizing an appeal only from a final judgment in a criminal action. The action of a trial court in overruling a motion for a new trial may be reviewed upon an appeal from a judgment of conviction rendered against a defendant, but the overruling of a motion for a new trial must be assigned as error. In such case the appeal is from the judgment of conviction and not from the ruling upon the motion for a new trial. The overruling of a motion for a new trial does not constitute a judgment and an appeal does not lie from the court's action in overruling such motion.\" Selke v. State, 211 Ind. 232, 234, 6 N. E. 2d 570, 571. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 394, 401]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The judgment of conviction imposing the death sentence was entered January 9, 1956. The petitioner was entitled to appeal, as a matter of right, from that judgment, provided, in compliance with a State Supreme Court rule,\n6\n the appeal was perfected by filing with the Clerk of the Supreme Court a transcript of the trial record and an assignment of errors within 90 days of the judgment. The Supreme Court may, in its discretion, extend the time on proper motion made within the 90-day period. The questions before the Supreme Court are those raised by the appellant in his assignment of errors. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 394, 402]\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn March 22, 1956, the petitioner applied for an extension of time within which to file the trial transcript and his assignment of errors. This was after he was returned to the custody of the State and well within 90 days from January 9, 1956, the date of the judgment of conviction. We were advised on oral argument that the State objected to this motion \"because he [petitioner] had escaped,\" and a hearing was held on the objection by the State Supreme Court. Petitioner's motion was granted and the time was extended to June 1, 1956. The assignment of errors, timely filed with the trial transcript of some 5,000 pages, assigned only one ground of error - that \"the [trial] Court erred in overruling appellant's motion for new trial.\" The petitioner's brief of over 700 pages opened by advising the State Supreme Court that \"Under this single assignment of error, the appellant has combined all errors alleged to have been committed prior to the filing of the motion for a new trial.\" In short, the form of the assignment was a shorthand way of specifying the 415 grounds stated in the motion for new trial as constituting the claimed denial of constitutional rights. Indeed the only arguments made in the lengthy brief related to the constitutional claim. The State's brief devoted some 70 pages to answering these contentions, and in 7 additional pages argued that in any event the Circuit Court had not erred in denying the motion for a new trial because the petitioner was an escapee at the time it was filed and decided.\n\nThe case before the Indiana Supreme Court was thus an appeal perfected in full compliance with Indiana procedure; therefore, the court was required under Indiana law to pass on the merits of the petitioner's assignment of error. That the assignment of error was sufficient to present the constitutional claim is evident from the court's acceptance of it as the basis for considering the 415 grounds of alleged error constituting that claim. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 394, 403]\n\u00a0\n However, under the single assignment of error, the judgment of conviction could be affirmed by the State Supreme Court if, for any reason finding support in the record, the motion for a new trial was properly overruled. The State argued that the overruling should be upheld on either of two grounds: one, because the petitioner was an escapee at the time the motion was made and decided, and, two, because the trial itself was fair and without error. Petitioner's appeal clearly raised both of these issues and the Indiana Supreme Court discussed both in its opinion.\n\nWe think that the District Court and Court of Appeals erred in concluding that the State Supreme Court decision rested on the ground that the petitioner was an escapee when his motion for a new trial was made and decided. On the contrary, the opinion to us is more reasonably to be read as resting the judgment on the holding that the petitioner's constitutional claim is without merit. As we have shown, under the state procedure, the State Supreme Court could have rested its decision solely on the federal constitutional claim.\n7\n This, we think, is what the Indiana high court did. The opinion discusses both issues. The discussion of the escape issue concludes with the statement. \"No error could have been committed in overruling the motion for a new trial under the circumstances.\" 236 Ind., at 392, 139 N. E. 2d. at 902. But the opinion proceeds: \"Our decision on the point under examination makes it unnecessary for us to consider the other contentions of the appellant; however, because of the finality of the sentence in the case we have reviewed the evidence to satisfy ourselves that there is no miscarriage of justice in the case.\" 236 Ind., at 392-393, 139 N. E. 2d, at 902. The conclusion reached after discussion of the merits is: \"It does not appear from the record and argument had, \n\n[359 \nU.S. 394, 404]\n\u00a0\n that the appellant was denied due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment . . . .\" 236 Ind., at 394, 139 N. E. 2d, at 902. The court's statement that its conclusion on the escape point made it \"unnecessary\" to consider the constitutional claim was not a holding that the judgment was rested on that ground. Rather the court proceeded to determine the merits \"because of the finality of the sentence\" and \"to satisfy ourselves that there is no miscarriage of justice.\" In this way, in our view, the State Supreme Court discharged the obligation which rests upon \"the State courts, equally with the courts of the Union, . . . to guard, enforce, and protect every right granted or secured by the Constitution of the United States . . . .\" Robb v. Connolly, \n111 \nU.S. 624, 637\n. We thus believe that the opinion is to be read as rested upon the State Supreme Court's considered conclusion that the conviction resulting in the death sentence was not obtained in disregard of the protections secured to the petitioner by the Constitution of the United States.\n\nIn this posture, 28 U.S.C. 2254 does not bar the petitioner's resort to federal habeas corpus. The doctrine of exhaustion of state remedies in federal habeas corpus was judicially fashioned after the Congress, by the Act of February 5, 1867, greatly expanded the habeas corpus jurisdiction of the federal courts to embrace \"all cases where any person may be restrained of his . . . liberty in violation of the constitution, or of any treaty or law of the United States . . . .\" 14 Stat. 385. Although the statute has been re-enacted with minor changes at various times the sweep of the jurisdiction granted by this broad phrasing has remained unchanged.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nSince there inhered in this expanded grant of power, beside the added burden on the federal courts, the potentiality \n\n[359 \nU.S. 394, 405]\n\u00a0\n of conflict between federal and state courts, this Court, starting with the decision in Ex parte Royall, \n117 \nU.S. 241\n, developed the doctrine of exhaustion of state remedies, a \"rule . . . that the . . . Courts of the United States, while they have power to grant writs of habeas corpus for the purpose of inquiring into the cause of restraint of liberty of any person in custody under the authority of a State in violation of the Constitution, . . . yet, except in cases of peculiar urgency, ought not to exercise that jurisdiction by a discharge of the person in advance of a final determination of his case in the courts of the State, . . .\" Tinsley v. Anderson, \n171 \nU.S. 101, 104\n-105. The principles are now reasonably clear. \"Ordinarily an application for habeas corpus by one detained under a state court judgment of conviction for crime will be entertained by a federal court only after all state remedies available, including all appellate remedies in the state courts and in this Court by appeal or writ of certiorari, have been exhausted.\" Ex parte Hawk, \n321 \nU.S. 114, 116\n-117. The principles of the doctrine have been embodied in 28 U.S.C. 2254 which was enacted by Congress to codify the existing habeas corpus practice. See Darr v. Burford, \n339 \nU.S. 200, 210\n-214; Young v. Ragen, \n337 \nU.S. 235, 238\n, note 1; Brown v. Allen, \n344 \nU.S. 443, 447\n-450. As is stated in the Reviser's Note: \"This new section is declaratory of existing law as affirmed by the Supreme Court.\"\n9\n\u00a0\n\nThe petitioner in this case plainly invoked \"all state remedies available\" and obtained \"a final determination\" of his constitutional claim from the Indiana Supreme Court. Certainly Brown v. Allen, \n344 \nU.S. 443\n, relied \n\n[359 \nU.S. 394, 406]\n\u00a0\n upon by the Court of Appeals, does not bear on his situation. In that case the two petitioners in Daniels v. Allen had 60 days in which to make and serve a statement of the case on appeal from a conviction in the state trial court. Counsel failed to serve this statement until 61 days had expired, and the trial judge struck the appeal as out of time. The pertinent North Carolina rule provided that the time limitation was \"mandatory,\" and precluded an appeal to the State Supreme Court. The State Supreme Court dismissed petitioners' attempted appeal on the ground that no appeal had been filed. This Court held that under the doctrine of exhaustion of state remedies habeas corpus ought not be granted since petitioners had sought too late to invoke North Carolina's \"adequate and easily-complied-with method of appeal.\" \n344 \nU.S., at 485\n. In contrast, the petitioner's appeal from his judgment of conviction to the Indiana Supreme Court raising the constitutional claim was timely and was accepted by that court as fully complying with all pertinent procedural requirements. Furthermore, the State Supreme Court did reach and decide petitioner's federal constitutional claim.\n\nWe therefore hold that the case is governed by the principle that the doctrine of exhaustion of state remedies embodied in 28 U.S.C. 2254 does not bar resort to federal habeas corpus if the petitioner has obtained a decision on his constitutional claims from the highest court of the State, even though, as here, that court could have based its decision on another ground. Wade v. Mayo, \n334 \nU.S. 672\n. In this view, we do not reach the question whether federal habeas corpus would have been available to the petitioner had the Indiana Supreme Court rested its decision on the escape ground.\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded to that court. The Court of Appeals \n\n[359 \nU.S. 394, 407]\n\u00a0\n may decide the merits of petitioner's constitutional claim, or remand to the District Court for further consideration of that claim, as the Court of Appeals may determine.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE STEWART concurs in the judgment and the opinion of the Court, with the understanding that the Court does not here depart from the principles announced in Brown v. Allen, \n344 \nU.S. 443\n.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 2241 provides in pertinent part:\n\n\"(a) Writs of habeas corpus may be granted by the . . . district courts . . . within their respective jurisdictions.\n\n.   .  .  .  .\n\n\n\n\"(c) The writ of habeas corpus shall not be extended to a prisoner unless . . .\n\n.  .  .  .  .\n\n\n\n\"(3) He is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States . . . .\" \n\n[359 \nU.S. 394, 396]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The full text of 2254 is as follows:\n\n\"An application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted unless it appears that the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State, or that there is either an absence of available State corrective process or the existence of circumstances rendering such process ineffective to protect the rights of the prisoner.\n\n\n\"An applicant shall not be deemed to have exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State, within the meaning of this section, if he has the right under the law of the State to raise, by any available procedure, the question presented.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The case was here previously on Irvin's petition seeking direct review on certiorari to the Indiana Supreme Court from that court's decision in Irvin v.

JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, dissenting.\n\nThe problem represented by this case is as old as the Union and will persist as long as our society remains a constitutional federalism. It concerns the relation of the United States and the courts of the United States to the States and the courts of the States. The federal judiciary has no power to sit in judgment upon a determination of a state court unless it is found that it must rest on disposition of a claim under federal law.\n*\n This is so whether a state adjudication comes directly under \n\n[359 \nU.S. 394, 408]\n\u00a0\n review in this Court or reaches us by way of the limited scope of habeas corpus jurisdiction originating in a District Court. (Judicial power is not so restrictively distributed in other federalisms comparable to ours. Neither the Canadian Supreme Court nor the Australian High Court is restricted to reviewing Dominion and Commonwealth issues respectively. The former reviews decisions of provincial courts turning exclusively on provincial law and the latter may review state decisions resting exclusively on state law.) To such an extent is it beyond our power to review state adjudications turning on state law that even in the high tide of nationalism following the Civil War, this Court felt compelled to restrict itself to review of federal questions, in cases coming from state courts, by limiting broadly phrased legislation that seemingly gave this Court power to review all questions, state and federal, in cases jurisdictionally before it. It refused to impute to Congress such a \"radical and hazardous change of a policy vital in its essential nature to the independence of the State courts . . . .\" Murdock v. Memphis, 20 Wall. 590, 630. This decision has not unjustifiably been called one of \"the twin pillars\" (the other is Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304) on which have been built \"the main lines of demarcation between the authority of the state legal systems and that of the federal system.\" Hart, The Relations Between State and Federal Law, 54 Col. L. Rev. 489, 503-504.\n\nSomething that thus goes to the very structure of our federal system in its distribution of power between the United States and the States is not a mere bit of red tape to be cut, on the assumption that this Court has general discretion to see justice done. Nor is it one of those \"technical\" matters that laymen, with more confidence than understanding of our constitutional system, so often disdain. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 394, 409]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn view of so vital a limitation on our jurisdiction, this Court has, until relatively recently, been very strict on insisting on an affirmative showing on the record, when review is here sought, that it clearly appear that the judgment complained of rested on the construction of federal law and was not supportable on a rule of local law beyond our power to question. Particularly in cases where life or liberty is at stake, the Court has relaxed this insistence to the extent of giving state courts an opportunity to clarify a decision that could fairly be said to be obscure or ambiguous in establishing that it rested or could rest on an interpretation of state law. No doubt this procedure makes for delay in ultimate decision. But it ensures that there is no denial of the right to resort to this Court for the vindication of a federal right when a state court's adjudication leaves fair ground for doubt whether a federal right controlled the issue. Experience shows that this procedure for clarification at times establishes that it was, in fact, federal law on which the state decision rested, while in other instances the state court removed all doubt that state law supported its decision, and there was an end of the matter. Compare Whitney v. California, \n274 \nU.S. 357\n, and Herb v. Pitcairn, \n324 \nU.S. 117, 325\n U.S. 77, with State Tax Comm'n v. Van Cott, \n306 \nU.S. 511\n, and Van Cott v. State Tax Comm'n, 98 Utah 264, 96 P.2d 740; Minnesota v. National Tea Co., \n309 \nU.S. 551\n, and National Tea Co. v. State, 208 Minn. 607, 294 N. W. 230; Williams v. Georgia, \n349 \nU.S. 375\n, and Williams v. State, 211 Ga. 763, 88 S. E. 2d 376.\n\nEven the most benign or latitudinarian attitude in reading state court opinions precludes today's decision. It is not questioned that the Indiana Supreme Court discussed two issues, one indisputably a rule of local law and the other a claim under the Fourteenth Amendment. That court discussed the claim under the Fourteenth Amendment rather summarily, after it had dealt \n\n[359 \nU.S. 394, 410]\n\u00a0\n extensively with the problem of local law. If the Indiana court's opinion had stopped with its lengthy discussion of the local law and had not gone on to consider the federal issue, prefacing its consideration with the introductory sentence that \"[o]ur decision on the point under examination makes it unnecessary for us to consider the other contentions of the appellant; however, because of the finality of the sentence in the case we have reviewed the evidence to satisfy ourselves that there is no miscarriage of justice in this case . . .\" (Irvin v. State, 236 Ind. 384, 392-393, 139 N. E. 2d 898, 902), it is inconceivable that, on the proceeding before us, we would entertain jurisdiction. What this Court is therefore saying, in effect, is that it interprets the discussion of the Fourteenth Amendment problem which follows the elaborate and potentially conclusive discussion of the state issue not as resting the case on two grounds, state and federal, but as a total abandonment of the state ground, a legal erasing of the seven-page discussion of state law. Concededly, if a state court rests a decision on both an adequate state ground and a federal ground, this Court is without jurisdiction to review the superfluous federal ground. For while state courts are subject to the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution (Art. VI, 2), they are so subject only if that Clause becomes operative, and they need not pass on a federal issue if a relevant rule of state law can dispose of the litigation.\n\nIt may be that it is the unwritten practice of the Indiana Supreme Court to have an \"unnecessary\" consideration of a federal issue wipe out or displace a prior full discussion of a controlling state ground. Maybe so. But it is surely not a self-evident proposition that discussion of a federal claim constitutes abandonment of a prior disposition of a case on a relevant and conclusive state ground. The frequency with which state court opinions indulge in the superfluity of dealing with a federal issue, \n\n[359 \nU.S. 394, 411]\n\u00a0\n after resting a case on a state ground, affords abundant proof that we cannot take judicial notice of an inference that a federal question discussion following a state-ground disposition spells abandonment of the latter. Perhaps if counsel had documented such an Indiana practice, had supplied us with a basis for drawing that conclusion regarding the appropriate way of reading Indiana opinions, this Court itself would be entitled to find that such is the way in which Indiana decisions must be read. But we cannot extemporize the existence of such an Indiana practice as a basis for our jurisdiction. Restricted, as we are restricted, to the text of what the Supreme Court of Indiana wrote in 236 Ind. 384, 139 N. E. 2d 898, in ascertaining what it is that the Indiana Supreme Court meant to do when it first enlarged upon a controlling state ground and then, ex gratia, dealt with an \"unnecessary\" federal ground, we are not free to pluck from the air an undocumented state practice on the strength of which we are to ignore the bulk of the state court's opinion and treat it as though it had not been written or its significance had been discredited by the Indiana Supreme Court.\n\nIn the most compassionate mood, all we are entitled to do in a case like this, where life is at stake, is to afford an opportunity for the Indiana Supreme Court to tell us whether, in fact, it abandoned its state ground and rested its decision solely on the \"unnecessary\" federal ground. Thus only could this Court acquire jurisdiction over the federal question. Such a remission to the Indiana Supreme Court, by an appropriate procedure, for a clarification of its intention in writing this double-barreled opinion would be in full accord with the series of cases in which the state court was given opportunity to clarify its purpose. To assume, as the Court does, that the Indiana Supreme Court threw into the discard an elaborately considered local law rule is, I most respectfully submit, to assume a jurisdiction that we do not have. This assumption of \n\n[359 \nU.S. 394, 412]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction cannot help but call to mind the admonition of Benjamin R. Curtis, one of the notable members in the Court's history, that \"questions of jurisdiction were questions of power as between the United States and the several States.\" 2 Cliff. 614 (1st Cir.).\n\nWith due regard to the limits of our jurisdiction there is only one other mode of reading the opinion of the Indiana Supreme Court, one other mode, that is, by which the meaning of its opinion is to be decided by that court and not this. That is the mode which my brother HARLAN has explicated, and it is entirely consistent with the governing considerations which I have tried to set forth for me also to join, as I do join, his dissenting opinion.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] The formulation by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, for the Court, of this jurisdictional sine qua non in California Powder Works v. Davis, \n151 \nU.S. 389, 393\n, represents the undeviating practice of the Court until today:\n\n\"It is axiomatic that, in order to give this court jurisdiction on writ of error to the highest court of a State in which a decision in the suit could be had, it must appear affirmatively not only that a Federal question was presented for decision by the highest court of the State having jurisdiction, but that its decision was necessary to the determination of the cause, and that it was actually decided or that the judgment as rendered could not have been given without deciding it. And where the decision complained of rests on an independent ground, not involving a Federal question and broad enough to maintain the judgment, the writ of error will be dismissed by this court without considering any Federal question that may also have been presented.\"\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, MR. JUSTICE CLARK, and MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER join, dissenting.\n\nAlthough I agree that federal consideration of petitioner's constitutional claims is not foreclosed by the decision of the Supreme Court of Indiana, I think that the Court's disposition of the matter, which contemplates the overturning of petitioner's conviction without the necessity of further proceedings in the state courts if his constitutional contentions are ultimately federally sustained, rests upon an impermissible interpretation of the opinion of the State Supreme Court (236 Ind. 384, 139 N. E. 2d 898), and that a different procedural course is required if state and federal concerns in this situation are to be kept in proper balance.\n\nIt is clear that the federal courts would be without jurisdiction to consider petitioner's constitutional claims on habeas corpus if the Supreme Court of Indiana rejected those claims because, irrespective of their possible merit, they were not presented to it in compliance with the State's \"adequate and easily-complied-with \n\n[359 \nU.S. 394, 413]\n\u00a0\n method of appeal.\" Brown v. Allen, \n344 \nU.S. 443, 485\n. The first question that concerns us, therefore, is whether the state court's judgment affirming the conviction rests independently on such a state ground.\n\nAt the outset we must keep in mind several aspects of Indiana criminal procedure, and the manner in which petitioner's attorneys presented his appeal to the Indiana Supreme Court, all as noted in this Court's opinion. The procedural aspects are (1) that no appeal lies from an order denying a new trial as such, that kind of an order being reviewable only in connection with an appeal from the final judgment in the case; (2) an escapee, such as this petitioner was, has no standing to make a motion for a new trial, at least if he is at large throughout the period available for the making of such a motion, 236 Ind., at 386-392, 139 N. E. 2d, at 898-902; and (3) an appellant must perfect his appeal by filing assignments of error and a transcript of the record. In the taking of petitioner's appeal from the judgment of conviction the only assignment of error filed related to the trial court's denial of the motion for a new trial. While that assignment was supported by a detailed specification of petitioner's constitutional claims, none of such claims was independently filed as an assignment of error.\n\nHad the State Supreme Court declined without more to reach petitioner's constitutional contentions because (1) his motion for a new trial had been forfeited by reason of escape, and (2) such claims had not independently been assigned as error, the federal courts would not, as has been said, be entitled to consider them. The difficulty here is that the state court did not stop at this juncture, but, after pointing out that petitioner had assigned as error only the denial of his motion for a new trial and holding that such denial was not error because of petitioner's escape, went on to consider and find without merit petitioner's constitutional claims. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 394, 414]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThis Court infers from the fact that the Indiana court considered petitioner's constitutional contentions that its affirmance of his conviction rested entirely on the denial of those claims. It reads the state court's opinion as saying that although that court could under state law properly rest its affirmance of the conviction on petitioner's failure to assign as error anything but the denial of his motion for a new trial, which, as we have seen, was held to have been properly denied under the State's \"escapee\" rule, it would not do so but would treat petitioner's constitutional claims as if they had themselves been presented as assignments of error, rather than only as grounds supporting the error assigned to the trial court's order denying a new trial. I think this reading of the state court's opinion defies its plain language.\n\nThe state court devotes no less than seven pages of its nine-page opinion to an exhaustive discussion of the rule of state law which requires denial of a new trial motion made by an escapee still at large. At the close of this discussion it says:\n\n \"The action upon which the appellant predicates error in this appeal is based solely upon the overruling of a motion for a new trial. There is no other error claimed. Since appellant had no standing in court at the time he filed a motion for a new trial the situation is the same as if no motion for a new trial had been filed, or he had voluntarily permitted the time to expire for such filing. His letter reveals he was aware of this right, and had talked with his attorneys about a new trial and an appeal.\n\n\n \"No error could have been committed in overruling the motion for a new trial under the circumstances.\n\n\n \"Our decision on the point under examination makes it unnecessary for us to consider the other \n\n[359 \nU.S. 394, 415]\n\u00a0\n contentions of the appellant; however, because of the finality of the sentence in the case we have reviewed the evidence to satisfy ourselves that there is no miscarriage of justice in this case. . . .\" 236 Ind., at 392-393, 139 N. E. 2d, at 901-902.\n\n\n The opinion then reviews the petitioner's constitutional contentions, and concludes with the statement:\n\n \"It does not appear from the record and argument had, that the appellant was denied due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment, or due course of law under the Bill of Rights, or that there was any miscarriage of justice when he was convicted and given the death penalty.\" 236 Ind., at 394, 139 N. E. 2d, at 902.\n\n\n This Court's reading of the Indiana opinion makes the exhaustive discussion in that opinion of the status of an escapee under Indiana law entirely unnecessary and meaningless. While I agree with the Court that the Indiana Supreme Court reached a \"considered conclusion that the conviction resulting in the death sentence was not obtained in disregard of the protections secured to the petitioner by the Constitution of the United States,\" it is fully apparent that the state court ultimately rested its judgment of affirmance squarely on the ground that the petitioner's sole assignment of error, the denial of his motion for a new trial, was without merit because he was an escapee when that motion was made, and when it was denied. The fact that the Indiana court also reached a conclusion that petitioner's claims of constitutional deprivation were not made out does not entitle us to ignore the fact that it was on a point of state procedure that it ultimately rested.\n\nNevertheless, I do not think that in the circumstances of this case the State's contention that the federal courts \n\n[359 \nU.S. 394, 416]\n\u00a0\n lack jurisdiction to deal with petitioner's constitutional points can be accepted. The State has conceded that its Supreme Court was empowered in its discretion to disregard the procedural defects in petitioner's appeal. That being so, the state court's constitutional discussion takes on, for me, a vital significance in connection with its procedural holding under state law, namely, that affirmance of petitioner's conviction was rested on this state ground only after the Indiana court, displaying a meticulous concern that state procedural requirements should not be allowed to work a \"miscarriage of justice,\" particularly in view of \"the finality of the sentence,\" had satisfied itself that petitioner's constitutional contentions were untenable. Such a reading of the state court's opinion is required to give meaning to its constitutional discussion, for if petitioner's procedural failures inexorably prevented the state appellate court from reaching his constitutional claims their discussion in its opinion would appear to have been wholly pointless. At the same time this view of the opinion deprives Indiana's procedural holding of vitality as a bar to consideration of petitioner's constitutional claims by the federal courts on habeas corpus, for the decision as to those claims was inextricably a part of that holding. I therefore think that the two courts below should have dealt with the merits of petitioner's constitutional points.\n\nHowever, even were the federal courts ultimately to hold that petitioner was denied due process, it would not be within their province thereupon to order his release. At that point it would unmistakably be the prerogative of the Indiana Supreme Court to decide whether on different postulates of federal constitutional law it would nevertheless hold that under Indiana law petitioner would still be barred from being heard because of his failure to comply with the State's procedural rules. For just as it \n\n[359 \nU.S. 394, 417]\n\u00a0\n is the federal courts' responsibility and duty finally to decide the federal questions presented in this case, it belongs to the Indiana Supreme Court finally to decide the state questions presented in the light of federal decision as to the commands of the Fourteenth Amendment. Hence if petitioner ultimately prevails on his constitutional claims, further proceedings in the state courts will be unavoidable.\n\nIn this state of affairs I think our proper course should be to proceed ourselves to a decision of the constitutional issues, rather than remand the case to the Court of Appeals. If the judgment of the Indiana Supreme Court is potentially going to be called into question because of a federal court's conclusion that it is based in part on erroneous constitutional postulates, I believe that Indiana is entitled to have that conclusion authoritatively pronounced by this Court. Moreover, the District Court, and one judge of the Court of Appeals, have already given clear (and conflicting) statements of their views as to the merits of such issues. The questions have been exhaustively briefed and fully argued before us. And this course would avoid further protracted delay.\n\nWere we to conclude that the Indiana Supreme Court was correct in its premise that petitioner's constitutional points are without merit, the judgment of the Court of Appeals dismissing the writ of habeas corpus should of course be affirmed. If, on the other hand, we should decide that petitioner was in fact deprived of due process at trial, I would hold the case and give petitioner a reasonable opportunity to seek, through such avenues as may be open to him, a determination by the Indiana Supreme Court as to whether, in light of such a decision, it would nevertheless hold that petitioner's failure to comply with the State's procedural rules required affirmance of his conviction. Cf. Patterson v. Alabama, \n294 \nU.S. 600\n; \n\n[359 \nU.S. 394, 418]\n\u00a0\n Williams v. Georgia, \n349 \nU.S. 375\n. Should no such avenues be open to petitioner in Indiana, it would then be time enough to decide what final disposition should be made of this case.\n\nFor these reasons I concur in the view that federal consideration of petitioner's constitutional claims is not precluded, and in all other respects dissent from the Court's opinion. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 394, 419]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","87":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJ.

His petition contained allegations, primarily concerning the introduction into evidence at his trial of a confession coerced by physical mistreatment by police officers, which if true would entitle him to relief. Appended to the petition were various documents, including an opinion of the Supreme Court of Illinois affirming his conviction and simultaneously affirming the denial to him of post-conviction remedies which he had sought in the trial court while \n\n[358 \nU.S. 276, 277]\n\u00a0\n his appeal from the conviction was pending. See People v. Jennings, 11 Ill. 2d 610, 144 N. E. 2d 612.

KOSUGA(1959)\nNo. 267\nArgued: January 22, 1959Decided: February 24, 1959\n\n\n\n\n In this suit brought in a Federal District Court on grounds of diversity of citizenship by a seller to recover from a buyer the unpaid balance due in respect to a lawful sale for a fair consideration, the District Court properly granted the plaintiff's motion to strike an affirmative defense pleaded by the buyer to the effect that the sale was made pursuant to, and as an indivisible part of, an agreement which violated 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. Pp. 516-521.\n\n 257 F.2d 48, affirmed.\n\nJoseph W. Louisell argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief was Ivan E. Barris.\n\nLee A. Freeman argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were Anthony Bradley Eben, Brainerd Currie and Philip B. Kurland.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe respondent sued the petitioner in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois for failing to complete payment of the purchase price of 50 cars of onions which the respondent had sold to the petitioner in December 1955. Jurisdiction was based on diversity of citizenship. The petitioner interposed the defense that the sale was made pursuant to and as an indivisible part of an agreement which violated 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 1. A motion was made to strike this defense and therefore the facts underlying it must be taken to be those set up in the petitioner's answer. Petitioner and respondent were both \n\n[358 \nU.S. 516, 517]\n\u00a0\n engaged in the marketing of onions. Petitioner, who was a grower of onions, admitted that he bought the onions from the respondent. But he alleged that the respondent and one Sam Siegel had represented to him and to other onion growers that they were the owners of substantial amounts of onions in storage, controlling 600 cars in the Chicago area and 400 more elsewhere throughout the country; that respondent and Siegel further informed the petitioner and other growers, at meetings called for the purpose in November and December 1955, that unless the growers purchased a large quantity of these onions, the respondent and Siegel would deliver them on the futures exchange for the purpose of depressing the futures price and the cash market price of onions. The petitioner and the other growers, who usually sold through trade channels, were fearful that this would cause them considerable loss. It was finally agreed by the petitioner and other growers that they would purchase 287 of the 600 cars of onions stored in the Chicago area, and the respondent and Siegel agreed not to deliver any onions on the futures market for the remainder of the current trading season. The petitioner and the other purchasers themselves agreed not to deliver any of the onions purchased from respondent and Siegel on the futures market for the remainder of the season; this was \"for the purpose of creating a false and fictitious market condition,\" and \"to fix the price of onions and limit the amount of onions sold in the State of Illinois.\" The District Court granted respondent's motion and struck the defense as insufficient in law.\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[358 \nU.S. 516, 518]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe District Court then found, on the undisputed facts, that petitioner had in fact purchased the 50 cars of onions from the respondent, at an agreed price of $960 per car, plus storage charges incurred after sale; that petitioner had withdrawn 13 cars of the onions from the designated storage places after the sale, but had not withdrawn the remainder; that while petitioner had made some payments on account of the sale, he had come into default on them; and that, when the onions began to show signs of deterioration, the respondent properly, after repudiation of the purchase by the petitioner, withdrew the remaining cars from storage and sold them for petitioner's account. The District Court entered summary judgment for the unpaid purchase price and storage charges, less the amounts obtained on the sale by respondent, the market price having declined in the interim. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed. 257 F.2d 48. We granted certiorari to consider the availability of the petitioner's pleaded defense of illegality under the Sherman Act to this action to enforce the terms of a sale made under state law. \n358 \nU.S. 811\n.\n\nAs a defense to an action based on contract, the plea of illegality based on violation of the Sherman Act\n2\n has not met with much favor in this Court. This has been notably the case where the plea has been made by a purchaser in an action to recover from him the agreed price of goods sold. In Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co., \n184 \nU.S. 540\n, one who had purchased merchandise from a firm allegedly a combination in restraint of trade was not allowed to set up that fact as a defense to an action for the purchase price. In D. R. Wilder Mfg. Co. v. Corn Products Refining Co., \n236 \nU.S. 165\n, Corn Products sold merchandise to Wilder with a standing offer, of which the \n\n[358 \nU.S. 516, 519]\n\u00a0\n latter apparently had sought to take some advantage, to give Wilder a rebate if it bought exclusively from it. Again, in an action by the seller, Corn Products, to recover the agreed price, the purchaser, Wilder, was denied any defense of illegality based on the Sherman Act. The Court observed that the Sherman Act's express remedies could not be added to judicially by including the avoidance of private contracts as a sanction. Id., at 174-175. Cf. Bruce's Juices, Inc., v. American Can Co., \n330 \nU.S. 743, 755\n. See A. B. Small Co. v. Lamborn & Co., \n267 \nU.S. 248, 252\n, generally to the same effect. Obviously, state law governs in general the rights and duties of sellers and purchasers of goods, and, while the effect of illegality under a federal statute is a matter of federal law, Sola Electric Co. v. Jefferson Electric Co., \n317 \nU.S. 173, 176\n-177, even in diversity actions in the federal courts after Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n, still the federal courts should not be quick to create a policy of nonenforcement of contracts beyond that which is clearly the requirement of the Sherman Act.\n\nThe petitioner recognizes the import of the holdings in Connolly, Wilder and Small, but he argues that they involve situations where a person not party to any unlawful agreement sought to defend against the action on the grounds of the seller's unlawful acts; where the purchaser is party to the unlawful agreement and the agreement bears some relation to the suit, the petitioner claims he is not to be held to the purchase price. The distinction asserted is, to say the least, on its face paradoxical; and the petitioner quotes from this Court's opinion in McMullen v. Hoffman, \n174 \nU.S. 639, 669\n, which dealt with the plea of illegality in another context: \"It has been often stated in similar cases that the defence is a very dishonest one, and it lies ill in the mouth of the defendant to allege it, and it is only allowed for public considerations and in order the better to secure the public against dishonest transactions.\" \n\n[358 \nU.S. 516, 520]\n\u00a0\n Petitioner evidently is willing to take the bitter as well as the sweet from this passage. If the defense of illegality is to be allowed as a collateral method of enforcement of the antitrust laws, as the breadth of the petitioner's argument suggests, it must be said that his theory creates a very strange class of private attorneys general.\n\nIn any event, an analysis of the narrow scope in which the defense is allowed in respect of the Sherman Act indicates that the principle of distinction is not what the petitioner claims it to be. The leading case here in which the defense was allowed is Continental Wall Paper Co. v. Louis Voight & Sons Co., \n212 \nU.S. 227\n, much relied on by petitioner. There the Voight company had made purchases from Continental, a corporation which existed only as a selling agent for numerous wallpaper companies doing business as a pool and selling at prices, alleged to be excessive and unreasonable, fixed through the pool agreement. The Court was of opinion that to give judgment for the excessive purchase price so fixed in favor of such a vendor would be to make the courts a party to the carrying out of one of the very restraints forbidden by the Sherman Act. \n212 \nU.S., at 261\n. Any thought that the Court might have been proceeding on broader grounds was shortly afterwards laid to rest by the unanimous opinion of the Court in the Wilder case. \n236 \nU.S., at 177\n. The scope of the defense of illegality under the Sherman Act goes no further. While enforcement of a contract between wrongdoers may more frequently present such a situation, cf. Lyons v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., 222 F.2d 184, 188, the character of the parties is not in itself determinative. Past the point where the judgment of the Court would itself be enforcing the precise conduct made unlawful by the Act, the courts are to be guided by the overriding general policy, as Mr. Justice Holmes put it, \"of preventing people from getting other people's property for nothing when they purport to be \n\n[358 \nU.S. 516, 521]\n\u00a0\n buying it.\" Continental Wall Paper Co. v. Louis Voight & Sons Co., supra, at 271 (dissenting opinion). Supplying a sanction for the violation of the Act, not in terms provided and capricious in its operation, cf. Bruce's Juices, Inc., v. American Can Co., supra, at 753-754, is avoided by treating the defense as so confined.\n\nAccordingly, while the nondelivery agreement between the parties could not be enforced by a court, if its unlawful character under the Sherman Act be assumed, it can hardly be said to enforce a violation of the Act to give legal effect to a completed sale of onions at a fair price. And while analysis in terms of \"divisibility\" or some other verbal formula may well be circular, see 6 Corbin, Contracts, 1520, in any event, where, as here, a lawful sale for a fair consideration constitutes an intelligible economic transaction in itself, we do not think it inappropriate or violative of the intent of the parties to give it effect even though it furnished the occasion for a restrictive agreement of the sort here in question. Cf. Cincinnati, Portsmouth, Big Sandy & Pomeroy Packet Co. v. Bay, \n200 \nU.S. 179, 185\n.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BLACK and MR.

COMPAGNIE GENERALE(1959)\nNo. 22\nArgued: November 13, 1958Decided: February 24, 1959\n\n\n\n\n While visiting a seaman on board a vessel berthed at a pier in New York City, petitioner was injured by a fall down a stairway. Basing jurisdiction on diversity of citizenship, he brought an action for damages in a Federal District Court against the shipowner. He alleged unseaworthiness of the vessel and negligence of its crew. The jury returned a verdict for petitioner; but the District Court set it aside and dismissed the complaint. Held: Judgment vacated and case remanded to the District Court with instructions to reinstate the jury verdict and enter judgment accordingly. Pp. 626-632.\n\n 1. Since petitioner was injured aboard a ship upon navigable waters, the case is within full range of admiralty jurisdiction and is governed by the standards of maritime law; and the District Court erred in ruling that it was governed by New York law. Pp. 628-629.\n\n\n 2. The District Judge erred in instructing the jury that contributory negligence on petitioner's part would operate as a complete bar to recovery; he should have told the jury that petitioner's contributory negligence was to be considered only in mitigation of damages; but this error did not prejudice petitioner, because the jury found in his favor. P. 629.\n\n\n 3. The District Judge was correct in eliminating from the case the claim based on unseaworthiness, since petitioner was not a member of the ship's company nor of that broadened class of workmen to whom the admiralty law has latterly extended the absolute right to a seaworthy ship. P. 629.\n\n\n 4. Under maritime law, the owner of a ship in navigable waters owes to all who are on board for purposes not inimical to his legitimate interests the duty of exercising reasonable care under the circumstances of each case. Pp. 629-632.\n\n\n 245 F.2d 175, judgment vacated and case remanded to the District Court. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 625, 626]\n\u00a0\n\n\nEdward J. Malament argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief was Malcolm B. Rosow.\n\nGeorge A. Garvey argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nOn November 24, 1948, the respondent's vessel, the S. S. Oregon, was berthed at a pier in the North River, New York City. About noon on that day Joseph Kermarec came aboard to visit Henry Yves, a member of the ship's crew. The purpose of the visit was entirely personal, to pay a social call upon Yves and to give him a package to be delivered to a mutual friend in France. In accordance with customary practice permitting crew members to entertain guests aboard the vessel, Yves had obtained a pass from the executive officer authorizing Kermarec to come aboard.\n1\n As he started to leave the ship several hours later, Kermarec fell and was injured while descending a stairway.\n\nOn the theory that his fall had been caused by the defective manner in which a canvas runner had been \n\n[358 \nU.S. 625, 627]\n\u00a0\n tacked to the stairway, Kermaree brought an action for personal injuries in the District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging unseaworthiness of the vessel and negligence on the part of its crew. Federal jurisdiction was invoked by reason of the diverse citizenship of the parties, and a jury trial was demanded.\n\nThe district judge was of the view that the substantive law of New York was applicable. Accordingly, he eliminated the unseaworthiness claim from the case and instructed the jury that Kermarec was \"a gratuitous licensee\" who could recover only if the defendant had failed to warn him of a dangerous condition within its actual knowledge, and only if Kermarec himself had been entirely free of contributory negligence.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nThe jury returned a verdict in Kermarec's favor. Subsequently the trial court granted a motion to set the verdict aside and dismiss the complaint, ruling that there \n\n[358 \nU.S. 625, 628]\n\u00a0\n had been a complete failure of proof that the shipowner had actually known that the stairway was in a dangerous or defective condition. A divided Court of Appeals affirmed. The opinion of that court does not make clear whether affirmance was based upon agreement with the trial judge that New York law was applicable, or upon a determination that the controlling legal principles would in any event be no different under maritime law. 245 F.2d 175. Certiorari was granted to examine both of these issues. \n355 \nU.S. 902\n.\n\nThe District Court was in error in ruling that the governing law in this case was that of the State of New York. Kermarec was injured aboard a ship upon navigable waters. It was there that the conduct of which he complained occurred. The legal rights and liabilities arising from that conduct were therefore within the full reach of the admiralty jurisdiction and measurable by the standards of maritime law. See The Plymouth, 3 Wall. 20; Philadelphia, W. & B. R. Co. v. Philadelphia & Havre de Grace Steam Tugboat Co., 23 How. 209, 215; The Commerce, 1 Black 574, 579; The Rock Island Bridge, 6 Wall. 213, 215; The Belfast, 7 Wall. 624, 640; Leathers v. Blessing, \n105 \nU.S. 626, 630\n; The Admiral Peoples, \n295 \nU.S. 649, 651\n. If this action had been brought in a state court, reference to admiralty law would have been necessary to determine the rights and liabilities of the parties. Carlisle Packing Co. v. Sandanger, \n259 \nU.S. 255, 259\n. Where the plaintiff exercises the right conferred by diversity of citizenship to choose a federal forum, the result is no different, even though he exercises the further right to a jury trial. Whatever doubt may once have existed on that score was effectively laid to rest by Pope & Talbot, Inc., v. Hawn, \n346 \nU.S. 406, 410\n-411. It thus becomes necessary to consider whether prejudice resulted from the court's application of the substantive law of New York. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 625, 629]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn instructing the jury that contributory negligence on Kermarec's part would operate as a complete bar to recovery, the district judge was clearly in error. The jury should have been told instead that Kermarec's contributory negligence was to be considered only in mitigation of damages. The Max Morris, \n137 \nU.S. 1\n; Pope & Talbot, Inc., v. Hawn, \n346 \nU.S. 406, 408\n-409. It is equally clear, however, that this error did not prejudice Kermarec. By returning a verdict in his favor, the jury necessarily found that Kermarec had not in fact been guilty of contributory negligence \"even in the slightest degree.\"\n\nThe district judge refused to submit the issue of unseaworthiness to the jury for the reason that an action for unseaworthiness is unknown to the common law of New York. Although the basis for its action was inappropriate, the court was correct in eliminating the unseaworthiness claim from this case. Kermarec was not a member of the ship's company, nor of that broadened class of workmen to whom the admiralty law has latterly extended the absolute right to a seaworthy ship. See Mahnich v. Southern S. S. Co., \n321 \nU.S. 96\n; Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, \n328 \nU.S. 85\n; Pope & Talbot, Inc., v. Hawn, \n346 \nU.S. 406\n. Kermarec was aboard not to perform ship's work, but simply to visit a friend.\n\nIt is apparent, therefore, that prejudicial error occurred in this case only if the maritime law imposed upon the shipowner a standard of care higher than the duty which the district judge found owing to a gratuitous licensee under the law of New York. If, in other words, the shipowner owed Kermarec the duty of exercising ordinary care, then upon this record Kermarec was entitled to judgment, the jury having resolved the factual issues in his favor under instructions less favorable to him than should \n\n[358 \nU.S. 625, 630]\n\u00a0\n have been given.\n3\n Stated broadly, the decisive issue is thus whether admiralty recognizes the same distinctions between an invitee and a licensee as does the common law.\n\nIt is a settled principle of maritime law that a shipowner owes the duty of exercising reasonable care towards those lawfully aboard the vessel who are not members of the crew. Leathers v. Blessing, \n105 \nU.S. 626\n; The Max Morris, \n137 \nU.S. 1\n; The Admiral Peoples, \n295 \nU.S. 649\n.\n4\n But this Court has never determined whether a different and lower standard of care is demanded if the ship's visitor is a person to whom the label \"licensee\" can be attached. The issue must be decided in the performance of the Court's function in declaring the general maritime law, free from inappropriate common-law concepts. The Lottawanna, 21 Wall. 558; The Max Morris, \n137 \nU.S. 1\n.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nThe distinctions which the common law draws between licensee and invitee were inherited from a culture deeply rooted to the land, a culture which traced many of its standards to a heritage of feudalism. In an effort to do justice in an industrialized urban society, with its complex economic and individual relationships, modern common-law courts have found it necessary to formulate increasingly subtle verbal refinements, to create subclassifications among traditional common-law categories, and to delineate fine gradations in the standards of care which the landowner owes to each.\n6\n Yet even \n\n[358 \nU.S. 625, 631]\n\u00a0\n within a single jurisdiction, the classifications and subclassifications bred by the common law have produced confusion and conflict.\n7\n As new distinctions have been spawned, older ones have become obscured. Through this semantic morass the common law has moved, unevenly and with hesitation, towards \"imposing on owners and occupiers a single duty of reasonable care in all the circumstances.\"\n8\n\u00a0\n\nFor the admiralty law at this late date to import such conceptual distinctions would be foreign to its traditions of simplicity and practicality. The Lottawanna, 21 Wall. 558, at 575. The incorporation of such concepts appears particularly unwarranted when it is remembered that they originated under a legal system in which status depended almost entirely upon the nature of the individual's estate with respect to real property, a legal system \n\n[358 \nU.S. 625, 632]\n\u00a0\n in that respect entirely alien to the law of the sea.\n9\n We hold that the owner of a ship in navigable waters owes to all who are on board for purposes not inimical to his legitimate interests the duty of exercising reasonable care under the circumstances of each case.\n10\n It follows that in the present case the judgment must be vacated and the case remanded to the District Court with instructions to reinstate the jury verdict and enter judgment accordingly.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The pass contained the following language: \"The person accepting this pass in consideration thereof assumes all risks of accidents, and expressly agrees that the Compagnie Generale Transatlantique shall not be held liable under any circumstances whether by negligence of their employees, or otherwise, for any injury to his person or for any loss or injury to his property.\" The district judge instructed the jury that this attempted disclaimer could have no effect unless it had been made known to Kermarec. The evidence showed that Kermarec had not seen the pass. By its verdict the jury implicitly found that Kermarec had not been informed of the language appearing on it. Since that finding is not disputed here, we need not consider what effect the attempted disclaimer would have had if Kermarec had been aware of it. See Moore v. American Scantic Line, Inc., 121 F.2d 767. Compare 46 U.S.C. 183c.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] \"With respect to the first issue of fact, namely, the alleged negligence of the defendant, you must bear in mind that the owner of a ship such as the defendant is subject to liability for bodily harm caused to a gratuitous licensee, such as the plaintiff, by any artificial condition on board the ship, only if both of the following conditions are present: (1) if the defendant knows of the unsafe condition and realizes that it involves an unreasonable risk to the plaintiff and has reason to believe that the plaintiff will not discover the condition or realize the risk; and (2) if the defendant invites or permits the plaintiff to enter or remain upon the ship without exercising reasonable care either to make the condition reasonably safe or to warn the plaintiff of the condition and risk involved therein.\n\n\"In short, in order that the plaintiff recover in this case, he must establish by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the defendant knew of the unsafe condition and invited the plaintiff aboard without either correcting the condition or warning him of it.\n\n.  .  .  .  .\n\n\n\n\"In connection with damages, if you find that the plaintiff's injuries were the proximate result of the defendant's negligence and the plaintiff's own contributory negligence, even in the slightest degree, then the plaintiff cannot recover at all.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The record clearly justifies a finding that the canvas runner was defectively tacked to the stairway, and that this caused a dangerous condition of which the shipowner's agent would have known in the exercise of ordinary care. By its verdict, the jury found that much and more.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Cf. The Osceola, \n189 \nU.S. 158\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Where there is no impingement upon legislative policy. Cf. United States v. Atlantic Mut. Inc. Co., \n343 \nU.S. 236\n; Halcyon Lines v. Haenn Ship Corp., \n342 \nU.S. 282\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Random selection of almost any modern decision will serve to illustrate the point. E. g., Chicago G. W. R. Co. v. Beecher, \n\n[358 \nU.S. 625, 131]\n\u00a0\n 150 F.2d 394 (licensee by express invitation; licensee by implied invitation; bare licensee).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] For example, the duty of an occupier toward a licensee under the law of New York, which the District Court thought applicable in the present case, appears far from clear. Compare Fox v. Warner-Quinlan Asphalt Co., 204 N. Y. 240, 245, 97 N. E. 497, 498; Mendelowitz v. Neisner, 258 N. Y. 181, 184, 179 N. E. 378, 379; Paquet v. Barker, 250 App. Div. 771, 293 N. Y.

Membership in the ship's company, for example, a status that confers an absolute right to a seaworthy ship, is peculiar to the law of the sea. Such status has now been extended to others aboard \"doing a seaman's work and incurring a seaman's hazards.\" Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, \n328 \nU.S. 85\n, at 99.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] The inconsistent and diverse results reached by courts which have tried to apply to the facts of shipboard life common-law distinctions between licensees and invitees reinforce the conclusion here reached.

Wise.\n\nCharles A. Brind, Jr. argued the cause and filed a brief for appellees.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nOnce again the Court is required to consider the impact of New York's motion picture licensing law upon First Amendment liberties, protected by the Fourteenth Amendment from infringement by the States. Cf. Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, \n343 \nU.S. 495\n.\n\nThe New York statute makes it unlawful \"to exhibit, or to sell, lease or lend for exhibition at any place of amusement for pay or in connection with any business in the state of New York, any motion picture film or reel \n\n[360 \nU.S. 684, 685]\n\u00a0\n [with certain exceptions not relevant here], unless there is at the time in full force and effect a valid license or permit therefor of the education department. . . .\"\n1\n The law provides that a license shall issue \"unless such film or a part thereof is obscene, indecent, immoral, inhuman, sacrilegious, or is of such a character that its exhibition would tend to corrupt morals or incite to crime. . . .\"\n2\n A recent statutory amendment provides that, \"the term `immoral' and the phrase `of such a character that its exhibition would tend to corrupt morals' shall denote a motion picture film or part thereof, the dominant purpose or effect of which is erotic or pornographic; or which portrays acts of sexual immorality, perversion, or lewdness, or which expressly or impliedly presents such acts as desirable, acceptable or proper patterns of behavior.\"\n3\n\u00a0\n\nAs the distributor of a motion picture entitled \"Lady Chatterley's Lover,\" the appellant Kingsley submitted that film to the Motion Picture Division of the New York Education Department for a license. Finding three isolated scenes in the film \"`immoral' within the intent of our Law,\" the Division refused to issue a license until the scenes in question were deleted. The distributor petitioned the Regents of the University of the State of New York for a review of that ruling.\n4\n The Regents upheld the denial of a license, but on the broader ground that \"the whole theme of this motion picture is immoral under said law, for that theme is the presentation of adultery as a desirable, acceptable and proper pattern of behavior.\" \n\n[360 \nU.S. 684, 686]\n\u00a0\n\n\nKingsley sought judicial review of the Regents' determination.\n5\n The Appellate Division unanimously annulled the action of the Regents and directed that a license be issued. 4 App. Div. 2d 348, 165 N. Y. S. 2d 681. A sharply divided Court of Appeals, however, reversed the Appellate Division and upheld the Regents' refusal to license the film for exhibition. 4 N. Y. 2d 349, 151 N. E. 2d 197, 175 N. Y. S. 2d 39.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nThe Court of Appeals unanimously and explicitly rejected any notion that the film is obscene.\n7\n See Roth \n\n[360 \nU.S. 684, 687]\n\u00a0\n v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 476\n. Rather, the court found that the picture as a whole \"alluringly portrays adultery as proper behavior.\" As Chief Judge Conway's prevailing opinion emphasized, therefore, the only portion of the statute involved in this case is that part of 122 and 122-a of the Education Law requiring the denial of a license to motion pictures \"which are immoral in that they portray `acts of sexual immorality . . . as desirable, acceptable or proper patterns of behavior.'\"\n8\n 4 N. Y. 2d, at 351, 151 N. E. 2d, at 197, 175 N. Y. S. 2d, at 40. A majority of the Court of Appeals ascribed to that language a precise purpose of the New York Legislature to require the denial of a license to a motion picture \"because its subject matter is adultery presented as being right and desirable for certain people under \n\n[360 \nU.S. 684, 688]\n\u00a0\n certain circumstances.\"\n9\n 4 N. Y. 2d, at 369, 151 N. E. 2d, at 208, 175 N. Y. S. 2d, at 55 (concurring opinion).\n\nWe accept the premise that the motion picture here in question can be so characterized. We accept too, as we must, the construction of the New York Legislature's language which the Court of Appeals has put upon it. Albertson v. Millard, \n345 \nU.S. 242\n; United States v. Burnison, \n339 \nU.S. 87\n; Aero Mayflower Transit Co. v. Board of R. R. Comm'rs, \n332 \nU.S. 495\n. That construction, we emphasize, gives to the term \"sexual immorality\" a concept entirely different from the concept embraced in words like \"obscenity\" or \"pornography.\"\n10\n Moreover, it is not suggested that the film would itself operate as an incitement to illegal action. Rather, the New York Court of Appeals tells us that the relevant portion of the New York Education Law requires the denial of a license to any motion picture which approvingly portrays an adulterous relationship, quite without reference to the manner of its portrayal.\n\nWhat New York has done, therefore, is to prevent the exhibition of a motion picture because that picture advocates an idea - that adultery under certain circumstances may be proper behavior. Yet the First Amendment's basic guarantee is of freedom to advocate ideas. The State, quite simply, has thus struck at the very heart of constitutionally protected liberty.\n\nIt is contended that the State's action was justified because the motion picture attractively portrays a relationship which is contrary to the moral standards, the religious precepts, and the legal code of its citizenry. This \n\n[360 \nU.S. 684, 689]\n\u00a0\n argument misconceives what it is that the Constitution protects. Its guarantee is not confined to the expression of ideas that are conventional or shared by a majority. It protects advocacy of the opinion that adultery may sometimes be proper, no less than advocacy of socialism or the single tax. And in the realm of ideas it protects expression which is eloquent no less than that which is unconvincing.\n\nAdvocacy of conduct proscribed by law is not, as Mr. Justice Brandeis long ago pointed out, \"a justification for denying free speech where the advocacy falls short of incitement and there is nothing to indicate that the advocacy would be immediately acted on.\" Whitney v. California, \n274 \nU.S. 357\n, at 376 (concurring opinion). \"Among free men, the deterrents ordinarily to be applied to prevent crime are education and punishment for violations of the law, not abridgment of the rights of free speech. . . .\" Id., at 378.\n11\n\u00a0\n\nThe inflexible command which the New York Court of Appeals has attributed to the State Legislature thus cuts so close to the core of constitutional freedom as to make it quite needless in this case to examine the periphery. Specifically, there is no occasion to consider the appellant's contention that the State is entirely without power to require films of any kind to be licensed prior to their exhibition. Nor need we here determine whether, despite problems peculiar to motion pictures, the controls which a State may impose upon this medium of expression \n\n[360 \nU.S. 684, 690]\n\u00a0\n are precisely coextensive with those allowable for newspapers,\n12\n books,\n13\n or individual speech.\n14\n It is enough for the present case to reaffirm that motion pictures are within the First and Fourteenth Amendments' basic protection.

As stated above, `The law is concerned with effect, not merely with but one means of producing it.' It must be firmly borne in mind that to give obscenity, as defined, the stature of the only constitutional limitation is to extend an invitation to corrupt the public morals by methods of presentation which craft will insure do not fall squarely within the definition of that term. Precedent, just as sound principle, will not support a statement that motion pictures must be `out and out' obscene before they may be \n\n[360 \nU.S. 684, 687]\n\u00a0\n censored.\" 4 N.

Judge Van Voorhis' dissenting opinion stated: \"[I]t is impossible to write off this entire drama as `mere pornography' . . . .\" Judge Van Voorhis, however, would have remitted the case to the Board of Regents to consider whether certain \"passages\" in the film \"might have been eliminated as `obscene' without doing violence to constitutional liberties.\" 4 N.

JUSTICE BLACK, concurring.\n\nI concur in the Court's opinion and judgment but add a few words because of concurring opinions by several Justices who rely on their appraisal of the movie Lady Chatterley's Lover for holding that New York cannot constitutionally bar it. Unlike them, I have not seen the picture. My view is that stated by MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, that prior censorship of moving pictures like prior censorship of newspapers and books violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments. If despite the Constitution, however, this Nation is to embark on the dangerous road of censorship, my belief is that this Court is about the most inappropriate Supreme Board of Censors that could be found. So far as I know, judges possess no special expertise providing exceptional competency to set standards and to supervise the private morals of the Nation. In addition, the Justices of this Court seem especially unsuited to make the kind of value judgments - as to what movies are good or bad for local communities - which the concurring opinions appear to require. We are told that the only way we can decide whether a State or municipality can constitutionally bar movies is for this Court to view and appraise each movie on a case-by-case basis. Under these circumstances, every member of the \n\n[360 \nU.S. 684, 691]\n\u00a0\n Court must exercise his own judgment as to how bad a picture is, a judgment which is ultimately based at least in large part on his own standard of what is immoral. The end result of such decisions seems to me to be a purely personal determination by individual Justices as to whether a particular picture viewed is too bad to allow it to be seen by the public. Such an individualized determination cannot be guided by reasonably fixed and certain standards. Accordingly, neither States nor moving picture makers can possibly know in advance, with any fair degree of certainty, what can or cannot be done in the field of movie making and exhibiting. This uncertainty cannot easily be reconciled with the rule of law which our Constitution envisages.\n\nThe different standards which different people may use to decide about the badness of pictures are well illustrated by the contrasting standards mentioned in the opinion of the New York Court of Appeals and the concurring opinion of MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER here. As I read the New York court's opinion this movie was held immoral and banned because it makes adultery too alluring. MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER quotes Mr. Lawrence, author of the book from which the movie was made, as believing censorship should be applied only to publications that make sex look ugly, that is, as I understand it, less alluring.\n\nIn my judgment, this Court should not permit itself to get into the very center of such policy controversies, which have so little in common with lawsuits.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, concurring in the result.\n\nAs one whose taste in art and literature hardly qualifies him for the avant-garde, I am more than surprised, after viewing the picture, that the New York authorities should have banned \"Lady Chatterley's Lover.\" To assume that this motion picture would have offended Victorian \n\n[360 \nU.S. 684, 692]\n\u00a0\n moral sensibilities is to rely only on the stuffiest of Victorian conventions. Whatever one's personal preferences may be about such matters, the refusal to license the exhibition of this picture, on the basis of the 1954 amendment to the New York State Education Law, can only mean that that enactment forbids the public showing of any film that deals with adultery except by way of sermonizing condemnation or depicts any physical manifestation of an illicit amorous relation. Since the denial of a license by the Board of Regents was confirmed by the highest court of the State, I have no choice but to agree with this Court's judgment in holding that the State exceeded the bounds of free expression protected by the \"liberty\" of the Fourteenth Amendment. But I also believe that the Court's opinion takes ground that exceeds the appropriate limits for decision. By way of reinforcing my brother HARLAN'S objections to the scope of the Court's opinion, I add the following.\n\nEven the author of \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\" did not altogether rule out censorship, nor was his passionate zeal on behalf of society's profound interest in the endeavors of true artists so doctrinaire as to be unmindful of the facts of life regarding the sordid exploitation of man's nature and impulses. He knew there was such a thing as pornography, dirt for dirt's sake, or, to be more accurate, dirt for money's sake. This is what D. H. Lawrence wrote:\n\n \"But even I would censor genuine pornography, rigorously. It would not be very difficult. In the first place, genuine pornography is almost always underworld, it doesn't come into the open. In the second, you can recognize it by the insult it offers invariably, to sex, and to the human spirit.\n\n\n \"Pornography is the attempt to insult sex, to do dirt on it. This is unpardonable. Take the very lowest instance, the picture post-card sold underhand, \n\n[360 \nU.S. 684, 693]\n\u00a0\n by the underworld, in most cities. What I have seen of them have been of an ugliness to make you cry. The insult to the human body, the insult to a vital human relationship! Ugly and cheap they make the human nudity, ugly and degraded they make the sexual act, trivial and cheap and nasty.\" (D. H. Lawrence, Pornography and Obscenity, pp. 12-13.)\n\n\n This traffic has not lessened since Lawrence wrote. Apparently it is on the increase. In the course of the recent debate in both Houses of Parliament on the Obscene Publications Bill, now on its way to passage, designed to free British authors from the hazards of too rigorous application in our day of Lord Cockburn's ruling, in 1868, in Regina v. Hicklin, L. R. 3 Q. B. 360, weighty experience was adduced regarding the extensive dissemination of pornographic materials.\n1\n See 597 Parliamentary Debates, H. C., No. 36 (Tuesday, December 16, 1958), cols. 992 et seq., and 216 Parliamentary Debates H. L., No. 77 (Tuesday, June 2, 1959), cols. 489 et seq. Nor is there any reason to believe that on this side of the ocean there has been a diminution in the pornographic business which years ago sought a flourishing market in some of the leading secondary schools for boys, who presumably had more means than boys in the public high schools.\n\nIt is not surprising, therefore, that the pertinacious, eloquent and free-spirited promoters of the liberalizing legislation in Great Britain did not conceive the needs of a civilized society, in assuring the utmost freedom to those who make literature and art possible - authors, artists, publishers, producers, book sellers - easily attainable by sounding abstract and unqualified dogmas about freedom. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 684, 694]\n\u00a0\n They had a keen awareness that freedom of expression is no more an absolute than any other freedom, an awareness that is reflected in the opinions of Mr. Justice Holmes and Mr. Justice Brandeis, to whom we predominantly owe the present constitutional safeguards on behalf of freedom of expression. And see Near v. Minnesota, \n283 \nU.S. 697, 715\n-716, for limitations on constitutionally protected freedom of speech.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nIn short, there is an evil against which a State may constitutionally protect itself, whatever we may think about the questions of policy involved. The real problem is the formulation of constitutionally allowable safeguards which society may take against evil without impinging upon the necessary dependence of a free society upon the fullest scope of free expression. One cannot read the debates in the House of Commons and the House of Lords and not realize the difficulty of reconciling these conflicting interests, in the framing of legislation on the ends of which there was agreement, even for those who most generously espouse that freedom of expression without which all freedom gradually withers.\n\nIt is not our province to meet these recalcitrant problems of legislative drafting. Ours is the vital but very limited task of scrutinizing the work of the draftsmen in order to determine whether they have kept within the narrow limits of the kind of censorship which even D. H. Lawrence deemed necessary. The legislation must not be so vague, the language so loose, as to leave to those who have to apply it too wide a discretion for sweeping within its condemnation what is permissible expression as \n\n[360 \nU.S. 684, 695]\n\u00a0\n well as what society may permissibly prohibit. Always remembering that the widest scope of freedom is to be given to the adventurous and imaginative exercise of the human spirit, we have struck down legislation phrased in language intrinsically vague, unless it be responsive to the common understanding of men even though not susceptible of explicit definition. The ultimate reason for invalidating such laws is that they lead to timidity and inertia and thereby discourage the boldness of expression indispensable for a progressive society.\n\nThe New York legislation of 1954 was the product of careful lawyers who sought to meet decisions of this Court which had left no doubt that a motion-picture licensing law is not inherently outside the scope of the regulatory powers of a State under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court does not strike the law down because of vagueness, as we struck down prior New York legislation. Nor does it reverse the judgment of the New York Court of Appeals, as I would, because in applying the New York law to \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\" it applied it to a picture to which it cannot be applied without invading the area of constitutionally free expression. The difficulty which the Court finds seems to derive from some expressions culled here and there from the opinion of the Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals. This leads the Court to give the phrase \"acts of sexual immorality . . as desirable, acceptable or proper patterns of behavior\" an innocent content, meaning, in effect, an allowable subject matter for discussion. But, surely, to attribute that result to the decision of the Court of Appeals, on the basis of a few detached phrases of Chief Judge Conway, is to break a faggot into pieces, is to forget that the meaning of language is to be felt and its phrases not to be treated disjointedly. \"Sexual immorality\" is not a new phrase in this branch of law and its implications dominate the \n\n[360 \nU.S. 684, 696]\n\u00a0\n context. I hardly conceive it possible that the Court would strike down as unconstitutional the federal statute against mailing lewd, obscene and lascivious matter, which has been the law of the land for nearly a hundred years, see the Act of March 3, 1865, 13 Stat. 507, and March 3, 1873, 17 Stat. 599, whatever specific instances may be found not within its allowable prohibition. In sustaining this legislation this Court gave the words \"lewd, absence and lascivious\" concreteness by saying that they concern \"sexual immorality.\" And only very recently the Court sustained the constitutionality of the statute. Roth v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 476\n.\n\nUnless I misread the opinion of the Court, it strikes down the New York legislation in order to escape the task of deciding whether a particular picture is entitled to the protection of expression under the Fourteenth Amendment. Such an exercise of the judicial function, however onerous or ungrateful, inheres in the very nature of the judicial enforcement of the Due Process Clause. We cannot escape such instance-by-instance, case-by-case application of that clause in all the varieties of situations that come before this Court. It would be comfortable if, by a comprehensive formula, we could decide when a confession is coerced so as to vitiate a state conviction. There is no such talismanic formula. Every Term we have to examine the particular circumstances of a particular case in order to apply generalities which no one disputes. It would be equally comfortable if a general formula could determine the unfairness of a state trial for want of counsel. But, except in capital cases, we have to thread our way, Term after Term, through the particular circumstances of a particular case in relation to a particular defendant in order to ascertain whether due process was denied in the unique situation before us. We are constantly called upon to consider the alleged misconduct of a prosecutor as vitiating the fairness of a particular \n\n[360 \nU.S. 684, 697]\n\u00a0\n trial or the inflamed state of public opinion in a particular case as undermining the constitutional right to due process. Again, in the series of cases coming here from the state courts, in which due process was invoked to enforce separation of church and state, decision certainly turned on the particularities of the specific situations before the Court. It is needless to multiply instances. It is the nature of the concept of due process, and, I venture to believe, its high serviceability in our constitutional system, that the judicial enforcement of the Due Process Clause is the very antithesis of a Procrustean rule. This was recognized in the first full-dress discussion of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, when the Court defined the nature of the problem as a \"gradual process of judicial inclusion and exclusion, as the cases presented for decision shall require, with the reasons on which such decision may be founded.\" Davidson v. New Orleans, \n96 \nU.S. 97, 104\n. The task is onerous and exacting, demanding as it does the utmost discipline in objectivity, the severest control of personal predilections. But it cannot be escaped, not even by disavowing that such is the nature of our task.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"In the course of our enquiries, we have been impressed with the existence of a considerable and lucrative trade in pornography . . . .\" Report of the Select Committee on Obscene Publications to the House of Commons, March 20, 1958, p. IV.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] \"The objection has also been made that the principle as to immunity from previous restraint is stated too broadly, if every such restraint is deemed to be prohibited. That is undoubtedly true; the protection even as to previous restraint is not absolutely unlimited. But the limitation has been recognized only in exceptional cases . . . .\" \n283 \nU.S., at 715\n-716.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK joins, concurring.\n\nWhile I join in the opinion of the Court, I adhere to the views I expressed in Superior Films v. Department of Education, \n346 \nU.S. 587, 588\n-589, that censorship of movies is unconstitutional, since it is a form of \"previous restraint\" that is as much at war with the First Amendment, made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth, as the censorship struck down in Near v. Minnesota, \n283 \nU.S. 697\n. If a particular movie violates a valid law, the exhibitor can be prosecuted in the usual way. I can find in the First Amendment no room for any censor \n\n[360 \nU.S. 684, 698]\n\u00a0\n whether he is scanning an editorial, reading a news broadcast, editing a novel or a play, or previewing a movie.\n\nReference is made to British law and British practice. But they have little relevance to our problem, since we live under a written Constitution. What is entrusted to the keeping of the legislature in England is protected from legislative interference or regulation here. As we stated in Bridges v. California, \n314 \nU.S. 252, 265\n, \"No purpose in ratifying the Bill of Rights was clearer than that of securing for the people of the United States much greater freedom of religion, expression, assembly, and petition than the people of Great Britain had ever enjoyed.\" If we had a provision in our Constitution for \"reasonable\" regulation of the press such as India has included in hers,\n1\n there would be room for argument that censorship in the interests of morality would be permissible. Judges sometimes try to read the word \"reasonable\" into the First Amendment or make the rights it grants subject to reasonable regulation (see Beauharnais v. Illinois, \n343 \nU.S. 250, 262\n; Dennis v. United States, \n341 \nU.S. 494, 523\n-525), or apply to the States a watered-down version of the First Amendment. See Roth v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 476, 505\n-506. But its language, in terms that are absolute, is utterly at war with censorship. Different questions may arise as to censorship of some news when the Nation is actually at war. But any possible exceptions are extremely limited. That is why the tradition represented by Near v. Minnesota, supra, represents our constitutional ideal. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 684, 699]\n\u00a0\n\n\nHappily government censorship has put down few roots in this country. The American tradition is represented by Near v. Minnesota, supra. See Lockhart and McClure, Literature, The Law of Obscenity, and the Constitution, 38 Minn. L. Rev. 295, 324-325; Alpert, Judicial Censorship of Obscene Literature, 52 Harv. L. Rev. 40, 53 et seq. We have in the United States no counterpart of the Lord Chamberlain who is censor over England's stage. As late as 1941 only six States had systems of censorship for movies. Chafee, Free Speech in the United States (1941), p. 540. That number has now been reduced to four\n2\n - Kansas, Maryland, New York, and Virginia - plus a few cities. Even in these areas, censorship of movies shown on television gives way by reason of the Federal Communications Act. See Allen B. Dumont Laboratories v. Carroll, 184 F.2d 153. And from what information is available, movie censors do not seem to be very active.\n3\n Deletion of the residual part of censorship that remains would constitute the elimination of an institution that intrudes on First Amendment rights.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 19 (2) of the Indian Constitution permits \"reasonable restrictions\" on the exercise of the right of freedom of speech and expression in the interests, inter alia, of \"decency or morality . . . defamation or incitement to an offence.\" This limitation is strictly construed; any restriction amounting to an \"imposition\" which will \"operate harshly\" on speech or the press will be held invalid. See Seshadri v. District Magistrate, Tangore, 41 A. I. R. (Sup. Ct.) 747, 749.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See Note, 71 Harv. L. Rev. 326, 328, n. 14.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Id., p. 332.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK, concurring in the result.\n\nI can take the words of the majority of the New York Court of Appeals only in their clear, unsophisticated and common meaning. They say that 122 and 122-a of New York's Education Law \"require the denial of a license to motion pictures which are immoral in that they portray `acts of sexual immorality . . . as desirable, acceptable or proper patterns of behavior.'\" That court states the issue in the case in this language:\n\n\"Moving pictures are our only concern and, what is more to the point, only those motion pictures which \n\n[360 \nU.S. 684, 700]\n\u00a0\n alluringly present acts of sexual immorality as proper behavior.\" 4 N. Y. 2d 349, 361, 151 N. E. 2d 197, 203, 175 N. Y. S. 2d 39, 48.\n\n\n Moreover, it is significant to note that in its 14-page opinion that court says again and again, in fact 15 times, that the picture \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\" is proscribed because of its \"espousal\" of sexual immorality as \"desirable\" or as \"proper conduct for the people of our State.\"\n*\n\u00a0\n\nThe minority of my brothers here, however, twist this holding into one that New York's Act requires \"obscenity or incitement, not just abstract expressions of opinion.\" But I cannot so obliterate the repeated declarations above-mentioned that were made not only 15 times by the Court of Appeals but which were the basis of the Board of Regents' decision as well. Such a construction would raise many problems, not the least of which would be our failure to accept New York's interpretation of the scope of its own Act. I feel, as does the majority here, bound by their holding.\n\nIn this context, the Act comes within the ban of Joseph Burstyn, Inc., v. Wilson, \n343 \nU.S. 495\n (1952). We held there that \"expression by means of motion pictures \n\n[360 \nU.S. 684, 701]\n\u00a0\n is included within the free speech and free press guaranty of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\" Id., at 502. Referring to Near v. Minnesota, \n283 \nU.S. 697\n (1931), we said that while \"a major purpose of the First Amendment guaranty of a free press was to prevent prior restraints upon publication\" such protection was not unlimited but did place on the State \"a heavy burden to demonstrate that the limitation challenged\" was exceptional. Id., at 503-504. The standard applied there was the word \"sacrilegious\" and we found it set the censor \"adrift upon a boundless sea amid a myriad of conflicting currents of religious views . . . .\" Id., at 504. We struck it down.\n\nHere the standard is the portrayal of \"acts of sexual immorality . . . as desirable, acceptable or proper patterns of behavior.\" Motion picture plays invariably have a hero, a villain, supporting characters, a location, a plot, a diversion from the main theme and usually a moral. As we said in Burstyn: \"They may affect public attitudes and behavior in a variety of ways, ranging from direct espousal of a political or social doctrine to the subtle shaping of thought which characterizes all artistic expression.\" \n343 \nU.S., at 501\n. What may be to one viewer the glorification of an idea as being \"desirable, acceptable or proper\" may to the notions of another be entirely devoid of such a teaching. The only limits on the censor's discretion is his understanding of what is included within the term \"desirable, acceptable or proper.\" This is nothing less than a roving commission in which individual impressions become the yardstick of action, and result in regulation in accordance with the beliefs of the individual censor rather than regulation by law. Even here three of my brothers \"cannot regard this film as depicting anything more than a somewhat unusual, and rather pathetic, `love triangle.'\" At least three - perhaps four - of the members of New York's highest court thought otherwise. I \n\n[360 \nU.S. 684, 702]\n\u00a0\n need only say that the obscurity of the standard presents such a choice of difficulties that even the most experienced find themselves at dagger's point.\n\nIt may be, as Chief Judge Conway said, \"that our public morality, possibly more than ever before, needs every protection government can give.\" 4 N. Y. 2d, at 363, 151 N. E. 2d, at 204-205, 175 N. Y. S. 2d, at 50. And, as my Brother HARLAN points out, \"each time such a statute is struck down, the State is left in more confusion.\" This is true where broad grounds are employed leaving no indication as to what may be necessary to meet the requirements of due process. I see no grounds for confusion, however, were a statute to ban \"pornographic\" films, or those that \"portray acts of sexual immorality, perversion or lewdness.\" If New York's statute had been so construed by its highest court I believe it would have met the requirements of due process. Instead, it placed more emphasis on what the film teaches than on what it depicts. There is where the confusion enters. For this reason, I would reverse on the authority of Burstyn.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] The phrase is not always identical but varies from the words of the statute, \"acts of sexual immorality . . . as desirable, acceptable or proper patterns of behavior,\" to such terms \"as proper conduct for the people of our State\"; \"exaltation of illicit sexual love in derogation of the restraints of marriage\"; as \"a proper pattern of behavior\"; \"the espousal of sexually immoral acts\"; \"which debase fundamental sexual morality by portraying its converse to the people as alluring and desirable\"; \"which alluringly portrays sexually immoral acts as proper behavior\"; \"by presenting . . . [adultery] in a clearly approbatory manner\"; \"which alluringly portrays adultery as proper behavior\"; \"which alluringly portray acts of sexual immorality (here adultery) and recommend them as a proper way of life\"; \"which alluringly portray adultery as proper and desirable\"; and \"which alluringly portray acts of sexual immorality by adultery as proper behavior.\"\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER and MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER join, concurring in the result.\n\nI think the Court has moved too swiftly in striking down a statute which is the product of a deliberate and conscientious effort on the part of New York to meet constitutional objections raised by this Court's decisions respecting predecessor statutes in this field. But although I disagree with the Court that the parts of 122 and 122-a of the New York Education Law, 16 N. Y. Laws Ann. 122 (McKinney 1953), 16 N. Y. Laws Ann. 122-a (McKinney Supp. 1958), here particularly involved are unconstitutional on their face, I believe that in their application to this film constitutional bounds were exceeded. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 684, 703]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nSection 122-a of the State Education Law was passed in 1954 to meet this Court's decision in Commercial Pictures Corp. v. Regents, \n346 \nU.S. 587\n, which overturned the New York Court of Appeals' holding in In re Commercial Pictures Corp. v. Board of Regents, 305 N. Y. 336, 113 N. E. 2d 502, that the film La Ronde could be banned as \"immoral\" and as \"tend[ing] to corrupt morals\" under 122.\n1\n The Court's decision in Commercial Pictures was but a one line per curiam with a citation to Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, \n343 \nU.S. 495\n, which in turn had held for naught not the word \"immoral\" but the term \"sacrilegious\" in the statute.\n\nNew York, nevertheless, set about repairing its statute. This it did by enacting 122-a which in the respects emphasized in the present opinion of Chief Judge Conway as pertinent here defines an \"immoral\" motion picture film as one which portrays \"`acts of sexual immorality . . . as desirable, acceptable or proper patterns of behavior.'\" 4 N. Y. 2d 349, 351, 151 N. E. 2d 197, 175 N. Y. S. 2d 39.\n2\n The Court now holds this part of New York's effort \n\n[360 \nU.S. 684, 704]\n\u00a0\n unconstitutional on its face under the Fourteenth Amendment. I cannot agree.\n\nThe Court does not suggest that these provisions are bad for vagueness.\n3\n Any such suggestion appears \n\n[360 \nU.S. 684, 705]\n\u00a0\n to me untenable in view of the long-standing usage in this Court of the concept \"sexual immorality\" to explain in part the meaning of \"obscenity.\" See, e. g., Swearingen v. United States, \n161 \nU.S. 446, 451\n.\n4\n Instead, the Court finds a constitutional vice in these provisions in that they require, so it is said, neither \"obscenity\" nor incitement to \"sexual immorality,\" but strike of their own force at the mere advocacy of \"an idea - that adultery under certain circumstances may be proper behavior\"; expressions of \"opinion that adultery may sometimes be proper . . . .\" I think this characterization of these provisions misconceives the construction put upon them by the prevailing opinions in the Court of Appeals. Granting that the abstract public discussion or advocacy of adultery, unaccompanied by obscene portrayal or actual incitement to such behavior, may not constitutionally be proscribed by the State, I do not read those opinions to hold that the statute on its face undertakes \n\n[360 \nU.S. 684, 706]\n\u00a0\n any such proscription. Chief Judge Conway's opinion, which was joined by two others of the seven judges of the Court of Appeals, and in the thrust of which one more concurred, to be sure with some doubt, states (4 N. Y. 2d, at 356, 151 N. E. 2d, at 200, 175 N. Y. S. 2d, at 44):\n\n\"It should first be emphasized that the scope of section 122-a is not mere expression of opinion in the form, for example, of a filmed lecture whose subject matter is the espousal of adultery. We reiterate that this case involves the espousal of sexually immoral acts (here adultery) plus actual scenes of a suggestive and obscene nature.\" (Emphasis in original.)\n\n\n The opinion elsewhere, as indeed is also the case with 122 and 122-a themselves when independently read in their entirety, is instinct with the notion that mere abstract expressions of opinion regarding the desirability of sexual immorality, unaccompanied by obscenity\n5\n or incitement, are not proscribed. See 4 N. Y. 2d 349, especially at 351-352, 354, 356-358, 361, 363-364; 151 N. E. 2d 197, at 197, 199, 200-201, 203, 204-205; 175 N. Y. S. 2d 39, at 40, 42, 44-46, 48, 50-51; and Notes 1 and 2, supra. It is the corruption of public morals, occasioned by the inciting effect of a particular portrayal or by what New York has deemed the necessary effect of obscenity, at which the statute is aimed. In the words of Chief Judge Conway, \"There is no difference \n\n[360 \nU.S. 684, 707]\n\u00a0\n in substance between motion pictures which are corruptive of the public morals, and sexually suggestive, because of a predominance of suggestive scenes, and those which achieve precisely the same effect by presenting only several such scenes in a clearly approbatory manner throughout the course of the film. The law is concerned with effect, not merely with but one means of producing it . . . the objection lies in the corrosive effect upon the public sense of sexual morality.\" 4 N. Y. 2d, at 358, 151 N. E. 2d, at 201, 175 N. Y. S. 2d, at 46. (Emphasis in original.)\n\nI do not understand that the Court would question the constitutionality of the particular portions of the statute with which we are here concerned if the Court read, as I do, the majority opinions in the Court of Appeals as construing these provisions to require obscenity or incitement, not just mere abstract expressions of opinion. It is difficult to understand why the Court should strain to read those opinions as it has. Our usual course in constitutional adjudication is precisely the opposite.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nThe application of the statute to this film is quite a different matter. I have heretofore ventured the view that in this field the States have wider constitutional latitude than the Federal Government. See the writer's separate opinion in Roth v. United States and Alberts v. California, \n354 \nU.S. 476, 496\n. With that approach, I have viewed this film.\n\nGiving descriptive expression to what in matters of this kind are in the last analysis bound to be but individual subjective impressions, objectively as one may try to discharge his duty as a judge, is not apt to be repaying. I shall therefore content myself with saying that, according full respect to, and with, I hope, sympathetic consideration for, the views and characterizations expressed by \n\n[360 \nU.S. 684, 708]\n\u00a0\n others, I cannot regard this film as depicting anything more than a somewhat unusual, and rather pathetic, \"love triangle,\" lacking in anything that could properly be termed obscene or corruptive of the public morals by inciting the commission of adultery. I therefore think that in banning this film New York has exceeded constitutional limits.\n\nI conclude with one further observation. It is sometimes said that this Court should shun considering the particularities of individual cases in this difficult field lest the Court become a final \"board of censorship.\" But I cannot understand why it should be thought that the process of constitutional judgment in this realm somehow stands apart from that involved in other fields, particularly those presenting questions of due process. Nor can I see, short of holding that all state \"censorship\" laws are constitutionally impermissible, a course from which the Court is carefully abstaining, how the Court can hope ultimately to spare itself the necessity for individualized adjudication. In the very nature of things the problems in this area are ones of individual cases, see Roth v. United States and Alberts v. California, supra, at 496-498, for a \"censorship\" statute can hardly be contrived that would in effect be self-executing. And, lastly, each time such a statute is struck down, the State is left in more confusion, as witness New York's experience with its statute.\n\nBecause I believe the New York statute was unconstitutionally applied in this instance I concur in the judgment of the Court.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 122 provides: \"The director of the [motion picture] division or, when authorized by the regents, the officers of a local office or bureau shall cause to be promptly examined every motion picture film submitted to them as herein required, and unless such film or a part thereof is obscene, indecent, immoral, inhuman, sacrilegious, or is of such a character that its exhibition would tend to corrupt morals or incite to crime, shall issue a license therefor. If such director or, when so authorized, such officer shall not license any film submitted, he shall furnish to the applicant therefor a written report of the reasons for his refusal and a description of each rejected part of a film not rejected in toto.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 122-a provides:\n\n\"1. For the purpose of section one hundred twenty-two of this chapter, the term `immoral' and the phrase `of such a character that its exhibition would tend to corrupt morals' shall denote a motion \n\n[360 \nU.S. 684, 704]\n\u00a0\n picture film or part thereof, the dominant purpose or effect of which is erotic or pornographic; or which portrays acts of sexual immorality, perversion, or lewdness, or which expressly or impliedly presents such acts as desirable, acceptable or proper patterns of behavior.\n\n\n\"2. For the purpose of section one hundred twenty-two of this chapter, the term `incite to crime' shall denote a motion picture the dominant purpose or effect of which is to suggest that the commission of criminal acts or contempt for law is profitable, desirable, acceptable, or respectable behavior; or which advocates or teaches the use of, or the methods of use of, narcotics or habit-forming drugs.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The bill that became 122-a was introduced at the request of the State Education Department, which noted in a memorandum that \"the issue of censorship, as such, is not involved in this bill. This bill merely attempts to follow out the criticism of the United States Supreme Court by defining the words `immoral' and `incite to crime.'\" N. Y. S. Legis. Ann., 1954, 36. In a memorandum accompanying his approval of the measure, the then Governor of New York, himself a lawyer, wrote:\n\n\"Since 1921, the Education Law of this State has required the licensing of motion pictures and authorized refusal of a license for a motion picture which is `obscene, indecent, immoral' or which would `tend to corrupt morals or incite to crime.'\n\n\n\"Recent Supreme Court decisions have indicated that the term `immoral' may not be sufficiently definite for constitutional purposes. The primary purpose of this bill is to define `immoral' and `tend to corrupt morals' in conformance with the apparent requirements of these cases. It does so by defining them in terms of `sexual immorality.' The words selected for this definition are based on judicial opinions which have given exhaustive and reasoned treatment to the subject.\n\n\n\"The bill does not create any new licensing system, expand the scope of motion picture censorship, or enlarge the area of permissible prior restraint. Its sole purpose is to give to the section more precision to make it conform to the tenor of recent court decisions and proscribe the exploitation of `filth for the sake of filth.' It does so \n\n[360 \nU.S. 684, 705]\n\u00a0\n as accurately as language permits in `words well understood through long use.' [People v. Winters, \n333 \nU.S. 507, 518\n (1948)].\n\n.  .  .  .  .\n\n\n\n\"The language of the Supreme Court of the United States, in a recent opinion of this precise problem, should be noted:\n\n\n\"`To hold that liberty and expression by means of motion pictures is guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, however, is not the end of our problem. It does not follow that the Constitution requires absolute freedom to exhibit every motion picture of every kind at all times and all places.' [Burstyn v. Wilson, \n343 \nU.S. 495\n, at 502].\n\n\n\"So long as the State has the responsibility for interdicting motion pictures which transgress the bounds of decency, we have the responsibility for furnishing guide lines to the agency charged with enforcing the law.\" Id., at 408.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Certainly it cannot be claimed that adultery is not a form of \"sexual immorality\"; indeed adultery is made a crime in New York. N. Y. Penal Law 100-103, 39 N. Y. Laws Ann. 100-103 (McKinney 1944).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Nothing in Judge Dye's dissenting opinion, to which the Court refers in Note 7 of its opinion, can be taken as militating against this view of the prevailing opinions in the Court of Appeals. Judge Dye simply disagreed with the majority of the Court of Appeals as to the adequacy of the 122-a definition of \"immoral\" to overcome prior constitutional objections to that term. See 4 N. Y. 2d, at 371, 151 N. E. 2d, at 209-210, 175 N. Y. S. 2d, at 57; see also the dissenting opinion of Judge Van Voorhis, 4 N. Y. 2d, at 374, 151 N. E. 2d, at 212, 175 N. Y.

Respondents did not deny these allegations but moved for summary judgment and dismissal of the complaint for failure to state a cause of action. They filed affidavits that there were hundreds of other retailers selling the same and competing appliances in the same community and contended that the controversy was a \"purely private quarrel\" between petitioner and the chain of department stores, which did not amount to a \"public wrong\" proscribed by the Sherman Act. Held: Petitioner's allegations clearly showed a group boycott, which is forbidden by the Sherman Act, and respondents' affidavits provided no defense to the charges. Pp. 208-214.\n\n (a) A group boycott is not to be tolerated merely because the victim is only one merchant whose business is so small that his destruction makes little difference to the economy.

Nevertheless, manufacturers and distributors of such well-known brands as General Electric, RCA, Admiral, Zenith, Emerson and others\n2\n have conspired among themselves and with Broadway-Hale either not to sell to Klor's or to sell to it only at discriminatory prices and highly unfavorable terms. Broadway-Hale has used its \"monopolistic\" buying power to bring about this situation. The business of manufacturing, distributing and selling household appliances is in interstate commerce. The concerted refusal to deal with Klor's has seriously handicapped its ability to compete and has already caused it a great loss of profits, goodwill, reputation and prestige.\n\nThe defendants did not dispute these allegations, but sought summary judgment and dismissal of the complaint for failure to state a cause of action. They submitted unchallenged affidavits which showed that there were \n\n[359 \nU.S. 207, 210]\n\u00a0\n hundreds of other household appliance retailers, some within a few blocks of Klor's who sold many competing brands of appliances, including those the defendants refused to sell to Klor's. From the allegations of the complaint, and from the affidavits supporting the motion for summary judgment, the District Court concluded that the controversy was a \"purely private quarrel\" between Klor's and Broadway-Hale, which did not amount to a \"public wrong proscribed by the [Sherman] Act.\" On this ground the complaint was dismissed and summary judgment was entered for the defendants. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the summary judgment. 255 F.2d 214. It stated that \"a violation of the Sherman Act requires conduct of defendants by which the public is or conceivably may be ultimately injured.\" 255 F.2d, at 233. It held that here the required public injury was missing since \"there was no charge or proof that by any act of defendants the price, quantity, or quality offered the public was affected, nor that there was any intent or purpose to effect a change in, or an influence on, prices, quantity, or quality . . . .\" Id., at 230. The holding, if correct, means that unless the opportunities for customers to buy in a competitive market are reduced, a group of powerful businessmen may act in concert to deprive a single merchant, like Klor, of the goods he needs to compete effectively. We granted certiorari to consider this important question in the administration of the Sherman Act. \n358 \nU.S. 809\n.\n\nWe think Klor's allegations clearly show one type of trade restraint and public harm the Sherman Act forbids, and that defendants' affidavits provide no defense to the charges. Section 1 of the Sherman Act makes illegal any contract, combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade, and 2 forbids any person or combination from monopolizing or attempting to monopolize any part of \n\n[359 \nU.S. 207, 211]\n\u00a0\n interstate commerce. In the landmark case of Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 1\n, this Court read 1 to prohibit those classes of contracts or acts which the common law had deemed to be undue restraints of trade and those which new times and economic conditions would make unreasonable. Id., at 59-60. The Court construed 2 as making \"the prohibitions of the act all the more complete and perfect by embracing all attempts to reach the end prohibited by the first section, that is, restraints of trade, by any attempt to monopolize, or monopolization thereof . . . .\" Id., at 61. The effect of both sections, the Court said, was to adopt the common-law proscription of all \"contracts or acts which it was considered had a monopolistic tendency . . .\" and which interfered with the \"natural flow\" of an appreciable amount of interstate commerce. Id., at 57, 61; Eastern States Lumber Assn. v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 600, 609\n. The Court recognized that there were some agreements whose validity depended on the surrounding circumstances. It emphasized, however, that there were classes of restraints which from their \"nature or character\" were unduly restrictive, and hence forbidden by both the common law and the statute. \n221 \nU.S., at 58\n, 65.\n3\n As to these classes of restraints, the Court noted, Congress had determined its own criteria of public harm and it was not for the courts to decide whether in an individual case injury had actually occurred. Id., at 63-68.\n4\n\u00a0\n\n[359 \nU.S. 207, 212]\n\u00a0\n\n\nGroup boycotts, or concerted refusals by traders to deal with other traders, have long been held to be in the forbidden category.\n5\n They have not been saved by allegations that they were reasonable in the specific circumstances, nor by a failure to show that they \"fixed or regulated prices, parcelled out or limited production, or brought about a deterioration in quality.\" Fashion Originators' Guild v. Federal Trade Comm'n, \n312 \nU.S. 457, 466\n, 467-468. Cf. United States v. Trenton Potteries Co., \n273 \nU.S. 392\n. Even when they operated to lower prices or temporarily to stimulate competition they were banned. For, as this Court said in Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Seagram & Sons, \n340 \nU.S. 211, 213\n, \"such agreements, no less than those to fix minimum prices, cripple the freedom of traders and thereby restrain their ability to sell in accordance with their own judgment.\" Cf. United States v. Patten, \n226 \nU.S. 525, 542\n.\n\nPlainly the allegations of this complaint disclose such a boycott. This is not a case of a single trader refusing to deal with another,\n6\n nor even of a manufacturer and a dealer agreeing to an exclusive distributorship. Alleged \n\n[359 \nU.S. 207, 213]\n\u00a0\n in this complaint is a wide combination consisting of manufacturers, distributors and a retailer. This combination takes from Klor's its freedom to buy appliances in an open competitive market and drives it out of business as a dealer in the defendants' products. It deprives the manufacturers and distributors of their freedom to sell to Klor's at the same prices and conditions made available to Broadway-Hale, and in some instances forbids them from selling to it on any terms whatsoever. It interferes with the natural flow of interstate commerce. It clearly has, by its \"nature\" and \"character,\" a \"monopolistic tendency.\" As such it is not to be tolerated merely because the victim is just one merchant whose business is so small that his destruction makes little difference to the economy.\n7\n Monopoly can as surely thrive by the elimination of such small businessmen, one at a time, as it can by driving them out in large groups. In recognition of this fact the Sherman Act has consistently been read to forbid all contracts and combinations \"which `tend to create a monopoly,'\" whether \"the tendency is a creeping \n\n[359 \nU.S. 207, 214]\n\u00a0\n one\" or \"one that proceeds at full gallop.\" International Salt Co. v. United States, \n332 \nU.S. 392, 396\n.\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded to the District Court for trial.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE HARLAN, believing that the allegations of the complaint are sufficient to entitle the petitioner to go to trial, and that the matters set forth in respondents' affidavits are not necessarily sufficient to constitute a defense irrespective of what the petitioner may be able to prove at the trial, concurs in the result.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides: \"Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of \n\n[359 \nU.S. 207, 209]\n\u00a0\n trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal . . . .\" Section 2 of the Act reads, \"Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor . . . .\" Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731, 15 U.S.C. 15, states, \"Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor . . . and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained . . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The appliance manufacturers named in the complaint are: Admiral Corp., Emerson Radio and Phonograph Corp., General Electric Co., Olympic Radio and Television, Inc., Philco Corp., Rheem Manufacturing Co., Radio Corp. of America, Tappan Stove Co., Whirlpool Corp., Zenith Radio Corp.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See also United States v.

While some language in that case can be read as supporting the position that no restraint on trade is prohibited by 1 of the Sherman Act unless it has or is intended to have an effect on market prices, such statements must be considered in the light of the fact that the defendant in that case was a labor union. The Court in Apex recognized that the Act is aimed primarily at combinations having commercial objectives and is applied only to a very limited extent to organizations, like labor unions, which normally have other objectives. See United States v. Hutcheson, \n312 \nU.S. 219\n; Allen Bradley Co. v. Local 3, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, \n325 \nU.S. 797\n.

CABOT CARBON CO.(1959)\nNo. 329\nArgued: March 24, 1959Decided: June 8, 1959\n\n\n\n\n Respondents organized an \"employee committee\" at each of their numerous plants for the stated purposes of meeting regularly with management to consider and discuss problems of mutual interest, including grievances, and of handling grievances at nonunion plants and departments. In practice, such committees also made proposals and requests respecting such matters as seniority, job classification, job bidding, working schedules, holidays, vacations, sick leave, a merit system, wage corrections, and improvement of working conditions and facilities. A \"central committee\" consisting of the chairmen of the several plant committees also met annually at the head office with respondents' Director of Industrial Relations and made proposals and requests with respect to matters covering nearly the whole scope of the employment relationship which are commonly considered and dealt with in collective bargaining. After appropriate administrative proceedings, the National Labor Relations Board found that both the \"employee committees\" and the \"central committee\" were \"labor organizations\" within the meaning of 2 (5) of the National Labor Relations Act and that respondents had dominated, interfered with, and supported them in violation of 8 (a) (2); and it issued an appropriate cease and desist order. Held: The order is sustained. Pp. 204-218.\n\n 1. Such committees are \"labor organizations\" within the meaning of 2 (5) of the Act. Pp. 210-218.\n\n\n (a) Since such committees exist, in part at least, for the purpose of \"dealing with employers concerning grievances . . . or conditions of work,\" they are not excluded from the definition of \"labor organizations\" in 2 (5) simply because they do not \"bargain with\" employers in the usual concept of collective bargaining. Pp. 210-213.\n\n\n (b) Consideration of the declared purposes and actual functions of these committees shows that they existed for the purpose, in part at least, of \"dealing with employers concerning grievances, \n\n[360 \nU.S. 203, 204]\n\u00a0\n labor disputes, wages, rates of pay, hours of work, or conditions of work,\" and that, therefore, they are \"labor organizations\" within the meaning of 2 (5). Pp. 213-215.\n\n\n (c) There is nothing in the 1947 amendment of 9 (a) or its legislative history to indicate that Congress thereby eliminated, or intended to eliminate, such employee committees from the term \"labor organization\" as defined in 2 (5) and used in 8 (a) (2), or that authorizes an employer to engage in \"dealing with\" an employer-dominated \"labor organization\" as the representative of his employees concerning their grievances. Pp. 215-218.\n\n\n 2. Since the Board's order does not forbid employers and employees from discussing matters of mutual interest concerning the employment relationship but merely precludes the employers from dominating, interfering with or supporting the employee committees, it does not abridge freedom of speech in violation of the First Amendment.

JUSTICE WHITTAKER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe question for decision in this case is whether \"Employee Committees\" established and supported by respondents at each of their several plants for the stated purposes of meeting regularly with management to consider and discuss problems of mutual interest, including grievances, and of handling \"grievances at nonunion plants and departments,\" are, in the light of their declared purposes and actual practices, \"labor organizations\" \n\n[360 \nU.S. 203, 205]\n\u00a0\n within the meaning of 2 (5) of the National Labor Relations Act.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nRespondents are affiliated corporations under the same general management and maintain their principal office at Pampa, Texas. They are, and for many years have been, engaged in operating a number of plants, principally in Texas and Louisiana, primarily for the purposes of manufacturing and selling carbon black and oil field equipment. Pursuant to a suggestion of the War Production Board in 1943, respondents decided to establish an Employee Committee at each of their plants. To that end, respondents prepared, in collaboration with employee representatives from their several plants, a set of bylaws, stating the purposes, duties and functions of the proposed Employee Committees, for transmittal to and adoption by the employees in establishing such Committees. The bylaws were adopted by a majority of employees at each plant and by respondents, and, thus, the Employee Committees were established. Those bylaws, and certain related company rules, were later published by respondents in a company manual called \"The Guide,\" and are still in effect.\n\nIn essence, the bylaws state: that the purpose of the Committees is to provide a procedure for considering employees' ideas and problems of mutual interest to employees and management;\n2\n that each plant Committee \n\n[360 \nU.S. 203, 206]\n\u00a0\n shall consist of a stated number of employees (ranging from 2 to 3) whose terms shall be one year, and that retiring members, with the help of plant clerks, will conduct the nomination and election of their successors; that each plant Committee shall meet with the plant management at regular monthly meetings and at all special meetings called by management, shall assist the plant management in solving problems of mutual interest, and that time so spent will be considered time worked; and that \"It shall be the Committee's responsibility to: . . . Handle grievances at nonunion plants and departments according to procedure set up for these plants and departments.\"\n3\n\u00a0\n\nIn November 1954, International Chemical Workers Union, AFL-CIO, filed with the National Labor Relations Board, and later several times amended, an unfair labor practice charge against respondents, alleging, in part, that respondents were unlawfully dominating, interfering \n\n[360 \nU.S. 203, 207]\n\u00a0\n with and supporting labor organizations, called Employee Committees, at their several plants. Thereafter the Board, in April 1956, issued a complaint against respondents under 10 (b) of the Act (29 U.S.C. 160 (b)) alleging, inter alia, that the Employee Committees were labor organizations within the meaning of 2 (5) (see note 1), and that respondents, since May 1954, had dominated, interfered with, and supported the Committees in violation of 8 (a) (2) of the Act.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nAfter a hearing, the trial examiner issued his intermediate report containing detailed findings of fact. The relevant findings, mainly based on undisputed evidence, may be summarized as follows: The Committees' bylaws were prepared and adopted in the manner, and contain the provisions, above stated. During the period here involved (from May 1954 to the date of the hearing before the Board in June 1956), the Employee Committees, in addition to considering and discussing with respondents' plant officials problems of the nature covered by the bylaws, made and discussed proposals and requests respecting many other aspects of the employee relationship, including seniority, job classifications, job bidding, makeup time, overtime records, time cards, a merit system, wage corrections, working schedules, holidays, vacations, sick leave, and improvement of working facilities and conditions. Respondents' plant officials participated in those discussions and in some instances granted the Committees' \n\n[360 \nU.S. 203, 208]\n\u00a0\n requests.\n5\n Although not provided for in the bylaws, a \"Central Committee,\" consisting of the chairmen of the several plant Committees, met annually with respondents' Director of Industrial Relations in Pampa, Texas, where, during the 1955 and 1956 meetings, the Central Committee made proposals and requests with respect to many matters covering nearly the whole scope of the employment relationship.\n6\n The Director of Industrial Relations discussed those proposals and requests, their feasibility and economic consequences from respondents' point of view, and sought to reach some solution. In some instances he expressed approval of requests or promised to see what could be done toward meeting them, in other instances he suggested that the matter be taken up with local management, and in still other instances he rejected the proposals and requests and explained his reasons for doing so. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 203, 209]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe trial examiner also found that the Employee Committees have no membership requirements, collect no dues and have no funds; that plant clerks assist the Committees in conducting their elections and do all of their clerical work; and that respondents pay all of the necessary expenses of the Committees. None of the Committees has ever attempted to negotiate a collective bargaining contract with respondents. From time to time the Board has certified independent labor organizations as the exclusive bargaining agents for certain bargaining units of employees in approximately one-third of respondents' plants, and, as such agents for those bargaining units, the respective certified labor organizations have entered into collective bargaining contracts with respondents which, as they may have been amended, are still in effect. Since the respective dates of those collective bargaining contracts the certified labor organizations and the Employee Committees have coexisted in those plants, but the functions of those Employee Committees have generally been reduced to plant efficiency, production promotion and the handling of grievances for employees who are not included in the bargaining units.\n\nUpon these findings the trial examiner concluded in his intermediate report that the Employee Committees and the Central Committee are labor organizations within the meaning of 2 (5), and that during the period here involved respondents dominated, interfered with, and supported those labor organizations in violation of 8 (a) (2) (see note 4). He therefore recommended that respondents be ordered to cease such conduct, and to withdraw all recognition from, and completely disestablish, the Committees \"as the representative of any of [their] employees for the purpose of dealing with Respondents concerning grievances, labor disputes, wages, rates of pay, hours of employment, or conditions of work.\" The Board adopted the findings, conclusions and recommendations \n\n[360 \nU.S. 203, 210]\n\u00a0\n of the trial examiner and entered its order accordingly 117 N. L. R. B. 1633.\n\nRespondents then petitioned the Court of Appeals to review and vacate the Board's findings and order, and the Board's answer sought enforcement of its order. The Court of Appeals denied enforcement of the Board's order and set it aside. 256 F.2d 281. It found that respondents dominated and supported the Committees but held that they were not \"labor organizations\" within the meaning of 2 (5) (see note 1) because it thought (a) that the term \"dealing with,\" as used in that section, means \"bargaining with,\" and that these Committees \"avoid[ed] the usual concept of collective bargaining,\" and (b) that the provisions and legislative history of the 1947 amendment of 9 (a) of the Act show that Congress, in effect, excluded such employee committees from the definition of \"labor organization\" contained in 2 (5). 256 F.2d, at 285-289. Because of an asserted conflict of that decision with the decisions of other Courts of Appeals, and of the importance of the matter to the proper administration of the National Labor Relations Act, we granted certiorari. \n358 \nU.S. 863\n.\n\nWe turn first to the Court of Appeals' holding that an employee committee which does not \"bargain with\" employers in \"the usual concept of collective bargaining\" does not engage in \"dealing with\" employers, and is therefore not a \"labor organization\" within the meaning of 2 (5). Our study of the matter has convinced us that there is nothing in the plain words of 2 (5), in its legislative history, or in the decisions construing it, that supports that conclusion.\n\nSection 2 (5) includes in its definition of \"labor organization\" any \"employee representation committee or plan . . . which exists for the purpose, in whole or in part, of dealing with employers concerning grievances, \n\n[360 \nU.S. 203, 211]\n\u00a0\n labor disputes, wages, rates of pay, hours of employment, or conditions of work.\"\n7\n (Emphasis added.) Certainly nothing in that section indicates that the broad term \"dealing with\" is to be read as synonymous with the more limited term \"bargaining with.\" See, e. g., Labor Board v. Jas. H. Matthews & Co., 156 F.2d 706, 708, and Indiana Metal Products Corp. v. Labor Board, 202 F.2d 613, 620-621. The legislative history of 2 (5) strongly confirms that Congress did not understand or intend those terms to be synonymous. When the original print of the 1935 Wagner bill (S. 1958) was being considered in the Senate, the then Secretary of Labor proposed an amendment to 2 (5) which, if adopted, would have given that section the meaning now ascribed to it by the Court of Appeals. The proposal was that the term \"bargaining collectively\" be substituted for the term \"dealing.\"\n8\n But the proposal was not adopted.\n9\n It is therefore quite clear that Congress, by adopting the broad term \"dealing\" and rejecting the more limited term \"bargaining collectively,\" did not intend that the broad term \"dealing with\" should be limited to and mean only \"bargaining with\" as held by \n\n[360 \nU.S. 203, 212]\n\u00a0\n the Court of Appeals.\n10\n Construing 2 (5) of the original Wagner Act, the Courts of Appeals uniformly held that employee committees or plans, under whatever name called, that functioned similarly to those here, were \"labor organizations\" as defined in that statute.\n11\n With full knowledge of the terms of 2 (5) of the original Wagner Act,\n12\n and of its legislative history and judicial interpretation, Congress in the Taft-Hartley Act re-enacted the section without change.\n13\n Since that time, as before, the several Courts of Appeals have uniformly held that employee committees or plans, functioning similarly to those here, were \"labor organizations\" within the definition of 2 (5).\n14\n\u00a0\n\nThe Court of Appeals was therefore in error in holding that company-dominated Employee Committees, which exist for the purpose, in part at least, \"of dealing with employers concerning grievances . . . or conditions of \n\n[360 \nU.S. 203, 213]\n\u00a0\n work,\" are not \"labor organizations,\" within the meaning of 2 (5), simply because they do not \"bargain with\" employers in \"the usual concept of collective bargaining.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\nConsideration of the declared purposes and actual functions of these Committees shows that they existed for the purpose, in part at least, \"of dealing with employers concerning grievances, labor disputes, wages, rates of pay, hours of employment, or conditions of work.\" It cannot be, and is not, disputed that, by the terms of the bylaws, which were accepted both by the employees and by respondents, the Employee Committees undertook the \"responsibility to,\" and did, \"[h]andle grievances [with respondents on behalf of employees] at nonunion plants and departments according to grievance procedure set up [by respondents] for these plants and departments\" (see note 3). It is therefore as plain as words can express that these Committees existed, at least in part, for the purpose \"of dealing with employers concerning grievances . . . .\" This alone brings these Committees squarely within the statutory definition of \"labor organizations.\"\n\nMoreover, although none of the Employee Committees attempted to negotiate any formal bargaining contract with respondents, the Employee Committees, at the regular Employee Committee-Management meetings held during the period here involved, made proposals and requests respecting such matters as seniority, job classification, job bidding, working schedules, holidays, vacations, sick leave, a merit system, wage corrections, and improvement of working facilities and conditions. Respondents' plant officials participated in the discussion of these matters and frequently granted the Committees' requests (see note 5). Also, during the 1955 and 1956 meetings of the Central Committee with respondents' Director of Industrial Relations in Pampa, Texas, the \n\n[360 \nU.S. 203, 214]\n\u00a0\n Central Committee made proposals and requests with respect to matters covering nearly the whole scope of the employment relationship and which are commonly considered and dealt with in collective bargaining (see note 6). The Director of Industrial Relations discussed those proposals and requests with the Central Committee, and sought to reach some solution. He granted some of them and rejected others, explaining his reasons for doing so. Respondents say that these activities by the Committees and respondents' officials do not mean that the Committees were \"dealing with\" respondents in respect to those matters, because, they argue, the proposals and requests amounted only to recommendations and that final decision remained with respondents. But this is true of all such \"dealing,\" whether with an independent or a company-dominated \"labor organization.\" The principal distinction lies in the unfettered power of the former to insist upon its requests. Labor Board v. Jas. H. Matthews & Co., 156 F.2d 706, 708.\n15\n Whether those proposals and requests by the Committees, and respondents' consideration of and action upon them, do or do not constitute \"the usual concept of collective bargaining\" (256 F.2d ___, at 285), we think that those activities establish that the Committees were \"dealing with\" respondents, with respect to those subjects, within the meaning of 2 (5).\n\nWe therefore conclude that under the declared purposes and actual practices of these Committees they are labor organizations unless, as the Court of Appeals held and as respondents contend. Congress by the 1947 amendment \n\n[360 \nU.S. 203, 215]\n\u00a0\n of 9 (a), in legal effect, eliminated such committees from the term \"labor organization\" as defined in 2 (5) and used in 8 (a) (2) (see note 4). We now turn to that contention.\n\nIn 1947 the House passed H. R. 3020, known as the \"Hartley Bill,\" which, among other things, proposed a new section, to be designated 8 (d) (3), providing:\n\n \"(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the following shall not constitute or be evidence of an unfair labor practice under any of the provisions of this Act:\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"(3) Forming or maintaining by an employer of a committee of employees and discussing with it matters of mutual interest, including grievances, wages, hours of employment, and other working conditions, if the Board has not certified or the employer has not recognized a representative as their representative under section 9.\"\n16\n\u00a0\n\n\n The Senate amended H. R. 3020 by substituting its own bill, S. 1126, known as the \"Taft Bill.\"\n17\n The Senate bill contained no provision corresponding to the new 8 (d) (3) proposed by the House, but it did propose an amendment to 9 (a) of the original Wagner Act (49 Stat. 453) by adding to the proviso of that section which read:\n\n\"Provided, That any individual employee or a group of employees shall have the right at any time to present grievances to their employer\"\n\n\n the words\n\n\"and to have such grievances adjusted, without the intervention of the bargaining representative, as long \n\n[360 \nU.S. 203, 216]\n\u00a0\n as the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of a collective-bargaining contract or agreement then in effect: Provided further, That the bargaining representative has been given opportunity to be present at such adjustment.\"\n18\n\u00a0\n\n\n Thereupon the Senate requested a conference.\n19\n The conferees later reported a new measure, taken partly from the House bill and partly from the Senate bill and containing some entirely new provisions.\n20\n That bill as finally agreed upon by the conferees did not contain the House's proposed new 8 (d) (3) or any similar language, but it did contain the Senate's proposed amendment to 9 (a).\n\nIn reporting to the House, the House conferees stated with respect to the elimination of its proposed new 8 (d) (3) that:\n\n \"Section 8 (d) (3) . . . in the House bill provided that nothing in the act was to be construed as prohibiting an employer from forming or maintaining a committee of employees and discussing with it matters of mutual interest, if the employees did not have a bargaining representative. This provision is omitted from the conference agreement since the act by its terms permits individual employees and groups of employees to meet with the employer and section 9 (a) of the conference agreement permits employers to answer their grievances.\"\n21\n\u00a0\n\n[360 \nU.S. 203, 217]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The bill so agreed upon by the conferees was passed by both Houses and eventually became the law.\n22\n\u00a0\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that Congress rejected the House proposal of a new section, to be designated 8 (d) (3), which, if adopted, would have permitted an employer to form or maintain a committee of employees and to discuss with it matters of mutual interest, including grievances, wages, hours of employment, and other working conditions, if there was no employee representative, respondents contend that Congress intended to accomplish the same purposes by its amendment to 9 (a), and that, in consequence, an employer, whose employees have no bargaining representative, may now legally form or maintain a committee of employees and discuss with it the matters referred to in the proposed 8 (d) (3) advocated by the House.\n\nThis argument treats the amendment to 9 (a) as though Congress had adopted, rather than rejected as it did, the proposed 8 (d) (3) advocated by the House. And it overlooks the facts that the House Conference Report itself declared that \"The conference agreement does not make any change\" in the definition of \"labor organization,\"\n23\n and that, as pointed out by Senator Taft, the conferees specifically rejected all attempts to \"amend . . . the provisions in subsection 8 (2) [of the original Wagner Act] relating to company-dominated unions\" and had left its prohibitions \"unchanged.\"\n24\n The amendment to 9 (a) does not say that an employer may form or maintain an employee committee for the purpose of \"dealing with\" the employer, on behalf of employees, concerning grievances. On the contrary the amendment to 9 (a) simply provides, in substance, that \n\n[360 \nU.S. 203, 218]\n\u00a0\n any individual employee or group of employees shall have the right personally to present their own grievances to their employer, and to have such grievances adjusted, without the intervention of any bargaining representative, as long as the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of any collective bargaining contract then in effect, provided that the bargaining representative, if there is one, has been given an opportunity to be present. It is thus evident that there is nothing in the amendment of 9 (a) that authorizes an employer to engage in \"dealing with\" an employer-dominated \"labor organization\" as the representative of his employees concerning their grievances.\n\nWe therefore conclude that there is nothing in the amendment of 9 (a), or in its legislative history, to indicate that Congress thereby eliminated or intended to eliminate such employee committees from the term \"labor organization\" as defined in 2 (5) and used in 8 (a) (2).\n\nRespondents argue that to hold these employee committees to be labor organizations would prevent employers and employees from discussing matters of mutual interest concerning the employment relationship, and would thus abridge freedom of speech in violation of the First Amendment of the Constitution. But the Board's order does not impose any such bar; it merely precludes the employers from dominating, interfering with or supporting such employee committees which Congress has defined to be labor organizations.\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 2 (5) of the National Labor Relations Act, 61 Stat. 138, 29 U.S.C. 152 (5) provides:\n\n\"The term `labor organization' means any organization of any kind, or any agency or employee representation committee or plan, in which employees participate and which exists for the purpose, in whole or in part, of dealing with employers concerning grievances, labor disputes, wages, rates of pay, hours of employment, or conditions of work.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Examples of the problems of mutual interest to employees and management to be considered at the Committee-Management meetings \n\n[360 \nU.S. 203, 206]\n\u00a0\n were stated in the bylaws to be, but were not limited to, safety; increased efficiency and production; conservation of supplies, materials, and equipment; encouragement of ingenuity and initiative; and grievances at nonunion plants or departments.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] As published in The Guide the established grievance procedure applicable to nonunion plants and departments provides, in summary, that in handling an employee's grievance it shall be the Committee's duty to consult with the Foreman, the Assistant Plant Superintendent and the Plant Superintendent, and consider all the facts. If, after having done so, the Committee believes that the employee has a just grievance it shall prepare in writing a formal statement of its supporting reasons and present it to the Plant Superintendent, who shall send copies of it, attaching his own report and recommendations, to the District Superintendent, the department head and Industrial Relations Department of the company. Within five days after receipt of such grievance the District Superintendent or the department head, or both, shall meet with the Committee and plant management and discuss the problem and announce their decision. If the Committee still feels that the grievance has not been fairly settled it may appeal to the General Manager who, within five days, shall meet with the Committee and plant management and announce his decision.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Section 8 (a) (2) of the Act, 61 Stat. 140, 29 U.S.C. 158 (a) (2), provides:\n\n\"(a) It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer -\n\n .   .   .  .   .\n\n\n\n\"(2) to dominate or interfere with the formation or administration of any labor organization or contribute financial or other support to it; Provided, That subject to rules and regulations made and published by the Board pursuant to section 6, an employer shall not be prohibited from permitting employees to confer with him during working hours without loss of time or pay. . . .\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Among other things, respondents' plant officials agreed to Employee Committee requests to change from a company to a plant seniority system in several plants where employees desired the change; to provide longer notice periods concerning jobs up for bid; to permit employees to report early and leave early on week ends; to establish an annual basis for allocating overtime; and to install vents in the roofs of warehouses.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The subjects discussed by the Central Committee with respondents' Director of Industrial Relations at those meetings included Committee proposals and requests for: a vacation of 3 weeks for employees with 10 years' service; annual sick leave; a disability benefit plan; amendments in the practice of working on holidays; the establishment and financing by respondents of an employee educational program; the granting of leaves of absence to employees wishing to attend college; the furnishing to certain employees of work clothing; a change in policy to permit shiftmen to make up work days lost; the creation of more job classifications, with resulting higher wages; more opportunities for employees to transfer from one plant or department to another; payment of wages to employees while attending National Guard camps; making the working day of shift-workers the same as that of the gangs with which they work; and a general wage increase.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] \"The term `labor organization' is phrased very broadly in order that the independence of action guaranteed by section 7 . . . and protected by section 8 shall extend to all organizations of employees that deal with employers in regard to `grievances, labor disputes, wages, rates of pay, hours of employment, or conditions of work.'

FANT MILLING CO.(1959)\nNo. 482\nArgued: May 20, 1959Decided: June 15, 1959\n\n\n\n\n A union which had been certified by the National Labor Relations Board as the exclusive collective bargaining representative for a unit of respondent's employees filed a charge with the Board alleging that respondent had violated 8 (a) (5) of the Act by refusing to bargain collectively with the union; but the Regional Director declined to issue a complaint on the ground that the evidence was insufficient. Later respondent unilaterally granted a general wage increase and notified the union that it was withdrawing its recognition and would not bargain further with it. In the light of these additional facts and although no amended charge was filed, the Board issued a complaint, held hearings, found that respondent had refused to bargain collectively, and issued an appropriate order. Held: In finding a refusal to bargain collectively, the Board was not precluded from considering conduct on the part of the employer which was related to that alleged in the charge and grew out of it while the proceeding was pending before the Board. National Licorice Co. v. Labor Board, \n309 \nU.S. 350\n. Pp. 301-309.\n\n 258 F.2d 851, reversed.\n\nDominick L. Manoli argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Jerome D. Fenton, Thomas J. McDermott and Frederick U. Reel.\n\nO. B. Fisher argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe National Labor Relations Act makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer to refuse to bargain in good \n\n[360 \nU.S. 301, 302]\n\u00a0\n faith with the representative of his employees.\n1\n The question presented by this case is the extent to which the Labor Board may, in formulating a complaint and in finding a violation of this section of the Act, take cognizance of events occurring subsequent to the filing of the charge upon which the complaint is based.\n\nPursuant to an election a union was certified in June 1953 as the exclusive bargaining representative for an appropriate unit of the respondent's employees at its plant in Sherman, Texas. During the ensuing months agents of the union and of the respondent met on several occasions for the supposed purpose of working out a collective bargaining contract. By May 20, 1954, several such meetings had taken place, but no agreement had been reached.\n\nOn that date the union filed a charge with the Regional Director of the Board, alleging that the respondent had violated 8 (a) (5) of the Act by refusing to bargain collectively with the union. Two months later the Regional Director advised the union that he was refusing to issue a complaint on the ground that \"it does not appear that there is sufficient evidence of violations to warrant further \n\n[360 \nU.S. 301, 303]\n\u00a0\n proceedings at this time.\" The union requested the General Counsel of the Board to review this refusal.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nIn the meantime and until October 1954 more than a dozen further meetings were held between representatives of the union and of the respondent. No real progress towards reaching an agreement was made. In October, while negotiations were still going on, the respondent unilaterally put into effect a general wage increase without prior notice to the union. A few weeks later the respondent advised the union that it was withdrawing recognition and that it would refuse any further bargaining conferences.\n\nThereafter, in January 1955, the Regional Director informed the union that \"upon reconsideration of the facts and circumstances, and additional evidence furnished us in connection with our investigation in the above matter, we have decided to and are hereby withdrawing our refusal to issue Complaint with respect to the 8 (a) (5) allegation of refusal to bargain . . . . We shall proceed with our investigation in due course.\" Later the Board's General Counsel advised the union as follows: \"With respect to the 8 (a) (5) allegation of refusal to bargain; the Regional Director advised the parties by letter dated January 24, 1955, that he was withdrawing his dismissal of the 8 (a) (5) portion of the charge and was continuing with the investigation thereof. All further inquiries with respect to the 8 (a) (5) allegation should be addressed to the Regional Director.\" Five days afterwards the Regional Director issued a complaint, alleging that \"on or about November 21, 1953, and at all times thereafter, \n\n[360 \nU.S. 301, 304]\n\u00a0\n Respondent did refuse and continues to refuse to bargain collectively . . . .\"; that \"On or about October 7, 1954, Respondent, without notice to the Union, put into effect a general wage increase . . . .\"; and that by those acts \"Respondent did engage in and is hereby engaging in an unfair labor practice within the meaning of Section 8 (a), subsection (5) of the Act.\"\n3\n\u00a0\n\nThe Board, agreeing with its Trial Examiner, held that the respondent had refused to bargain collectively with the union within the meaning of the Act, finding that \"after November 21, 1953, . . . the Respondent was merely going through the motions of collective bargaining without a genuine intention of trying to negotiate an agreement with the Union as required by the provisions of the Act.\" An appropriate order was accordingly issued. 117 N. L. R. B. 1277.\n4\n The Board expressly held that the respondent's unilateral grant of a general wage increase in October of 1954, although occurring subsequent to the original charge and not the subject of an amended charge, was properly included as a subject of the complaint. Moreover, its finding of a refusal to bargain was largely influenced by this specific conduct on the part of the respondent.\n5\n One member of the Board dissented \n\n[360 \nU.S. 301, 305]\n\u00a0\n upon the ground that the October wage increase could not lawfully be made the basis of a finding that the respondent had violated the Act.\n\nThe Court of Appeals denied the Board's petition for enforcement. 258 F.2d 851. Substantially agreeing with the reasoning of the dissenting Board member, the court held that 10 (b) of the Act requires \"that a charge must set up facts showing an unfair labor practice . . ., and the facts must be predicated on actions which have already been taken.\" (Emphasis in original.)\n6\n It further held that \"the complaint must faithfully reflect the \n\n[360 \nU.S. 301, 306]\n\u00a0\n facts constituting the unfair labor practices as presented in the charge.\"\n7\n\u00a0\n\nTo attribute so tightly restricted a function to a Board complaint is, as this Court pointed out in National Licorice Co. v. Labor Board, \n309 \nU.S. 350\n, not consonant with the basic scheme of the Act. One of the issues in that case was substantially identical to the issue presented here - \"whether the jurisdiction of the Board is limited to such unfair labor practices as are set up in the charge presented to the Board so as to preclude its determination that [certain actions on the part of the employer] involved unfair labor practices, since both occurred after the charge was lodged with the Board. . . .\" \n309 \nU.S., at 357\n. The Court's resolution of the issue was unambiguous:\n\n \"It is unnecessary for us to consider now how far the statutory requirement of a charge as a condition precedent to a complaint excludes from the subsequent proceedings matters existing when the charge was filed, but not included in it. Whatever restrictions the requirements of a charge may be thought to place upon subsequent proceedings by the Board, we can find no warrant in the language or purposes \n\n[360 \nU.S. 301, 307]\n\u00a0\n of the Act for saying that it precludes the Board from dealing adequately with unfair labor practices which are related to those alleged in the charge and which grow out of them while the proceeding is pending before the Board. The violations alleged in the complaint and found by the Board were but a prolongation of the attempt to form the company union and to secure the contracts alleged in the charge. All are of the same class of violations as those set up in the charge and were continuations of them in pursuance of the same objects. The Board's jurisdiction having been invoked to deal with the first steps, it had authority to deal with those which followed as a consequence of those already taken. We think the court below correctly held that `the Board was within its power in treating the whole sequence as one.'\" \n309 \nU.S. 350\n, at 369.\n\n\n In the present case, as in National Licorice, the unilateral wage increase was \"of the same class of violations as those set up in the charge . . . .\" The wage increase was \"related to\" the conduct alleged in the charge and developed as one aspect of that conduct \"while the proceeding [was] pending before the Board.\"\n\nA charge filed with the Labor Board is not to be measured by the standards applicable to a pleading in a private lawsuit. Its purpose is merely to set in motion the machinery of an inquiry. Labor Board v. I. & M. Electric Co., \n318 \nU.S. 9, 18\n. The responsibility of making that inquiry, and of framing the issues in the case is one that Congress has imposed upon the Board, not the charging party. To confine the Board in its inquiry and in framing the complaint to the specific matters alleged in the charge would reduce the statutory machinery to a vehicle for the vindication of private rights. This would be alien to the basic purpose of the Act. The Board was \n\n[360 \nU.S. 301, 308]\n\u00a0\n created not to adjudicate private controversies but to advance the public interest in eliminating obstructions to interstate commerce, as this Court has recognized from the beginning. Labor Board v. Jones & Laughlin, \n301 \nU.S. 1\n.\n\nOnce its jurisdiction is invoked the Board must be left free to make full inquiry under its broad investigatory power\n8\n in order properly to discharge the duty of protecting public rights which Congress has imposed upon it. There can be no justification for confining such an inquiry to the precise particularizations of a charge. For \n\n[360 \nU.S. 301, 309]\n\u00a0\n these reasons we adhere to the views expressed in National Licorice Co. v. Labor Board.\n9\n\u00a0\n\nWhat has been said is not to imply that the Board is, in the words of the Court of Appeals, to be left \"carte blanche to expand the charge as they might please, or to ignore it altogether.\" 258 F.2d., at 856. Here we hold only that the Board is not precluded from \"dealing adequately with unfair labor practices which are related to those alleged in the charge and which grow out of them while the proceeding is pending before the Board.\" National Licorice Co. v. Labor Board, \n309 \nU.S. 350\n, at 369. It follows in the present case that the October wage increase was a proper subject of the Board's complaint and was properly considered by the Board in reaching its decision.\n10\n\u00a0\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"Sec. 8 (a) It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer - . . . (5) to refuse to bargain collectively with the representatives of his employees, subject to the provisions of section 9 (a). . . . (d) For the purposes of this section, to bargain collectively is the performance of the mutual obligation of the employer and the representative of the employees to meet at reasonable times and confer in good faith with respect to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment, or the negotiation of an agreement, or any question arising thereunder, and the execution of a written contract incorporating any agreement reached if requested by either party, but such obligation does not compel either party to agree to a proposal or require the making of a concession . . . .\" 29 U.S.C. 158 (a).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The respondent continues here to press the claim that this request was not timely under 102.19 of the Board's Rules and Regulations, although the uncontroverted evidence shows that the request was filed within an extension of time that had been granted.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The chronology of these events refutes the respondent's claim that the Regional Director acted while the matter was under review by the General Counsel. The General Counsel had exercised his reviewing authority prior to the time the complaint issued.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The Board ordered the respondent to cease and desist from refusing to bargain; to refrain from interfering with the union's efforts to bargain; upon request, to bargain collectively with the union; and to post appropriate notices.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The language of the Board's decision makes clear how strongly it relied upon the October 1954 wage increase in reaching its conclusion, e. g.: \"We have no difficulty in determining the Respondent's bad faith throughout these protracted negotiations, particularly in view of the Respondent's unilateral effectuation of a general wage \n\n[360 \nU.S. 301, 305]\n\u00a0\n increase early in October 1954, while the negotiations were still in progress but without consultation with or even notice to the Union. . . .\n\n.  .  .  .  .\n\n\"We find, rather, that the giving of this general increase while negotiations were still continuing, and in complete disregard of the Union's representative status, provides the final insight into the Respondent's conduct of negotiations with the Union.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Section 10 (b) of the Act provides: \"Whenever it is charged that any person has engaged in or is engaging in any such unfair labor practice, the Board, or any agent or agency designated by the Board for such purposes, shall have power to issue and cause to be served upon such person a complaint stating the charges in that respect, and containing a notice of hearing before the Board or a member thereof, or before a designated agent or agency, at a place therein fixed, not less than five days after the serving of said complaint: Provided, That no complaint shall issue based upon any unfair labor practice occurring more than six months prior to the filing of the charge with the Board and the service of a copy thereof upon the person against whom such charge is made, unless the person aggrieved thereby was prevented from filing such charge by reason of service in the armed forces, in which event the six-month period shall be computed from the day of his discharge. Any such complaint may be amended by the member, agent, or agency conducting the hearing or the Board in its discretion at any time prior to the issuance of an order based thereon.\" 29 U.S.C. 160 (b).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Judge Cameron wrote the prevailing opinion for the court. Chief Judge Hutcheson wrote a separate concurring opinion in which he agreed with Judge Cameron's view: \"In short, what has happened here is that by the device of injecting into the case entirely new matter completely unrelated to the charge, the regional director, in violation of the provisions of the Act, that no complaint can be filed except one based upon a charge, has filed a complaint, and the Board has heard and condemned the respondent in respect of matters which, because of the lack of a charge, were not before it.\" Judge Rives dissented, expressing the view that \"the . . . construction . . . by the majority seems to me excessively technical and restrictive, and, if sustained, I believe that it will seriously cripple the Board in any effective enforcement of the Act.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Section 11 of the Act provides: \"Investigatory powers of Board. For the purpose of all hearings and investigations, which, in the opinion of the Board, are necessary and proper for the exercise of the powers vested in it by section 9 and section 10 - (1) Documentary evidence; summoning witnesses and taking testimony.\n\n\"The Board, or its duly authorized agents or agencies, shall at all reasonable times have access to, for the purpose of examination, and the right to copy any evidence of any person being investigated or proceeded against that relates to any matter under investigation or in question. The Board, or any member thereof, shall upon application of any party to such proceedings, forthwith issue to such party subpenas requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of any evidence in such proceeding or investigation requested in such application. Within five days after the service of a subpena on any person requiring the production of any evidence in his possession or under his control, such person may petition the Board to revoke, and the Board shall revoke, such subpena if in its opinion the evidence whose production is required does not relate to any matter under investigation, or any matter in question in such proceedings, or if in its opinion such subpena does not describe with sufficient particularity the evidence whose production is required. Any member of the Board, or any agent or agency designated by the Board for such purposes, may administer oaths and affirmations, examine witnesses, and receive evidence. Such attendance of witnesses and the production of such evidence may be required from any place in the United States or any Territory or possession thereof, at any designated place of hearing.\" 29 U.S.C. 161.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] The 1947 amendments to the National Labor Relations Act made no change with respect to the respective functions of a charge and a complaint. The only change in 10 (b) was the addition of the provisions that \"No complaint shall issue based upon any unfair labor practice occurring more than six months prior to the filing of the charge, etc.\" See note 6, supra. This limitation extinguishes liability for unfair labor practices committed more than six months prior to the filing of the charge. It does not relate to conduct subsequent to the filing of the charge.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] The Board urges that we instruct the Court of Appeals to enforce the Board's order. We decline to do so. Cf. Labor Board v. Pittsburgh S. S. Co., \n340 \nU.S. 498\n. However, we think it appropriate to state that if the factual summary contained in Judge Rives' dissenting opinion finds support in the record as a whole, the Board's order should be enforced \"even though the court would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it de novo.\" Universal Camera Corp. v.

Seawell, Attorney General of North Carolina, and Ralph Moody, Assistant Attorney General, filed a brief for the State of North Carolina, as amicus curiae, urging affirmance.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis controversy started in a Federal District Court. Appellant, a Negro citizen of North Carolina, sued to have the literacy test for voters prescribed by that State declared unconstitutional and void. A three-judge court was convened. That court noted that the literacy test was part of a provision of the North Carolina Constitution that also included a grandfather clause. It said that \n\n[360 \nU.S. 45, 46]\n\u00a0\n the grandfather clause plainly would be unconstitutional under Guinn v. United States, \n238 \nU.S. 347\n. It noted, however, that the North Carolina statute which enforced the registration requirements contained in the State Constitution had been superseded by a 1957 Act and that the 1957 Act does not contain the grandfather clause or any reference to it. But being uncertain as to the significance of the 1957 Act and deeming it wise to have all administrative remedies under that Act exhausted before the federal court acted, it stayed its action, retaining jurisdiction for a reasonable time to enable appellant to exhaust her administrative remedies and obtain from the state courts an interpretation of the statute in light of the State Constitution. 152 F. Supp. 295.\n\nThereupon the instant case was commenced. It started as an administrative proceeding. Appellant applied for registration as a voter. Her registration was denied by the registrar because she refused to submit to a literacy test as required by the North Carolina statute.\n1\n She appealed to the County Board of Elections. On the de novo hearing before that Board appellant again refused to take the literacy test and she was again denied registration for that reason. She appealed to the Superior Court which sustained the Board against the claim that the requirement of the literacy test violated the Fourteenth, Fifteenth, and Seventeenth Amendments of the Federal Constitution. Preserving her federal question, she appealed to the North Carolina Supreme Court which affirmed the lower court. 248 N.C. 102, 102 S. E. 2d 853. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 45, 47]\n\u00a0\n The case came here by appeal, 28 U.S.C. 1257 (2), and we noted probable jurisdiction. \n358 \nU.S. 916\n.\n\nThe literacy test is a part of 4 of Art. VI of the North Carolina Constitution. That test is contained in the first sentence of 4. The second sentence contains a so-called grandfather clause. The entire 4 reads as follows:\n\n \"Every person presenting himself for registration shall be able to read and write any section of the Constitution in the English language. But no male person who was, on January 1, 1867, or at any time prior thereto, entitled to vote under the laws of any state in the United States wherein he then resided, and no lineal descendant of any such person, shall be denied the right to register and vote at any election in this State by reason of his failure to possess the educational qualifications herein prescribed: Provided, he shall have registered in accordance with the terms of this section prior to December 1, 1908. The General Assembly shall provide for the registration of all persons entitled to vote without the educational qualifications herein prescribed, and shall, on or before November 1, 1908, provide for the making of a permanent record of such registration, and all persons so registered shall forever thereafter have the right to vote in all elections by the people in this State, unless disqualified under section 2 of this article.\"\n\n\n Originally Art. VI contained in 5 the following provision:\n\n  \"That this amendment to the Constitution is presented and adopted as one indivisible plan for the regulation of the suffrage, with the intent and purpose to so connect the different parts, and to make them so dependent upon each other, that the whole shall stand or fall together.\" \n\n[360 \nU.S. 45, 48]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n But the North Carolina Supreme Court in the instant case held that a 1945 amendment to Article VI freed it of the indivisibility clause. That amendment rephrased 1 of Art. VI to read as follows:\n\n \"Every person born in the United States, and every person who has been naturalized, twenty-one years of age, and possessing the qualifications set out in this article, shall be entitled to vote . . . .\"\n\n\n That court said that \"one of those qualifications\" was the literacy test contained in 4 of Art. VI; and that the 1945 amendment \"had the effect of incorporating and adopting anew the provisions as to the qualifications required of a voter as set out in Article VI, freed of the indivisibility clause of the 1902 amendment. And the way was made clear for the General Assembly to act.\" 248 N.C., at 112, 102 S. E. 2d 860, 861.\n\nIn 1957 the Legislature rewrote General Statutes 163-28 as we have noted.\n2\n Prior to that 1957 amendment 163-28 perpetuated the grandfather clause contained in 4 of Art. VI of the Constitution and 163-32 established a procedure for registration to effectuate it.\n3\n But \n\n[360 \nU.S. 45, 49]\n\u00a0\n the 1957 amendment contained a provision that \"All laws and clauses of laws in conflict with this Act are hereby repealed.\"\n4\n The federal three-judge court ruled that this 1957 amendment eliminated the grandfather clause from the statute. 152 F. Supp., at 296.\n\nThe Attorney General of North Carolina, in an amicus brief, agrees that the grandfather clause contained in Art. VI is in conflict with the Fifteenth Amendment. Appellee maintains that the North Carolina Supreme Court ruled that the invalidity of that part of Art. VI does not impair the remainder of Art. VI since the 1945 amendment to Art. VI freed it of its indivisibility clause. Under that view Art. VI would impose the same literacy test as that imposed by the 1957 statute and neither would be linked with the grandfather clause which, though present in print, is separable from the rest and void. We so read the opinion of the North Carolina Supreme Court.\n\nAppellant argues that that is not the end of the problem presented by the grandfather clause. There is a provision in the General Statutes for permanent registration in some counties.\n5\n Appellant points out that \n\n[360 \nU.S. 45, 50]\n\u00a0\n although the cut-off date in the grandfather clause was December 1, 1908, those who registered before then might still be voting. If they were allowed to vote without taking a literacy test and if appellant were denied the right to vote unless she passed it, members of the white race would receive preferential privileges of the ballot contrary to the command of the Fifteenth Amendment. That would be analogous to the problem posed in the classic case of Yick Wo v. Hopkins, \n118 \nU.S. 356\n, where an ordinance unimpeachable on its face was applied in such a way as to violate the guarantee of equal protection contained in the Fourteenth Amendment. But this issue of discrimination in the actual operation of the ballot laws of North Carolina has not been framed in the issues presented for the state court litigation. Cf. Williams v. Mississippi, \n170 \nU.S. 213, 225\n. So we do not reach it. But we mention it in passing so that it may be clear that nothing we say or do here will prejudice appellant in tendering that issue in the federal proceedings which await the termination of this state court litigation.\n\nWe come then to the question whether a State may consistently with the Fourteenth and Seventeenth Amendments apply a literacy test to all voters irrespective of race or color. The Court in Guinn v. United States, supra, at 366, disposed of the question in a few words, \"No time need be spent on the question of the validity of the literacy test considered alone since as we have seen its establishment was but the exercise by the State of a lawful power vested in it not subject to our supervision, and indeed, its validity is admitted.\"\n\nThe States have long been held to have broad powers to determine the conditions under which the right of suffrage may be exercised, Pope v. Williams, \n193 \nU.S. 621, 633\n; Mason v. Missouri, \n179 \nU.S. 328, 335\n, absent of course the discrimination which the Constitution condemns. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 45, 51]\n\u00a0\n Article I, 2 of the Constitution in its provision for the election of members of the House of Representatives and the Seventeenth Amendment in its provision for the election of Senators provide that officials will be chosen \"by the People.\" Each provision goes on to state that \"the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature.\" So while the right of suffrage is established and guaranteed by the Constitution (Ex parte Yarbrough, \n110 \nU.S. 651, 663\n-665; Smith v. Allwright, \n321 \nU.S. 649, 661\n-662) it is subject to the imposition of state standards which are not discriminatory and which do not contravene any restriction that Congress, acting pursuant to its constitutional powers, has imposed. See United States v. Classic, \n313 \nU.S. 299, 315\n. While 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which provides for apportionment of Representatives among the States according to their respective numbers counting the whole number of persons in each State (except Indians not taxed), speaks of \"the right to vote,\" the right protected \"refers to the right to vote as established by the laws and constitution of the State.\" McPherson v. Blacker, \n146 \nU.S. 1, 39\n.\n\nWe do not suggest that any standards which a State desires to adopt may be required of voters. But there is wide scope for exercise of its jurisdiction. Residence requirements, age, previous criminal record (Davis v. Beason, \n133 \nU.S. 333, 345\n-347) are obvious examples indicating factors which a State may take into consideration in determining the qualifications of voters. The ability to read and write likewise has some relation to standards designed to promote intelligent use of the ballot. Literacy and illiteracy are neutral on race, creed, color, and sex, as reports around the world show.\n6\n Literacy \n\n[360 \nU.S. 45, 52]\n\u00a0\n and intelligence are obviously not synonymous. Illiterate people may be intelligent voters. Yet in our society where newspapers, periodicals, books, and other printed matter canvass and debate campaign issues, a State might conclude that only those who are literate should exercise the franchise. Cf. Franklin v. Harper, 205 Ga. 779, 55 S. E. 2d 221, appeal dismissed \n339 \nU.S. 946\n. It was said last century in Massachusetts that a literacy test was designed to insure an \"independent and intelligent\" exercise of the right of suffrage.\n7\n Stone v. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 45, 53]\n\u00a0\n Smith, 159 Mass. 413-414, 34 N. E. 521. North Carolina agrees. We do not sit in judgment on the wisdom of that policy. We cannot say, however, that it is not an allowable one measured by constitutional standards.\n\nOf course a literacy test, fair on its face, may be employed to perpetuate that discrimination which the Fifteenth Amendment was designed to uproot. No such influence is charged here. On the other hand, a literacy test may be unconstitutional on its face. In Davis v. Schnell, 81 F. Supp. 872, aff'd \n336 \nU.S. 933\n, the test was the citizen's ability to \"understand and explain\" an article of the Federal Constitution. The legislative setting of that provision and the great discretion it vested in the registrar made clear that a literacy requirement was merely a device to make racial discrimination easy. We cannot make the same inference here. The present requirement, applicable to members of all races, is that the prospective voter \"be able to read and write any section of the Constitution of North Carolina in the English \n\n[360 \nU.S. 45, 54]\n\u00a0\n language.\" That seems to us to be one fair way of determining whether a person is literate, not a calculated scheme to lay springes for the citizen. Certainly we cannot condemn it on its face as a device unrelated to the desire of North Carolina to raise the standards for people of all races who cast the ballot.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This Act, passed in 1957, provides in 163-28 as follows:\n\n\"Every person presenting himself for registration shall be able to read and write any section of the Constitution of North Carolina in the English language. It shall be the duty of each registrar to administer the provisions of this section.\"\n\n\n Sections 163-28.1, 163-28.2, and 163-28.3 provide the administrative remedies pursued in this case.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Note 1, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Section 163-32 provided:\n\n\"Every person claiming the benefit of section four of article six of the Constitution of North Carolina, as ratified at the general election on the second day of August, one thousand nine hundred, and who shall be entitled to register upon the permanent record for registration provided for under said section four, shall prior to December first, one thousand nine hundred and eight, apply for registration to the officer charged with the registration of voters as prescribed by law in each regular election to be held in the State for members of the General Assembly, and such persons shall take and subscribe before such officer an oath in the following form, viz.:\n\n\n\"I am a citizen of the United States and of the State of North Carolina; I am - years of age.

Code Ann., Tit. 15, 1701; Me. Rev. Stat., c. 3, 2; Mass. Gen. L. Ann., c. 51, 1. Five require that the elector be able to read and write a section of the Federal or State Constitution. Ala.

Alabama also requires that the voter be of \"good character\" and \"embrace the duties and obligations of citizenship\" under the Federal and State Constitutions. Ala. Code, Tit. 17, 32 (1955 Supp.).\n\nTwo States require that the voter be able to read and write English. N. Y. Election Code 150; Ore. Rev. Stat. 247.131. Wyoming (Wyo. Comp. Stat. Ann. 31-113) and Connecticut (Conn. Gen. Stat. 9-12) require that the voter read a constitutional provision in English, while Virginia (Va. Code 24-68) requires that the voting application be written in the applicant's hand before the registrar and without aid, suggestion or memoranda. Washington (Wash. Rev. Code 29.07.070) has the requirement that the voter be able to read and speak the English language.\n\nGeorgia requires that the voter read intelligibly and write legibly a section of the State or Federal Constitution. If he is physically unable to do so, he may qualify if he can give a reasonable interpretation of a section read to him. An alternative means of qualifying is provided: if one has good character and understands the duties and obligations of citizenship under a republican government, and he \n\n[360 \nU.S. 45, 53]\n\u00a0\n can answer correctly 20 of 30 questions listed in the statute (e. g., How does the Constitution of Georgia provide that a county site may be changed?, what is treason against the State of Georgia?, who are the solicitor general and the judge of the State Judicial Circuit in which you live?) he is eligible to vote. Geo. Code Ann. 34-117, 34-120.\n\nIn Louisiana one qualifies if he can read and write English or his mother tongue, is of good character, and understands the duties and obligations of citizenship under a republican form of government. If he cannot read and write, he can qualify if he can give a reasonable interpretation of a section of the State or Federal Constitution when read to him, and if he is attached to the principles of the Federal and State Constitutions. La. Rev. Stat., Tit. 18, 31.\n\nIn Mississippi the applicant must be able to read and write a section of the State Constitution and give a reasonable interpretation of it.

MADIGAN(1959)\nNo. 42\nArgued: Decided: January 12, 1959\n\n\n\n\n Article 92 of the Articles of War provided that \"no person shall be tried by court-martial for murder or rape committed within the geographical limits of the States of the Union and the District of Columbia in time of peace.\" Petitioner was convicted by a court-martial of the crime of conspiracy to commit murder, the offense having occurred in California on June 10, 1949 - after actual termination of hostilities in 1945, but before termination of the wars with Germany and Japan had been proclaimed by the President or the Congress. Held: The offense was committed \"in time of peace\" within the meaning of Article 92, and the court-martial had no jurisdiction. Pp. 229-236.\n\n (a) The term \"in time of peace\" must be construed in the light of the precise facts of each case and the impact of the particular statute involved, and it may have different meanings in different contexts. Kahn v. Anderson, \n255 \nU.S. 1\n, and other cases, distinguished. Pp. 230-232.\n\n\n (b) In view of the attitude of a free society toward the jurisdiction of military tribunals and our reluctance to give them authority to try people for non-military offenses, any grant to them of power to try people for capital offenses should be construed strictly. Pp. 232-236.\n\n\n (c) It cannot be readily assumed that Congress used the term \"in time of peace\" in Article 92 to deprive soldiers or civilians of the safeguards guaranteed in civil courts in capital cases, including the benefit of jury trials, four years after all hostilities had ceases. P. 236.\n\n\n 248 F.2d 783, reversed.\n\nCarl L. Rhoads and Robert Edward Hannon argued the cause for petitioner. With them on the brief was Charles Upton Shreve.\n\nJohn F.

(1946 ed., Supp. IV) 1564, which, prior to the adoption of the Uniform Code of Military Justice,\n1\n governed trials for murder or rape before courts-martial,\n2\n contained a proviso \"That no person shall be tried by court-martial for murder or rape committed within the geographical limits of the States of the Union and the District of Columbia in time of peace.\"\n\nThe question for decision concerns the meaning of the words \"in time of peace\" in the context of Article 92.\n\nPetitioner, while serving with the United States Army in France, was convicted by a court-martial, dishonorably discharged, and sentenced to prison for 20 years. He was serving that sentence in the custody of the Army at Camp Cooke, California, when he was convicted by a court-martial of the crime of conspiracy to commit murder. This offense occurred on June 10, 1949, at Camp Cooke. The question is whether June 10, 1949, was \"in time of peace\" as the term was used in the 92d Article. The question was raised by a petition for a writ of habeas corpus challenging the jurisdiction of the court-martial. Both the District Court (148 F. Supp. 23) and the Court of \n\n[358 \nU.S. 228, 230]\n\u00a0\n Appeals (248 F.2d 783) ruled against petitioner. We granted certiorari, \n356 \nU.S. 911\n.\n\nThe Germans surrendered on May 8, 1945 (59 Stat. 1857), the Japanese on September 2, 1945 (59 Stat. 1733). The President on December 31, 1946, proclaimed the cessation of hostilities, adding that \"a state of war still exists.\" 61 Stat. 1048. In 1947, Senate Joint Resolution 123 was passed (61 Stat. 449) which terminated, inter alia, several provisions of the Articles of War\n3\n but did not mention Article 92. The war with Germany terminated October 19, 1951, by a Joint Resolution of Congress (65 Stat. 451) and a Presidential Proclamation (66 Stat. c3). And on April 28, 1952, the formal declaration of peace and termination of war with Japan was proclaimed by the President (66 Stat. c31), that being the effective date of the Japanese Peace Treaty. Since June 10, 1949 - the critical date involved here - preceded these latter dates, and since no previous action by the political branches of our Government had specifically lifted Article 92 from the \"state of war\" category, it is argued that we were not then \"in time of peace\" for the purposes of Article 92. That argument gains support from a dictum in Kahn v. Anderson, \n255 \nU.S. 1, 9\n-10, that the term \"in time of peace\" as used in Article 92 \"signifies peace in the complete sense, officially declared.\" Of like tenor are generalized statements that the termination of a \"state of war\" is \"a political act\" of the other branches of Government, not the Judiciary. See Ludecke v. Watkins, \n335 \nU.S. 160, 169\n. We do not think that either of those authorities is dispositive of the present controversy. A more particularized and discriminating analysis must be made. We deal with a term that must be construed in light of the precise facts \n\n[358 \nU.S. 228, 231]\n\u00a0\n of each case and the impact of the particular statute involved. Congress in drafting laws may decide that the Nation may be \"at war\" for one purpose, and \"at peace\" for another. It may use the same words broadly in one context, narrowly in another. The problem of judicial interpretation is to determine whether \"in the sense of this law\" peace had arrived. United States v. Anderson, 9 Wall. 56, 69. Only mischief can result if those terms are given one meaning regardless of the statutory context.\n\nIn the Kahn case, the offense was committed on July 29, 1918, and the trial started November 4, 1918 - both dates being before the Armistice.\n4\n It is, therefore, clear that the offense was not committed \"in time of peace.\" Moreover, a military tribunal whose jurisdiction over a case attaches in a time of actual war does not lose jurisdiction because hostilities cease. Once a military court acquires jurisdiction that jurisdiction continues until the end of the trial and the imposition of the sentence. See Carter v. McClaughry, \n183 \nU.S. 365, 383\n. The broad comments of the Court in the Kahn case on the meaning of the term \"in time of peace\" as used in Article 92 were, therefore, quite unnecessary for the decision.\n\nLudecke v. Watkins, \n335 \nU.S. 160\n, belongs in a special category of cases dealing with the power of the Executive or the Congress to deal with the aftermath of problems which a state of war brings and which a cessation of hostilities does not necessarily dispel. That case concerns the power of the President to remove an alien enemy after hostilities have ended but before the political branches have declared the state of war ended. Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries & Warehouse Co., \n251 \nU.S. 146\n, involves the constitutionality under the war power of a prohibition law \n\n[358 \nU.S. 228, 232]\n\u00a0\n passed in 1918 after the armistice with Germany was signed and to be operative \"until the conclusion of the present war and thereafter until the termination of demobilization, the date of which shall be determined and proclaimed by the President of the United States.\" Woods v. Miller Co., \n333 \nU.S. 138\n, concerns the constitutionality of control of housing rentals promulgated after hostilities were ended and before peace was formally declared. These cases deal with the reach of the war power, as a source of regulatory authority over national affairs, in the aftermath of hostilities. The earlier case of McElrath v. United States, \n102 \nU.S. 426\n, is likewise irrelevant to our problem. It was a suit for back pay by an officer, the outcome of which turned on a statute which allowed dismissal of an officer from the service \"in time of peace\" only by court-martial. The President had made the dismissal; and the Court held that such action, being before August 20, 1866, when the Presidential Proclamation announced the end of the rebellion and the existence of peace, was lawful, since there was extrinsic evidence that Congress did not intend the statute to be effective until the date of the Proclamation.\n\nOur problem is not controlled by those cases. We deal with the term \"in time of peace\" in the setting of a grant of power to military tribunals to try people for capital offenses. Did Congress design a broad or a narrow grant of authority? Is the authority of a court-martial to try a soldier for a civil crime, such as murder or rape, to be generously or strictly construed? Cf. Duncan v. Kahanamoku, \n327 \nU.S. 304\n.\n\nWe do not write on a clean slate. The attitude of a free society toward the jurisdiction of military tribunals - our reluctance to give them authority to try people for nonmilitary offenses - has a long history.\n\nWe reviewed both British and American history, touching on this point, in Reid v. Covert, \n354 \nU.S. 1, 23\n-30. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 228, 233]\n\u00a0\n We pointed out the great alarms sounded when James II authorized the trial of soldiers for nonmilitary crimes and the American protests that mounted when British courts-martial impinged on the domain of civil courts in this country. The views of Blackstone on military jurisdiction became deeply imbedded in our thinking: \"The necessity of order and discipline in an army is the only thing which can give it countenance; and therefore it ought not to be permitted in time of peace, when the king's courts are open for all persons to receive justice according to the laws of the land.\" 1 Blackstone's Commentaries 413. And see Hale, History and Analysis of the Common Law of England (1st ed. 1713), 40-41. We spoke in that tradition in Toth v. Quarles, \n350 \nU.S. 11, 22\n, \"Free countries of the world have tried to restrict military tribunals to the narrowest jurisdiction deemed absolutely essential to maintaining discipline among troops in active service.\"\n\nThe power to try soldiers for the capital crimes of murder and rape was long withheld. Not until 1863 was authority granted. 12 Stat. 736. And then it was restricted to times of \"war, insurrection, or rebellion.\"\n5\n The theory was that the civil courts, being open, were wholly qualified to handle these cases. As Col. William Winthrop wrote in Military Law and Precedents (2d ed. 1920) 667, about this 1863 law:\n\n\"Its main object evidently was to provide for the punishment of these crimes in localities where, in consequence of military occupation, or the prevalence \n\n[358 \nU.S. 228, 234]\n\u00a0\n of martial law, the action of the civil courts is suspended, or their authority can not be exercised with the promptitude and efficiency required by the exigencies of the period and the necessities of military government.\"\n\n\n Civil courts were, indeed, thought to be better qualified than military tribunals to try nonmilitary offenses. They have a more deeply engrained judicial attitude, a more thorough indoctrination in the procedural safeguards necessary for a fair trial. Moreover, important constitutional guarantees come into play once the citizen - whether soldier or civilian - is charged with a capital crime such as murder or rape. The most significant of these is the right to trial by jury, one of the most important safeguards against tyranny which our law has designed.\n6\n We must assume that the Congress, as well as \n\n[358 \nU.S. 228, 235]\n\u00a0\n the courts, was alive to the importance of those constitutional guarantees when it gave Article 92 its particular phrasing. Statutory language is construed to conform as near as may be to traditional guarantees that protect the rights of the citizen. See Ex parte Endo, \n323 \nU.S. 283, 301\n-304; Rowoldt v. Perfetto, \n355 \nU.S. 115\n; Kent v. Dulles, \n357 \nU.S. 116, 129\n. We will attribute to Congress a purpose to guard jealously against the dilution of the liberties of the citizen that would result if the jurisdiction of military tribunals were enlarged at the expense of civil courts. General Enoch H. Crowder, Judge Advocate General, in testifying in favor of the forerunner of the present proviso of Article 92, spoke of the protection it extended the officer and soldier by securing them \"a trial by their peers.\"\n7\n We think the proviso should be read generously to achieve that end.\n\nWe refused in Duncan v. Kahanamoku, \n327 \nU.S. 304\n, to construe \"martial law,\" as used in an Act of Congress, broadly so as to supplant all civilian laws and to substitute military for judicial trials of civilians not charged with violations of the law of war. We imputed to Congress an attitude that was more consonant with our traditions of civil liberties. We approach the analysis of the \n\n[358 \nU.S. 228, 236]\n\u00a0\n term \"in time of peace\" as used in Article 92 in the same manner. Whatever may have been the plan of a later Congress in continuing some controls long after hostilities ceased,\n8\n we cannot readily assume that the earlier Congress used \"in time of peace\" in Article 92 to deny soldiers or civilians the benefit of jury trials for capital offenses four years after all hostilities had ceased. To hold otherwise would be to make substantial rights turn on a fiction. We will not presume that Congress used the words \"in time of peace\" in that sense. The meaning attributed to them is at war with common sense, destructive of civil rights, and unnecessary for realization of the balanced scheme promulgated by the Articles of War. We hold that June 10, 1949, was \"in time of peace\" as those words were used in Article 92. This conclusion makes it unnecessary for us to consider the other questions presented, including the constitutional issues which have been much mooted.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 64 Stat. 108, 10 U.S.C.

R. Rep. No. 2682, 79th Cong., 2d Sess.; H. R. Rep. No. 799, 80th Cong., 1st Sess.; S. Rep. No. 339, 80th Cong., 1st Sess.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] In Givens v. Zerbst, \n255 \nU.S. 11\n, a companion case to the Kahn case, the crime was committed on September 28, 1918, and the court-martial convened on October 30, 1918.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Prior to that time only state courts could try a soldier for murder or rape. Coleman v. Tennessee, \n97 \nU.S. 509, 514\n. And that Act was construed as not giving the military exclusive jurisdiction.\n\n\"With the known hostility of the American people to any interference by the military with the regular administration of justice in the civil courts, no such intention should be ascribed to Congress in the absence of clear and direct language to that effect.\" Id.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] We said in Toth v. Quarles, supra, pp. 17-19:\n\n\". . . there is a great difference between trial by jury and trial by selected members of the military forces. It is true that military personnel because of their training and experience may be especially competent to try soldiers for infractions of military rules. Such training is no doubt particularly important where an offense charged against a soldier is purely military, such as disobedience of an order, leaving post, etc. But whether right or wrong, the premise underlying the constitutional method for determining guilt or innocence in federal courts is that laymen are better than specialists to perform this task. This idea is inherent in the institution of trial by jury.\n\n\n\"Juries fairly chosen from different walks of life bring into the jury box a variety of different experiences, feelings, intuitions and habits. Such juries may reach completely different conclusions than would be reached by specialists in any single field, including specialists in the military field. On many occasions, fully known to the Founders of this country, jurors - plain people - have manfully stood up in defense of liberty against the importunities of judges and despite prevailing hysteria and prejudices. The acquittal of William Penn is an illustrious example. Unfortunately, instances could also be cited where jurors have themselves betrayed the cause of justice by \n\n[358 \nU.S. 228, 235]\n\u00a0\n verdicts based on prejudice or pressures. In such circumstances independent trial judges and independent appellate judges have a most important place under our constitutional plan since they have power to set aside convictions.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] See S. Rep. No. 130, 64th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 88.\n\nGeneral Crowder was opposed to a proposal of the General Staff that capital crimes even when committed in this country be tried by court-martial as well as by civil courts. He said, \"We never have had that law, and I doubt very much whether it is desirable to divorce the Army to that extent from accountability in the civil courts. . . . I think that here in the United States proper the Army should be under the same accountability as civilians for capital crimes.\" Id., at 32.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] The method employed by the Executive and the Congress in terminating wartime controls was different at the end of World War II than it was when World War I terminated. In the earlier war most of the legislation dependent on the existence of a state of war was terminated at one time. See 41 Stat. 1359, H. R. Rep. No. 1111, 66th Cong., 3d Sess.; S. Rep. No. 706, 66th Cong., 3d Sess. At the end of World War II Congress acted more selectively. See H. R. Rep. No. 2682, 79th Cong., 2d Sess. Thus Congress by S. J. Res. 123, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., declared that, for the purpose of construing specified statutes (among them certain Articles of War - but not Article 92), the effective date of the Resolution should be deemed the termination date of the state of war. The fact that Article 92 was not in that list leaves the problem where it was at the time the law was enacted. The failure to repeal, alter, or amend this law plainly has no bearing on its original purpose. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 228, 237]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE CLARK joins, dissenting.\n\nThe Court today holds that on June 10, 1949, the date of this capital offense, this country was \"in time of peace\" within the meaning of Article of War 92, 10 U.S.C. (1946 ed., Supp. IV) 1564, and therefore that the court-martial before which petitioner was tried was without statutory jurisdiction to entertain the proceeding. Believing that the ground upon which the Court nullifies petitioner's conviction has long been settled squarely to the contrary, and that a de novo examination of the question also requires the conclusion that the United States, on June 10, 1949, was not \"in time of peace\" within the meaning of Article 92, I respectfully dissent.\n\nIn Kahn v. Anderson, \n255 \nU.S. 1, 10\n, this Court unanimously held that the term \"in time of peace\" in Article 92 \"signifies peace in the complete sense, officially declared.\" See also Givens v. Zerbst, \n255 \nU.S. 11, 21\n. The Court now dismisses this square holding as \"dictum\" and as \"quite unnecessary for the decision,\" pointing out that the statement of facts in Kahn shows that the capital offense for which petitioner there was tried was committed before the Armistice which resulted in the termination of active hostilities in World War I, and that the court-martial which tried him was also convened before the Armistice. I think that Kahn can hardly be dismissed so lightly. The conclusion there as to the meaning of \"in time of peace\" might have been regarded as unnecessary to decision only had the Court, proceeding on a theory entirely different from that which it actually adopted, relied on the date of the offense or of the beginning of trial as dispositive. But plainly the Court did not proceed on any such basis. Rather, it accepted at least arguendo petitioner's contention that the court-martial which had tried him did not have jurisdiction \n\n[358 \nU.S. 228, 238]\n\u00a0\n to continue \"in time of peace\" even a trial previously begun. It is thus not sound to say that the holding that \"peace\" in Article 92 \"signifies peace in the complete sense, officially declared,\" was unnecessary to the decision in Kahn. Given the ground upon which the Court chose to decide the case it was quite indispensable. The idea that the ground on which a court actually decides a case becomes dictum because the case might have been decided on another ground is novel doctrine to me.\n\nI think that Congress, and the military authorities charged with the implementation and enforcement of the Articles of War, should be able to rely on a construction given one of those Articles by a unanimous decision of this Court. The conclusion in Kahn was not reached lightly without full consideration, as is shown by the fact that nearly two pages of the summary of counsels' argument contained in the report of the case are devoted to a discussion of the question, and another two pages to the Court's expression of the reasoning underlying its decision on the point. In 1948, 27 years after Kahn and a single year before the prosecution here involved. Congress re-enacted Article 92 without change in the relevant language. The Court now holds that between 1921 and 1949 the meaning of the statute underwent an inexplicable change, and that the authority under the statute then confirmed must now be denied. I see no warrant for thus speculating anew as to the motives of Congress in enacting and re-enacting the phrase \"in time of peace\" in Article 92.\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[358 \nU.S. 228, 239]\n\u00a0\n\n\nEntirely apart from Kahn, I think today's decision is demonstrably wrong. This Court has consistently for nearly 100 years recognized, in many contexts, that a cessation of active hostilities does not denote the end of \"war\" or the beginning of \"peace\" as those or similar terms have been used from time to time by Congress in legislation. In McElrath v. United States, \n102 \nU.S. 426\n, there was before the Court a statute of Congress prohibiting summary dismissal by the President of military officers \"in time of peace.\" Although I venture to say that almost as many reasons could be conjured up for construing the term loosely in that context as in that now before us, the Court unanimously held that July 1866 was not \"in time of peace\" although active hostilities between North and South had long since ceased, and that \"peace, in contemplation of law\" did not exist until the Presidential Proclamation of August 20, 1866. See also United States v. Anderson, 9 Wall. 56. In Ludecke v. Watkins, \n335 \nU.S. 160, 168\n-169, this Court in construing a statute recognized that \"`The state of war' may be terminated by treaty or legislation or Presidential proclamation. Whatever the mode, its termination is a political act.\" See also Woods v. Miller Co., \n333 \nU.S. 138\n; Knauff v. Shaughnessy, \n338 \nU.S. 537\n, both expressly recognizing that the state of war between this country and the Axis powers was not terminated by either the Presidential Proclamation of 1946 or the Joint Resolution of July 1947.\n\nThe Court says that \"Congress in drafting laws may decide that the Nation may be `at war' for one purpose, and `at peace' for another.\" Of course it may. But the Court points to no case, and I know of none, which has \n\n[358 \nU.S. 228, 240]\n\u00a0\n construed statutory language similar to that found in Article 92 to mean anything but \"peace in the complete sense, officially declared.\" Under these circumstances, and given McElrath and Kahn, the conclusion seems to me unmistakable that Congress intended that \"peace\" in Article 92 mean what we have always, until today, held it meant in this and other congressional legislation. When Congress has wished to define \"war\" or \"peace\" in particular statutes as meaning something else, it has explicitly done so. See, e. g., War Brides Act, 59 Stat. 659: \"For the purpose of this Act, the Second World War shall be deemed to have commenced on December 7, 1941, and to have ceased upon the termination of hostilities as declared by the President or by a joint resolution of Congress.\"\n\nToday's decision casts a cloud upon the meaning of all federal legislation the impact of which depends upon the existence of \"peace\" or \"war.\" Hitherto legislation of this sort has been construed according to well-defined principles, the Court looking to \"treaty or legislation or Presidential proclamation,\" Ludecke v. Watkins, \n335 \nU.S., at 168\n, to ascertain whether a \"state of war\" exists. The Court, in an effort to make a \"more particularized and discriminating analysis,\" has apparently jettisoned these principles. It is far from clear to me just what has taken their place.\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[358 \nU.S. 228, 241]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Court does not reach petitioner's contention that he could not constitutionally be tried by court-martial because he was not a member of the armed forces at the time this offense was committed. It is sufficient to say that this contention is also squarely foreclosed by Kahn v. Anderson, supra, and that in my opinion nothing in Toth v. Quarles, \n350 \nU.S. 11\n, or in Reid v. Covert, \n354 \nU.S. 1\n, impairs the authority of Kahn on this score.\n\nI would affirm.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Court's heavy reliance in construing the statute here involved on its attribution to Congress of \"a purpose to guard jealously against the dilution of the liberties of the citizen that would result if the jurisdiction of military tribunals were enlarged at the expense of civil courts\" is rendered somewhat suspect, to say the least, by the fact that under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 64 Stat. 108, 10 U.S.C. (Supp. V) 801, enacted May 5, 1950, Congress \n\n[358 \nU.S. 228, 239]\n\u00a0\n has apparently chosen to give courts-martial jurisdiction over capital crimes committed in this country in time of peace as well as in time of war. See 10 U.S.C. (Supp. V) 918, 920.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Court does not say when the \"peace\" which it finds to have existed in June 1949 came into being. It may be noted that the Presidential Proclamation of December 31, 1946, proclaiming the cessation of hostilities, specifically announced that \"a state of war still exists,\" and that Senate Joint Resolution 123, 61 Stat. 449 (effective July 25, 1947), which repealed or rendered inoperative a selected group of wartime measures (not including Article 92), was obviously an expression of a conscious and deliberate decision by Congress that the time had not yet come to end the state of war. It was not until October 19, 1951, that Congress, by joint resolution, declared that \"the state of war declared to exist between the United \n\n[358 \nU.S. 228, 241]\n\u00a0\n States and the Government of Germany by the joint resolution of Congress approved December 11, 1941, is hereby terminated,\" 65 Stat. 451, and not until April 28, 1952, the effective date of the Japanese Peace Treaty, that peace with Japan was proclaimed by the President, 66 Stat. c31. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 228, 242]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","105":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLEV v.

We granted certiorari, \n358 \nU.S. 893\n, because of the importance of the question in the judicial enforcement of the power of eminent domain under diversity jurisdiction.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nIn connection with the first decision in which a closely divided Court considered and upheld jurisdiction over an eminent domain proceeding removed to the federal courts on the basis of diversity of citizenship, Madisonville Traction Co. v. St. Bernard Mining Co., \n196 \nU.S. 239, 257\n, Mr. Justice Holmes made the following observation:\n\n \"The fundamental fact is that eminent domain is a prerogative of the State, which on the one hand may be exercised in any way that the State thinks fit, and on the other may not be exercised except by an authority which the State confers.\"\n\n\n While this was said in the dissenting opinion, the distinction between expropriation proceedings and ordinary diversity cases, though found insufficient to restrict diversity jurisdiction, remains a relevant and important consideration in the appropriate judicial administration of such actions in the federal courts. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 25, 27]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have increasingly recognized the wisdom of staying actions in the federal courts pending determination by a state court of decisive issues of state law. Thus in Railroad Comm'n v. Pullman Co., \n312 \nU.S. 496, 499\n, it was said:\n\n\"Had we or they [the lower court judges] no choice in the matter but to decide what is the law of the state, we should hesitate long before rejecting their forecast of Texas law. But no matter how seasoned the judgment of the district court may be, it cannot escape being a forecast rather than a determination.\"\n\n\n On the other hand, we have held that the mere difficulty of state law does not justify a federal court's relinquishment of jurisdiction in favor of state court action. Meredith v. Winter Haven, \n320 \nU.S. 228, 236\n.\n2\n But \n\n[360 \nU.S. 25, 28]\n\u00a0\n where the issue touched upon the relationship of City to State, Chicago v. Fieldcrest Dairies, Inc., \n316 \nU.S. 168\n, or involved the scope of a previously uninterpreted state statute which, if applicable, was of questionable constitutionality, Leiter Minerals, Inc., v. United States, \n352 \nU.S. 220, 229\n, we have required District Courts, and not merely sanctioned an exercise of their discretionary power, to stay their proceedings pending the submission of the state law question to state determination.\n\nThese prior cases have been cases in equity, but they did not apply a technical rule of equity procedure. They reflect a deeper policy derived from our federalism. We have drawn upon the judicial discretion of the chancellor to decline jurisdiction over a part or all of a case brought before him. See Railroad Comm'n v. Pullman Co., supra. Although an eminent domain proceeding is deemed for certain purposes of legal classification a \"suit at common law,\" Kohl v. United States, \n91 \nU.S. 367, 375\n-376, it is of a special and peculiar nature. Mr. Justice Holmes set forth one differentiating characteristic of eminent domain: it is intimately involved with sovereign prerogative. And when, as here, a city's power to condemn is challenged, a further aspect of sovereignty is introduced. A determination of the nature and extent of delegation of the power of eminent domain concerns the apportionment of governmental powers between City and State. The issues normally turn on legislation with much local variation interpreted in local settings. The considerations that prevailed in conventional equity suits for avoiding the hazards of serious disruption by federal courts of state government or needless friction between state and federal authorities are similarly appropriate in a state eminent domain proceeding brought in, or removed to, a federal court. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 25, 29]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe special nature of eminent domain justifies a district judge, when his familiarity with the problems of local law so counsels him, to ascertain the meaning of a disputed state statute from the only tribunal empowered to speak definitively - the courts of the State under whose statute eminent domain is sought to be exercised - rather than himself make a dubious and tentative forecast. This course does not constitute abnegation of judicial duty. On the contrary, it is a wise and productive discharge of it. There is only postponement of decision for its best fruition. Eventually the District Court will award compensation if the taking is sustained. If for some reason a declaratory judgment is not promptly sought from the state courts and obtained within a reasonable time, the District Court, having retained complete control of the litigation, will doubtless assert it to decide also the question of the meaning of the state statute. The justification for this power, to be exercised within the indicated limits, lies in regard for the respective competence of the state and federal court systems and for the maintenance of harmonious federal-state relations in a matter close to the political interests of a State.\n\nIt would imply an unworthy conception of the federal judiciary to give weight to the suggestion that acknowledgment of this power will tempt some otiose or timid judge to shuffle off responsibility. \"Such apprehension implies a lack of discipline and of disinterestedness on the part of the lower courts, hardly a worthy or wise basis for fashioning rules of procedure.\" Kerotest Mfg. Co. v. C-O-Two Fire Equipment Co., \n342 \nU.S. 180, 185\n. Procedures for effective judicial administration presuppose a federal judiciary composed of judges well-equipped and of sturdy character in whom may safely be vested, as is already, a wide range of judicial discretion, subject to appropriate review on appeal. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 25, 30]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn light of these considerations, the immediate situation quickly falls into place. In providing on his own motion for a stay in this case, an experienced district judge was responding in a sensible way to a quandary about the power of the City of Thibodaux into which he was placed by an opinion of the Attorney General of Louisiana in which it was concluded that in a strikingly similar case a Louisiana city did not have the power here claimed by the City. A Louisiana statute apparently seems to grant such a power. But that statute apparently been interpreted, in respect to a situation like that before the judge, by the Louisiana courts and it would not be the first time that the authoritative tribunal has found in a statute less than meets the outsider's eye. Informed local courts may find meaning not discernible to the outsider. The consequence of allowing this to come to pass would be that this case would be the only case in which the Louisiana statute is construed as we would construe it, whereas the rights of all other litigants would be thereafter governed by a decision of the Supreme Court of Louisiana quite different from ours.\n\nCaught between the language of an old but uninterpreted statute and the pronouncement of the Attorney General of Louisiana, the district judge determined to solve his conscientious perplexity by directing utilization of the legal resources of Louisiana for a prompt ascertainment of meaning through the only tribunal whose interpretation could be controlling - the Supreme Court of Louisiana. The District Court was thus exercising a fair and well-considered judicial discretion in staying proceedings pending the institution of a declaratory judgment action and subsequent decision by the Supreme Court of Louisiana.\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the stay order of the District Court reinstated. We assume that both parties will cooperate in taking prompt \n\n[360 \nU.S. 25, 31]\n\u00a0\n and effective steps to secure a declaratory judgment under the Louisiana Declaratory Judgment Act, La. Rev. Stat., 1950, Tit. 13, 4231-4246, and a review of that judgment by the Supreme Court of Louisiana. By retaining the case the District Court, of course, reserves power to take such steps as may be necessary for the just disposition of the litigation should anything prevent a prompt state court determination.\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In the petition for certiorari there was also raised the question of the appealability of the District Court's order. In our grant of the writ we eliminated this question by limiting the scope of review. \n358 \nU.S. 893\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The issue in Meredith v. Winter Haven, \n320 \nU.S. 228\n, is, of course, decisively different from the issue now before the Court. Here the issue is whether an experienced district judge, especially conversant with Louisiana law, who, when troubled with the construction which Louisiana courts may give to a Louisiana statute, himself initiates the taking of appropriate measures for securing construction of this doubtful and unsettled statute (and not at all in response to any alleged attempt by petitioner to delay a decision by that judge), should be jurisdictionally disabled from seeking the controlling light of the Louisiana Supreme Court. The issue in Winter Haven was not that. It was whether jurisdiction must be surrendered to the state court. At the very outset of his opinion Mr. Chief Justice Stone stated this issue:\n\n\"The question is whether the Circuit Court of Appeals, on appeal from the judgment of the District Court, rightly declined to exercise its jurisdiction on the ground that decision of the case on the merits turned on questions of Florida constitutional and statutory law which the decisions of the Florida courts had left in a state of uncertainty.\" \n320 \nU.S., at 229\n.\n\n\n In Winter Haven the Court of Appeals directed the action to be dismissed. In this case the Court of Appeals denied a conscientious exercise by the federal district judge of his discretionary power merely to stay disposition of a retained case until he could get controlling light from the state court.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART, concurring.\n\nIn a conscientious effort to do justice the District Court deferred immediate adjudication of this controversy pending authoritative clarification of a controlling state statute of highly doubtful meaning. Under the circumstances presented, I think the course pursued was clearly within the District Court's allowable discretion. For that reason I concur in the judgment.\n\nThis case is totally unlike County of Allegheny v. Mashuda Co., decided today, post, p. 185, except for the coincidence that both cases involve eminent domain proceedings. In Mashuda the Court holds that it was error for the District Court to dismiss the complaint. The Court further holds in that case that, since the controlling state law is clear and only factual issues need be resolved, there is no occasion in the interest of justice to refrain from prompt adjudication.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS join, dissenting.\n\nUntil today, the standards for testing this order of the District Court sending the parties to this diversity action to a state court for decision of a state law question might have been said to have been reasonably consistent with the imperative duty of a District Court, imposed by Congress under 28 U.S.C. 1332 and 1441, to render \n\n[360 \nU.S. 25, 32]\n\u00a0\n prompt justice in cases between citizens of different States. To order these suitors out of the federal court and into a state court in the circumstances of this case passes beyond disrespect for the diversity jurisdiction to plain disregard of this imperative duty. The doctrine of abstention, in proper perspective, is an extraordinary and narrow exception to this duty, and abdication of the obligation to decide cases can be justified under this doctrine only in the exceptional circumstances where the order to the parties to repair to the state court would clearly serve one of two important countervailing interests: either the avoidance of a premature and perhaps unnecessary decision of a serious federal constitutional question, or the avoidance of the hazard of unsettling some delicate balance in the area of federal-state relationships.\n\nThese exceptional circumstances provided until now a very narrow corridor through which a District Court could escape from its obligation to decide state law questions when federal jurisdiction was properly invoked. The doctrine of abstention originated in the area of the federal courts' duty to avoid, if possible, decision of a federal constitutional question. This was Railroad Comm'n of Texas v. Pullman Co., \n312 \nU.S. 496\n. There this Court held that the District Court should have stayed its hand while state issues were resolved in a state court when an injunction was sought to restrain the enforcement of the order of a state administrative body on the ground that the order was not authorized by the state law and was violative of the Federal Constitution. The Court reasoned that if the state courts held that the order was not authorized under state law there could be avoided \"the friction of a premature constitutional adjudication.\" \n312 \nU.S., at 500\n. Numerous decisions since then have sanctioned abstention from deciding cases involving a federal constitutional issue where a state court determination of state law might moot the issue or put the case in a \n\n[360 \nU.S. 25, 33]\n\u00a0\n different posture. See, e. g., City of Meridian v. Southern Bell Tel. & Tel. Co., \n358 \nU.S. 639\n; Government Employees Organizing Comm. v. Windsor, \n353 \nU.S. 364\n; Leiter Minerals, Inc., v. United States, \n352 \nU.S. 220\n; Albertson v. Millard, \n345 \nU.S. 242\n; Shipman v. DuPre, \n339 \nU.S. 321\n; Stainback v. Mo Hock Ke Lok Po, \n336 \nU.S. 368\n; American Federation of Labor v. Watson, \n327 \nU.S. 582\n; Alabama State Federation of Labor v. McAdory, \n325 \nU.S. 450\n; Spector Motor Service, Inc., v. McLaughlin, \n323 \nU.S. 101\n; Chicago v. Fieldcrest Dairies, Inc., \n316 \nU.S. 168\n.\n1\n Abstention has also been sanctioned on grounds of comity with the States - to avoid a result in \"needless friction with state policies.\" Railroad Comm'n of Texas v. Pullman Co., \n312 \nU.S. 496, 500\n. Thus this Court has upheld an abstention when the exercise by the federal court of jurisdiction would disrupt a state administrative process, Burford v. Sun Oil Co., \n319 \nU.S. 315\n; Pennsylvania v. Williams, \n294 \nU.S. 176\n, interfere with the collection of state taxes, Toomer v. Witsell, \n334 \nU.S. 385, 392\n; Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v. Huffman, \n319 \nU.S. 293\n, or otherwise create needless friction by unnecessarily enjoining state officials from executing domestic policies, Alabama Public Service Comm'n v. Southern R. Co., \n341 \nU.S. 341\n; Hawks v. Hamill, \n288 \nU.S. 52\n.\n\nBut neither of the two recognized situations justifying abstention is present in the case before us. The suggestion that federal constitutional questions lurk in the background is so patently frivolous that neither the District Court, the Court of Appeals, nor this Court considers it to be worthy of even passing reference. The \n\n[360 \nU.S. 25, 34]\n\u00a0\n Power and Light Company's only contention under the Federal Constitution is that the expropriation of its property would violate the Due Process and Impairment of the Obligation of Contract Clauses, even though just compensation is paid for it, because the property sought to be taken is operated by the company under a franchise granted by the Parish and confirmed by the City. This claim is utterly without substance. Long Island Water Supply Co. v. Brooklyn, \n166 \nU.S. 685\n; West River Bridge Co. v. Dix, 6 How. 507. Certainly the avoidance of such a constitutional issue cannot justify a federal court's failure to exercise its jurisdiction. To hold the contrary would mean that a party could defeat his adversary's right to a federal adjudication simply by alleging a frivolous constitutional issue. Furthermore, no countervailing interest would be served by avoiding decision of such an issue.\n\nThe Court therefore turns the holding on the purported existence of the other situation justifying abstention, stating the bald conclusion that: \"The considerations that prevailed in conventional equity suits for avoiding the hazards of serious disruption by federal courts of state government or needless friction between state and federal authorities are similarly appropriate in a state eminent domain proceeding brought in, or removed to, a federal court.\" But the fact of the matter is that this case does not involve the slightest hazard of friction with a State, the indispensable ingredient for upholding abstention on grounds of comity, and one which has been present in all of the prior cases in which abstention has been approved by this Court on that ground. First of all, unlike all prior cases in which abstention has been sanctioned on grounds of comity, the District Court has not been asked to grant injunctive relief which would prohibit state officials from acting. This case involves an \n\n[360 \nU.S. 25, 35]\n\u00a0\n action at law,\n2\n initiated by the City and removed to the District Court under 28 U.S.C. 1441. Clearly decision of this case, in which the City itself is the party seeking an interpretation of its authority under state law, will not entail the friction in federal-state relations that would result from decision of a suit brought by another party to enjoin the City from acting. Secondly, this case does not involve the potential friction that results when a federal court applies paramount federal law to strike down state action. Aside from the patently frivolous constitutional question raised by the Power Company, the District Court in adjudicating this case would be applying state law precisely as would a state court. Far from disrupting state policy, the District Court would be applying state policy, as embodied in the state statute, to the facts of this case. There is no more possibility of conflict with the State in this situation than there is in the ordinary negligence or contract case in which a District Court applies state law under its diversity jurisdiction. A decision by the District Court in this case would not interfere with Louisiana administrative processes, prohibit the collection of state taxes, or otherwise frustrate the execution of state domestic policies. Quite the reverse, this action is part of the process which the City must follow in order to carry out the State's policy of expropriating private property for public uses. Finally, in this case the State of Louisiana, represented by its constituent organ the City of Thibodaux, urges the District Court to adjudicate the state law issue. How, conceivably, can the Court justify the abdication of responsibility to exercise jurisdiction on the ground of avoiding interference and conflict with the State when the State itself desires the federal court's adjudication? It is obvious that the abstention in this case was for the convenience of the District Court, not for \n\n[360 \nU.S. 25, 36]\n\u00a0\n the State. The Court forgets, in upholding this abstention, that \"The diversity jurisdiction was not conferred for the benefit of the federal courts or to serve their convenience.\" Meredith v. Winter Haven, \n320 \nU.S. 228, 234\n.\n\nThe Court of Appeals, in my view, correctly considered, in reversing the action of the District Court, that there is not shown a semblance of a countervailing interest which meets the standards permitting abstention. The standard utilized by the Court of Appeals in reviewing the District Court's order was not whether the district judge abused his discretion in staying the proceedings; rather it was whether he had any discretion to abstain from deciding this case in which the federal court's jurisdiction was properly invoked. This approach was correct in light of the teaching of all prior cases, which delimit the narrow area in which abstention is permissible and hold that jurisdiction must be exercised in all other situations. It would obviously wreak havoc with federal jurisdiction if the exercise of that jurisdiction was a matter for the ad hoc discretion of the District Court in each particular case.\n\nDespite the complete absence of the necessary showing to justify abstention, the Court supports its holding simply by a reference to a dissenting opinion in which it was said \"that eminent domain is a prerogative of the State.\"\n3\n Thus the Court attempts to carve out a new \n\n[360 \nU.S. 25, 37]\n\u00a0\n area in which, even though an adjudication by the federal court would not require the decision of federal constitutional questions, nor create friction with the State, the federal courts are encouraged to abnegate their responsibilities in diversity cases. In doing so the Court very plainly has not made a responsible use of precedent. First of all, not only does the Court cite no cases where abstention has been approved in the absence of a showing of one of the only two countervailing interests heretofore required to justify abstention, but the Court ignores cases in which this Court has refused to refer state law questions to state courts even though that course required a federal constitutional decision which resulted in affirmative prohibitions against the State from carrying out sovereign activities. Surely eminent domain is no more mystically involved with \"sovereign prerogative\" than a city's power to license motor vehicles, Chicago v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co., \n357 \nU.S. 77\n, a State's power to regulate fishing in its waters, Toomer v. Witsell, \n334 \nU.S. 385\n, its power to regulate intrastate trucking rates, Public Utilities Comm'n of California v. United States, \n355 \nU.S. 534\n, and a host of other governmental activities carried on by the States and their subdivisions which have been brought into question in the Federal District Courts without a prior state court determination of the relevant state law. Furthermore, the decision in Meredith v. Winter Haven, \n320 \nU.S. 228\n, long recognized as a landmark in this field, is squarely contrary to today's holding. For there the petitioners sought in a Federal District Court an injunction prohibiting the City of Winter Haven from redeeming certain bonds without paying deferred interest charges on them. The only issues in the case were whether the City was authorized under the Florida Constitution and statutes to issue the bonds without a referendum, and, if the bonds were not validly issued, what recovery the bondholders were entitled to receive. Federal jurisdiction \n\n[360 \nU.S. 25, 38]\n\u00a0\n was based solely on diversity of citizenship. Although there was present the obvious irritant to state-federal relations of a federal court injunction against City officials, which is not present in this case, this Court in Winter Haven held that it was incumbent on the Federal District Court to perform its duty and adjudicate the case. I am unable to see a distinction, so far as concerns non-interference with the exercise of state sovereignty, between decision as to the City of Winter Haven's authority under Florida's statutes and constitution to issue deferred-interest bonds without a referendum, and decision as to the City of Thibodaux's authority under Louisiana's statutes and constitution to expropriate the Power and Light Company's property. Since the Court suggests no adequate basis of distinction between the two cases, it should frankly announce that Meredith v. Winter Haven is overruled, for no other conclusion is reasonable.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nIn the second place, the Court, in its opinion, omits mention of the host of cases, many in this Court, which \n\n[360 \nU.S. 25, 39]\n\u00a0\n have approved the decision by a federal court of precisely the same kind of state eminent domain question which the District Court was asked by the City of Thibodaux to decide in this case. Years of experience in federal court adjudication of state eminent domain cases have conclusively demonstrated that this practice does not entail the hazard of friction in federal-state relations. See County of Allegheny v. Mashuda Co., post, p. 185. The Court, despite the lesson taught by this experience and despite the fact that it is impossible to show any actual friction that might develop from a federal court adjudication in this case, rests its holding on a conclusive presumption that friction will develop because of \"the special nature of eminent domain.\" This presumption is totally at war with the Court's holding today in County of Allegheny v. Mashuda Co., which orders a District Court to exercise its diversity jurisdiction even though such a course will require decision as to the power of a County under the state law of eminent domain to expropriate certain property. Thus the Court's decision is explicable to me for two other reasons, neither of which is articulated in the Court's opinion, probably because both are wholly untenable.\n\nThe first is that the only real issue of law in the case, the interpretation of Act 111, presents a difficult question of state law. It is true that there are no Louisiana decisions interpreting Act 111, and that there is a confusing opinion of the State's Attorney General on the question. But mere difficulty of construing the state statute is not justification for running away from the task. \"Questions may occur which we would gladly avoid; but we cannot avoid them. All we can do is, to exercise our best judgment, and conscientiously to perform our duty.\" Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 404. Difficult questions of state law to which the federal courts cannot give definitive answers arise every day in federal courts \n\n[360 \nU.S. 25, 40]\n\u00a0\n throughout the land. Chief Justice Stone, in his opinion for the Court in Meredith v. Winter Haven, \n320 \nU.S. 228\n, settled that this difficulty can never justify a failure to exercise jurisdiction. The Chief Justice said:\n\n\"But we are of opinion that the difficulties of ascertaining what the state courts may hereafter determine the state law to be do not in themselves afford a sufficient ground for a federal court to decline to exercise its jurisdiction to decide a case which is properly brought to it for decision.\n\n\n \"The diversity jurisdiction was not conferred for the benefit of the federal courts or to serve their convenience. Its purpose was generally to afford to suitors an opportunity in such cases, at their option, to assert their rights in the federal rather than in the state courts. In the absence of some recognized public policy or defined principle guiding the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred, which would in exceptional cases warrant its non-exercise, it has from the first been deemed to be the duty of the federal courts, if their jurisdiction is properly invoked, to decide questions of state law whenever necessary to the rendition of a judgment. . . . When such exceptional circumstances are not present, denial of that opportunity by the federal courts merely because the answers to the questions of state law are difficult or uncertain or have not yet been given by the highest court of the state, would thwart the purpose of the jurisdictional act.\" \n320 \nU.S., at 234\n-235.\n\n\n The cases are legion, since Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n, in which the federal courts have adjudicated diversity cases by deciding issues of state law, difficult and easy, without relevant state court decisions on the point in issue. And this Court has many times, often over dissents urging abstention, decided doubtful questions of state law when properly before us. Propper v. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 25, 41]\n\u00a0\n Clark, \n337 \nU.S. 472\n; Commissioner v. Estate of Church, \n335 \nU.S. 632\n; Estate of Spiegel v. Commissioner, \n335 \nU.S. 701\n; Williams v. Green Bay & Western R. Co., \n326 \nU.S. 549, 553\n-554; Markham v. Allen, \n326 \nU.S. 490\n; Risty v. Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 378\n; McClellan v. Carland, \n217 \nU.S. 268\n.\n\nThe second possible reason explaining the Court's holding is that it reflects a distaste for the diversity jurisdiction. But distaste for diversity jurisdiction certainly cannot be reason to license district judges to retreat from their responsibility. The roots of that jurisdiction are inextricably intertwined with the roots of our federal system. They stem from Art. III, 2 of the Constitution and the first Judiciary Act, the Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 73, 78.\n5\n I concede the liveliness of the controversy over the utility or desirability of diversity jurisdiction, but it has stubbornly outlasted the many and persistent attacks against it and the attempts in the Congress to curtail or eliminate it.\n6\n Until Congress speaks otherwise, the federal judiciary has no choice but conscientiously to render justice for litigants from different States entitled to have their controversies adjudicated in the federal courts. \"Whether it is a sound theory, whether diversity jurisdiction is necessary or desirable in order to avoid possible unfairness by state courts, state judges and juries, against outsiders, whether the federal courts ought to be relieved of the burden of diversity litigation, - these are matters which are not my concern as a judge. They are the concern of those \n\n[360 \nU.S. 25, 42]\n\u00a0\n whose business it is to legislate, not mine.\" Burford v. Sun Oil Co., \n319 \nU.S. 315, 337\n (dissenting opinion).\n\nNot only has the Court departed from any precedential basis for its action, but the decision encourages inefficiency in administration of the federal courts and leads to unnecessary delay, waste and added expense for the parties. This is particularly the stark truth in the instant case. The City of Thibodaux brought this proceeding in a Louisiana court to expropriate lands of the Power and Light Company for public purposes. The Power and Light Company, a Florida corporation, removed the action to the District Court, as was its privilege under 28 U.S.C. 1441. The crucial issue in the case is whether Louisiana Act 111 of 1900 empowers the City to exercise the State's right of eminent domain.\n7\n Because the District Court rebuffed the City's plea to decide its authority under Act 111, and this Court sustains the District Court, the City must go back to the state court, not in the action originally \n\n[360 \nU.S. 25, 43]\n\u00a0\n brought there by the City, but in a new action to be initiated under Louisiana's declaratory judgment law. The Power and Light Company, which escaped a state court decision by removing the City's action to the District Court, is now wholly content with the sua sponte action of the District Court. This is understandable since the longer decision is put off as to the City's power to expropriate its property, the longer the Power and Light Company will enjoy the possession of it. Resolution of the legal question of the City's authority, already delayed over two years due to no fault of the City, will be delayed, according to the City's estimate in its brief, a minimum of two additional years before a decision may be obtained from the State Supreme Court in the declaratory judgment action. Even if the City obtains a favorable decision, the City must suffer still further delay while the case comes back to the District Court for a decision upon the amount of damages to be paid the Power and Light Company. Thus at best the District Court will finally dispose of this case only after prolonged delay and considerable additional expense for the parties. Moreover, it is possible that the State Supreme Court will, for one reason or another, conclude that it will not render the parties this advisory opinion. All of this delay should have been avoided, and would have been, had the District Court performed what I think was its plain duty, and decided the question of the City's power when that question was ripe for decision a few months after the case was removed to the District Court. I think it is more than coincidence that both in this case and in Mashuda the party supporting abstention is the one presently in possession of the property in question. I cannot escape the conclusion in these cases that delay in the reaching of a decision is more important to those parties than the tribunal which ultimately renders the decision. The Court today upholds a procedure which encourages such delay \n\n[360 \nU.S. 25, 44]\n\u00a0\n and prevents \"that promptness of decision which in all judicial actions is one of the elements of justice.\" Forsyth v. Hammond, \n166 \nU.S. 506, 513\n. One must regret that this Court's departure from the long-settled criteria governing abstention should so richly fertilize the Power and Light Company's strategy of delay which now has succeeded, I dare say, past the fondest expectation of counsel who conceived it. It is especially unfortunate in that departure from these criteria fashions an opening wedge for District Courts to refer hard cases of state law to state courts in even the routine diversity negligence and contract actions.\n\nI would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] But when questions of state law are not cloudy the District Court should decide them, even though such a course necessitates decision of a federal constitutional issue. Chicago v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co., \n357 \nU.S. 77\n; Public Utilities Comm'n of California v. United States, \n355 \nU.S. 534\n; Toomer v. Witsell, \n334 \nU.S. 385\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Expropriation proceedings such as this one are recognized to be suits at law. Kohl v.

The District Court did not rest its actions on this theory, but relied upon Leiter Minerals, Inc., v. United States, \n352 \nU.S. 220\n, as authority for the stay order. That decision, which came down shortly before the District Court's order in this case, modified an order of the same district judge and provided for a reference to the Louisiana courts of a question of Louisiana law because the state court's interpretation of state law might well have mooted a federal constitutional issue or cast it in a different posture. The simple fact that there is no constitutional question of any substance to avoid in this case makes Leiter inapposite.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] It is true that this Court in Meredith v. Winter Haven was reviewing an order dismissing federal jurisdiction, whereas the District Court order in this case retains jurisdiction pending the state court determination. However, it is significant that the Court in Winter Haven, rather than remanding the case with instructions that the District Court retain jurisdiction but abstain from deciding the state law issues, ordered the District Court to adjudicate those issues. It is perfectly clear that Winter Haven did not turn on any difference between an abstention and a dismissal, nor on the fact that it was a Court of Appeals rather than a District Court which initially decided to refrain from adjudicating the state issues. Neither did it turn on this Court's ideas about the competence or experience of the judges below. Meredith v. Winter Haven rested squarely on the Court's conclusion that, no matter how intimately related to a State's sovereignty a case is, the District Court must adjudicate it if jurisdiction is properly invoked and that adjudication would not entail decision of a serious constitutional question or disruption of state policy.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] See, for a discussion of this subject, Friendly, The Historic Basis of Diversity Jurisdiction, 41 Harv.

The case was tried to a jury on a negligence theory and judgment went for petitioner. The Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that the decedent was an employee of respondent and the Pennsylvania Workmen's Compensation Act provided the exclusive remedy. Both courts treated the question whether the decedent was respondent's employee within the meaning of the Pennsylvania statute as a question of law for determination by the judge, instead of the jury. Held: The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for a new trial. Pp. 274-279.\n\n (a) In a Federal District Court, all disputed issues of fact necessary to a determination as to whether the decedent was respondent's employee within the meaning of the Pennsylvania Workmen's Compensation Act were for jury determination, regardless of the practice in the state courts, unless the State's assignment of those factual issues to the judge rather than the jury has been \"announced as an integral part of the special relationship created by the statute.\" Byrd v.

JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis is a diversity case for wrongful death of petitioner's decedent, who was killed when a tractor-trailer leased by respondent crashed off a Pennsylvania highway. The action was tried to a jury on a negligence theory and judgment went for petitioner. 161 F. Supp. 875. The Court of Appeals reversed, finding that under Pennsylvania law the decedent was an employee of respondent and that the Pennsylvania Workmen's Compensation Act, Purdon's Pa. Stat. Ann., 1952, Tit. 77, provided the exclusive remedy. 257 F.2d 445. We granted certiorari, \n358 \nU.S. 927\n, on the question whether, in the light of Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Electric Cooperative, Inc., \n356 \nU.S. 525\n (1958) (decided after this case was argued in the Court of Appeals), the matter of the relationship of the decedent to respondent was a jury question. We have concluded that Byrd does control that issue and that the judgment must therefore be reversed.\n\nRespondent is an interstate motor carrier of freight certificated under the Interstate Commerce Act. It had leased a tractor-trailer, complete with driver, from one Fidler, an independent contractor. Its lease contract, which had been in effect for four years, required Fidler to furnish the driver as well as to keep the leased equipment in repair. In this connection the evidence indicates that Fidler had authorized his driver, where circumstances required, to hire services and purchase necessities on trips of this kind. The vehicle and driver leased by respondent were en route from Syracuse, N. Y., to Midland, Pa., with 36,000 pounds of steel when the mishap leading to \n\n[360 \nU.S. 273, 275]\n\u00a0\n decedent's death occurred. The trip from Syracuse had been so beset with difficulties, such as tire replacements, battery trouble and brake failure, as well as bad weather, that it had already consumed 7 days' time. Under ordinary conditions 20 hours of elapsed time would have been sufficient. During a stop at a tavern near Waterford, Pa., the driver, Schroyer, was talking to the tavern keeper about his truck troubles when decedent and his cousin entered the place. Schroyer offered the cousin $25 to accompany him for the remainder of the trip and, upon refusal, made the same offer to decedent. The latter accepted. While the evidence is weak on the point, the indications are that decedent's job was to aid the driver in the event further trouble with the truck was encountered. Decedent was experienced with cars and had worked for a short time as a mechanic. Schroyer and decedent proceeded in the truck-trailer toward their destination, with the former driving. Some hours later the vehicle was found off the road on the downside of an embankment. Both men were dead.\n\nThis action ensued, in which petitioner alleged negligence on the part of Fidler and respondent for continuing to operate the vehicle with knowledge of its defective brakes. Liability of respondent was rested upon the rule that its status as a certificated carrier made it liable for the negligence of Fidler, its independent contractor, whose motor equipment was operated under the former's I. C. C. certificate. This is the law of Pennsylvania, Kissell v. Motor Age Transit Lines, 357 Pa. 204, 209, 53 A. 2d 593, 597.\n1\n Petitioner's theory was that his decedent was an invitee on the tractor-trailer, and that Fidler and his driver, Schroyer, therefore, owed decedent \n\n[360 \nU.S. 273, 276]\n\u00a0\n a duty of due care for breach of which respondent was liable under its I. C. C. certificate. Respondent claimed that decedent was a trespasser and, under Pennsylvania law, that it was therefore liable only for wanton misconduct. After discovery had been exhausted, respondent moved for summary judgment on the ground that the circumstances of decedent's engagement by Schroyer created an employer-employee relationship between it and decedent under the State workmen's compensation statute. The motion was denied and the case went to trial. It was submitted to the jury on special interrogatories covering the issues as to liability and a general charge as to the damages. The trial judge entered judgment on the special issues and the damage verdict for $76,500.\n\nInterrogatory No. 1,\n2\n the meaning of which is now in controversy, inquired as to whether it was \"reasonably necessary for the protection of defendant's [respondent's] interests\" to engage decedent. The Court of Appeals held that the affirmative answer of the jury classified decedent as respondent's employee bringing him within the general definition of 104 of the Pennsylvania Workmen's Compensation Act.\n3\n It noted that respondent had \n\n[360 \nU.S. 273, 277]\n\u00a0\n conceded that decedent was its \"casual\" employee but that this was not enough to take him out of the Act's coverage for, in addition, such casual employment must \"not be in the regular course of business\" of respondent. This, the Court of Appeals said, was a question of law under Pennsylvania practice and open to review. It held that the finding under Interrogatory No. 1 put decedent \"into the regular business\" of respondent. This holding would call for the dismissal of this suit, as petitioner's exclusive remedy would be under the Pennsylvania Workmen's Compensation Act.\n\nSince the keystone of the Court of Appeals' holding depends on its interpretation of Special Interrogatory No. 1, we note the views of the trial judge on that issue. In his opinion on the motion of respondent for judgment non obstante veredicto, he observed that \"the interrogatory . . . was not so phrased as to require the jury to determine whether decedent was an employee of Aetna.\" Rather, it \"was simply to secure a finding from the jury as to the reasonable necessity of Schroyer engaging decedent.\" 161 F. Supp., at 878. Likewise during the trial, in a colloquy with counsel as to this interrogatory, he advised: \"[Y]ou notice there I refrain from saying just what his [decedent's] status is. I don't think it necessary to have the jury find whether he was employed or not; I think that is a question for the law.\" On balance we believe that an examination of the record supports this interpretation of Interrogatory No. 1, although it must be admitted that the apparently inadvertent use of the words in \"protection of the defendant's interest\" in the interrogatory may have been taken in a different light by the jury. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 273, 278]\n\u00a0\n\n\nBe this as it may, however, not only the question of the relationship of the decedent to respondent should have been submitted to the jury but, in order to meet 104's definition, it should likewise have passed upon whether the employment, if any, was \"casual\" and not \"in the regular course\" of respondent's business. Our opinion in Byrd came down subsequent to argument in the Court of Appeals. As we said in that case \"An essential characteristic of [the federal system] is the manner in which, in civil common-law actions, it distributes trial functions between judge and jury . . . [assigning] the decisions of disputed questions of fact to the jury.\" Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Electric Coop., supra, at 537. We found there that the South Carolina rule in compensation cases, permitting courts to decide such factual issues without the aid of juries, was not \"announced as an integral part of the special relationship created by the statute.\" Id., at 536. We held that under such circumstances \"the federal court should not follow the state rule.\" Id., at 538. The same reasoning applies here. We have been given no reason for the distinction in the Pennsylvania practice of trying such disputed factual issues to the court. Respondent does not claim that the rule is an \"integral part of the special relationship\" created by its statute but rather that the disputed issue of employment was in fact submitted to the jury. It cannot be gainsaid that all of the disputed issues were not so submitted. In order to determine whether the Pennsylvania Act bars recovery here the court must have a full answer as to the status of the decedent as an employee under 104 of the Act. If the jury, under proper instructions, finds facts which show that, under 104, the decedent was respondent's employee and that such employment was \"casual\" and not \"in the regular course\" of respondent's business, then it can find for petitioner. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 273, 279]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are therefore of the opinion that a new trial on the whole case is necessary, since these disputed issues are so interrelated with the ultimate issues of liability and damages that a limited hearing would not be in the interest of fairness and efficiency in judicial administration. If the evidence on that trial is such as to justify with reason different conclusions on the factual issues as to the relationship of decedent as an employee, under 104 of Pennsylvania's Act, of either respondent or its contractor, Fidler, resolution of those issues, along with others that arise from the evidence, will be for the jury. The jury's verdict at that trial will determine if as well as in what amount petitioner may recover in this action.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Also see 49 Stat. 557, as amended, 49 U.S.C. 315, which provides that a certificate holder must carry insurance to satisfy any final judgment for injuries due to the \"negligent . . . use of motor vehicles under such certificate.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] \"Interrogatory Number 1. Under the evidence in this case, do you find that an unforeseen contingency arose which made it reasonably necessary for the protection of the defendant's interests that the driver Charles Schroyer engage the decedent Norman Ormsbee, Jr. to accompanying him for the remainder of the trip?\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Section 104 of the Pennsylvania Workmen's Compensation Act, Purdon's Pa. Stat. Ann., 1952, Tit. 77, 22, Cum. Supp., provides:\n\n\"The term `employe,' as used in this act is declared to be synonymous with servant, and includes -\n\n\n\"All natural persons who perform services for another for a valuable consideration, exclusive of persons whose employment is casual in character and not in the regular course of the business of the employer, and exclusive of persons to whom articles or materials are given out to be made up, cleaned, washed, altered, ornamented, finished or repaired, or adapted for sale in the worker's own home, or on other premises, not under the control or management of the \n\n[360 \nU.S. 273, 277]\n\u00a0\n employer. Every executive officer of a corporation elected or appointed in accordance with the charter and by-laws of the corporation, except elected officers of the Commonwealth or any of its political subdivisions, shall be an employe of the corporation.\"\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER, whom MR. JUSTICE HARLAN and MR. JUSTICE STEWART join, dissenting.\n\nThe issues in this case have had a shifting history. Today the problem of the case appears to be cast into these questions: was the issue of decedent Ormsbee's employment submitted to the jury and, if not, should it have been? But at trial the evidence massed on both sides was to prove or disprove that decedent was a trespasser. In the course of showing he was something other than a trespasser, petitioner introduced evidence which tended to prove that decedent was in fact a temporary employee of respondent, hired by the truck driver to aid in an emergency. Respondent countered by urging that the evidence introduced by petitioner, if believed, proved decedent was an employee of Aetna and therefore, under applicable Pennsylvania law, deprived petitioner of a common-law remedy against Aetna. The trial judge, believing employment to be a question of law, reserved until after the verdict a ruling on the effect of the Pennsylvania \n\n[360 \nU.S. 273, 280]\n\u00a0\n Workmen's Compensation Act, Purdon's Pa. Stat. Ann., 1952, Tit. 77, 22, 52, 462. And so, putting aside this question, and keeping the original issue regarding the status of decedent as a trespasser in mind, the judge framed one of the four interrogatories submitted to the jury to elicit its opinion whether decedent was or was not a trespasser. The jury found that he was not by answering the following interrogatory in the affirmative:\n\n \"Under the evidence in this case, do you find that an unforeseen contingency arose which made it reasonably necessary for the protection of the defendant's interests that the driver Charles Schroyer engage the decedent Norman Ormsbee, Jr. to accompany him for the remainder of the trip?\"\n\n\n The jury also returned a general verdict for petitioner.\n\nIn his opinion refusing Aetna's motions for a new trial or judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the trial judge reasoned that the Pennsylvania Act did not bar petitioner's recovery at common law because the nature of decedent's employment did not, under the Pennsylvania decisions, bring him under the Workmen's Compensation Act. 161 F. Supp. 875. The Court of Appeals disagreed with the trial judge's interpretation of the interrogatory, of the Pennsylvania statute and of the decisions thereunder. Reviewing the jury's verdict for decedent's administrator, that court held that the affirmative answer to the interrogatory necessitated a finding that decedent was an employee of Aetna within the definition of that status in the Pennsylvania Act and that therefore the only remedy was under that Act. 257 F.2d 445. In so doing, the court was applying to facts as found by a jury the law made applicable to the parties to this action by Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n, and the Rules of Decision Act, 28 U.S.C. 1652. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 273, 281]\n\u00a0\n\n\nPetitioner now asserts that our opinion in Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Electric Cooperative, Inc., \n356 \nU.S. 525\n, required the jury in the federal courts to decide the issue of employment and that the jury did not make that determination here. To agree with this second proposition we must either find that the Court of Appeals totally misinterpreted the answer of the jury to the interrogatory or that the rule stated in Byrd requires not only that disputed questions of fact be submitted to the jury but also that the application of law to facts likewise rests with the jury. The former ruling would deviate from the settled practice of this Court to accept the interpretation of proceedings below adopted by the Court of Appeals unless that interpretation is baseless.\n1\n Moreover, the ruling of the Court of Appeals was based primarily on an interpretation of Pennsylvania law and not on an extrapolation from the jury's finding. Judge Goodrich held that \"[w]e cannot escape the conclusion that the [jury] finding that authorized the hiring of Ormsbee put him into the regular business of the defendant, namely, transportation of goods by truck. If that was not what he was doing, he had no business riding with Schroyer at all.\" 257 F.2d ___, at 448. Thus the Court of Appeals applied the jury-found facts to the court-interpreted statute and said that the Pennsylvania law barred a common-law remedy. We should not review here the finding of the Court of Appeals on the meaning of the Pennsylvania statute. This Court has repeatedly deferred to decisions on local law reached by the lower federal courts.\n2\n What reason is there to \n\n[360 \nU.S. 273, 282]\n\u00a0\n deviate from that practice in this case? The meaning given to the Pennsylvania statutory language and to the cases interpreting it was the determination of three uncommonly experienced Pennsylvania circuit judges. Finally, no prior federal case would justify a ruling that in the federal courts application of law to fact is a jury function.\n3\n Nor does historical analysis support the assumption that such was the case at the time of the adoption of the Seventh Amendment.\n4\n Whether a given set of facts constitutes an employment relationship is a pure question of law and as such not within a jury's province. The charge, interrogatory, and answer thereto, as reasonably interpreted by the Court of Appeals, do not permit the conclusion that issues were withheld from the jury which were within its sphere of power, duty, and capability.\n\nBut suppose it be correct to conclude that the Court of Appeals erred in its opinion that the jury resolved all relevant factual inquiries. Still the petitioner has no case \n\n[360 \nU.S. 273, 283]\n\u00a0\n that should prevail here. For not only did the petitioner fail at trial to request the question of employment to be submitted to a jury, he himself stated during the course of the trial that employment was a question of law.\n5\n And when the trial judge said that he believed that as a question of law it ought not to be submitted to a jury, the petitioner did not claim otherwise.\n6\n Indeed it was the respondent who requested that the question be submitted to the jury and who objected when this request was refused. I shall continue to believe it to be law in civil cases in the federal courts that, barring some extraordinary circumstances not here present, failure to request a given issue to be submitted to a jury constitutes a waiver of any right to such submission.\n7\n The least requisite for raising such failure on appeal is notice to the trial court by way of an objection.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nCertiorari was granted upon a petition which urged that the Court of Appeals had so ruled as to deprive petitioner of the right to a jury determination of employment status and thus that the case raised the same basic question as that dealt with by this Court in Byrd. More particular consideration than could be expected to be given to the petition for certiorari\n9\n has made it apparent \n\n[360 \nU.S. 273, 284]\n\u00a0\n that neither statement is correct. The briefs on the merits and oral argument made it inescapably clear that petitioner failed to present a case which qualifies for our consideration in the light of the historical development of our certiorari jurisdiction\n10\n and the rule which we have promulgated to guide its exercise.\n11\n This is an ordinary diversity case turning solely on the application of Pennsylvania law to a unique set of facts and involving no question which justifies review under our discretionary jurisdiction. When the Court has discovered, even after argument, that there existed no question suitable for this Court's determination, certiorari has been dismissed as improvidently granted.\n12\n The reasons for such a disposition of a case even after argument - action so often taken as fairly to be part of the settled practice of the Court - were thus expounded by Mr. Chief Justice Taft:\n\n \"If it be suggested that as much effort and time as we have given to the consideration of the alleged conflict would have enabled us to dispose of the case before us on the merits, the answer is that it is very important that we be consistent in not granting the writ of certiorari except in cases involving principles the settlement of which is of importance to the public as distinguished from that of the parties, and in cases where there is a real and embarrassing conflict \n\n[360 \nU.S. 273, 285]\n\u00a0\n of opinion and authority between the circuit courts of appeal. The present case certainly comes under neither head.\"\n13\n\u00a0\n\n\n And so, since upon full consideration of this case it becomes clear that the complained-of error was probably not committed and that in any event petitioner is not in a position to assert it, due regard for the controlling importance of observing the conditions for the proper exercise of our discretionary jurisdiction requires that the writ of certiorari should be dismissed as improvidently granted.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See, e. g., Labor Board v.

JUSTICE STEWART joins, dissenting.\n\nPlenary consideration of this case, and indeed the opinion of the majority of this Court, have made it clear that the Court of Appeals dealt with the factual issues involved on the basis of a concession by the respondent and the jury's answer to Interrogatory No. 1. It is therefore now apparent that this case presents no question concerning the classification of these issues as for the court or for the jury under the decision in Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Cooperative, Inc., \n356 \nU.S. 525\n, and that the premise on which we granted certiorari was accordingly a mistaken one. And whether or not the Court of Appeals in acting as it did was correct in its assessment of the trial record is certainly not a matter justifying the exercise of our certiorari power within the criteria of Rule 19. I therefore agree with my Brother FRANKFURTER that the writ of certiorari should be dismissed as improvidently granted, and join in his dissenting opinion.\n\nEven if a Byrd issue could be considered as properly presented, the most that should be done is to remand the \n\n[360 \nU.S. 273, 286]\n\u00a0\n case to the Court of Appeals for further consideration in light of that decision. A retrial of this case would be justified under Byrd only if the Pennsylvania practice treating factual issues under 104 of the Workmen's Compensation Act as for the court, instead of for the jury, see Persing v. Citizens Traction Co., 294 Pa. 230, 144 A. 97; Vescio v. Pennsylvania Electric Co., 336 Pa. 502, 9 A. 2d 546, is merely a \"form and mode\" of procedure rather than \"an integral part\" of the rights created by the Act. Before deciding such a difficult and subtle question of local law, this Court should have the aid of the Court of Appeals whose members are more competent than we to speak on Pennsylvania law. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 273, 287]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","110":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMAGNET COVE BARIUM CORP. v.

UNITED STATES(1959)\nNo. 383\nArgued: Decided: June 15, 1959\n\n\n\n\n At a jury in a Federal District Court in which petitioner was convicted of unlawfully dispensing certain drugs without a prescription from a licensed physician, in violation of 21 U.S.C. 331 (k), the judge refused to permit the Government to introduce evidence that petitioner had previously practiced medicine without a license; but some of the jurors saw and read newspaper articles alleging that he had a record of two previous felony convictions and reciting other defamatory matters about him. Upon being questioned, each of these jurors assured the judge that he would not be influenced by the news articles and that he could decide the case only on the evidence of record. Held: The harm to petitioner that resulted when prejudicial information denied admission into evidence was brought before jurors through newspapers requires that a new trial be granted. Pp. 310-313.\n\n 258 F.2d 94, reversed.\n\nGeorge J. Francis argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief were Omer Griffin and Frances De Lost.\n\nJames W. Knapp argued the cause for the United States. On the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Anderson and Beatrice Rosenberg.\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\nPetitioner was convicted of unlawfully dispensing a number of dextro amphetamine sulfate tablets, a drug within the scope of 21 U.S.C. 353 (b) (1) (B), without a prescription from a licensed physician, which resulted in misbranding and violation of 21 U.S.C. 331 (k). The Court of Appeals affirmed, one judge dissenting, 258 F.2d 94. The case is here on a petition for certiorari, 28 U.S.C. 1254 (1), which we granted because of doubts \n\n[360 \nU.S. 310, 311]\n\u00a0\n whether exposure of some of the jurors to newspaper articles about petitioner was so prejudicial in the setting of the case as to warrant the exercise of our supervisory power to order a new trial. \n358 \nU.S. 892\n.\n\nPetitioner never took the stand; nor did he offer any evidence. A government agent testified that he was introduced to petitioner as a salesman who had difficulty staying awake on long automobile trips and that on two occasions he obtained these tablets from petitioner. Petitioner asked the trial judge to rule there was entrapment as a matter of law. The judge refused so to hold and submitted the issue of entrapment with appropriate instructions to the jury. Cf. Masciale v. United States, \n356 \nU.S. 386\n. The Government asked to be allowed to prove that petitioner had previously practiced medicine without a license, as tending to refute the defense of entrapment. The trial judge refused this offer saying, \"It would be just like offering evidence that he picked pockets or was a petty thief or something of that sort which would have no bearing on the issue and would tend to raise a collateral issue and I think would be prejudicial to the defendant.\"\n\nYet during the trial two newspapers containing such information got before a substantial number of jurors. One news account said:\n\n \"Marshall has a record of two previous felony convictions.\n\n\n \"In 1953, while serving a forgery sentence in the State Penitentiary at McAlester, Okla., Marshall testified before a state legislative committee studying new drug laws for Oklahoma.\n\n\n \"At that time, he told the committee that although he had only a high school education, he practiced medicine with a $25 diploma he received through the mails. He told in detail of the ease in which he wrote and passed prescriptions for dangerous drugs.\" \n\n[360 \nU.S. 310, 312]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The other news account said:\n\n  \"The defendant was Howard R. (Tobey) Marshall, once identified before a committee of the Oklahoma Legislature as a man who acted as a physician and prescribed restricted drugs for Hank Williams before the country singer's death in December, 1953.\n\n\n  .   .  .   .   .\n\n\n \"Marshall was arrested with his wife, Edith Every Marshall, 56, in June, 1956. She was convicted on the drug charges in Federal District Court here in November and was sentenced to 60 days in jail.\n\n\n \"Records show that Marshall once served a term in the Oklahoma penitentiary for forgery. There is no evidence he is a doctor, court attaches said.\"\n\n\n The trial judge on learning that these news accounts had reached the jurors summoned them into his chamber one by one and inquired if they had seen the articles. Three had read the first of the two we have listed above and one had read both. Three others had scanned the first article and one of those had also seen the second. Each of the seven told the trial judge that he would not be influenced by the news articles, that he could decide the case only on the evidence of record, and that he felt no prejudice against petitioner as a result of the articles. The trial judge, stating he felt there was no prejudice to petitioner, denied the motion for mistrial.\n\nThe trial judge has a large discretion in ruling on the issue of prejudice resulting from the reading by jurors of news articles concerning the trial. Holt v. United States, \n218 \nU.S. 245, 251\n. Generalizations beyond that statement are not profitable, because each case must turn on its special facts. We have here the exposure of jurors to information of a character which the trial judge ruled was so prejudicial it could not be directly offered as evidence. The prejudice to the defendant is almost certain \n\n[360 \nU.S. 310, 313]\n\u00a0\n to be as great when that evidence reaches the jury through news accounts as when it is a part of the prosecution's evidence. Cf. Michelson v. United States, \n335 \nU.S. 469, 475\n. It may indeed be greater for it is then not tempered by protective procedures.\n\nIn the exercise of our supervisory power to formulate and apply proper standards for enforcement of the criminal law in the federal courts (Bruno v. United States, \n308 \nU.S. 287\n; McNabb v.

CREASY(1959)\nNo. 157\nArgued: April 2, 1959Decided: June 8, 1959\n\n\n\n\n Respondents owned property abutting a section of highway in Pennsylvania which was about to be designated as a \"limited access highway\" under authority of a Pennsylvania statute which provides that the owners of property affected by the designation of a \"limited access highway\" shall be entitled \"only to damages arising from an actual taking of property\" and not for \"consequential damages where no property is taken.\" They sued in a Federal District Court for injunctive relief and a judgment declaring the statute unconstitutional. The District Court stayed its proceedings to permit the parties to seek a determination of their rights under the Act in the state courts. They brought an equity suit in a state court, which held that the Act provides a method by which every property owner may have it decided whether he is entitled to compensation, and, if so, for what and in what amounts, and that their constitutional rights, whatever they may be, will be protected. The State Supreme Court affirmed. Thereafter, the District Court concluded that the State Legislature did not intend to compensate abutting landowners whose rights of access to an existing highway are destroyed by its designation as a limited access highway, and that the Act violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; and it permanently enjoined the Governor and the Secretary of Highways from proceeding further. Held: The circumstances were such that the District Court should have declined to adjudicate this controversy. Pp. 220-225.\n\n (a) The desirability of avoiding unseemly conflict between two sovereignties, the unnecessary impairment of state functions, and the premature determination of constitutional questions should have led the District Court to stay its hand. Pp. 223-224.\n\n\n (b) Another reason why the District Court should have stayed its hand is to be found in the complex and varying effects which the contemplated state action may have upon different landowners. Pp. 224-225. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 219, 220]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n (c) There is no reason to suppose that the State will not accord full constitutional scope to the statutory phrase \"actual taking of property\"; but, should it fail to do so, recourse may be had to this Court. P. 225.\n\n\n 160 F. Supp. 404, reversed.\n\nAnne X. Alpern, Attorney General of Pennsylvania, argued the cause for appellants. On the brief were Harry J. Rubin, Deputy Attorney General, Harrington Adams and Leonard M. Mendelson.\n\nEdward P. Good argued the cause for appellees. With him on the brief were A. E. Kountz and Thomas D. Caldwell.\n\nOpinion of the Court by MR. JUSTICE STEWART, announced by MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER.\n\nThis action was instituted in the District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania by owners of property abutting a section of highway which runs between downtown Pittsburgh and the Greater Pittsburgh Airport. The complaint stated that the Secretary of Highways and the Governor of Pennsylvania were about to designate that section of the road a \"limited access highway\" under authority of a Pennsylvania statute. Claiming that such action would deprive them of their property without due process of law, since the Pennsylvania statute allegedly did not provide compensation for loss of access to the highway, the plaintiffs asked for injunctive relief and for a judgment declaring the statute unconstitutional.\n\nThe legislation under which it was asserted the state officials were planning to act is the Pennsylvania Limited Access Highways Act of 1945.\n1\n The Act defines a limited \n\n[360 \nU.S. 219, 221]\n\u00a0\n access highway as \"a public highway to which owners or occupants of abutting property or the traveling public have no right of ingress or egress to, from or across such highway, except as may be provided by the authorities responsible therefor.\"\n2\n It authorizes the Secretary of Highways, with the approval of the Governor, to declare any highway, or part thereof, to be a limited access highway.\n3\n Section 8 of the statute, as amended in 1947, provides:\n\n\"The owner or owners of private property affected by the construction or designation of a limited access highway . . . shall be entitled only to damages arising from an actual taking of property. The Commonwealth shall not be liable for consequential damages where no property is taken . . . .\"\n\n\n The latter section was specifically attacked by the plaintiffs, who claimed that in the light of the Pennsylvania courts' interpretation of other statutes, this provision would be construed to mean that compensation was to be paid only if land were taken. The Limited Access Highways Act itself had never been construed by the courts of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe district judge issued a temporary restraining order. Thereafter a three-judge court was convened pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2281 and 2284. After stipulations of fact were filed, the District Court entered an order staying proceedings to permit the parties to seek a determination of their rights under the statute in the courts of Pennsylvania.\n\nThereupon the plaintiffs filed an equitable proceeding in the Common Pleas Court of Dauphin County, Pennsylvania. That court pointed out that the plaintiffs were asking for a determination of \"whether or not a taking \n\n[360 \nU.S. 219, 222]\n\u00a0\n of property has occurred and what damages shall be awarded therefor, and that, if the depriving them of access is found to be a taking of a compensable property right, that plaintiffs' legitimate interests will be constitutionally safeguarded by a resort to viewers proceedings and, if necessary, by later appeals to the courts.\" Creasy v. Lawler, 8 Pa. D. & C. 2d 535, 537.\n\nAs a court of equity, the county court found it proper to determine only the last of these questions, and its answer was unequivocal:\n\n\"All of plaintiffs' rights can be protected and secured in a proceeding before viewers, as is provided in section 8 of The Limited Access Highway Act of May 29, 1945. . . . Here the legislature, in The Limited Access Highways Act, . . . has provided a way in which every property owner may have it decided whether he is entitled to compensation and, if so, when, for what, and in what amounts. . . . Should the Commonwealth proceed, then at that time plaintiffs will have the right to proceed before viewers on the question of their right to damages. In the orderly course of the procedure provided by The Limited Access Highways Act, they will have a right of appeal to the common pleas court and a jury trial, and still later to have their rights adjudicated in the appellate courts. At all times their constitutional rights, whatever they may be, will be guarded and protected.\" 8 Pa. D. & C. 2d, at 538-539.\n\n\n This decision was affirmed per curiam by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which explicitly adopted the lower court's opinion. 389 Pa. 635, 133 A. 2d 178.\n\nFurther proceedings were then had in the District Court. Although stating its awareness \"that the federal courts should be reluctant to exercise jurisdiction in cases where the plaintiffs' constitutional rights will be properly \n\n[360 \nU.S. 219, 223]\n\u00a0\n protected in the state tribunal and where the statute under attack has not yet been construed by the State courts,\" nevertheless the District Court proceeded to adjudicate the merits of the controversy, believing that the plaintiffs might be irreparably harmed during the period required to determine their rights in the state courts. \"Without venturing to predict the ultimate decision of the Pennsylvania Courts on the issue of compensation,\" the District Court was of the view that the Pennsylvania Legislature did not intend to compensate abutting landowners \"whose right of access to an existing highway is destroyed by the designation of that highway as a limited-access highway.\" For that reason the court found the statute repugnant to the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. A final decree was issued, permanently enjoining, in the most sweeping terms, the Secretary of Highways and the Governor from proceeding. Creasy v. Stevens, 160 F. Supp. 404.\n4\n The case is here by way of a direct appeal, 28 U.S.C. 1253, of which this Court noted probable jurisdiction. \n358 \nU.S. 807\n.\n\nIt was the clear pronouncement of the Pennsylvania courts that the state statute provides a complete procedure to guard and protect the plaintiffs' constitutional rights \"at all times.\" In the light of this pronouncement it is difficult to perceive the basis for the District Court's conclusion that the plaintiffs would be irreparably harmed \n\n[360 \nU.S. 219, 224]\n\u00a0\n unless the state officers were enjoined from proceeding under the statute. There is no question here of the State's right to create or designate a limited access highway. The only question is the plaintiffs' right to compensation. It must be assumed that the courts of Pennsylvania meant what they said in stating that the plaintiffs will be afforded a procedure through which the full measure of their rights under the United States Constitution will be preserved. Assuming, however, that there was a basis to support intervention by a court of equity, the District Court, we think, should nevertheless have declined to adjudicate this controversy.\n\nThe circumstances which should impel a federal court to abstain from blocking the exercise by state officials of their appropriate functions are present here in a marked degree. The considerations which support the wisdom of such abstention have been so thoroughly and repeatedly discussed by this Court as to require little elaboration. Railroad Comm'n v. Pullman Co., \n312 \nU.S. 496\n; Chicago v. Fieldcrest Dairies, \n316 \nU.S. 168\n; Spector Motor Co. v. McLaughlin, \n323 \nU.S. 101\n; American Federation of Labor v. Watson, \n327 \nU.S. 582\n; Government Employees v. Windsor, \n353 \nU.S. 364\n. See also Alabama Comm'n v. Southern R. Co., \n341 \nU.S. 341\n. Reflected among the concerns which have traditionally counseled a federal court to stay its hand are the desirability of avoiding unseemly conflict between two sovereignties, the unnecessary impairment of state functions, and the premature determination of constitutional questions. All those factors are present here.\n\nAt least one additional reason for abstention in the present case is to be found in the complex and varying effects which the contemplated state action may have upon the different landowners. Some of them may be completely deprived of access; others may have access to existing roads or service roads to be constructed; still \n\n[360 \nU.S. 219, 225]\n\u00a0\n others may have access to the highway itself through points of ingress and egress established under the statute. In the state court proceedings the case of each landowner will be considered separately, with whatever particular problems each case may present.\n\nThere is no reason to suppose that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania will not accord full constitutional scope to the statutory phrase \"actual taking of property.\"\n5\n If, after all is said and done in the Pennsylvania courts, any of the plaintiffs believe that the Commonwealth has deprived them of their property without due process of law, this Court will be here.\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Pa.

JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, concurring.\n\nA District Court's abstention from the exercise of its properly invoked jurisdiction is justified, in my view, \"only in the exceptional circumstances where the order to the parties to repair to the state court would clearly serve one of two important countervailing interests: either the avoidance of a premature and perhaps unnecessary decision of a serious federal constitutional question, or the avoidance of the hazard of unsettling some delicate balance in the area of federal-state relationships.\" Louisiana Power & Light Co. v. City of Thibodaux, ante, p. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 219, 226]\n\u00a0\n 32 (dissenting opinion). Both of these circumstances in which abstention is justified are present in this case. If the District Court directs the parties to the Pennsylvania courts, those courts may interpret the cutting off of access rights as a taking of property requiring the payment of compensation under Pennsylvania law. Such an interpretation would obviate any need for determination of the serious constitutional issue raised in the District Court.\n\nFurthermore, the District Court's action has halted at the threshold the carrying out of a large-scale highway program before the state courts have had an opportunity to interpret the statute creating that program. This constitutes an unnecessary interference with state domestic policy creating undesirable friction in federal-state relationships.\n\nTherefore, I concur in the judgment of the Court.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting in part.\n\nWe are all agreed that the District Court improperly enjoined the enforcement of the Pennsylvania statute. But I believe that these property owners are entitled to a declaratory judgment by the federal court, determining whether access to a highway is a property right, compensable under the Fifth Amendment (and made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth, Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, \n166 \nU.S. 226\n).\n\nCongress has granted the District Courts jurisdiction over cases arising \"under the Constitution,\" 28 U.S.C. 1331, as this one does. That jurisdiction need not be exercised where it would be obstructive of state action and lead to needless interference with state agencies. Alabama Comm'n v. Southern R. Co., \n341 \nU.S. 341\n. It likewise need not be exercised where the resolution of state law questions - which are complex or unsettled - may make it unnecessary to reach a federal constitutional \n\n[360 \nU.S. 219, 227]\n\u00a0\n question. Spector Motor Co. v. McLaughlin, \n323 \nU.S. 101\n; Chicago v. Fieldcrest Dairies, \n316 \nU.S. 168\n; American Federation of Labor v. Watson, \n327 \nU.S. 582\n. And these principles are applicable in the main to declaratory judgment actions as well as to those where injunctions are sought. Great Lakes Co. v. Huffman, \n319 \nU.S. 293\n.\n\nIn my view these cases are irrelevant here. We have at bottom in this case a question whether access to a highway is a property right which is compensable under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. If it is compensable, as the District Court ruled, see 160 F. Supp. 404, 410-412, this is the most appropriate time to make the announcement. Particularly is this so when appellees in this case sought a declaration by the state court of their rights under the statute and were told that \"their constitutional rights, whatever they may be, will be guarded and protected.\" Such a ruling by the District Court would not halt the highway program. But it might have an effect on engineering designs for new local service roads to provide substitute means of access to the highways; and it would make clear to the local authorities what the scope of their financial commitments in the undertaking is.\n\nA determination of appellees' property rights would not be a premature decision because of the inability to forecast how the State will effect its goal of limiting access to its highway. Whether or not the landowners will be left landlocked or given access to substitute service roads goes only to the question of the amount of property \"taken,\" if any. It has nothing to do with the question of the landowner's property right in access to a highway abutting his land.\n\nWe have witnessed in recent times a hostility to the exercise by federal courts of their power to declare what a citizen's rights are under local law in diversity cases (Louisiana Power & Light Co. v. Thibodaux, ante, p. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 219, 228]\n\u00a0\n 25) and in cases where federal rights are invoked. Public Service Comm'n v. Wycoff Co., \n344 \nU.S. 237\n; Harrison v. NAACP, ante, p. 167. I think the federal courts, created by the First Congress, are today a haven where rights can sometimes be adjudicated even more dispassionately than in state tribunals. At least Congress in its wisdom has provided since 1875 (18 Stat. 470) that the lower federal courts should be the guardian of federal rights. The judicial intolerance of diversity jurisdiction, noted by my Brother BRENNAN in his dissent in Louisiana Power & Light Co. v. Thibodaux, supra, seems to be spreading to other heads of federal jurisdiction as the decisions in this case and in Harrison v. NAACP,\n1\n supra, suggest. True it is, that the exercise of that power in some cases would be so utterly disruptive of state-federal relations as to make it undesirable. As a general rule, however, the federal courts should be responsible for the exposition of federal law. It should be their responsibility in cases properly before them under heads of jurisdiction prescribed by Congress to construe federal statutes and the Federal Constitution. There is no more appropriate occasion for the exercise of that jurisdiction than the present case which involves the question whether or not access rights constitute \"property\" in the constitutional sense.\n2\n That question concerns not state law but \n\n[360 \nU.S. 219, 229]\n\u00a0\n a concept imbedded in the Bill of Rights. It is in no way entangled with local law. The Supremacy Clause of the Constitution makes all local projects bow to that concept of \"property.\" And in my view there is no more appropriate tribunal for an adjudication of that issue than the Federal District Court, which in this case acted at the very threshold of this engineering project and made a ruling that informs the local authorities of the full reach of their responsibilities. This is not intermeddling in state affairs nor creating needless friction. It is an authoritative pronouncement at the beginning of a controversy which saves countless days in the slow, painful, and costly litigation of separate individual lawsuits in state viewers proceedings.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Harrison case invoked federal jurisdiction not only under 28 U.S.C. 1331 and 1332 (diversity) but also under 1343 (civil rights).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Title 28 U.S.C. 2201 permits a federal court to declare a party's rights in the case of an actual controversy. There is such a controversy here. Appellants have expressed their intention to declare the highway on which appellees' properties abut to be a limited access highway, and have consistently argued that appellees have no right to compensation, although they may be denied access to the highway which they previously had. This is enough to create an actual controversy which a federal court may settle if its processes are, as here, properly invoked. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 219, 230]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","114":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMcCAULEY v.

They were dissolved under their respective state statutes and moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that their dissolution abated the proceeding. Held: Under the applicable Maryland and Delaware statutes, their corporate lives were sufficiently continued to make them \"existing\" corporations within the meaning of 8 of the Sherman Act, so that the proceeding did not abate.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioners are corporations - two organized under Maryland law and one under Delaware law - and wholly owned subsidiaries of Schenley Industries, Inc. They were indicted with others for restraining trade, conspiring to monopolize and attempting to monopolize commerce in violation of 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 26 Stat. 209, 15 U.S.C. 1, 2. Shortly after the indictment was returned, petitioners were dissolved under their respective \n\n[359 \nU.S. 271, 272]\n\u00a0\n state statutes and became separate divisions of a new corporation under the same ultimate ownership. They then moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that their dissolution abated the proceeding. The District Court denied the motions, holding that under the applicable Maryland and Delaware statutes the existence of the dissolved corporations continued so far as prosecution of this criminal proceeding was concerned. 138 F. Supp. 685. Petitioners then pleaded nolo contendere and the District Court levied fines against them. The Court of Appeals affirmed, 258 F.2d 726. The case is here on a petition for a writ of certiorari which we granted because of a conflict among the Circuits.\n1\n\u00a0\n358 \nU.S. 878\n.\n\nWe start from the premise that in the federal domain prosecutions abate both on the death of an individual defendant (List v. Pennsylvania, \n131 \nU.S. 396\n; Schreiber v. Sharpless, \n110 \nU.S. 76\n) and on the dissolution of a corporate defendant (Defense Supplies Corp. v. Lawrence Warehouse Co., \n336 \nU.S. 631, 634\n), unless the action is saved by statute. We need not decide whether federal law alone would be sufficient to save a federal cause of action against a corporation dissolved under state law. We have here a situation where the interplay of federal and state law makes it clear that petitioners did not escape criminal responsibility under the Sherman Act by the kind of dissolution decreed under Maryland and Delaware law.\n\nThe Sherman Law in 8 defines \"person\" to include corporations \"existing\" under the laws of any State. The question whether a corporation \"exists\" for any purpose is thus determined by reference to state law. We conclude that under both Maryland and Delaware law the \n\n[359 \nU.S. 271, 273]\n\u00a0\n lives of these corporations were not cut short, as is sometimes done on dissolution, cf. Chicago T. & T. Co. v. Wilcox Bldg. Corp., \n302 \nU.S. 120\n, but were sufficiently continued so that this proceeding did not abate.\n\nIn Maryland, during the period relevant here, though the dissolution of the corporation was effective when the articles of dissolution had been accepted, the corporation continued \"in existence for the purpose of paying, satisfying and discharging any existing debts and obligations . . . .\" (Flack's Md. Ann. Code, 1951, Art. 23, 72 (b).) It was also provided in 78 (a) that \"such dissolution\" shall not \"abate any pending suit or proceeding by or against the corporation . . . .\" We have found no Maryland decisions interpreting these sections; but we are satisfied that the term \"proceeding,\" no matter how the state court may construe it,\n2\n implies enough vitality to make the corporation an \"existing\" enterprise for the purposes of 8 of the Sherman Act.\n\nThe Delaware statute seems equally clear, though again there is no authoritative interpretation of it. It provides that any \"proceeding\" begun by or against a corporation before or within three years after dissolution shall continue \"until any judgments, orders, or decrees therein shall be fully executed.\" Del. Code Ann., 1953, Tit. 8, 278; Addy v. Short, 47 Del. 157, 89 A. 2d 136, 139. The term \"proceeding\" is elsewhere used in the Delaware Code as including criminal prosecutions;\n3\n and that seems to us to \n\n[359 \nU.S. 271, 274]\n\u00a0\n be consistent with its normal construction.\n4\n We conclude that irrespective of how the Delaware statute may be construed by the Delaware courts, it sufficiently continued the existence of this corporation for the purpose of 8 of the Sherman Act.\n\nPolicy reasons look to the same result. Petitioners were wholly owned subsidiaries of Schenley Industries, Inc. After dissolution they simply became divisions of a new corporation under the same ultimate ownership. In this situation there is no more reason for allowing them to escape criminal penalties than damages in civil suits. As the Court of Appeals noted, a corporation cannot be sent to jail. The discharge of its liabilities whether criminal or civil can be effected only by the payment of money.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See United States v.

The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the judgment of the District Court. 256 F.2d 83. An appeal was taken to this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1254 (2), providing for appeal of a decision of a Court of Appeals where appellant relies on a state statute held to be \"invalid as repugnant to the Constitution, treaties or laws of the United States.\" Appellee moved to dismiss the appeal, contending that review by appeal does not lie because the Court of Appeals decision declaring the state statute unconstitutional was based on the Constitution of Mississippi as well as the Federal Constitution. Subsequently, appellant moved the Court to vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the District Court with instructions to vacate its judgment and convene a three-judge court under 28 U.S.C. 2281 and 2284 to consider appellee's complaint.

See Railroad Comm'n v. Pullman Co., \n312 \nU.S. 496\n. That is especially desirable where the questions of state law are enmeshed with federal questions. Spector Motor Co. v.

Magnolia Petroleum Co., \n309 \nU.S. 478, 483\n. In such a case, when the state court's interpretation of the statute or evaluation of its validity under the state constitution may obviate any need to consider its validity under the Federal Constitution, the federal court should hold its hand, lest it render a constitutional decision unnecessarily.

He also reiterates his belief that nothing \n\n[360 \nU.S. 230, 231]\n\u00a0\n in this decision forecloses reconsideration of the Feldman holding in a case presenting the issue presented by Feldman.\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS concur, dissenting.\n\nIn Knapp v. Schweitzer, \n357 \nU.S. 371\n, the Court left open the question whether in the case of collaboration between state and federal officers a witness could successfully assert the federal privilege against self-incrimination in a state proceeding. In my view, that question should be answered here, for the records in these cases show such collaboration. Yet the majority of the Court ignores the question in affirming without opinion. Therefore, although I agree with and join the dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, I add these additional views.\n\nThe petitioners in these cases were held in contempt for failure to answer questions before a state grand jury investigating the bribery of police officials of New Orleans by persons conducting lottery operations within that city. From the nature of the questions asked petitioners, it is evident that they were suspected of engaging in lotteries and giving bribes. The District Attorney of the Parish of Orleans, under authority granted by state statute, offered petitioners full immunity from state prosecution for crimes, other than perjury, uncovered by the questioning. Nevertheless, petitioners refused to answer questions relating to bribery and their connections with lottery operations, pleading in justification of this refusal the federal privilege against self-incrimination.\n\nThe contempt proceedings and the state court reviews were had upon an agreed statement of facts. These stipulations recited that during the pendency of the state grand jury investigation \"the Intelligence Division, Internal Revenue Service of the United States, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Louisiana and the \n\n[360 \nU.S. 230, 232]\n\u00a0\n United States Grand Jury [had] been for several months and [were then] engaged in investigating some of the members of the New Orleans Police Department for income tax evasion, a felony under the laws of the United States.\" In addition, the parties agreed that these investigations were well publicized and that, at the time of the instant proceedings, a number of federal income tax indictments had been returned against police officers. Further, it was established that each of the petitioners had been requested to execute, and had executed, waivers of the statute of limitations on his federal tax liabilities for most of the years in question. Lastly, the parties stipulated:\n\n \"That there has existed, and now exists [at the time of the state proceeding], cooperation and collaboration between the District Attorney for the Parish of Orleans and the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Louisiana and the Internal Revenue Service of the United States of America and its investigators, as well as with the Police Bureau of Investigation of the City of New Orleans in reference to members of the New Orleans Police Department regarding public bribery and income tax evasion and that the Honorable Leon D. Hubert, Jr., District Attorney for the Parish of Orleans, has held conferences with the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Louisiana regarding public bribery on the part of certain members of the New Orleans Police Department and income tax evasion, felonies under the law of the United States of America and the State of Louisiana.\"\n\n\n In Knapp v. Schweitzer, supra, which decided that the federal privilege against self-incrimination may not ordinarily be raised in a state proceeding, the Court said:\n\n \"Of course the Federal Government may not take advantage of this recognition of the States' autonomy \n\n[360 \nU.S. 230, 233]\n\u00a0\n in order to evade the Bill of Rights. If a federal officer should be a party to the compulsion of testimony by state agencies, the protection of the Fifth Amendment would come into play. Such testimony is barred in a federal prosecution, see Byars v. United States, \n273 \nU.S. 28\n. Whether, in a case of such collaboration between state and federal officers, the defendant could successfully assert his privilege in the state proceeding, we need not now decide, for the record before us is barren of evidence that the State was used as an instrument of federal prosecution or investigation. Petitioner's assertion that a federal prosecuting attorney announced his intention of cooperating with state officials in the prosecution of cases in a general field of criminal law presents a situation devoid of legal significance as a joint state and federal endeavor.\" \n357 \nU.S., at 380\n.\n\n\n I dissented from that decision on the ground that the state court had decided that the federal privilege did not obtain on the seemingly false premise that information adduced in the state proceeding could not be used against the petitioner in a subsequent federal prosecution. But even accepting, for the purpose of argument, the validity of the Knapp result, I am of the view that the question which was not answered there should be considered here and resolved in favor of the petitioners.\n\nThe Knapp decision when taken in conjunction with Feldman v. United States, \n322 \nU.S. 487\n, means that a person can be convicted of a federal crime on the basis of testimony which he is compelled to give in a state investigation. This opens vast opportunities for calculated efforts by state and federal officials working together to force a disclosure in a state proceeding and to convict on the basis of that disclosure in a federal proceeding. Such opportunities will not go unused unless the courts are vigilant to protect the rights of persons who find themselves \n\n[360 \nU.S. 230, 234]\n\u00a0\n faced with such coaction of federal and state prosecuting agencies. Such vigilance becomes increasingly required as the Federal Government, through prosecutions for tax evasion, moves into the criminal areas regulated by the States.\n*\n\u00a0\n\nIn the instant case the record shows clearly that state and federal authorities had launched a coordinated investigation into the suspected bribery by gamblers of New Orleans' police officers. The State was interested primarily in the enforcement of its public bribery statutes. The Federal Government sought to apprehend tax evaders. The state and federal agencies involved in this two-fold investigation collaborated to obtain desired ends. Policemen suspected of taking bribes and gamblers suspected of giving them were called for questioning. Both were in jeopardy of prosecution: the police under state statute for taking bribes and under federal statute for income tax evasion; the gamblers under state statute for giving bribes and under federal statutes for income tax evasion and for failure to pay the special stamp and excise taxes levied on gambling operations. Doubt which might have existed concerning federal interest in petitioners' possible tax evasions was removed when petitioners were induced to waive the statute of limitations for relevant tax years.\n\nThe opinion in the Knapp case states that the protection of the Fifth Amendment comes into play if a federal officer is a party to the compulsion of testimony by a state agency. \n357 \nU.S. 371, 380\n. The threshold question then is whether the requisite relationship existed between the State District Attorney and the United States Attorney \n\n[360 \nU.S. 230, 235]\n\u00a0\n and Internal Revenue agents. The stipulation, when read in the light of the known facts, adequately shows that federal officers participated in the state action which sought to compel the testimony of petitioners. That stipulation, signed by the state prosecutor, admits of \"cooperation,\" \"collaboration,\" and \"conferences.\" These terms viewed against the background of contemporaneous investigations by a federal grand jury, a state grand jury, the Police Bureau of Investigation of the City of New Orleans, and the Intelligence Division of the Internal Revenue Service, all pointed at a group of persons which included petitioners, require the conclusion that the State was used as an instrument of federal investigation.\n\nI come then to the question left open in the Knapp case: whether, where, as here, a State is used as an instrument of federal investigation, witnesses can successfully assert their federal privilege against self-incrimination in state proceedings. Knapp v. Schweitzer, supra, suggests that where testimony is compelled in such circumstances, the testimony would be inadmissible in a subsequent federal prosecution. See Byars v. United States, \n273 \nU.S. 28\n. See also Feldman v. United States, \n322 \nU.S. 487, 494\n. But this is only partial protection. To compel testimony in a federal investigation, a witness must be assured at the outset complete immunity from any prosecution which might result from his compelled disclosures. Counselman v. Hitchcock, \n142 \nU.S. 547\n; Brown v. Walker, \n161 \nU.S. 591\n; Blau v. United States, \n340 \nU.S. 159\n; Ullmann v. United States, \n350 \nU.S. 422, 430\n. There is no indication that such protection obtains here - that petitioners are protected from federal prosecutions which might result from their testimony even though that testimony is not admissible in the subsequent proceeding. Byars v. United States, supra, merely prohibits the introduction of illegally seized evidence and Knapp v. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 230, 236]\n\u00a0\n Schweitzer, supra, and Feldman v. United States, supra, speak merely of the non-use of the compelled testimony in a subsequent federal prosecution. None of these cases deals with the fruits of the compelled testimony, and defendants, like petitioners, who are forced to testify under circumstances similar to those here present, are left without the protection against self-incrimination intended by the Constitution. These cases, in my opinion, should be extended to prohibit any prosecution resulting from disclosures compelled under circumstances similar to those which exist here. But this is not an established principle and a witness is entitled to more than hopes of immunity when federal agencies seek to compel incriminatory testimony. Therefore, in my view, petitioners properly invoked their federal privilege against self-incrimination in the present proceeding and the contempts should be discharged. Cf. Rea v. United States, \n350 \nU.S. 214\n; Bartkus v. Illinois, \n359 \nU.S. 121, 164\n (dissenting opinion).\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Cf. Commissioner v. Wilcox, \n327 \nU.S. 404\n; Rutkin v.

JUSTICE BLACK concur, dissenting.\n\nPetitioners in these cases were summoned before a state grand jury in New Orleans and interrogated concerning bribery of public officials and income tax evasion. They were at the time being investigated by the Federal Internal Revenue Service. Accordingly, they objected to the questions, invoking the Fifth Amendment and stating that the answers to the questions would tend to incriminate them. Their objections were overruled and they were held in contempt for refusal to answer. The Supreme Court of Louisiana refused writs of certiorari, mandamus, and prohibition, finding \"no error of law in the ruling complained of.\" The cases are here on certiorari. \n358 \nU.S. 810\n. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 230, 237]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt has been the prevailing view since Twining v. New Jersey, \n211 \nU.S. 78\n, that the guaranty of the Fifth Amendment that no person \"shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself\" is not made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. Adamson v. California, \n332 \nU.S. 46\n. Under the Twining rule, the Louisiana courts, therefore, need not bow to the Fifth Amendment as a requirement read into state law by the Bill of Rights.\n\nThat is not, however, the end of our problem. For the question remains whether a state court can override a claim of federal right seasonably raised in the state proceeding, when the failure to recognize the federal right will result in its destruction or nullification.\n\nThe classical case involves a federal right in the conduct of a business, as in the case of the contractor in Leslie Miller, Inc. v. Arkansas, \n352 \nU.S. 187\n, who, having been the successful bidder for federal construction work, could not be subjected to conflicting state licensing requirements. Related cases are in the class of Service Storage & Transfer Co. v. Virginia, \n359 \nU.S. 171\n, and Castle v. Hayes Freight Lines, \n348 \nU.S. 61\n, which hold that an interstate motor carrier certificate issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission could not be overridden in state proceedings. Litigants asserting federal rights as the basis of a claim (Testa v. Katt, \n330 \nU.S. 386\n) or as a defense to a claim under state law (Miles v. Illinois Central R. Co., \n315 \nU.S. 698\n) may do so in state courts which must recognize and protect the federal rights. Chief Justice White stated it as the \"duty resting upon\" state and federal courts \"to protect and enforce rights lawfully created, without reference to the particular government from whose exercise of lawful power the right arose.\" Minneapolis & St. Louis R. Co. v. Bombolis, \n241 \nU.S. 211, 223\n. Litigants, resting on a federal right, \n\n[360 \nU.S. 230, 238]\n\u00a0\n need not resort to federal courts to protect those rights where those rights are put in jeopardy in state proceedings.\n\nThere is no more apt illustration of that principle than the present case. The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution reserves a twofold federal guarantee for every citizen. It protects him from being forced to give testimony in any federal proceeding, criminal or civil (Counselman v. Hitchcock, \n142 \nU.S. 547, 562\n; McCarthy v. Arndstein, \n262 \nU.S. 355, 266\n U.S. 34), judicial, investigative or administrative (Quinn v. United States, \n349 \nU.S. 155, 161\n; Smith v. United States, \n337 \nU.S. 137\n), which might tend to incriminate him. And it also assures that no incriminating information adduced from a defendant involuntarily by anyone, anywhere, may be admitted into evidence against him in any federal prosecution. Bram v. United States, \n168 \nU.S. 532\n; Wan v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 1\n. It was to this second principle that the ruling of this Court in Feldman v. United States, \n322 \nU.S. 487\n, was unfaithful. As long as that decision is adhered to, the evidence obtained in a state proceeding such as the one in this case can be used in a federal prosecution. It is, therefore, too late to protect the federal right if one waits for action by the federal court. The federal right is lost irretrievably, if it is not saved by the state court. As stated by the Supreme Court of Michigan in People v. DenUyl, 318 Mich. 645, 651, 29 N. W. 2d 284, 287:\n\n \"It seems like a travesty on verity to say that one is not subjected to self-incrimination when compelled to give testimony in a State judicial proceeding which testimony may forthwith be used against him in a Federal criminal prosecution.\"\n\n\n If the dissent in Feldman v. United States, supra, had prevailed and testimony compelled from a witness in a state proceeding had been barred from use against him when he became a defendant in a federal proceeding, protection \n\n[360 \nU.S. 230, 239]\n\u00a0\n of the federal right against self-incrimination could be left to the federal courts. But Feldman, until it is overruled, controls the regimes under which state investigations are made and federal prosecutions conducted. As long as it is on the books the only place a witness, who is being examined in state proceedings about matters that may incriminate him under federal laws, can protect his rights against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment is in the state courts.\n\nKnapp v. Schweitzer, \n357 \nU.S. 371\n, is contrary to the disposition I would make of the present cases. But it is not a principled decision that addressed itself to the proposition that unless the federal right is protected in the state proceeding it is lost forever. The opinion in that case was concerned with maintaining the vitality of state investigations. Not once did it mention Feldman v. United States, supra, nor address itself to the dilemma created by that decision. Nowhere does it explain how in light of Feldman v. United States the federal right can be protected and the vitality of state investigations also maintained. I have said enough to indicate that both cannot be done by affirming these judgments. As long as Feldman v. United States stands on the books, the state courts should be required to recognize the federal right against self-incrimination - lest it be lost forever. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 230, 240]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","120":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMILWAUKIE COMPANY v.

LOUIS R. CO. v. U.S.(1959)\nNo. 12\nArgued: Decided: December 14, 1959\n\n\n\n\n Under 5 (2) of the Interstate Commerce Act, the Commission was confronted with rival applications by several railroads for authority to acquire control of the Toledo, Peoria & Western Railroad, an independent, short-line, \"bridge carrier\" of through east-west traffic by-passing the congested Chicago and St. Louis gateways and connecting with 16 other railroads. After extended hearings, the Commission found that the plan for joint control of Western by the Santa Fe and Pennsylvania Railroads contemplated that Western would continue to be operated as a separate and independent carrier with responsible local management and that all existing routes via Western would be maintained and kept open without discrimination between connecting lines of railroads; but that the plan of the Minneapolis & St. Louis Railroad to acquire sole control of Western contemplated its disappearance as an independent and neutral connection for 15 other carriers, that it would be extremely harmful to other carriers and that it would result in termination of the employment of most of Western's 24 executives and 225 other employees. The Commission concluded that the acquisition and plan of operation by the Santa Fe and Pennsylvania, subject to stated conditions, was within the scope of 5 (2) of the Act, that the proposed terms and conditions were just and reasonable, and that the transaction would be consistent with the public interest. It, therefore, approved the Santa Fe-Pennsylvania application, dismissed the Minneapolis application, and denied applications by several intervening railroads for permission to participate in the acquisition of Western's stock. The District Court sustained the Commission's order. Held: The judgment is affirmed. Pp. 176-194. \n\n[361 \nU.S. 173, 174]\n\u00a0\n\n\n 1. The record shows that the Commission's finding that continued operation of Western as a \"separate and independent carrier\" was required by the \"public interest\" did not deprive the Minneapolis & St. Louis Railroad of \"fair comparative consideration\" and that it was made after full and fair consideration; and the District Court did not err in so holding. Pp. 184-185.\n\n\n 2. Notwithstanding appellants' contention that acquisition of Western by Santa Fe and Pennsylvania would create a combination in restraint of commerce in violation of 1 of the Sherman Act and would lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in violation of 7 of the Clayton Act, the record shows that the Commission fully estimated the scope and appraised the effects of any resulting curtailment of competition and concluded that the proposed acquisition and plan of operation would not result in any significant lessening of competition; and this determination rests upon adequate findings, supported by substantial evidence, and is well within the limits of the Commission's discretion under the Act. Pp. 185-189.\n\n\n (a) Although 5 (11) does not authorize the Commission to \"ignore\" the antitrust laws, it does authorize the Commission to approve acquisitions which might otherwise violate the antitrust laws, if it finds that such acquisitions are in the public interest, and, upon approval of the acquisitions by the Commission, it relieves the acquiring carriers from the operation of the antitrust laws. Pp. 185-187.\n\n\n (b) As respects railroad acquisitions, the Commission is not so bound by the antitrust laws that it must permit them to overbear what it finds to be in the public interest, and the wisdom and experience of the Commission, not of the courts, must determine whether the proposed acquisition is in the public interest. Pp. 187-188.\n\n\n (c) The Commission gave extensive consideration to this contention of appellants and determined that the acquisition of Western by Santa Fe and Pennsylvania and their plan of operation of Western would not result in any significant lessening of competition; and that determination was based upon adequate findings, supported by substantial evidence, and was well within the limits of the Commission's discretion under the Act. Pp. 188-189.\n\n\n 3. Notwithstanding appellants' contention that Pennsylvania actually contracted to purchase 50% of Western's stock from a trust company which had four common directors with Pennsylvania and that such purchase would violate 10 of the Clayton \n\n[361 \nU.S. 173, 175]\n\u00a0\n Act, the Commission's action in approving Pennsylvania's acquisition of the stock, after fully considering all factors bearing thereon, did not exceed the statutory limits of the Commission's discretion. Pp. 189-191.\n\n\n 4. Whether or not 5 (11) operates only in futuro is immaterial in this case, since the existing contractual arrangements through which Pennsylvania asked authority to acquire 50% of Western's stock looked entirely to the future. Pp. 191-192.\n\n\n 5. Notwithstanding appellants' contention that the Commission violated 8 (b) of the Administrative Procedure Act by failing to make findings which, they think, were compelled by the evidence, the record discloses that the Commission made adequate subsidiary findings upon all material issues and made the ultimate findings required by 5 (2), that they support the Commission's order and that they are, in turn, supported by substantial evidence. Pp. 192-194.\n\n\n 6. The District Court fairly considered and decided all of the issues raised by appellants, accorded to them a full and fair judicial review, and reached a right result. P. 194.\n\n\n 165 F. Supp. 893, affirmed.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Together with No. 27, South Dakota et al. v. United States et al., and No. 28, Minnesota et al. v.

Lucas for the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Co. et al.; and Robert H. Walker for certain municipalities and shippers et al., appellees.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThese appeals present questions arising out of rival applications by several rail carriers to the Interstate Commerce Commission under 5 (2) of the Interstate Commerce Act\n1\n for authority to acquire control of Toledo, Peoria & Western Railroad Company. \n\n[361 \nU.S. 173, 177]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\"Western\" is an independent, short-line \"bridge carrier\"\n2\n of through east-west traffic by-passing the congested Chicago gateway. Its line is about 234 miles long, extending from its connection with the Pennsylvania Railroad Company (\"Pennsylvania\") at Effner, on the Illinois-Indiana state line, westward, through Peoria, to its connection with the main line of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Company (\"Santa Fe\") at Lomax, Illinois, and thence southwesterly a short distance to Keokuk, Iowa. Its headquarters, shops and yards are located in East Peoria where it has 24 executives and where, and elsewhere along its line, it has about 225 other employees. It has connections for the interchange of traffic with 16 railroads, the principal ones being with the Pennsylvania at Effner, with the Santa Fe at Lomax, and with the New York, Chicago & St. Louis Railroad Company (\"Nickel Plate\"), the Illinois Terminal Railroad Company, the \n\n[361 \nU.S. 173, 178]\n\u00a0\n Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad Company (\"Burlington\") and the Minneapolis & St. Louis Railway Company (\"Minneapolis\") at Peoria. Its interchange connections with the other 10 railroads are at 17 other towns along its line.\n\n\n Western has outstanding 90,000 shares of common capital stock, 82% of which is owned by the testamentary trustees of the estate of George P. McNear - Wilmington Trust Company and Guy Gladson - and the remaining 18% is owned by members of the McNear family, a bank and the president of Western. In 1954, the trustees determined to sell their Western stock, and rival efforts were commenced by Minneapolis, on the one hand, and by the Santa Fe and Pennsylvania, on the other hand, to purchase it. (Four of Wilmington Trust Company's directors were also directors of Pennsylvania.) Those negotiations culminated in a contract between the trustees and the Santa Fe, dated May 26, 1955, providing for the sale by the former and purchase by the latter of the stock at a price of $135 per share, subject to the Commission's approval.\n3\n Soon afterward, like agreements \n\n[361 \nU.S. 173, 179]\n\u00a0\n were made by the Santa Fe with the holders of the remaining 18% of the Western stock.\n\nOn June 28, 1955, the Santa Fe entered into a contract to sell to the Pennsylvania Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Pennsylvania, 50% of the outstanding capital stock of Western at $135 per share,\n4\n subject to approval of the Commission.\n\nOn July 8, 1955, the Santa Fe and Pennsylvania Company and its parent, Pennsylvania, applied to the Commission under 5 (2) of the Act\n5\n for approval of \n\n[361 \nU.S. 173, 180]\n\u00a0\n those stock purchase agreements and the consequent joint control of Western. The Minneapolis intervened and objected to the application, as did also the States of Minnesota and South Dakota and their respective public service regulatory commissions.\n\nThereafter, on October 13, 1955, the Minneapolis applied to the Commission, under the same section of the Act, for authority to acquire sole control of Western, expressing its willingness to enter into contracts with Western's stockholders to purchase their stock at the same price and on the same terms as set forth in their existing contracts with the Santa Fe. The Santa Fe, the Pennsylvania Company and Pennsylvania intervened in the latter proceeding and objected to the Minneapolis application.\n\nOn motion of Minneapolis, the Commission consolidated the two proceedings. Thereafter, seven other railroads having interchange connections with Western's line intervened. Two of them sought authority, at all events,\n6\n and two others of them sought authority, under stated conditions,\n7\n to participate, under 5 (2) (d) of the Act. \n\n[361 \nU.S. 173, 181]\n\u00a0\n in the acquisition of the Western stock on an equal basis with the successful applicant. The State of Illinois, 18 cities or towns and seven chambers of commerce located on or along Western's line, two labor organizations representing Western's employees, and a large number of shippers over Western's line, intervened in support of the Santa Fe-Pennsylvania application and in opposition to the Minneapolis application.\n\nAfter an extended consolidated hearing before him, the Commission's examiner issued a proposed report recommending approval of the Santa Fe-Pennsylvania application and dismissal of the Minneapolis application. Thereafter, upon exceptions, and briefs and arguments in their support, Division 4 of the Commission issued its report. It was confronted, as it said, with four alternative proposals, (1) for authorization of joint control of Western by the Santa Fe and Pennsylvania, (2) for authorization of sole control by the Minneapolis, (3) for authorization of two other railroads, at all events, and of two more railroads, under stated conditions, to participate in the acquisition of the Western stock on an equal basis with the successful applicant,\n8\n and (4) denial of both applications.\n\nThe Commission observed that \"[t]hese proceedings represent a new and more complicated phase in the administration of section 5, since [they involve] 2 applications for authority to control the same property, and petitions by 4 other carriers for inclusion in the transaction under varying circumstances.\" It recognized that, under 5 (2) \n\n[361 \nU.S. 173, 182]\n\u00a0\n of the Act and the National Transportation Policy,\n9\n it was required to \"weigh whether each application is consistent with the public interest, with or without inclusion of other railroads, considering not only other intervening petitioners seeking such inclusion but also the other applicant and nonparticipating railroads as well.\" It thought that the burden of proof was \"most heavy for an applicant in a proceeding like this, because it must not only overbalance the claims of those seeking to share in the control but also of those seeking to exclude it from the transaction.\" It conceived it to be its duty, under the Act and the National Transportation Policy, to \"arrive at a standard of public interest and determine which of the various plans of control most nearly approximates it.\"\n\nThe Commission found that the Santa Fe-Pennsylvania plan contemplates that Western \"will continue to be operated as a separate and independent carrier with responsible management located along its lines\"; that it \"will continue to maintain its own solicitation forces and will be entirely free to solicit traffic in such manner as best to serve the interests of the Western,\" and that all \"existing routes and channels of trade via the Western will be maintained and kept open without discrimination between connecting lines of railroad.\" It found, on the other hand, that the Minneapolis plan \"unequivocally contemplates the disappearance of the Western as an independent and neutral connection for the other 15 carriers with which it presently works\"; that \"[f]or all practical purposes the Western would be integrated, consolidated, and merged into the Minneapolis for ownership, management, and operation\"; that features of the Minneapolis plan \"would be extremely harmful to other carriers\"; that Western's headquarters office at Peoria would be eliminated, leaving only a trainmaster and a roadmaster at \n\n[361 \nU.S. 173, 183]\n\u00a0\n that point, and that the employment of most of Western's 24 executives and 225 other employees would be severed.\n\nThe Commission further found that \"[o]nly the Minneapolis and its supporting interveners, the States of Minnesota and South Dakota, advocate the disappearance of the Western as a separate and independent operating carrier,\" and that all other parties to, and intervenors in, the proceedings \"insist that the separate and independent operation of the Western under its present local management is a public necessity.\" It then found that the \"[p]ublic interest demands that the present policies of the Western in all respects be continued.\" It thereupon made the ultimate finding, required by 5 (2) (b) of the Act, that the acquisition and plan of operation by the Santa Fe and Pennsylvania, subject to stated conditions, was \"within the scope of section 5 (2) of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended; that the terms and conditions proposed [by them] are just and reasonable, and that the transaction will be consistent with the public interest.\" The Commission then entered its order approving the Santa Fe-Pennsylvania application, dismissing the Minneapolis application, and denying the petitions of the several intervening railroads which sought to participate in the acquisition of the Western stock. 295 I. C. C. 523.\n\nThereafter, Minneapolis petitioned the whole Commission for a reconsideration, and alternatively requested that, if the approval of the Santa Fe-Pennsylvania application be permitted to stand, it be authorized to participate equally with those railroads in the purchase of Western's stock on the same terms. That petition was denied.\n\nMinneapolis then timely filed a complaint in the District Court for Minnesota against the United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission to vacate the Commission's order. The States of Minnesota and South Dakota and their respective regulatory commissions. \n\n[361 \nU.S. 173, 184]\n\u00a0\n being interested in strengthening the Minneapolis, which operates in those States, intervened in support of the complaint. The defendants answered, asserting the full legality of the Commission's order. The Santa Fe, the Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania Company, the State of Illinois, the 18 cities and seven chambers of commerce and the numerous shippers who were intervenors before the Commission, intervened in opposition to the complaint. The Nickel Plate intervened, complaining that the Commission had improperly denied its request to participate in the purchase of the Western stock.\n\nA three-judge court was convened and, after hearing, rendered its opinion and judgment sustaining the Commission's order. 165 F. Supp. 893. On separate appeals by the Minneapolis, the State of Minnesota and its regulatory commission, and the State of South Dakota and its regulatory commission, the case was brought here and we noted probable jurisdiction. \n359 \nU.S. 933\n. All of those who were defendants and intervenors in opposition to the complaint in the District Court, except the Nickel Plate, are appellees in this Court.\n\nMinneapolis, supported by the States of Minnesota and South Dakota, contends, first, that the Commission improperly adopted at the outset of its report the standard of \"separate and independent management\" of Western as the criterion governing the comparative merits of the rival plans, which was antithetic to its application, and thereby deprived it of \"fair comparative consideration,\" and that the District Court erred in approving the Commission's action.\n\nThe record does not support that contention. Rather, it shows that the Commission's governing standard was the \"public interest,\" although it ultimately did find that the public interest would be best served by Western's continued operation as a \"separate and independent carrier.\" We believe that the recited findings show that the Commission \n\n[361 \nU.S. 173, 185]\n\u00a0\n carefully \"weighed\" and considered \"each application\" in its labors to determine which, if either, of them was \"consistent with the public interest.\" Its subsidiary findings (a) that the Minneapolis plan \"unequivocally contemplates the disappearance of the Western as an independent and neutral connection for the other 15 carriers with which it presently works,\" (b) that certain features of the Minneapolis plan \"would be extremely harmful to other carriers,\" (c) that the Minneapolis plan contemplates the elimination of Western's office and the separation of its employees, and (d) that numerous witnesses insisted \"that the separate and independent operation of the Western under its present local management is a public necessity,\" fully support its conclusional finding that the \"[p]ublic interest demands that the present policies of the Western in all respects be continued.\" That finding, though antithetic to Minneapolis' application, did not deprive it of \"fair comparative consideration,\" but, on the contrary, it seems to us, was made by the Commission after full and fair consideration, and the District Court did not err in so holding.\n\nAppellants' principal contention appears to be that acquisition of control of Western by Santa Fe and Pennsylvania will create a combination in restraint of commerce in violation of 1 of the Sherman Act\n10\n and will lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in violation of 7 of the Clayton Act,\n11\n and that the Commission's approval of their application was an abuse of power.\n\nOn their face these contentions would seem to run in the teeth of the language and purpose of 5 (11) of the Interstate Commerce Act. That section, in substance, provides that \"The authority conferred by this section shall be exclusive and plenary, and any carrier or corporation \n\n[361 \nU.S. 173, 186]\n\u00a0\n participating in . . . any transaction approved by the Commission thereunder, shall have full power . . . to carry such transaction into effect and to own and operate any properties and exercise any control or franchises acquired through said transaction . . . and any carriers . . . participating in a transaction approved or authorized under the provisions of this section shall be and they are hereby relieved from the operation of the antitrust laws and of all other restraints, limitations, and prohibitions of law . . . insofar as may be necessary to enable [it] to carry into effect the transaction so approved or provided for in accordance with the terms and conditions, if any, imposed by the Commission, and to hold, maintain, and operate any properties and exercise any control or franchises acquired through such transaction.\" 24 Stat. 380, as amended, 54 Stat. 908, 49 U.S.C. 5 (11).\n\nSection 5 (11) is both a more recent and a more specific expression of congressional policy than 1 of the Sherman Act and 7 of the Clayton Act, and in terms relieves the acquiring carrier, upon approval by the Commission of the acquisition, \"from the operation of the antitrust laws . . . .\" Although 5 (11) does not authorize the Commission to \"ignore\" the antitrust laws, McLean Trucking Co. v. United States, \n321 \nU.S. 67, 80\n, there can be \"little doubt that the Commission is not to measure proposals for [acquisitions] by the standards of the antitrust laws.\" \n321 \nU.S., at 85\n-86. The problem is one of accommodation of 5 (2) and the antitrust legislation. The Commission remains obligated to \"estimate the scope and appraise the effects of the curtailment of competition which will result from the proposed [acquisition] and consider them along with the advantages of improved service [and other matters in the public interest] to determine whether the [acquisition] will assist in effectuating the over-all transportation policy.\" \n321 \nU.S., at 87\n. \n\n[361 \nU.S. 173, 187]\n\u00a0\n\n\nEven though such acquisitions might otherwise violate the antitrust laws, Congress has authorized the Commission to approve them, if it finds they are in the public interest, \"because it recognized that in some circumstances they were appropriate for effectuation of the national transportation policy. It was informed that this policy would be furthered by `encouraging the organization of stronger units' in the . . . industry. And in authorizing those [acquisitions] it did not import the general policies of the anti-trust laws as a measure of their permissibility. It in terms relieved participants in appropriate [acquisitions] from the requirements of those laws. 5 (11).\" \n321 \nU.S., at 85\n. It must be presumed that, in enacting this legislation, Congress took account of the fact that railroads are subject to strict regulation and supervision. \"Against this background, no other inference is possible but that, as a factor in determining the propriety of [railroad acquisitions] the preservation of competition among carriers, although still a value, is significant chiefly as it aids in the attainment of the objectives of the national transportation policy.\" \n321 \nU.S., at 85\n-86.\n\nAs respects railroad acquisitions, the Commission is not so bound by the antitrust laws that it must permit them to overbear what it finds to be in \"the public interest.\" A contrary view would, in effect, permit the Commission to authorize only those acquisitions which would not offend those laws. \"As has been said, this would render meaningless the exemption relieving the participants in a properly approved [acquisition] of the requirements of those laws . . . .\" \n321 \nU.S., at 86\n. Resolution of the conflicting considerations \"is a complex task which requires extensive facilities, expert judgment and considerable knowledge of the transportation industry. Congress left that task to the Commission `to the end that the wisdom and experience of that Commission may be used not only in connection with this form of transportation, \n\n[361 \nU.S. 173, 188]\n\u00a0\n but in its coordination of all other forms.' 79 Cong. Rec. 12207. `The wisdom and experience of that commission,' not of the courts, must determine whether the proposed [acquisition] is `consistent with the public interest.' Cf. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Illinois Central R. Co., \n215 \nU.S. 452\n; Pennsylvania Co. v. United States, \n236 \nU.S. 351\n; United States v. Chicago Heights Trucking Co., \n310 \nU.S. 344\n; Purcell v. United States, \n315 \nU.S. 381\n.\" \n321 \nU.S., at 87\n-88.\n\nHere, the Commission gave extensive consideration to the anti-competitive contentions advanced by appellants, devoting more than five pages of its report to that matter. It found that \"[a]ll the carriers endeavoring to participate in its control are in competition with Western\"; that the \"important thing is not whether there is possibility of competition, but whether there is probability of existing or potential competition being diminished or strangled by the Western under the control of the Santa Fe and the Pennsylvania.\" After an extended analysis of the complex facts and conflicting evidence, the Commission found that control of Western by the Santa Fe and Pennsylvania would not result in any significant lessening of competition. It pointed to the fact that although the Santa Fe's \"long haul\" is to Chicago and the Pennsylvania's \"next to longest haul\" is also to Chicago (its longest haul being to St. Louis) the Santa Fe has agreed, and is bound, \"to place Lomax on a parity with Chicago from a solicitation standpoint, and . . . the Pennsylvania will recognize Effner as one of its principal interchanges along with Chicago and St. Louis\"; that \"there may be some diversion of traffic, but such diversion would not jeopardize the maintenance of adequate transportation service by the objecting intervening carriers.\"\n\nThe Commission also pointed to the fact that Western had been in a prolonged receivership until 1927 when George P. McNear acquired its stock at a receiver's sale, \n\n[361 \nU.S. 173, 189]\n\u00a0\n Toledo, P. & W. R. Co. Acquisition, 124 I. C. C. 181. It further found that Western's modern existence began at that time and, under the guidance of McNear, was built into a fine railroad; that since McNear's death, in 1947, the present management has continued, with much success, the policies he established. Those policies, the Commission found, were, and are, \"to maintain strict neutrality between all connections, and to participate in any haul of traffic no matter how slight [as a bridge] carrier through Peoria as an alternative route, bypassing the congested terminals of Chicago and St. Louis,\" and that those policies are to be continued under the Santa Fe-Pennsylvania plan.\n\nWe think it is clear from this summary of its analysis and findings that the Commission fully estimated the scope and appraised the effects of any curtailment of competition which might result from the acquisition of Western by the Santa Fe and Pennsylvania, and, after having done so, concluded that their acquisition and plan of operation of Western would not result in any significant lessening of competition. Congress has left the task of making that determination to the wisdom and experience of the Commission. The determination it has made rests upon adequate findings which are, in turn, supported by substantial evidence and is well within the limits of its discretion under the Act.\n\nAppellants argue that the Pennsylvania, in actuality, contracted to purchase 50% of the Western stock from Wilmington Trust Company, a co-trustee of the McNear trust, and that, since four persons were directors of both companies, that proposed stock purchase violates 10 of the Clayton Act; that the Commission was without power to approve it; that, in any event, its action in \"condoning\" it was an abuse of power; and that the District Court, for those reasons also, erred in upholding the Commission's order. \n\n[361 \nU.S. 173, 190]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Commission found that the Santa Fe in entering into the contract of May 26, 1955, with the trustees of the McNear trust was \"acting on behalf of that carrier alone.\" But even if we assume, for present purposes, that it was acting as well for the Pennsylvania, the result must be the same. Section 10 of the Clayton Act prohibits a common carrier engaged in commerce from having \"any dealings in securities\" of more than $50,000, in the aggregate, in any one year, \"with another corporation, . . . when the said common carrier shall have upon its board of directors . . . any person who is at the same time a director [of] such other corporation . . ., except such purchases [as] shall be made . . . by competitive bidding under regulations to be prescribed by [the] Commission.\" 38 Stat. 734, 15 U.S.C. 20.\n\nSection 10 of the Clayton Act is, of course, an antitrust law,\n12\n and much of what we have just said relative to the problem of accommodation of 5 (2) of the Interstate Commerce Act and the antitrust laws is equally applicable to this contention. The evident purpose of 10 of the Clayton Act was to prohibit a corporation from abusing a carrier by palming off upon it securities, supplies and other articles without competitive bidding and at excessive prices through overreaching by, or other misfeasance of, common directors, to the financial injury of the carrier and the consequent impairment of its ability to serve the public interest.\n13\n But, even if this purchase \n\n[361 \nU.S. 173, 191]\n\u00a0\n of securities might, under other circumstances, violate 10 of the Clayton Act, Congress, by 5 (11) of the Interstate Commerce Act, has authorized the Commission to approve it if it finds that so doing is in the public interest. And Congress has expressly said that, upon such approval, the carrier shall be relieved \"from the operation of the anti-trust laws . . . .\" A contrary view would, in effect, permit the Commission to authorize only those stock purchases which would not, in the absence of 5 (11), offend the antitrust laws. \"As has been said, this would render meaningless the exemption relieving the participants in a properly approved [acquisition] of the requirements of those laws . . . .\" McLean Trucking Co. v. United States, supra, at 86.\n\nHere, the Commission fully considered the contracts under which the Pennsylvania proposes to acquire a 50% interest in the Western stock and all other factors bearing on that matter and, after doing so, approved them. That action by the Commission did not exceed the statutory limits within which Congress has confined its discretion.\n\nMinneapolis contends that 5 (11) operates only in futuro and confers \"no authority to purge the taint of a transaction illegal at the time it was brought to the Commission.\" Whether there is merit in that contention, as a legal abstraction, we need not decide, for here the existing contractual arrangements through which Pennsylvania asks authority to acquire 50% of the Western stock look entirely to the future. Neither the stock sale and purchase contract between the trustees and the Santa Fe nor the one between the Santa Fe and the Pennsylvania \n\n[361 \nU.S. 173, 192]\n\u00a0\n Company is a consummated transaction, but each is expressly subject to, and will become effective only upon, approval by the Commission. Apart from criminal prosecutions, with which we are not here concerned, it seems plain that approval of an acquisition by the Commission operates under 5 (11), as that section says, to relieve the acquiring carrier \"from the operation of the antitrust laws . . . .\"\n\nAppellants next contend that the Commission violated 8 (b) of the Administrative Procedure Act by failing to make findings which, they think, were compelled by the evidence.\n\nThere can be no doubt that the Administrative Procedure Act applies to proceedings before the Commission, Riss & Co. v. United States, \n341 \nU.S. 907\n, and see Chicago & Eastern Illinois R. Co. v. United States, \n344 \nU.S. 917\n.\n\nThe last sentence of 8 (b) provides:\n\n\"All [administrative] decisions . . . shall become a part of the record and include a statement of (1) findings and conclusions, as well as the reasons or basis therefor, upon all the material issues of fact, law, or discretion presented on the record; and (2) the appropriate rule, order, sanction, relief, or denial thereof.\"\n14\n\u00a0\n\n\n Upon the basis of that language, appellants argue that the Commission should have found that the price which the Santa Fe agreed to pay for the Western stock of $135 per share was excessive. Though the Commission made no express finding upon that matter it did discuss it, pointing out that the certified value of Western's properties for ratemaking purposes was more than $13,500,000; that it has no outstanding preferred stock and is relatively free of debt; that it has a fine earning record; that the transaction was at arm's length; that Minneapolis had \n\n[361 \nU.S. 173, 193]\n\u00a0\n offered $133 per share for the stock within a few days of the time when the Santa Fe contracted for its purchase at $135 per share; and that the Minneapolis sought authority in this proceeding to acquire the stock at the same price. The Commission concluded that if $135 per share was a fair price for the one it was also for the other.\n\nUpon the same basis, appellants also argue that the Commission should have found that the Minneapolis application was in the public interest in that its acquisition of Western would greatly strengthen both Minneapolis and Western by eliminating many duplicating facilities and by reducing operating expenses by more than $1,770,000 annually. The Commission did not make a specific finding upon that matter, but it did give consideration to it and found that most of that saving - more than $1,300,000 annually - would be at the expense of Western's employees - a matter which, because of the express command of clause 4 of 5 (2) (c) of the Interstate Commerce Act (see note 1), it evidently thought was not consistent with the public interest. Appellants further argue that the Commission should have found that the Minneapolis plan afforded adequate protection to Western's employees by providing for their absorption into the Minneapolis as attrition among its own employees permitted. Again, although the Commission made no specific finding upon that contention it did consider and discuss it, and we think the law required no more.\n\nAppellants challenge the Commission's failure to make a number of other subsidiary findings, all of which have been considered, but we find that they relate to contentions that are so collateral or immaterial that the law did not require specific findings upon them. By the express terms of 8 (b), the Commission is not required to make subordinate findings on every collateral contention advanced, but only upon those issues of fact, law, or \n\n[361 \nU.S. 173, 194]\n\u00a0\n discretion which are \"material.\" From a thorough examination of the record, we are persuaded that the Commission has made adequate subsidiary findings upon all material issues and has made the ultimate findings required by 5 (2), that they support the Commission's order, and are, in turn, supported by substantial evidence.\n\nFinally, appellants contend that the District Court, because of inadequate subsidiary findings by the Commission, was unable to, or at least did not, afford them a proper judicial review, and merely \"rubber stamped\" the Commission's order. Whether or not we approve all of the reasons and legal conclusions of the District Court, it is clear that it fairly considered and decided all of the issues raised by appellants, accorded to them a full and fair judicial review, and reached a right result. Accordingly the judgment is\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE DOUGLAS dissents.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 5 (2) of the Interstate Commerce Act (24 Stat. 380, as amended, 54 Stat. 905, 49 U.S.C. 5 (2)) provides, in pertinent part, that: \"(a) It shall be lawful, with the approval and authorization of the Commission, as provided in subdivision (b) of this paragraph - \"(i) for . . . two or more carriers jointly, to acquire control of another through ownership of its stock or otherwise . . . . .  .   .  .   . \"(b) Whenever a transaction is proposed under subdivision (a) of this paragraph, the carrier . . . seeking authority therefor shall present an application to the Commission, and thereupon the Commission shall notify . . .

If the Commission shall consider it necessary in order to determine whether the findings specified below may properly be made, it shall set said application for public hearing; and a public hearing shall be held in all cases where carriers by railroad are involved unless the Commission determines that a public hearing is not necessary in the public interest. If the Commission finds that, subject to such terms and conditions and such modifications as it shall find to be just and reasonable, the proposed transaction is within the scope of subdivision (a) of this paragraph and will be consistent with the public interest, it shall enter an order approving and authorizing such transaction, upon the terms and conditions, and with the modifications, so found to be just and reasonable . . . . \"(c) In passing upon any proposed transaction under the provisions of this paragraph, the Commission shall give weight to the \n\n[361 \nU.S. 173, 177]\n\u00a0\n following considerations, among others: (1) The effect of the proposed transaction upon adequate transportation service to the public; (2) the effect upon the public interest of the inclusion, or failure to include, other railroads in the territory involved in the proposed transaction; (3) the total fixed charges resulting from the proposed transaction; and (4) the interest of the carrier employees affected. \"(d) The Commission shall have authority in the case of a proposed transaction under this paragraph involving a railroad or railroads, as a prerequisite to its approval of the proposed transaction, to require, upon equitable terms, the inclusion of another railroad or other railroads in the territory involved, upon petition by such railroad or railroads requesting such inclusion, and upon a finding that such inclusion is consistent with the public interest.  .   .  .   .  . \"(f) As a condition of its approval, under this paragraph, of any transaction involving a carrier or carriers by railroad subject to the provisions of this chapter, the Commission shall require a fair and equitable arrangement to protect the interests of the railroad employees affected. . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The term \"bridge carrier\" appears to mean a short-line carrier which transports through traffic from one long-line carrier to another.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] During the negotiations, Minneapolis first offered $69.50, and later $80, per share for the stock. On April 15, 1955, the Santa Fe and Pennsylvania each obtained letter commitments from the trustees for the sale to each of them of 26% of the Western stock at a price of $100 per share. (Near the same time the Rock Island made a like offer to the trustees for 26% of the Western stock, but that offer was not accepted.) But a dispute arose - and apparently still exists between the trustees and Pennsylvania - with respect to the validity of those commitments. Thereupon, Minneapolis offered the trustees $133 per share for the Western stock, but that offer was not accepted, and on May 26, 1955, the Santa Fe, acting, as the Commission found, \"on behalf of that carrier alone,\" agreed with the trustees for the sale by the latter and purchase by the former of all the Western stock held by the trustees at a price of $135 per share, and those parties on that date entered into a contract, accordingly, subject to approval of the Commission.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The contract of June 28, 1955, between the Santa Fe and the Pennsylvania Company provided that it was without prejudice to any claims, causes of action or rights which Pennsylvania may have against the trustees of the McNear estate with respect to the letter commitment of April 15, 1955, for the sale by the trustees to Pennsylvania of 26% of the Western stock; and that, in the event Pennsylvania should acquire from the trustees, under that letter commitment, all or any part of such shares, the obligation of the Santa Fe under the contract to sell Western shares to the Pennsylvania Company was to be reduced accordingly. It appears that litigation was then, and is yet, pending by Pennsylvania against the trustees for the enforcement of the letter commitment of April 15, 1955. The contract also contained a covenant which, in essence, provided that (1) Western \"will continue to be operated as a separate and independent carrier with responsible management located along its lines in order to preserve to shippers and communities the present direct access to its officials,\" (2) that Western's properties will be maintained and improved, (3) that Western \"will continue to maintain its own solicitation forces and will be entirely free to solicit traffic in such manner as best to serve the interests of\" Western, (4) that all \"existing routes and channels of trade via [Western] will be maintained and kept open without discrimination between connecting lines of railroad,\" and (5) that the Board of Directors of Western shall consist of 11 members, of whom one shall be the president of the company, two shall be officers of the Santa Fe, two shall be officers of the Pennsylvania Company, or Pennsylvania, or both, and the remaining six shall be prominent citizens not connected with either of the parties but selected by them through mutual agreement.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] See note 1.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The New York, Chicago & St. Louis Railroad Company (\"Nickel Plate\") and the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railroad Company (\"Rock Island\") sought authority, under 5 (2) (d) of the Act (see note 1), to be included in the acquisition of Western's stock on an equal basis with the successful applicant or applicants.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad Company (\"Burlington\") and the Wabash Railroad Company (\"Wabash\") did not object to approval of the Santa Fe-Pennsylvania application, provided the order required continuation of present routes and channels of trade via existing junctions and gateways and of all existing traffic and operating relations and arrangements, but they asked, in the event any railroad other than the Santa Fe and Pennsylvania be authorized to acquire an interest in Western's stock, that they, too, be authorized to participate therein to the same extent as any such other railroad. The Illinois Central Railroad Company (\"Illinois Central\"), the Gulf, Mobile & Ohio Railroad Company (\"Gulf\") and the Chicago & North Western Railway Company (\"North Western\") asked that, \n\n[361 \nU.S. 173, 181]\n\u00a0\n if either application be approved, the order be conditioned to require the maintenance of all routes and channels of trade via existing gateways. The Monon Railroad Company asked that if the Santa Fe-Pennsylvania application be approved, the order contain a requirement that Pennsylvania shall grant to it certain trackage rights, and, if not done, that the Santa Fe-Pennsylvania application be denied.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] See notes 6 and 7.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] 49 U.S.C., n. preceding 1, 54 Stat. 899.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] 15 U.S.C. 1, 26 Stat. 209.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] 15 U.S.C. 18, 38 Stat. 731.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] It is clear that 10 of the Clayton Act is included in the \"antitrust laws\" referred to in 5 (11) of the Interstate Commerce Act. Section 1 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. (1952 ed.) 12, provides that \"`Anti-trust laws,' as used in sections 12, 13, 14-21, and 22-27 of this title, includes sections 1-27 of this title.\" Moreover, 5 (11) avoids any ambiguity by including \"all other restraints, limitations, and prohibitions of law, Federal, State, or municipal.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] The legislative history of 10 of the Clayton Act, though meager, supports the view stated in the text. In fact, the language of the several drafts of 10, together with the types of abuses cited in \n\n[361 \nU.S. 173, 191]\n\u00a0\n support of its enactment, suggests strongly that the words \"dealings in securities\" were intended to cover only a carrier's dealings with related persons in its own securities.

JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner, the Secretary of Labor, brought suit to enjoin respondents from violating the overtime and record-keeping provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, 52 Stat. 1060, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 201 et seq. Respondents, two closely affiliated subsidiaries of a common corporate parent, share an office in Louisville, Kentucky. They are engaged in the business of making personal loans, in amounts up to $300, to individuals, and in purchasing conditional sales contracts from dealers in furniture and appliances. Respondents share the services of a common manager and nine full-time and two part-time employees.\n\nBy pretrial stipulation and concessions at trial, respondents in effect conceded that an injunction should issue \n\n[359 \nU.S. 290, 291]\n\u00a0\n unless their employees are exempted from the overtime and record-keeping provisions of the statute by 13 (a) (2) thereof, which provides that such requirements shall not apply to\n\n\". . . any employee employed by any retail or service establishment, more than 50 per centum of which establishment's annual dollar volume of sales of goods or services is made within the State in which the establishment is located. A `retail or service establishment' shall mean an establishment 75 per centum of whose annual dollar volume of sales of goods or services (or of both) is not for resale and is recognized as retail sales or services in the particular industry; . . .\"\n\n\n As concededly more than 50 percent of respondents' loan and discount business is with Kentucky residents and none of it involves \"resale\" transactions, the sole question involved in this litigation is whether respondents should be considered as \"retail or service establishment[s],\" engaged in the making of \"sales of goods or services,\" within the meaning of 13 (a) (2). The burden is, of course, upon respondents to establish that they are entitled to the benefit of the 13 exemption, since coverage apart from the exemption is admitted.\n\nAfter trial the District Court found that respondents had not proved that they are a \"retail or service establishment\" within the meaning of 13 (a) (2), and issued an injunction restraining respondents from further violating the Act. 150 F. Supp. 368. The Court of Appeals reversed. 254 F.2d 8. We granted certiorari, \n358 \nU.S. 811\n, to resolve the conflict between the decision of the court below and that of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Aetna Finance Co. v. Mitchell, 247 F.2d 190.\n\nUntil 1949, 13 (a) (2) exempted from the overtime and record-keeping provisions of the Fair Labor Standards \n\n[359 \nU.S. 290, 292]\n\u00a0\n Act \"Any employee engaged in any retail or service establishment the greater part of whose selling or servicing is in intrastate commerce.\" The Administrator early ruled that personal loan companies and other business entities in what may broadly be called the \"financial industry\" were not within the scope of that exemption.\n1\n When Congress amended the Act in 1949 it provided that pre-1949 rulings and interpretations by the Administrator should remain in effect unless inconsistent with the statute as amended. 63 Stat. 920. The narrow issue before us, then, is whether Congress in the 1949 amendment of 13 (a) (2) broadened the scope of that section so as to embrace personal loan companies.\n\nThe present 13 (a) (2) differs from its predecessor primarily in the addition of a definition of the term \"retail or service establishment,\" such an establishment being one \"75 per centum of whose annual dollar volume of sales of goods or services (or of both) is not for resale and is recognized as retail sales or services in the particular industry; . . .\" Respondents argue that they plainly come within this definition because (1) more than 75 percent of their loan and discount business is \"not for resale,\" and (2) their activities are recognized in the financial industry as being the \"retail end\" of that industry. They claim that the intent of Congress in the 1949 amendment was to provide that \"local\" business was exempt from the overtime requirements of the statute, and that their activities are precisely the kind the 13 exemption was designed to embrace.\n\nWe do not think the issue before us can be disposed of so simply. The Government points out that the concept of \"sale\" is inherently inapposite to the lending of money at interest, and urges that because respondents cannot \n\n[359 \nU.S. 290, 293]\n\u00a0\n properly be said to be engaged in the \"sale of goods or services\" the exemption cannot as to them come into play even if their activities are recognized as \"retail\" in the financial industry. Respondents concede that they are not engaged in the sale of \"goods,\" but insist that their activities do constitute a \"sale\" of a \"service\" within the intendment of 13 (a) (2), characterizing that \"service\" as credit or the use of money.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nThis is not a case where perforce we must attempt to resolve a controversy as to the true meaning of equivocal statutory language unaided by any reliable extrinsic guide to legislative intention. On the contrary, the debates and reports in Congress with reference to this section of the statute are detailed and explicit. To those legislative materials we now turn.\n\nThe legislative history of the 1949 amendment to 13 (a) (2) demonstrates beyond doubt that Congress was acting in implementation of a specific and particularized purpose. Before 1949 the Administrator, in interpreting the term \"retail or service establishment,\" then nowhere defined in the statute, had, in addition to excluding from the coverage of the exemption personal loan companies and other financial institutions, ruled that a business enterprise generally would not qualify as such an establishment unless 75 percent of its receipts were derived from the sale of goods or services \"to private persons to satisfy their personal wants,\" on the theory that sales for business use were \"nonretail.\"\n3\n This administratively announced \"business use\" test was generally approved by this Court in Roland Electrical Co. v. Walling, \n326 \nU.S. 657\n.\n\nCongress was dissatisfied with this construction of the statute, and over the objection of the Administrator, who \n\n[359 \nU.S. 290, 294]\n\u00a0\n sought to have his \"business use\" test legislatively confirmed,\n4\n passed the 1949 amendment to 13 (a) (2) to do away with the rule that sales to other than individual consumers could not qualify as retail in deciding whether a particular business enterprise was a \"retail or service establishment,\" and to substitute a more flexible test, under which selling transactions would qualify as retail if they (1) did not involve \"resale,\" and (2) were recognized in the particular industry as retail. We find nothing in the debates or reports which suggests that Congress intended by the amendment to broaden the fields of business enterprise to which the exemption would apply. Rather, it was time and again made plain that the amendment was intended to change the prior law only by making it possible for business enterprises otherwise eligible under existing concepts to achieve exemption even though more than 25 percent of their sales were to other than private individuals for personal consumption, provided those sales were not for resale and were recognized in the field or industry involved as retail.\n5\n Thus enterprises \n\n[359 \nU.S. 290, 295]\n\u00a0\n in the financial field, none of which had previously been considered to qualify for the exemption regardless of the class of persons with which they dealt, and regardless of whether they were thought of in the financial industry as engaged in \"retail financing,\" remained unaffected by the amendment of 13 (a) (2).\n\nAny residual doubt on this score is dispelled by the explicit and repeated statements of the sponsors of the amendatory legislation and in the House and Senate Reports to the effect that \"The amendment does not exempt banks, insurance companies, building and loan associations, credit companies, newspapers, telephone companies, gas and electric utility companies, telegraph companies, etc., because there is no concept of retail selling or servicing in these industries. Where it was intended that such businesses have an exemption one was specifically provided by the law . . . .\"\n6\n (Emphasis added.) It is well settled that exemptions from the Fair Labor Standards Act are to be narrowly construed. A. H. Phillips, Inc., v. Walling, \n324 \nU.S. 490, 493\n; see also \n\n[359 \nU.S. 290, 296]\n\u00a0\n Powell v. United States Cartridge Co., \n339 \nU.S. 497, 517\n. In the light of the abundant pointed evidence that Congress did not intend that businesses like those of respondents be exempted from the overtime and record-keeping provisions of the statute by 13 (a) (2), we would not be justified in straining to bring respondents' activities within the literal words of the exemption.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE STEWART took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Interpretative Bull.

We agree with the observation of the Court of Appeals in Aetna Finance Co. v. Mitchell, supra, at 193, that this contention is \"quite unconvincing.\" There is nothing which indicates that Congress was using the term \"credit companies\" in any specialized sense, and indeed one of respondents' own expert witnesses testified that personal loan companies are \"credit institutions.\" We think it clear that the House and Senate Conferees used \"credit companies\" to mean nothing more nor less than companies which deal in credit, as respondents concededly do. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 290, 297]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","123":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMITCHELL v. LUBLIN, McGAUGHY & ASSO.(1959)\nNo. 37\nArgued: October 21, 1958Decided: January 12, 1959\n\n\n\n\n The Secretary of Labor brought this action under 17 of the Fair Labor Standards Act to restrain respondent from violating the record-keeping and overtime provisions of the Act. Respondent is a firm of architects and engineers which designs public, industrial and residential projects and prepares plans and specifications for them. It has offices in Norfolk, Va., and Washington, D.C., and employs 65 or 70 persons. Many of its projects and clients are located outside of Virginia and the District of Columbia. Its fieldmen often travel across state lines, and its plans and specifications often are sent across state lines. Its draftsmen, fieldmen, clerks and stenographers all work intimately with plans and specifications prepared by respondent for the construction, repair, relocation and improvement of various interstate instrumentalities and facilities, including air bases, roads, turnpikes, bus terminals and radio and television installations. Held:\n\n 1. Respondent's non-professional employees are \"engaged in commerce\" as that term is used in 6 and 7 of the Act, and they are within the coverage of the Act. Pp. 208-213.\n\n\n  (a) The work done on plans and specifications for instrumentalities and facilities of interstate commerce is so directly and vitally related to their functioning as to be, in practical effect, a part of such commerce. P. 212.\n\n\n  (b) That a portion of respondent's business pertains to military bases or new construction does not require a different result. P. 213.\n\n\n  (c) The controlling factor is the activities of the individual employees, and the employees here involved are clearly \"engaged in commerce.\" P. 213.\n\n\n 2. In the circumstances of this case, injunctive relief would not appear to be improper as a matter of law; but it will be within the discretion of the District Court whether or not to issue an injunction after further proceedings on remand of the case. Pp. 213-215.\n\n\n 250 F.2d 253, reversed and case remanded for further proceedings. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 207, 208]\n\u00a0\n\n\nBessie Margolin argued the cause for petitioner. With her on the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Stuart Rothman and Jacob I. Karro.\n\nAlan J. Hofheimer argued the cause for respondents. With him on the brief was Robert C. Nusbaum.\n\nMilton F. Lunch filed a brief for the National Society of Professional Engineers, as amicus curiae, in support of respondents.\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner, the Secretary of Labor, brought this action under 17 of the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. 217,\n1\n to restrain respondent\n2\n from violating the record-keeping and overtime provisions of the Act. 29 U.S.C. 206, 207, 211. The complaint was dismissed basically on the lower court's conclusion that the activities of respondent, an architectural and consulting engineering firm, were local in nature and not within the Act's coverage. 250 F.2d 253. We granted certiorari, \n356 \nU.S. 917\n, to resolve an apparent conflict with a decision of another Court of Appeals in a similar case.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nRespondent is hired to design public, industrial and residential projects and to prepare plans and specifications \n\n[358 \nU.S. 207, 209]\n\u00a0\n necessary for their construction. It has offices in both Norfolk, Virginia, and Washington, D.C., and it employs some sixty-five or seventy persons. Respondent does considerable work for the armed services. The District Court estimated that approximately 60% of the work in the Norfolk office has been done for the Army Engineers or the Navy Department while 85% of the work in Washington has been performed for similar agencies or for subdivisions of local governments in the District and nearby States. Many of respondent's projects and clients are located outside Virginia and the District of Columbia. A typical project undertaken in the past was the design of a standard mobile Army warehouse with the attendant preparation of detailed plans and specifications. In addition, respondent has designed various construction projects including the widening of streets at a naval operating base, the extension and paving of airplane taxiways and parking aprons at a naval air station, a local sewerage system in Maryland, the alteration of various hangar facilities at military air bases, the relocation of radio and television facilities, the improvement of state roads and turnpikes, and the repair of government buildings at shipyards. The balance of respondent's activity has consisted of preparing plans and specifications for the construction of private projects such as homes, commercial buildings, bus terminals, shopping centers and the like. Respondent has performed certain supervisory functions in connection with the construction of some of the private projects but almost none where governmental agencies were involved.\n\nThe government contracts required respondent to produce plans and specifications, copies of which were sent by the governmental agencies to prospective bidders, many of whom were located outside Virginia and the District of Columbia. These plans consisted of drawings and designs and were supplemented by explanatory specifications \n\n[358 \nU.S. 207, 210]\n\u00a0\n which contained the information necessary for estimating cost and guiding contractors in bidding and construction. They were prepared under the supervision of respondent's professional members and associates by draftsmen employed by respondent. In many cases, the information necessary to prepare the plans and specifications was gathered on the site of the projects by fieldmen employed by respondent. These fieldmen included surveyors, transitmen and chainmen who often traveled across state lines to get to the projects. On one project, fieldmen from the Washington office went daily to nearby Maryland to gather data for a sewerage project. In addition to the draftsmen and fieldmen, various clerks and stenographers employed by respondent participated in the mechanical preparation of these plans and specifications.\n\nThe parties are agreed that respondent's professional employees - architects and engineers - are exempted from the coverage of the Act by 13 (a) (1), 29 U.S.C. 213 (a) (1).\n4\n Therefore, the Secretary's injunction action is directed at some fifty employees mentioned above: draftsmen, fieldmen, clerks and stenographers. The stenographers, in addition to their connection with the plans and specifications, manned respondent's private phone wire connecting the Norfolk and Washington offices, prepared and typed substantial numbers of letters concerning the described projects which were mailed to persons in places other than Virginia and the District of Columbia, and prepared payrolls in the Virginia office for employees at the Washington and Norfolk locations. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 207, 211]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe question at issue is whether these non-professional employees are \"engaged in commerce\" as that term is used in 6 and 7 of the Act, 29 U.S.C. 206, 207.\n5\n To determine the answer to this question, we focus on the activities of the employees and not on the business of the employer. Kirschbaum Co. v. Walling, \n316 \nU.S. 517\n; Walling v. Jacksonville Paper Co., \n317 \nU.S. 564\n; Mitchell v. Vollmer & Co., \n349 \nU.S. 427\n. We start with the premise that Congress, by excluding from the Act's coverage employees whose activities merely \"affect commerce,\" indicated its intent not to make the scope of the Act coextensive with its power to regulate commerce.\n6\n Kirschbaum Co. v. Walling, supra; McLeod v. Threlkeld, \n319 \nU.S. 491\n. However, within the tests of coverage fashioned by Congress, the Act has been construed liberally to apply to the furthest reaches consistent with congressional direction. Thus the Court stated in Overstreet v. North Shore Corp., \n318 \nU.S. 125, 128\n, \". . . the policy of Congressional abnegation with respect to occupations affecting commerce is no reason for narrowly circumscribing the phrase `engaged in commerce.'\"\n7\n\u00a0\n\n[358 \nU.S. 207, 212]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhere employees' activities have related to interstate instrumentalities or facilities, such as bridges, canals and roads, we have used a practical test to determine whether they are \"engaged in commerce.\" The test is \"whether the work is so directly and vitally related to the functioning of an instrumentality or facility of interstate commerce as to be, in practical effect, a part of it, rather than isolated, local activity.\" Mitchell v. Vollmer & Co., supra, at 429.\n8\n Coverage in the instant case must be determined by that test for, as the parties stipulated below, the draftsmen, fieldmen, clerks and stenographers all worked intimately with the plans and specifications prepared by respondent for the repair and construction of various interstate instrumentalities and facilities including air bases, roads, turnpikes, bus terminals, and radio and television installations. In our view, such work is directly and vitally related to the functioning of these facilities because, without the preparation of plans for guidance, the construction could not be effected and the facilities could not function as planned. In our modern, technologically oriented society, the elements which combine to produce a final product are diffuse and variegated. Deciding whether any one element is so directly related to the end product as to be considered vital is sometimes a difficult problem. But plans, drawings and specifications have taken on greater importance as the complexities of design and bidding have increased. Under the circumstances present here, we have no hesitancy in concluding that the preparation of the plans and specifications was directly related to the end products and that the employees whose activities were intimately related to such preparation were \"engaged in commerce.\" \n\n[358 \nU.S. 207, 213]\n\u00a0\n\n\nRespondent urges that military bases are not instrumentalities of commerce, but rather of war, and, in addition, that many of the projects involved new construction and hence cannot be considered as existing facilities or instrumentalities of interstate commerce. In answer to respondent's first point, it is sufficient to note that under the Court's reasoning in Powell v. United States Cartridge Co., \n339 \nU.S. 497\n, a facility designed for war may also be an instrumentality of commerce. See Mitchell v. H. B. Zachry Co., 127 F. Supp. 377. Here respondent's employees admittedly worked on plans and specifications relating to construction at military air bases. And it is not disputed that these bases are used for interstate commerce, at least to the extent that interstate flights both land at and take off from them, and men, materials, and mail move through them from distant points. Respondent's second objection must be rejected also. Whatever vitality the \"new construction\" doctrine retains after Mitchell v. Vollmer & Co., supra, and Southern Pacific Co. v. Gileo, \n351 \nU.S. 493, 500\n, it is not applicable here because, as the record shows, many projects involved the repair, extension, or relocation of existing facilities.\n\nRespondent contends that its activities are essentially local in nature. But as we stated, Congress deemed the activities of the individual employees, not those of the employer, the controlling factor in determining the proper application of the Act. Here the activities of the employees show clearly that they are \"engaged in commerce\" and thus are eligible for the protections afforded by the Act.\n\nAlthough not an issue below and not a matter of disagreement between the parties before this Court, some doubt has arisen whether injunctive relief is proper in this case. Examination of the record reveals that the controversy has been whether the admitted activities of respondent's employees during the period of the complaint \n\n[358 \nU.S. 207, 214]\n\u00a0\n brought them within the Act's coverage. Respondent does not appear ever to have urged that an injunction would be improper if, as a matter of law, its employees were \"engaged in commerce.\" Its position seems correct in light of the specific statutory provision, 17, 29 U.S.C. 217, which gives the District Courts jurisdiction to restrain violations of the Act. And the numerous suits brought by the Department of Labor under that section attest to the fact that the commencement of an injunction action, where coverage is in doubt, is not at all unusual. See, e. g., Mitchell v. Vollmer & Co., supra; Walling v. Jacksonville Paper Co., supra; Kirschbaum Co. v. Walling, supra; Mitchell v. Raines, 238 F.2d 186; Mitchell v. Feinberg, 236 F.2d 9; Chambers Construction Co. v. Mitchell, 233 F.2d 717.\n\nThe Act sets up four means for enforcement. Section 16 (a), 29 U.S.C. 216 (a), provides for criminal prosecution of willful violators. Section 16 (b), 29 U.S.C. 216 (b), gives individual employees rights of actions in civil suits to recover unpaid minimum wages, overtime compensation and certain liquidated damages. Section 16 (c), 29 U.S.C. 216 (c), allows the Secretary of Labor to bring such an action in behalf of such employees provided the suit does not involve \"an issue of law which has not been settled finally by the courts.\" Section 17, 29 U.S.C. 217, of course, provides for injunctions. Even a cursory examination of these provisions shows that the injunction is the only effective device available to the Secretary when coverage is in doubt and he wishes to establish the availability of the Act to employees not theretofore afforded its protections.\n\nWe fail to see what undue burden will be placed on respondent by the issuance of an injunction especially in view of the District Court's suggestion, to which both parties appear to have acquiesced, that if coverage premised on the admitted activities is established, the \n\n[358 \nU.S. 207, 215]\n\u00a0\n parties should have no trouble in deciding which of the employees are covered. In any event, upon proceedings on remand, it will still be within the discretion of the District Court whether or not to issue an injunction. If, for instance, respondent discloses its records, enters a stipulation concerning which employees are covered, and agrees not to violate the Act in the future, the District Court might conclude that an injunction is unnecessary. Compare Mitchell v. Bland, 241 F.2d 808, 810, with Chambers Construction Co. v. Mitchell, supra, at 725.\n\nThe judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the District Court for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n    It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"The district courts . . . shall have jurisdiction, for cause shown, to restrain violations of section 15 of this title. . . .\"\n\nSection 15 makes it unlawful to violate, inter alia, any of the provisions of 6, 7, 11 (c) and 11 (d), 29 U.S.C. 206, 207, 211 (c) and 211 (d).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The action was commenced against Lublin, McGaughy & Associates, a copartnership, Alfred M.

JUSTICE WHITTAKER, dissenting.\n\nWhile I am of the view that the evidence may be sufficient to show that some of respondents' employees at some times - namely, fieldmen when traveling interstate in gathering information needed for the preparation of architectural and engineering plans, and construction supervisors when actually supervising the repairing or remodeling of structures used in commerce - are \"engaged in commerce,\" within the meaning of 7 (a) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 207 (a), I am nevertheless persuaded that the evidence is not sufficient, and does not show conduct sufficiently continuous as to any category of employees, to justify the entry of a general injunction against respondents from, in effect, \"violating the law,\" thus requiring them to live under pain of contempt citation for violation of a general injunctive decree, while others live under the law of the land. I am further persuaded to this conclusion in the knowledge that such of these employees as can show that their particular work at a particular time rendered them \"engaged in commerce\" have a complete legal remedy \n\n[358 \nU.S. 207, 216]\n\u00a0\n under 16 (b) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. 216 (b), to recover overtime compensation plus an additional equal amount, attorneys' fees and costs. As I read its opinion, these are the factors that persuaded the Court of Appeals to affirm the District Court's denial of the prayed injunction, 250 F.2d 253, 260-261, and for those reasons I would affirm its judgment.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART, dissenting.\n\nWith the general principles stated in the Court's opinion there can be no dispute. Their application to the facts of the present case, however, does not lead me to the conclusion reached by the Court.

Livingston, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Alabama, et al., on motion for leave to file and petition for writ of mandamus.\n\n Having been led by both parties and the state of the record to treat as the sole issue before it on the merits the question whether Alabama could constitutionally compel petitioner to produce its membership lists in court, this Court reversed a decision of the Supreme Court of Alabama sustaining a conviction of contempt for failing to do so. \n357 \nU.S. 449\n. On remand of the case to the Supreme Court of Alabama for proceedings not inconsistent with the opinion of this Court, the State Supreme Court \"again affirmed\" the contempt conviction and fine which this Court had set aside - on the ground that this Court was \"mistaken\" in considering that petitioner had complied with the production order except as to its membership lists.

Webb, Assistant Attorney General, for respondent.\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\nThe petition for a writ of certiorari is granted.\n\nIn our original opinion in this case, \n357 \nU.S. 449\n, we held the Alabama judgment of civil contempt against this petitioner, together with the $100,000 fine which it carried, constitutionally impermissible in the circumstances disclosed by the record. We declined, however, to review the trial court's restraining order prohibiting petitioner from engaging in further activities in the State, that order then not being properly before us. \n357 \nU.S., at 466\n-467. Our mandate, issued on August 1, 1958, accordingly remanded the case to the Supreme Court of Alabama \"for proceedings not inconsistent with\" our opinion.\n\nIn due course the petitioner moved in the Supreme Court of Alabama that our mandate be forwarded to the Circuit Court of Montgomery County for the further proceedings which were left open by our decision. After the motion had been twice renewed\n1\n the Supreme Court of Alabama on February 12, 1959, \"again affirmed\" the contempt adjudication and $100,000 fine which this Court \n\n[360 \nU.S. 240, 242]\n\u00a0\n had set aside.\n2\n Finding that the Circuit Court had determined that petitioner had failed to \"produce the documents described\" in its production order, the State Supreme Court concluded that this Court was \"mistaken\" in considering that, except for the refusal to provide its membership lists, petitioner had complied, or tendered satisfactory compliance, with such order. This conclusion was considered as \"necessitating another affirmance of the [contempt] judgment,\" involving, so the State Court thought, matters not covered by the opinion and mandate of this Court.\n\nWe have reviewed the petition, the response of the State and all of the briefs and the record filed here in the former proceedings. Petitioner there claimed that it had satisfactorily complied with the production order, except as to its membership lists, and this the State did not deny. In fact, aside from the procedural point, both the State and petitioner in the certiorari papers posed one identical question, namely, had the petitioner \"the constitutional right to refuse to produce records of its membership in Alabama, relevant to issues in a judicial proceeding to which it is a party, on the mere speculation that these \n\n[360 \nU.S. 240, 243]\n\u00a0\n members may be exposed to economic and social sanctions by private citizens of Alabama because of their membership?\" (State's Brief in Opposition to Petition for Certiorari, p. 2.)\n3\n The State made not even an indication that other portions of the production order had not been complied with and, therefore, required its affirmance. On the contrary, the State on this phase of the case relied entirely on petitioner's refusal to furnish the \"records of its membership.\" That was also the basis on which the issue was briefed and argued before us by both sides after certiorari had been granted. That was the view of the record which underlay this Court's conclusion that petitioner had \"apparently complied satisfactorily with the production order, except for the membership lists,\" \n357 \nU.S., at 465\n.\n4\n And that was the premise on which the Court disposed of the case. The State plainly accepted this view of the issue presented by the record and by its argument on it, for it did not seek a rehearing or suggest a clarification or correction of our opinion in that regard.\n\nIt now for the first time here says that it \"has never agreed, and does not now agree, that the petitioner has complied with the trial court's order to produce with the exception of membership. The respondent, in fact, specifically denies that the petitioner has produced or offered to produce in all aspects except for lists of membership.\" This denial comes too late. The State is bound by its previously taken position, namely, that decision of the sole question regarding the membership lists, is dispositive of the whole case.\n\nWe take it from the record now before us that the Supreme Court of Alabama evidently was not acquainted \n\n[360 \nU.S. 240, 244]\n\u00a0\n with the detailed basis of the proceedings here and the consequent ground for our defined disposition. Petitioner was, as the Supreme Court of Alabama held, obliged to produce the items included in the Circuit Court's order. It having claimed here its satisfactory compliance with the order, except as to its membership lists, and the State having not denied this claim, it was taken as true.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nIn these circumstances the Alabama Supreme Court is foreclosed from re-examining the grounds of our disposition. \"Whatever was before the Court, and is disposed \n\n[360 \nU.S. 240, 245]\n\u00a0\n of, is considered as finally settled.\" Sibbald v. United States, 12 Pet. 488, 492. See also Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304; Tyler v. Magwire, 17 Wall. 253.\n\nThis requires that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alabama be reversed. Upon further proceedings in the Circuit Court, if it appears that further production is necessary, that court may, of course, require the petitioner to produce such further items, not inconsistent with this and our earlier opinion, that may be appropriate, reasonable and constitutional under the circumstances then appearing.\n\nWe assume that the State Supreme Court, thus advised, will not fail to proceed promptly with the disposition of the matters left open under our mandate for further proceedings, \n357 \nU.S., at 466\n-467, and, therefore, deny petitioner's application in No. 674, Misc., for a writ of mandamus.\n\n    It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE STEWART took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Petitioner's motion was first made on November 5, 1958, and was renewed, on November 19, 1958, and on December 1, 1958, by mailing to the Attorney General and filing with the Alabama Supreme Court copies of the original.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] In its previous order, on which the former proceeding here was based, the Alabama Supreme Court held that certiorari did not lie to review the merits of the contempt adjudication, and dismissed the original petition for certiorari on that ground, 265 Ala. 349, 91 So.2d 214. Its opinion on which the present proceedings are based includes this statement: \"Lest there be no misapprehension on the part of the bench and bar of Alabama, we here reaffirm the well recognized and uniform pronouncements of this Court with respect to the functions and limitations of common-law certiorari, and the distinctions between that and other methods of review. 265 Ala. 349, 91 So.2d 214, supra. As we stated in American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees v. Dawkins, 268 Ala. 13, 104 So.2d 827, 834: `We cannot hurdle or make shipwreck of well-known rules of procedure in order to accommodate a single case.'\" 268 Ala. 531, 532, 109 So.2d 138-139.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Question I in the petition for certiorari was as follows: \"Whether the refusal of petitioner to produce names and addresses of its Alabama members was protected by the Fourteenth Amendment's interdiction against state interference with First Amendment rights?\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See Note 5, infra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Indeed had the State denied this claim it would have raised additional serious constitutional issues. As we noted in our original opinion the contempt adjudication not only carried a fine of serious proportions, but under Alabama law it had the effect of foreclosing \"petitioner from obtaining a hearing on the merits of the underlying ouster action, or from taking any steps to dissolve the temporary restraining order which had been issued ex parte, until it purged itself of contempt.\" \n357 \nU.S., at 454\n. Yet upon the facts disclosed by the record, the validity of a contempt decree carrying these consequences would, apart from the refusal to produce the membership lists, have depended upon nothing more substantial than the reasonableness of the degree of petitioner's tendered compliance. For example, Item \"5\" of the production order called for: \"All files, letters, copies of letters, telegrams and other correspondence, dated or occurring within the last twelve months next preceding the date of filing the petition for injunction, pertaining to or between the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Inc., and persons, corporations, associations, groups, chapters and partnerships within the State of Alabama.\" Petitioner's tender was this: \"the files in the offices of respondent [petitioner] are filed under subject matter headings. Therefore, to comply with this paragraph would require respondent to search all of its files in order to secure all information requested. Respondent receives correspondence in its offices at the rate of 50,000 letters alone per year and files are maintained for a period of ten years. Respondent produces, however, all memoranda to branches during the twelve months period next preceding June 1, 1956, which would include its branches in the State of Alabama.\" \n\n[360 \nU.S. 240, 246]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","126":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nN.

Accordingly, the petition for a writ of certiorari is denied, leaving petitioner free to take further proceedings here when the judgment below becomes final or the jurisdiction of this Court may otherwise be appropriately invoked.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS.\n\nWith some doubts I bow to the conclusion that this judgment is not final within the meaning of the jurisdictional statute, 28 U.S.C. 1257. It ordered the petitioner to \"produce all its books, records and other data \n\n[359 \nU.S. 550, 551]\n\u00a0\n bearing on said corporation's income, disbursements and expenses prepared or used by said corporation in the conduct of its business during said taxable years wherever said business was transacted, whether within or without this state (except such as may be otherwise theretofore produced hereunder) . . . within thirty-five days . . . [and] that said corporation forthwith pay into the registry of the Clerk of this Court a fine of twenty-five thousand dollars, to be hereafter assessed and apportioned remedially and punitively, as shall appear just and appropriate to the Court, the Court reserving jurisdiction, after the production of the books, records and data hereby ordered, to reduce the amount of said fine if such should be just under the circumstances then existing.\"\n\nBy the terms of this judgment, the Georgia court reserves the power to reduce the amount of the fine. One question tendered by the petitioner would turn on the amount of the fine. It is the issue of \"cruel and unusual punishments\" which is outlawed by the Eighth Amendment that is in turn made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth, Francis v. Resweber, \n329 \nU.S. 459, 463\n. That is a subsidiary question and one that the State contends is not properly here because, it is said, no such assignment of error was included in the bill of exceptions.\n\nThe central issue in the case has nothing to do with the amount of the fine. It seems that the order to produce the records and the citation for contempt followed each other in a matter of a few hours. The basic question is whether holding petitioner in contempt and imposing any fine comported with that due process required of every government under our Bill of Rights. Were that question here alone, I would think the judgment was final. But since the issue of \"cruel and unusual punishment\" is also tendered and since a reduction of the fine may eliminate it from the case, I acquiesce in the denial of certiorari at this stage of the proceedings. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 550, 552]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","128":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNAPUE v.

Zola Graves, Assistant Attorneys General. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 264, 265]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nAt the murder trial of petitioner the principal state witness, then serving a 199-year sentence for the same murder, testified in response to a question by the Assistant State's Attorney that he had received no promise of consideration in return for his testimony. The Assistant State's Attorney had in fact promised him consideration, but did nothing to correct the witness' false testimony. The jury was apprised, however, that a public defender had promised \"to do what he could\" for the witness. The question presented is whether on these facts the failure of the prosecutor to correct the testimony of the witness which he knew to be false denied petitioner due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n\nThe record in this Court contains testimony from which the following facts could have been found. The murder in question occurred early in the morning of August 21, 1938, in a Chicago, Illinois, cocktail lounge. Petitioner Henry Napue, the witness George Hamer, one Poe and one Townsend entered the dimly lighted lounge and announced their intention to rob those present. An off-duty policeman, present in the lounge, drew his service revolver and began firing at the four men. In the melee that followed Townsend was killed, the officer was fatally wounded, and the witness Hamer was seriously wounded. Napue and Poe carried Hamer to the car where a fifth man, one Webb, was waiting. In due course Hamer was apprehended, tried for the murder of the policeman, convicted on his plea of guilty and sentenced to 199 years. Subsequently, Poe was apprehended, tried, convicted, sentenced to death and executed. Hamer was not used as a witness.\n\nThereafter, petitioner Napue was apprehended. He was put on trial with Hamer being the principal witness \n\n[360 \nU.S. 264, 266]\n\u00a0\n for the State. Hamer's testimony was extremely important because the passage of time and the dim light in the cocktail lounge made eyewitness identification very difficult and uncertain, and because some pertinent witnesses had left the state. On the basis of the evidence presented, which consisted largely of Hamer's testimony, the jury returned a guilty verdict and petitioner was sentenced to 199 years.\n\nFinally, the driver of the car, Webb, was apprehended. Hamer also testified against him. He was convicted of murder and sentenced to 199 years.\n\nFollowing the conviction of Webb, the lawyer who, as former Assistant State's Attorney, had prosecuted the Hamer, Poe and Napue cases filed a petition in the nature of a writ of error coram nobis on behalf of Hamer. In the petition he alleged that as prosecuting attorney he had promised Hamer that if he would testify against Napue, \"a recommendation for a reduction of his [Hamer's] sentence would be made and, if possible, effectuated.\"\n1\n The \n\n[360 \nU.S. 264, 267]\n\u00a0\n attorney prayed that the court would effect \"consummation of the compact entered into between the duly authorized representatives of the State of Illinois and George Hamer.\"\n\nThis coram nobis proceeding came to the attention of Napue, who thereafter filed a post-conviction petition, in which he alleged that Hamer had falsely testified that he had been promised no consideration for his testimony,\n2\n and that the Assistant State's Attorney handling the case had known this to be false. A hearing was ultimately held at which the former Assistant State's Attorney testified that he had only promised to help Hamer if Hamer's story \"about being a reluctant participant\" in the robbery was borne out, and not merely if Hamer would testify at petitioner's trial. He testified that in his coram nobis petition on Hamer's behalf he \"probably used some language that [he] should not have used\" in his \"zeal to do something for Hamer\" to whom he \"felt a moral obligation.\" The lower court denied petitioner relief on the basis of the attorney's testimony.\n\nOn appeal, the Illinois Supreme Court affirmed on different grounds over two dissents. 13 Ill. 2d 566, 150 N. E. 2d 613. It found, contrary to the trial court, that the attorney had promised Hamer consideration if he would testify at petitioner's trial, a finding which the State does not contest here. It further found that the Assistant State's Attorney knew that Hamer had lied in denying that \n\n[360 \nU.S. 264, 268]\n\u00a0\n he had been promised consideration. It held, however that petitioner was entitled to no relief since the jury had already been apprised that someone whom Hamer had tentatively identified as being a public defender \"was going to do what he could\" in aid of Hamer, and \"was trying to get something did\" for him.\n3\n We granted certiorari \n\n[360 \nU.S. 264, 269]\n\u00a0\n to consider the question posed in the first paragraph of this opinion. \n358 \nU.S. 919\n.\n\nFirst, it is established that a conviction obtained through use of false evidence, known to be such by representatives of the State, must fall under the Fourteenth Amendment, Mooney v. Holohan, \n294 \nU.S. 103\n; Pyle v. Kansas, \n317 \nU.S. 213\n; Curran v. Delaware, 259 F.2d 707. See New York ex rel. Whitman v. Wilson, \n318 \nU.S. 688\n, and White v. Ragen, \n324 \nU.S. 760\n. Compare Jones v. Commonwealth, 97 F.2d 335, 338, with In re Sawyer's Petition, 229 F.2d 805, 809. Cf. Mesarosh v. United States, \n352 \nU.S. 1\n. The same result obtains when the State, although not soliciting false evidence, allows it to go uncorrected when it appears. Alcorta v. Texas, \n355 \nU.S. 28\n; United States ex rel. Thompson v. Dye, 221 F.2d 763; United States ex rel. Almeida v. Baldi, 195 F.2d 815; United States ex rel. Montgomery v. Ragen, 86 F. Supp. 382. See generally annotation.\n\nThe principle that a State may not knowingly use false evidence, including false testimony, to obtain a tainted conviction, implicit in any concept of ordered liberty, does not cease to apply merely because the false testimony goes only to the credibility of the witness. The jury's estimate of the truthfulness and reliability of a given witness may well be determinative of guilt or innocence, and it is upon such subtle factors as the possible interest of the witness in testifying falsely that a defendant's life or liberty may depend. As stated by the New York Court of Appeals in a case very similar to this one, People v. Savvides, 1 N. Y. 2d 554, 557; 136 N. E. 2d 853, 854-855; 154 N. Y. S. 2d 885, 887:\n\n \"It is of no consequence that the falsehood bore upon the witness' credibility rather than directly upon defendant's guilt. A lie is a lie, no matter \n\n[360 \nU.S. 264, 270]\n\u00a0\n what its subject, and, if it is in any way relevant to the case, the district attorney has the responsibility and duty to correct what he knows to be false and elicit the truth. . . . That the district attorney's silence was not the result of guile or a desire to prejudice matters little, for its impact was the same, preventing, as it did, a trial that could in any real sense be termed fair.\"\n\n\n Second, we do not believe that the fact that the jury was apprised of other grounds for believing that the witness Hamer may have had an interest in testifying against petitioner turned what was otherwise a tainted trial into a fair one. As Mr. Justice Schaefer, joined by Chief Justice Davis, rightly put it in his dissenting opinion below, 13 Ill. 2d 566, 571, 150 N. E. 2d 613, 616:\n\n \"What is overlooked here is that Hamer clearly testified that no one had offered to help him except an unidentified lawyer from the public defender's office.\"\n\n\n Had the jury been apprised of the true facts, however, it might well have concluded that Hamer had fabricated testimony in order to curry the favor of the very representative of the State who was prosecuting the case in which Hamer was testifying, for Hamer might have believed that such a representative was in a position to implement (as he ultimately attempted to do) any promise of consideration. That the Assistant State's Attorney himself thought it important to establish before the jury that no official source had promised Hamer consideration is made clear by his redirect examination, which was the last testimony of Hamer's heard by the jury:\n\n \"Q. Mr. Hamer, has Judge Prystalski [the trial judge] promised you any reduction of sentence? \n\n[360 \nU.S. 264, 271]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \"A. No, sir.\n\n\n \"Q. Have I promised you that I would recommend any reduction of sentence to anybody?\n\n\n \"A. You did not. [That answer was false and known to be so by the prosecutor.]\n\n\n \"Q. Has any Judge of the criminal court promised that they [sic] would reduce your sentence?\n\n\n \"A. No, sir.\n\n\n \"Q. Has any representative of the Parole Board been to see you and promised you a reduction of sentence?\n\n\n \"A. No, sir.\n\n\n \"Q. Has any representative of the Governor of the State of Illinois promised you a reduction of sentence?\n\n\n \"A. No, sir.\"\n\n\n We are therefore unable to agree with the Illinois Supreme Court that \"there was no constitutional infirmity by virtue of the false statement.\"\n\nThird, the State argues that we are not free to reach a factual conclusion different from that reached by the Illinois Supreme Court, and that we are bound by its determination that the false testimony could not in any reasonable likelihood have affected the judgment of the jury. The State relies on Hysler v. Florida, \n315 \nU.S. 411\n. But in that case the Court held only that a state standard of specificity and substantiality in making allegations of federal constitutional deprivations would be respected, and this Court made its own \"independent examination\" of the allegations there to determine if they had in fact met the Florida standard. The duty of this Court to make its own independent examination of the record when federal constitutional deprivations are alleged is clear, resting, as it does, on our solemn responsibility for maintaining the Constitution inviolate. Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304; Cooper v. Aaron, \n358 \nU.S. 1\n. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 264, 272]\n\u00a0\n This principle was well stated in Niemotko v. Maryland, \n340 \nU.S. 268, 271\n:\n\n \"In cases in which there is a claim of denial of rights under the Federal Constitution, this Court is not bound by the conclusions of lower courts, but will reexamine the evidentiary basis on which those conclusions are founded.\"\n\n\n It is now so well settled that the Court was able to speak in Kern-Limerick, Inc., v. Scurlock, \n347 \nU.S. 110, 121\n, of the \"long course of judicial construction which establishes as a principle that the duty rests on this Court to decide for itself facts or constructions upon which federal constitutional issues rest.\"\n4\n As previously indicated, our own evaluation of the record here compels us to hold that the false testimony used by the State in securing the conviction of petitioner may have had an effect on the outcome of the trial. Accordingly, the judgment below must be\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In relevant part, his petition read as follows:\n\n\"After Hamer was sentenced your petitioner [the Assistant State's Attorney] well knowing that identification of Poe, Napue and Webb if and when apprehended would be of an unsatisfactory character and not the kind of evidence upon which a jury could be asked to inflict a proper, severe penalty, and being unable to determine in advance whether Poe, Napue and Webb would make confessions of their participation in the crime, represented to Hamer that if he would be willing to cooperate with law enforcing officials upon the trial of [sic] trials of Poe, Napue and Webb when they were apprehended, that a recommendation for a reduction of his sentence would be made and, if possible, effectuated.\n\n\n .   .  .  .  .\n\n\"Before testifying on behalf of the State and against Napue, Hamer expressed to your petitioner a reluctance to cooperate any further unless he were given definite assurance that a recommendation for reduction of his sentence would be made. Your petitioner, feeling that the interests of justice required Hamer's testimony, again assured Hamer that every possible effort would be made to conform to the promise previously made to him.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The alleged false testimony of Hamer first occurred on his cross-examination:\n\n\"Q. Did anybody give you a reward or promise you a reward for testifying?\n\n\n\"A. There ain't nobody promised me anything.\"\n\n\n On redirect examination the Assistant State's Attorney again elicited the same false answer.\n\n\"Q. [by the Assistant State's Attorney] Have I promised you that I would recommend any reduction of sentence to anybody?\n\n\n\"A. You did not.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The following is Hamer's testimony on the subject:\n\n\"Q. [on cross-examination] And didn't you tell him [one of Napue's attorneys] that you wouldn't testify in this case unless you got some consideration for it?\n\n\n\"A. . . . Yes, I did; I told him that.\n\n.  .  .   .  .\n\n\n\n\"Q. What are you sentenced for?\n\n\n\"A. One Hundred and Ninety-Nine Years.\n\n\n\"Q. You hope to have that reduced, don't you?\n\n\n\"A. Well, if anybody would help me or do anything for me, why certainly I would.\n\n\n\"Q. Weren't you expecting that when you came here today?\n\n\n\"A. There haven't no one told me anything, no more than the lawyer. The lawyer come in and talked to me a while ago and said he was going to do what he could.\n\n\n\"Q. Which lawyer was that?\n\n\n\"A. I don't know; it was a Public Defender. I don't see him in here.\n\n\n\"Q. You mean he was from the Public Defender's office?\n\n\n\"A. I imagine that is where he was from, I don't know.\n\n\n\"Q. And he was the one who told you that?\n\n\n\"A. Yes, he told me he was trying to get something did for me.\n\n\n\"Q. . . . And he told you he was going to do something for you?\n\n\n\"A. He said he was going to try to.\n\n.  .  .  .  .\n\n\n\n\"Q. And you told them [police officers] you would [testify at the trial of Napue] but you expected some consideration for it?\n\n\n\"A. I asked them was there any chance of me getting any. The man told me he didn't know, that he couldn't promise me anything.\n\n\n\"Q. Then you spoke to a lawyer today who said he would try to get your time cut?\n\n\n\"A. That was this Public Defender. I don't even know his name. . . .\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See, e. g., Payne v.

Held: The Florida statute, on its face, does not violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Art. IV, 2 of the Constitution nor the Privileges and Immunities or Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Pp. 3-12.\n\n 100 So.2d 149, reversed and cause remanded.\n\nReeves Bowen, Assistant Attorney General of Florida, argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief were Richard W. Ervin, Attorney General of Florida, and Frank S. Hogan.\n\nL. J. Cushman argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.\n\nJames C. Dezendorf and Louis A.

JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case is before us to determine the constitutionality of a Florida statute entitled \"Uniform Law to Secure the Attendance of Witnesses from Within or Without a State in Criminal Proceedings.\" Fla. Stat., 1957, 942.01-942.06. Respondent, a citizen of Illinois, had traveled to Florida to attend a convention. In accordance with the Florida statute, the Circuit Court of Dade County, Florida, responded to a certificate executed by a judge of the Court of General Sessions, New York County (under N. Y. Code Crim. Proc. 618-a), by summoning respondent before it to determine whether he was to be given into the custody of New York authorities to be transported to New York to testify in a grand jury proceeding in that State. The Circuit Court, ruling that the Florida statute violated the Florida and the United States Constitutions, refused to grant New York's request. 9 Fla. Supp. 153. The Supreme Court of Florida affirmed this decision on the ground that the statute violated the United States Constitution. 100 So.2d 149. We granted certiorari, \n356 \nU.S. 972\n, inasmuch as this holding brings into question the constitutionality of a statute now in force in forty-two States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. (Thirty-nine States and Puerto Rico joined in an amici brief in support of the Uniform Act.) The certificate filed with the Circuit Court of Dade County recites that respondent's testimony is desired by a New York County grand jury. That certificate is, under the terms of the statute, \"prima facie \n\n[359 \nU.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n evidence of all the facts stated therein.\" Fla. Stat., 1957, 942.02 (2). Therefore, on the face of the record, respondent's attendance at a grand jury investigation in New York is required by the certificate filed with the Florida court and not withdrawn from it. Neither party has suggested that this is not a live litigation nor do we find any ground for deeming the case to be moot.\n\nThe Uniform Act as enacted by the Florida Legislature in 1941 was formulated by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in its present form in 1936. See Handbook of the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws 333 (1936); 9 U. L. A. 91 (1957). The Uniform Act is reciprocal. It is operative only between States which have enacted it or similar legislation for compelling of witnesses to travel to, and testify in, sister States.\n\nThe terms of the statute make quite clear the procedures to be followed. The judge of the court of the requesting State files in any court of record in the State in which the witness may be found a certificate stating the necessity of the appearance of such witness in a criminal prosecution or grand jury investigation in the requesting State. The certificate must also state the number of days the witness would be required to attend. Upon receipt of such a certificate a hearing is held by the court in which it is filed. In the hearing, at which under the Florida Act the witness is entitled to counsel, the court which received this certificate is obliged to determine whether an order to attend the prosecution or grand jury investigation in the requesting State would comply with conditions set forth in the statute: that the witness is material and necessary; that the trip to the requesting State would not involve undue hardship to the witness; that the laws of the requesting State and States through which the witness must travel grant him immunity from arrest and the service of civil and criminal process. Furthermore, \n\n[359 \nU.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n the statute provides that the witness must be tendered ten cents a mile for each mile to and from the requesting State and five dollars for each day that he is required to travel and attend as a witness. Under the statute the order of the forwarding State to the witness may take two forms: first, the court may issue a summons directing the witness to attend and testify in the requesting State; second, if the certificate of the requesting State so recommends, and if the recommendation is found to be desirable by the court of the forwarding State, the court may immediately deliver the witness to an officer of the requesting State. Furthermore, if such a recommendation is made by the requesting State, instead of the initial notification of hearing the court of the forwarding State may take the witness into immediate custody. Whether the procedure be by notification and then summons or by apprehension and then delivery, the hearing and the issues to be determined therein are the same.\n\nIn Commonwealth of Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66, Mr. Chief Justice Taney, speaking of the obligation imposed by the Constitution upon the Governor of Ohio to deliver to Kentucky one accused of violation of the criminal laws of Kentucky, called attention \"to the obvious policy and necessity of this provision to preserve harmony between States, and order and law within their respective borders . . . .\" 24 How., at 103. The same \"policy and necessity\" underlie the measure adopted by Florida and forty-two other jurisdictions. Unless there is some provision in the United States Constitution which clearly prevents States from accomplishing this end by the means chosen, this Court must sustain the Uniform Act. The absence of a provision in the United States Constitution specifically granting power to the States to legislate respecting interstate rendition of witnesses presents no bar. To argue from the declaratory incorporation \n\n[359 \nU.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n in the Constitution, Art. IV, 2, of the ancient political policy among the Colonies of delivering up fugitives from justice an implied denial of the right to fashion other cooperative arrangements for the effective administration of justice, is to reduce the Constitution to a rigid, detailed and niggardly code. In adjudging the validity of a statute affecting a new form of relationship between States, the search is not for a specific constitutional authorization for it. Rather, according the statute the full benefit of the presumption of constitutionality which is the postulate of constitutional adjudication, we must find clear incompatibility with the United States Constitution. The range of state power is not defined and delimited by an enumeration of legislative subject-matter. The Constitution did not purport to exhaust imagination and resourcefulness in devising fruitful interstate relationships. It is not to be construed to limit the variety of arrangements which are possible through the voluntary and cooperative actions of individual States with a view to increasing harmony within the federalism created by the Constitution. Far from being divisive, this legislation is a catalyst of cohesion. It is within the unrestricted area of action left to the States by the Constitution.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Florida found that the statute violated the Privileges and Immunities Clauses found in Art. IV, 2, and in the Fourteenth Amendment. The Privileges and Immunities Clause of Art. IV, 2, proscribes discrimination by a State against a citizen of another State. Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 77. There is no such discrimination here. The Florida statute applies to all persons within the boundaries, and therefore subject to the jurisdiction, of Florida. The finding of the Florida Supreme Court that the right to ingress and egress is a privilege of national citizenship protected by the Fourteenth Amendment raises an issue that has more than once been stirred in opinions of this Court. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n See concurring opinions in Edwards v. California, \n314 \nU.S. 160, 178\n and 184, in connection with Crandall v. Nevada, 6 Wall. 35. However, even if broad scope be given to such a privilege, there is no violation of that privilege by the Florida statute. Florida undoubtedly could have held respondent within Florida if he had been a material witness in a criminal proceeding within that State. And yet this would not have been less of a limitation on his claim of the right of ingress and egress than is an order to attend and testify in New York. There are restrictions on the exercise of the claimed constitutional right. One such restriction derives from the obligation to give testimony. This obligation has been sustained where it necessitated travel across the Atlantic Ocean. Blackmer v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 421\n.\n*\n\u00a0\n\nMore fundamentally, this case does not involve freedom of travel in its essential sense. At most it represents a temporary interference with voluntary travel. Particularly is this so in an era of jet transportation when vast distances can be traversed in a matter of hours. Respondent was perfectly free to return to Florida after testifying in New York. Indeed, New York was obligated to pay his way back to Florida. Or, after testifying, he could return to Illinois or remain in New York. The \n\n[359 \nU.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n privilege of ingress and egress among the States which has been urged in opinions is of hardier stuff. The privilege was to prevent the walling off of States, what has been called the Balkanization of the Nation. The requirement which respondent resists conduces, it merits repetition, toward a free-willed collaboration of independent States.\n\nThe more relevant challenge to the statute invalidated by the Supreme Court of Florida is that it denies due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Because of the generous protections to be accorded a person brought or summoned before the court of the forwarding State, procedural due process in the hearing itself must be accorded and this is firmly established. The circuit Court of Dade County ruled that the absence of any provision for bail in the procedure of apprehension and delivery violated due process of law. Since the Supreme Court of Florida expressly refrained from ruling whether the failure of the statute to provide for bail for persons attached and delivered violated either the Florida Constitution or the Fourteenth Amendment, and since silence on bail is not tantamount to proscription of bail, the claim that this silence of the statute is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment is a hypothetical question which need not now be considered. We may add that the sole claim before us, as it was the sole claim dealt with by the Supreme Court of Florida, is that the statute is unconstitutional on its face. No claim is before us that the administration of the statute in the particular circumstances of this case violates due process.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Florida held that inasmuch as what was ordered was to be carried on in a foreign jurisdiction, the Florida courts could not constitutionally be given jurisdiction to order it (citing Pennoyer v. Neff, \n95 \nU.S. 714\n). However, the Florida courts had immediate personal jurisdiction over respondent by virtue of his \n\n[359 \nU.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n presence within that State. Insofar as the Fourteenth Amendment is concerned, this gave the Florida courts constitutional jurisdiction to order an act even though that act is to be performed outside of the State. See Steele v. Bulova Watch Co., \n344 \nU.S. 280\n; Restatement, Conflict of Laws, 94.\n\nThe primary purpose of this Act is not eleemosynary. It serves a self-protective function for each of the enacting States. By enacting this law the Florida Legislature authorized and enabled Florida courts to employ the procedures of other jurisdictions for the obtaining of witnesses needed in criminal proceedings in Florida. Today forty-two States and Puerto Rico may facilitate criminal proceedings, otherwise impeded by the unavailability of material witnesses, by utilizing the machinery of this reciprocal legislation to obtain such witnesses from without their boundaries. This is not a merely altruistic, disinterested enactment.\n\nIn any event, to yield to an argument that benefiting other States is beyond the power of a State would completely disregard the inherent implications of our federalism within whose framework our organic society lives and moves and has its being - the abundant and complicated interrelationship between national authority and the States, see Hopkins Federal Savings & Loan Assn. v. Cleary, \n296 \nU.S. 315\n, and between the States inter sese. To yield to this argument would foreclose to the States virtually all arrangements which increase comity among the States. These extra-constitutional arrangements are designed to solve \"problems created by a constitutional division of powers without disturbance of the federal nature of our government.\" Clark, Joint Activity Between Federal and State Officials, 51 Pol. Sci. Q. 230, 269. Reciprocal legislation, such as the Uniform Law to Secure the Attendance of Witnesses from Within or Without a State in Criminal Proceedings and the \n\n[359 \nU.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n Acts providing reciprocal periods of grace in the registration of out-of-state automobiles, see Kane v. New Jersey, \n242 \nU.S. 160\n, is one such arrangement. The uniform laws proposed by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and adopted by individual States have (among other benefits) increased ease of interstate commercial relationships by providing uniformity in commercial laws through uniform Acts governing sales and negotiable instruments. Uniform laws have frequently been concerned with enforcement of criminal laws. Thus, the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, 9 U. L. A. 263 (1957), provides for rendition of alleged criminals whose conduct does not bring them within the constitutional extradition provision. U.S. Const., Art. IV, 2; Hyatt v. People ex rel. Corkran, \n188 \nU.S. 691\n. There are numerous cooperative undertakings among States by the formation of agencies which study joint problems and make suggestions for internal management within individual States calculated to increase comity among the several States. Interstate preserves are regulated through the device of fusion of distinct state administrative agencies by means of joint sessions and joint action. The Federal Government has also acted in aid of States in matters of local concern through auxiliary legislation (in game statutes, for example), through grants-in-aid, and through legislation calling for cooperation between particular state administrative agencies and federal agencies operating within the same general area of regulation. See Frankfurter and Landis, The Compact Clause of the Constitution - A Study in Interstate Adjustments, 34 Yale L. J. 685, 688-691. About such instances it has been said that they \"illustrate extra-constitutional forms of legal invention for the solution of problems touching more than one state. They were neither contemplated nor specifically provided for by the Constitution.\" Frankfurter and Landis, supra, at 691. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe manifold arrangements by which the Federal and State Governments collaborate constitute an extensive network of cooperative governmental activities not formulated in the Constitution but not offensive to any of its provisions or prohibitions. See Clark, supra. Among the examples of such devices discussed by Dr. Clark are the Selective Service System, Civilian Conservation Corps, deportation law enforcement, administration of the Pure Food and Drugs Act and the federal game statutes, and federal-state contracts for the boarding of federal prisoners in state facilities.\n\nTo hold that these and other arrangements are beyond the power of the States and Federal Government because there is no specific empowering provision in the United States Constitution would be to take an unwarrantedly constricted view of state and national powers and would hobble the effective functioning of our federalism. Diffusion of power has its corollary of diffusion of responsibilities, with its stimulus to cooperative effort in devising ways and means for making the federal system work. That is not a mechanical structure. It is an interplay of living forces of government to meet the evolving needs of a complex society.\n\nThe Constitution of the United States does not preclude resourcefulness of relationships between States on matters as to which there is no grant of power to Congress and as to which the range of authority restricted within an individual State is inadequate. By reciprocal, voluntary legislation the States have invented methods to accomplish fruitful and unprohibited ends. A citizen cannot shirk his duty, no matter how inconvenienced thereby, to testify in criminal proceedings and grand jury investigations in a State where he is found. There is no constitutional provision granting him relief from this obligation to testify even though he must travel to another State to do so. Comity among States, an end particularly to be \n\n[359 \nU.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n cherished when the object is enforcement of internal criminal laws, is not to be defeated by an a priori restrictive view of state power.\n\nThe judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida is reversed and the cause is remanded to that court for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Compulsion to travel across State boundaries to testify in sister States antedates the United States Constitution. See Laws of Maryland, November 1785, Chapter I, An ACT to approve, confirm and ratify, the compact made by the commissioners appointed by the general assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the commissioners appointed by this state, to regulate and settle the jurisdiction and navigation of Patowmack and Pocomoke rivers, and that part of Chesapeake bay which lieth within the territory of Virginia: \"And in all cases of trial in pursuance of the jurisdiction settled by this compact, citizens of either state shall attend as witnesses in the other, upon a summons from any court or magistrate having jurisdiction, being served by a proper officer of the county where such citizen shall reside.\"\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK concurs, dissenting.\n\nThe right to free ingress and egress within the country and even beyond the borders is a basic constitutional right, though it is not contained in haec verba in the Constitution. It had been included in the Articles of Confederation, Article IV of which provided in part:\n\n \"The better to secure and perpetuate mutual friendship and intercourse among the people of the different states in this union, the free inhabitants of each of these states, paupers, vagabonds and fugitives from justice excepted, shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of free citizens in the several states; and the people of each state shall have free ingress and regress to and from any other state . . . .\"\n\n\n As Chafee, Three Human Rights in the Constitution (1956), p. 185, states, the failure to make specific provision for this right in the Constitution must have been on the assumption that it was already included. For it is impossible to think that a right so deeply cherished in the Colonies was rejected outright. \"The Convention carefully prevented states from passing tariff laws; surely it did not want state immigration laws.\" Chafee, op. cit., supra, at 185. The Constitution was designed \"to secure the freest intercourse between the citizens of the different \n\n[359 \nU.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n States,\" said Chief Justice Taney in The Passenger Cases, 7 How. 283, 492. And he added: \"For all the great purposes for which the Federal government was formed, we are one people, with one common country. We are all citizens of the United States; and, as members of the same community, must have the right to pass and repass through every part of it without interruption, as freely as in our own States.\" Id., 492. This right of free ingress and egress is one \"arising out of the nature and essential character of the Federal government.\" Duncan v. Missouri, \n152 \nU.S. 377, 382\n; Twining v. New Jersey, \n211 \nU.S. 78, 97\n. As stated by the Court in Williams v. Fears, \n179 \nU.S. 270, 274\n:\n\n \"Undoubtedly the right of locomotion, the right to  remove from one place to another according to inclination,  is an attribute of personal liberty, and the  right, ordinarily, of free transit from or through the  territory of any State is a right secured by the Fourteenth  Amendment and by other provisions of the  Constitution.\"\n\n\n It has often been called a right or privilege of national citizenship, Crandall v. Nevada, 6 Wall. 35, 44, 49; Ward v. Maryland, 12 Wall. 418, 430; Slaughter House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 79; Twining v. New Jersey, supra, 97; Edwards v. California, \n314 \nU.S. 160, 178\n-181, 183 (concurring opinions). As such, it is protected against state action by the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Slaughter House Cases, supra, at 74-79; In re Kemmler, \n136 \nU.S. 436, 448\n.\n\nIt has at times been considered under the protective care of the Commerce Clause subject to control by Congress but free from stoppage or impairment by the States. Edwards v. California, supra.\n\nIn Kent v. Dulles, \n357 \nU.S. 116\n, we held that this right to travel was a part of the citizen's \"liberty\" within \n\n[359 \nU.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n\n\"Freedom of movement across frontiers in either direction, and inside frontiers as well, was a part of our heritage. Travel abroad, like travel within the country, may be necessary for a livelihood. It may be as close to the heart of the individual as the choice of what he eats, or wears, or reads. Freedom of movement is basic in our scheme of values.\" Id., at 126.\n\n\n Whatever may be the sources of this right of free movement - the right to go to any State or stay home as one chooses - it is an incident of national citizenship and occupies a high place in our constitutional values.\n\nThis right of national citizenship has been qualified. One qualification was made by the Extradition Clause of Art. IV, 2, of the Constitution:\n1\n\u00a0\n\n \"A Person charged in any State with Treason, Felony, or other Crime, who shall flee from Justice, and be found in another State, shall on Demand of the executive Authority of the State from which he fled, be delivered up, to be removed to the State having Jurisdiction of the Crime.\"\n\n\n But that limitation on the right of free movement applies only when the citizen is a fugitive from the law.\n\nYet O'Neill is not a fugitive from justice. He carries no criminal taint. He is wanted as a witness in New York. But there is no provision of the Constitution which provides for the extradition of witnesses by the States. That power is today judicially created. But I find no authority on the part of the States to enlarge and expand the power of extradition specifically restricted by \n\n[359 \nU.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n the Constitution to criminals. As stated in People ex rel. Corkran v. Hyatt, 172 N. Y. 176, 182, 64 N. E. 825, 826, aff'd \n188 \nU.S. 691\n, \". . . no person can or should be extradited from one state to another unless the order falls within the constitutional provision, . . . power which independent nations have to surrender criminals to other nations as a matter of favor or comity is not possessed by the states.\" We allow today only what a constitutional amendment could achieve. We in effect amend Art. IV, 2, by construction to add \"witnesses\" to the group now embraced in Art. IV, 2.\n\nThis right of freedom of movement even of the innocent may not be absolute. Perhaps a State could stop a migrant at its borders for health inspection. There may be other narrow and limited qualifications to this right of free ingress and egress which a State may impose. But I know of no power on the part of a State to pick a citizen up and forcibly remove him from its boundaries where there is no basis of extradition. Blackmer v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 421\n, is of no help here. There the United States was requiring a citizen, resident abroad, to return to this country to testify and penalizing him for his refusal. This was his home, to which he was rooted and where his loyalties lay. The obligation was exacted by the Federal Government as a requirement of national citizenship. Congress has stated this responsibility in an Act, 62 Stat. 755, 18 U.S.C. 1073, which, inter alia, makes it a federal crime for a person to move in interstate commerce \"to avoid giving testimony\" in certain criminal proceedings. And Congress has made explicit provision concerning the State to which the witness may be removed.\n2\n I can understand how this regulation of national citizenship can \n\n[359 \nU.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n be made by Congress which speaks with authority in the federal field of interstate commerce.\n3\n I fail to see how a State can regulate any of the incidents of national citizenship. I see no greater power on the part of a State to snatch a law-abiding citizen from his abode and send him to another State than to stop him at the border, as was done in Edwards v. California, supra, because it does not like the cut of his jib. State action was precluded in Edwards v. California, supra, even though Congress had not acted. It is even more obviously precluded where Congress has acted.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nReciprocal and uniform laws, like interstate compacts, doubtless serve many useful purposes. But a State does not increase its sovereign powers by making an agreement with another State. Whether the right of ingress and egress be bottomed on the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Commerce Clause, or a basic \"liberty\" inherent in national citizenship, I know of no way in which a State may take it from a citizen. To say that there is no interference here because O'Neill will be free to return to Florida later is to trifle with a basic human right. The Court's argument enables the States through reciprocal laws to generate power that they lack acting separately. It speaks of the importance \n\n[359 \nU.S. 1, 17]\n\u00a0\n of encouraging \"resourcefulness of relationships between States on matters as to which there is no grant of power to Congress and as to which the range of authority restricted within an individual State is inadequate.\" Yet if the power is inadequate for either Florida or New York acting separately (as I am sure it is), I fail to see how it can be made adequate by the pooling of their inadequacies. To make it such is indeed a saltatorial achievement. The fact that a resident of a State can be compelled to testify in that State is no ground for compelling him \"to leave his State and go to some other State to testify viva voce.\" In re Allen, 49 D. & C. Rep. 631, 640. His right to go or stay is an incident of national citizenship, qualified only by an appropriate exercise of federal power.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nThe power of extradition was an expression of a \"policy of mutual support, in bringing offenders to justice,\" Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66, 100; and to substitute a system of law, superior to state authority, for the system of comity prevailing among sovereign nations. Innes v. Tobin, \n240 \nU.S. 127, 130\n-131. The Federal Act governing witnesses who are fugitives is an assertion by Congress of control over our nationals. Any policy of providing compulsory delivery of witnesses from one State to another is in other words a federal policy. If we allow the States to exercise that power as they like, we might as well permit them to sanction compulsory delivery of \n\n[359 \nU.S. 1, 18]\n\u00a0\n citizens from one State into another for purposes of being sued. See Massachusetts v. Klaus, 130 N. Y. Supp. 713, 722 (dissenting opinion). If it took Art. IV, 2, of the Constitution to provide for the compulsory delivery of a person charged with a crime from one State to another, and a Federal Act to require the delivery of witnesses over state lines, it would seem to follow a fortiori that further constitutional provisions would be required to authorize one State to provide for the compulsory delivery of an innocent person to another State. See In re Allen, supra.\n\nThis is not giving the Constitution a niggardly construction. I urge a liberal construction which will respect the civil rights of the citizens. This right of people to choose such State as they like for their abode, to remain unmolested in their dwellings, and to be protected against being whisked away to another State\n6\n has been, until today, zealously guarded. Until now, it has been part and parcel of the cherished freedom of movement protected by the Constitution.\n\nI would affirm the judgment entered by a unanimous vote of the Florida Supreme Court.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This provision is implemented by an Act of Congress. 18 U.S.C. c. 209.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 1073 provides: \"Violations of this section may be prosecuted only in the Federal judicial district in which the original crime was alleged to have been committed or in which the person was held in custody or confinement.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See H. R. Rep. No. 1458, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 2; H. R. Rep. No. 1596, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 2; Hemans v.

JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThese cases concern the constitutionality of state net income tax laws levying taxes on that portion of a foreign corporation's net income earned from and fairly apportioned to business activities within the taxing State when those activities are exclusively in furtherance of interstate commerce. No question is raised in either case as to the reasonableness of the apportionment of net income under the State's formulas nor to the amount of the final assessment made. The Minnesota tax was upheld by its Supreme Court, 250 Minn. 32, 84 N. W. 2d 373, while the Supreme Court of Georgia invalidated its statute as being violative of \"both the commerce and due-process clauses of the Federal Constitution . . . .\" 213 Ga. 713, 721, 101 S. E. 2d 197, 202. The importance of the question in the field of state taxation is indicated by the fact that thirty-five States impose direct net income taxes on corporations. Therefore, we noted jurisdiction of the appeal in the Minnesota case, \n355 \nU.S. 911\n (1958), and granted certiorari in the other, \n356 \nU.S. 911\n (1958). Although the cases were separately briefed, argued, and submitted, we have, because of the similarity of the tax in each case, consolidated them for the purposes of decision. It is contended that each of the state statutes, as applied, violates both the Due Process and the Commerce Clauses of the United States Constitution. We conclude that net income from the interstate operations of a foreign corporation may be subjected to state taxation provided the levy is not discriminatory and is properly apportioned to local activities within the taxing State forming sufficient nexus to support the same. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 453]\n\u00a0\n\n\n No. 12. - Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v.   State of Minnesota.\n\nThis is an appeal from judgments of Minnesota's courts upholding the assessment by the State of income taxes for the years 1933 through 1948 against appellant, an Iowa corporation engaged in the manufacture and sale of cement at its plant in Mason City, Iowa, some forty miles from the Minnesota border. The tax was levied under 290.03\n1\n of the Minnesota Statutes which imposes an annual tax upon the taxable net income of residents and nonresidents alike. One of four classes taxed by the statute is that of \"domestic and foreign corporations . . . whose business within this state during the taxable year consists exclusively of foreign commerce, interstate commerce, or both.\" Minnesota has utilized three ratios in determining the portion of net income taxable under its law.\n2\n The first is that of the taxpayer's sales assignable to Minnesota during the year to its total sales during that period made everywhere; the second, that of the taxpayer's total tangible property in Minnesota for the year to its total tangible property used in the business that year wherever situated. The third is the taxpayer's \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 454]\n\u00a0\n total payroll in Minnesota for the year to its total payroll for its entire business in the like period. As we have noted, appellant takes no issue with the fairness of this formula nor of the accuracy of its application here.\n\nAppellant's activities in Minnesota consisted of a regular and systematic course of solicitation of orders for the sale of its products, each order being subject to acceptance, filling and delivery by it from its plant at Mason City. It sold only to eligible dealers, who were lumber and building material supply houses, contractors and ready-mix companies. A list of these eligible dealers was maintained and sales would not be made to those not included thereon. Forty-eight percent of appellant's entire sales were made in this manner to such dealers in Minnesota. For efficient handling of its activity in that State, appellant maintained in Minneapolis a leased sales office equipped with its own furniture and fixtures and under the supervision of an employee-salesman known as \"district manager.\" Two salesmen, including this district manager, and a secretary occupied this three-room office. Two additional salesmen used it as a clearing house. Each employee was paid a straight salary by the appellant direct from Mason City and two cars were furnished by it for the salesmen. Appellant maintained no bank account in Minnesota, owned no real estate there, and warehoused no merchandise in the State. All sales were made on a delivered price basis fixed by the appellant in Mason City and no \"pick ups\" were permitted at its plant there. The salesmen, however, were authorized to quote Minnesota customers a delivered price. Orders received by the salesmen or at the Minneapolis office were transmitted daily to appellant in Mason City, were approved there, and acknowledged directly to the purchaser with copies to the salesman.\n\nIn addition to the solicitation of approved dealers, appellant's salesmen also contacted potential customers \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 455]\n\u00a0\n and users of cement products, such as builders, contractors, architects, and state, as well as local government purchasing agents. Orders were solicited and received from them, on special forms furnished by appellant, directed to an approved local dealer who in turn would fill them by placing a like order with appellant. Through this system appellant's salesmen would in effect secure orders for local dealers which in turn were filled by appellant in the usual manner. Salesmen would also receive and transmit claims against appellant for loss or damage in any shipments made by it, informing the company of the nature thereof and requesting instructions concerning the same.\n\nNo income tax returns were filed with the State by the appellant. The assessments sued upon, aggregating some $102,000, with penalties and interest, were made by the Commissioner of Taxation on the basis of information available to him.\n\n No. 33. - T. V. Williams, Commissioner, v. Stockham   Valves & Fittings, Inc.\n\nThe respondent here is a Delaware Corporation with its principal office and plant in Birmingham, Alabama. It manufactures and sells valves and pipe fittings through established local wholesalers and jobbers who handle products other than respondent's. These dealers were encouraged by respondent to carry a local inventory of its products by granting to those who did so a special price concession. However, the corporation maintained no warehouse or storage facilities in Georgia. It did maintain a sales-service office in Atlanta, which served five States. This office was headquarters for one salesman who devoted about one-third of his time to solicitation of orders in Georgia. He was paid on a salary-plus-commission basis while a full-time woman secretary employed there received a regular salary only. She was \"a source of \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 456]\n\u00a0\n information\" for respondent's products, performed stenographic and clerical services and \"facilitated communications between the . . . home office in Birmingham, . . . [the] sales representative . . . and customers, prospective customers, contractors and users of [its] products.\" Respondent's salesman carried on the usual sales activities, including regular solicitation, receipt and forwarding of orders to the Birmingham office and the promotion of business and good will for respondent. Orders were taken by him, as well as the sales-service office, subject to approval of the home office and were shipped from Birmingham direct to the customer on an \"f. o. b. warehouse\" basis. Other than office equipment, supplies, advertising literature and the like, respondent had no property in Georgia, deposited no funds there and stored no merchandise in the State.\n\nGeorgia levies a tax\n3\n on net incomes \"received by every corporation, foreign or domestic, owning property or doing \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 457]\n\u00a0\n business in this State.\"\n4\n The Act defines the latter as including \"any activities or transactions\" carried on within the State \"for the purpose of financial profit or gain\" regardless of its connection with interstate commerce. To apportion net income, the Act applies a three-factor ratio based on inventory, wages and gross receipts. Under the Act the State Revenue Commissioner assessed and collected a total of $1,478.31 from respondent for the taxable years 1952, 1954 and 1955, and after claims for refund were denied the respondent filed this suit to recover such payments. It bases its right to recover squarely upon the constitutionality of Georgia's Act under the Commerce and the Due Process Clauses of the Constitution of the United States.\n\nThat there is a \"need for clearing up the tangled underbrush of past cases\" with reference to the taxing power of the States is a concomitant to the negative approach resulting from a case-by-case resolution of \"the extremely limited restrictions that the Constitution places upon the states. . . .\" Wisconsin v. J. C. Penney Co., \n311 \nU.S. 435, 445\n (1940). Commerce between the States having grown up like Topsy, the Congress meanwhile not having undertaken to regulate taxation of it, and the States having understandably persisted in their efforts to get some return for the substantial benefits they have afforded it, there is little wonder that there has been no end of cases testing out state tax levies. The resulting judicial application of constitutional principles to specific state statutes leaves much room for controversy and confusion and little in the way of precise guides to the States in the exercise of their indispensable power of taxation. This Court alone has handed down some three hundred full-dress \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 458]\n\u00a0\n opinions spread through slightly more than that number of our reports. As was said in Miller Bros. Co. v. Maryland, \n347 \nU.S. 340, 344\n (1954), the decisions have been \"not always clear . . . consistent or reconcilable. A few have been specifically overruled, while others no longer fully represent the present state of the law.\" From the quagmire there emerge, however, some firm peaks of decision which remain unquestioned.\n\nIt has long been established doctrine that the Commerce Clause gives exclusive power to the Congress to regulate interstate commerce, and its failure to act on the subject in the area of taxation nevertheless requires that interstate commerce shall be free from any direct restrictions or impositions by the States. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1 (1824). In keeping therewith a State \"cannot impose taxes upon persons passing through the state, or coming into it merely for a temporary purpose\" such as itinerant drummers. Robbins v. Taxing District, \n120 \nU.S. 489, 493\n-494 (1887). Moreover, it is beyond dispute that a State may not lay a tax on the \"privilege\" of engaging in interstate commerce, Spector Motor Service v. O'Connor, \n340 \nU.S. 602\n (1951). Nor may a State impose a tax which discriminates against interstate commerce either by providing a direct commercial advantage to local business, Memphis Steam Laundry v. Stone, \n342 \nU.S. 389\n (1952); Nippert v. Richmond, \n327 \nU.S. 416\n (1946), or by subjecting interstate commerce to the burden of \"multiple taxation,\" Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co. v. Calvert, \n347 \nU.S. 157\n (1954); Adams Mfg. Co. v. Storen, \n304 \nU.S. 307\n (1938). Such impositions have been stricken because the States, under the Commerce Clause, are not allowed \"one single-tax-worth of direct interference with the free flow of commerce.\" Freeman v. Hewit, \n329 \nU.S. 249, 256\n (1946).\n\nOn the other hand, it has been established since 1918 that a net income tax on revenues derived from interstate \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 459]\n\u00a0\n commerce does not offend constitutional limitations upon state interference with such commerce. The decision of Peck & Co. v. Lowe, \n247 \nU.S. 165\n, pointed the way. There the Court held that though true it was that the Constitution provided \"No Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State,\" Art. I, 9, still a net income tax on the profits derived from such commerce was not \"laid on articles in course of exportation or on anything which inherently or by the usages of commerce is embraced in exportation or any of its processes. . . . At most, exportation is affected only indirectly and remotely.\" Id., at 174-175. The first case in this Court applying the doctrine to interstate commerce was that of U.S. Glue Co. v. Town of Oak Creek, \n247 \nU.S. 321\n (1918). There the Court distinguished between an invalid direct levy which placed a burden on interstate commerce and a charge by way of net income derived from profits from interstate commerce. This landmark case and those usually cited as upholding the doctrine there announced, i. e., Underwood Typewriter Co. v. Chamberlain, \n254 \nU.S. 113\n (1920), and Memphis Gas Co. v. Beeler, \n315 \nU.S. 649\n (1942), dealt with corporations which were domestic to the taxing State (U.S. Glue Co. v. Town of Oak Creek, supra), or which had \"established a commercial domicile\" there, Underwood Typewriter Co. v. Chamberlain, supra; Memphis Gas Co. v. Beeler, supra.\n\nBut that the presence of such a circumstance is not controlling is shown by the cases of Bass, Ratcliff & Gretton, Ltd., v. State Tax Commission, \n266 \nU.S. 271\n (1924), and Norfolk & W. R. Co. v. North Carolina, \n297 \nU.S. 682\n (1936). In neither of these cases was the taxpayer a domiciliary of the taxing State, incorporated or with its principal place of business there, though each carried on substantial local activities. Permitting the assessment of New York's franchise tax measured on a proportional formula against a British corporation selling ale in New \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 460]\n\u00a0\n York State, the Court held in Bass, Ratcliff & Gretton, Ltd., supra, that \"the Company carried on the unitary business of manufacturing and selling ale, in which its profits were earned by a series of transactions beginning with the manufacture in England and ending in sales in New York and other places - the process of manufacturing resulting in no profits until it ends in sales - the State was justified in attributing to New York a just proportion of the profits earned by the Company from such unitary business.\" Id., at 282. Likewise in Norfolk & W. R. Co., supra, North Carolina was permitted to tax a Virginia corporation on net income apportioned to North Carolina on the basis of mileage within the State. These cases stand for the doctrine that the entire net income of a corporation, generated by interstate as well as intrastate activities, may be fairly apportioned among the States for tax purposes by formulas utilizing in-state aspects of interstate affairs. In fact, in Bass, Ratcliff & Gretton the operations in the taxing State were conducted at a loss, and still the Court allowed part of the over-all net profit of the corporation to be attributed to the State. A reading of the statute in Norfolk & W. R. Co. reveals further that one facet of the apportionment formula was specifically designed to attribute a portion of the interstate hauls to the taxing State.\n\nAny doubt as to the validity of our position here was entirely dispelled four years after Beeler, in a unanimous per curiam in West Publishing Co. v. McColgan, \n328 \nU.S. 823\n, citing the four cases of Beeler, U.S. Glue Co., both supra, Interstate Busses Corp. v. Blodgett, \n276 \nU.S. 245\n (1928), and International Shoe Co. v. Washington, \n326 \nU.S. 310\n (1945). The case involved the validity of California's tax on the apportioned net income of West Publishing Company, whose business was exclusively interstate. See 27 Cal. 2d 705, 166 P.2d 861. While the statement of the facts in that opinion recites that \"The \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 461]\n\u00a0\n employees were given space in the offices of attorneys in return for the use of plaintiff's books stored in such offices,\" it is significant to note that West had not qualified to do business in California and the State's statute itself declared that the tax was levied on income derived from interstate commerce within the State, as well as any arising intrastate. The opinion was not grounded on the triviality that office space was given West's soliciters by attorneys in exchange for the chanceful use of what books they may have had on hand for their sales activities. Rather, it recognized that the income taxed arose from a purely interstate operation.\n\n \"In relying on the foregoing cases for the proposition that a foreign corporation engaged within a state solely in interstate commerce is immune from net income taxation by that state, plaintiff [West Publishing Co.] overlooks the distinction made by the United States Supreme Court between a tax whose subject is the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce and a tax whose subject is the net income from such commerce. It is settled by decisions of the United States Supreme Court that a tax on net income from interstate commerce, as distinguished from a tax on the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce, does not conflict with the commerce clause.\" 27 Cal. 2d 705, 708-709, 166 P.2d 861, 863. (Citations omitted.)\n\n\n We believe that the rationale of these cases, involving income levies by States, controls the issues here. The taxes are not regulations in any sense of that term. Admittedly they do not discriminate against nor subject either corporation to an undue burden. While it is true that a State may not erect a wall around its borders preventing commerce an entry, it is axiomatic that the founders did not intend to immunize such commerce from \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 462]\n\u00a0\n carrying its fair share of the costs of the state government in return for the benefits it derives from within the State. The levies are not privilege taxes based on the right to carry on business in the taxing State. The States are left to collect only through ordinary means. The tax, therefore, is \"not open to the objection that it compels the company to pay for the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce.\" Underwood Typewriter Co. v. Chamberlain, supra, at 119. As was said in Wisconsin v. Minnesota Mining & Mfg. Co., \n311 \nU.S. 452, 453\n (1940), \"it is too late in the day to find offense to that [commerce] Clause because a state tax is imposed on corporate net income of an interstate enterprise which is attributable to earnings within the taxing state . . . .\"\n\nWhile the economic wisdom of state net income taxes is one of state policy not for our decision, one of the \"realities\" raised by the parties is the possibility of a multiple burden resulting from the exactions in question. The answer is that none is shown to exist here. This is not an unapportioned tax which by its very nature makes interstate commerce bear more than its fair share. As was said in Central Greyhound Lines v. Mealey, \n334 \nU.S. 653, 661\n (1948), \"it is interstate commerce which the State is seeking to reach and . . . the real question [is] whether what the State is exacting is a constitutionally fair demand by the State for that aspect of the interstate commerce to which the State bears a special relation.\" The apportioned tax is designed to meet this very requirement and \"to prevent the levying of such taxes as will discriminate against or prohibit the interstate activities or will place the interstate commerce at a disadvantage relative to local commerce.\" Id., at 670. Logically it is impossible, when the tax is fairly apportioned, to have the same income taxed twice. In practical operation, however, apportionment formulas being what they are, the possibility of the contrary is not foreclosed, especially \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 463]\n\u00a0\n by levies in domiciliary States.\n5\n But that question is not before us. It was argued in Northwest Airlines v. Minnesota, \n322 \nU.S. 292\n (1944), that the taxation of the entire fleet of its airplanes in that State would result in multiple taxation since other State levied taxes on some proportion of the full value thereof. The Court rejected this contention as being \"not now before us\" even though other States actually collected property taxes for the same year from Northwest upon \"some proportion\" of the full value of its fleet.\n6\n Here the records are all to the contrary. There is nothing to show that multiple taxation is present. We cannot deal in abstractions. In this type of case the taxpayers must show that the formula places a burden upon interstate commerce in a constitutional sense. This they have failed to do.\n\nIt is also contended that Spector Motor Service v. O'Connor, \n340 \nU.S. 602\n (1951), requires a contrary result. But there it was repeatedly emphasized that the tax was \"imposed upon the franchise of a foreign corporation for the privilege of doing business within the State . . . .\" Thus, it was invalid under a long line of precedents, some of which we have mentioned.\n7\n It was not a levy on net \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 464]\n\u00a0\n income but an excise or tax placed on the franchise of a foreign corporation engaged \"exclusively\" in interstate operations. Therefore, with the exception of Beeler, heretofore mentioned, the Court made no reference to the net-income-tax cases which control here. We do not construe that reference as intended to impair the validity of the Beeler opinion. Nor does it reach our problem. The taxes here, like that in West Publishing Co. v. McColgan, supra, are based only upon the net profits earned in the taxing State. That incidence of the tax affords a valid \"constitutional channel\" which the States have utilized to \"make interstate commerce pay its way.\" In Spector the incidence was the privilege of doing business, and that avenue of approach had long been declared unavailable under the Commerce Clause. As was said in Spector, \"taxes may be imposed although their payment may come out of the funds derived from petitioner's interstate business, provided the taxes are so imposed that their burden will be reasonably related to the powers of the State and [are] non-discriminatory.\" \n340 \nU.S., at 609\n. We find that the statutes here meet these tests.\n\nNor will the argument that the exactions contravene the Due Process Clause bear scrutiny. The taxes imposed are levied only on that portion of the taxpayer's net income which arises from its activities within the taxing State. These activities form a sufficient \"nexus between such a tax and transactions within a state for which the tax is an exaction.\" Wisconsin v. J. C. Penney Co., supra, at 445. It strains reality to say, in terms of our \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 465]\n\u00a0\n decisions, that each of the corporations here was not sufficiently involved in local events to forge \"some definite link, some minimum connection\" sufficient to satisfy due process requirements. Miller Bros. v. Maryland, \n347 \nU.S. 340, 344\n-345 (1954). See also Ott v. Miss. Valley Barge Line, \n336 \nU.S. 169\n (1949); International Shoe Co. v. Washington, \n326 \nU.S. 310\n (1945); and West Publishing Co. v. McColgan, supra. The record is without conflict that both corporations engage in substantial income-producing activity in the taxing States. In fact in No. 12 almost half of the corporation's income is derived from the taxing State's sales which are shown to be promoted by vigorous and continuous sales campaigns run through a central office located in the State. While in No. 33 the percent of sales is not available, the course of conduct was largely identical. As was said in Wisconsin v. J. C.

In fact, all involved taxes levied upon corporations for the privilege of engaging \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 464]\n\u00a0\n in interstate commerce. This Court has consistently held that the \"privilege\" of engaging in interstate commerce cannot be granted or withheld by a State, and that the assertion of state power to tax the \"privilege\" is, therefore, a forbidden attempt to \"regulate\" interstate commerce. Cf. Murdock v. Pennsylvania, \n319 \nU.S. 105, 112\n-113 (1943).\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring.\n\nIn joining the opinion of the Court, I deem it appropriate to make some further comments as to the issues in these cases because of the strongly held contrary views manifested in the dissenting opinions of MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER and MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER. I preface what follows by saying that in my view the past decisions of this Court clearly point to, if indeed they do not compel, the sustaining of these two state taxing measures. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 466]\n\u00a0\n\n\nSince U.S. Glue Co. v. Town of Oak Creek, \n247 \nU.S. 321\n, decided in 1918, this Court has uniformly held that a State, in applying a net income tax of general impact to a corporation doing business within its borders, may reach income derived from interstate commerce to the extent that such income is fairly related to corporate activities within the State. See, e. g., Shaffer v. Carter, \n252 \nU.S. 37, 57\n; Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Daughton, \n262 \nU.S. 413, 416\n. See also Underwood Typewriter Co. v. Chamberlain, \n254 \nU.S. 113, 119\n-120; Bass, Ratcliff & Gretton, Ltd., v. State Tax Comm'n, \n266 \nU.S. 271\n; Norfolk & W. R. Co. v. North Carolina, \n297 \nU.S. 682\n.\n\nAs I read the cases the existence of some income from intrastate business on the part of the taxed corporation, while sometimes adverted to, has never been considered essential to the valid taxation of such \"interstate\" income. The cases upholding taxes of this kind cannot, in my opinion, properly be said to rest on the theory that the income earned from the carrying on of interstate commerce was not in fact being taxed, but rather was being utilized simply to measure the income derived from some separate, but unidentified, intrastate commerce, which income was in truth the subject of the tax. That this is so seems to me apparent from U.S. Glue itself. There the Court explicitly recognized that the question before it was whether net income from exclusively interstate commerce could be taxed by a State on an apportioned basis together with other income of a corporation. The careful distinction, drawn more than once in the course of the opinion, between gross receipts from interstate commerce, assumed to be immune from state taxation, and net income therefrom, \n247 \nU.S., at 324\n, 326, 327, 328, 329, would be altogether meaningless if the case is to be explained on the basis suggested by my dissenting brethren, for if all that was in fact being taxed was income from intrastate commerce there is no reason why gross receipts \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 467]\n\u00a0\n as well as net income could not have been reached by the State.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nSurely any possible doubt on this score is removed by West Publishing Co. v. McColgan, \n328 \nU.S. 823\n, where this Court unanimously affirmed, without oral argument, a decision of the California Supreme Court upholding the validity of a statute taxing \"income from any activities carried on in this State, regardless of whether carried on in intrastate, interstate or foreign commerce\" as applied to reach a portion of the net income of a Minnesota corporation not qualified to do intrastate business in California and assumed by the California court to be deriving income in California entirely \"from activities in furtherance of a purely interstate business . . . .\" 27 Cal. 2d 705, 712, 166 P.2d 861, 865.\n\nIt is suggested that the Court's summary affirmance in the West case went on the ground that the taxpayer there was found by the state court to have been engaged in intrastate commerce in California, and that it was only the income earned from such commerce that had in truth been taxed by the State. In my view, this explanation \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 468]\n\u00a0\n of West is unacceptable. Apart from the fact that the California Supreme Court did not proceed on any such basis (see especially the quotation from the state court's opinion set forth at p. 461 of this Court's opinion), the only facts elucidated in support of this view of the West case are that employees of the taxpayer solicited business in California, that they were authorized to receive payments on orders taken by them, to collect delinquent accounts, and to adjust complaints, and that they were given space in California lawyers' offices in return for the use of the taxpayer's books there stored, which locations were also advertised as the taxpayer's local offices. It is said that these are \"the usual criteria which this Court has consistently held to constitute the doing of intrastate commerce\" and that \"California determined and taxed only the amount of that intrastate commerce.\" With deference, this seems to me to be both novel doctrine and unreal analysis; novel doctrine because this Court has never held that activities of this kind, performed solely in aid of interstate sales, are intrastate commerce; unreal analysis, because it is surely stretching things too far to say that California was seeking to measure and tax office renting and complaint adjusting rather than part of the income from concededly interstate sales transactions.\n\nI think that West squarely governs the two cases now before us.\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 469]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt is said that the taxes presently at issue were \"laid on income from [interstate commerce] because of its source.\" If this were so I should of course vote to strike down their application here as unconstitutionally discriminatory against interstate commerce. But this seems to me plainly not such a case. As the opinion of the Court demonstrates, the Minnesota and Georgia taxes are each part of a general scheme of state income taxation, reaching all individual, corporate, and other net income. The taxing statutes are not sought to be applied to portions of the net income of Northwestern and Stockham because of the source of that income - interstate commerce - but rather despite that source. The thrust of these statutes is not hostile discrimination against interstate commerce, but rather a seeking of some compensation for facilities and benefits afforded by the taxing States to income-producing activities therein, whether those activities be altogether local or in furtherance of interstate commerce. The past decisions of this Court establish that such compensation may be had by the States consistent with the Commerce Clause.\n\nI think it no more a \"regulation of,\" \"burden on,\" or \"interference with\" interstate commerce to permit a State within whose borders a foreign corporation engages solely in activities in aid of that commerce to tax the net income derived therefrom on a properly apportioned basis than to permit the same State to impose a nondiscriminatory net income tax of general application on a corporation engaging in both interstate and intrastate commerce therein and to take into account income from both categories. Cf. Peck & Co. v. Lowe, \n247 \nU.S. 165\n. In each case the amount of the tax will increase as the profitability of the interstate business done increases. This Court has \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 470]\n\u00a0\n consistently upheld state net income taxes of general application so applied as to reach that portion of the profits of interstate business enterprises fairly allocable to activities within the State's borders. We do no more today.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] As early as 1919 such a discriminating commentator as the late Thomas Reed Powell had this to say, in commenting on the decisions of this Court in Peck & Co. v. Lowe, \n247 \nU.S. 165\n, and U.S. Glue Co. v. Town of Oak Creek, supra: \"We may take it for granted, then, that the legal character of the recipient and the nature of the business in which the recipient is engaged are immaterial elements in considering the constitutionality of a state-wide, all-inclusive general tax on net income from business done within the state. The recipient may be an individual, a partnership, a domestic or a foreign corporation. The business may be exclusively interstate.\" Indirect Encroachment on Federal Authority by the Taxing Powers of the States. VII, 32 Harv. L. Rev. 634, 639. That nothing in U.S. Glue turned on the fact that the taxpayer there happened to be a domestic corporation is shown by the line of cases following it where the taxpayers were foreign corporations doing an interstate business. See cases cited, ante, p. 466.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Apart from the considerations discussed in the text of this opinion, it is noteworthy that the Court in West, in relying on Memphis Natural Gas Co. v. Beeler, \n315 \nU.S. 649\n, cited directly to page \"656\" of the Beeler opinion where it was said: \"In any case, even if taxpayer's business were wholly interstate commerce [italics supplied], a nondiscriminatory tax by Tennessee upon the net income of a foreign corporation having a commercial domicile there [citation], or upon net income derived from within the state [citations], is not prohibited by the commerce clause on which the taxpayer alone relies [citing among \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 469]\n\u00a0\n other cases U.S. Glue Co. v. Town of Oak Creek, supra]. There is no contention or showing here that the tax assessed is not upon net earnings justly attributable to Tennessee [citations].\"\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, dissenting.\n\nBy way of emphasizing my agreement with my brother WHITTAKER, I add a few observations.\n\nThe Court sustains the taxing power of the States in these two cases essentially on the basis of precedents. For me, the result of today's decisions is to break new ground. I say this because, among all the hundreds of cases dealing with the power of the States to tax commerce, there is not a single decision adjudicating the precise situation now before us. Concretely, we have never decided that a State may tax a corporation when that tax is on income related to the State by virtue of activities within it when such activities are exclusively part of the process of doing interstate commerce. That is the precise situation which the state courts found here, to wit:\n\n \"[Northwestern's] activities in this State were an integral part of its interstate activities, and all revenue received by it from customers in Minnesota resulted from its operations in interstate commerce.\"\n\n\n and,\n\n \"[W]ithout dispute [Stockham] was engaged exclusively in interstate commerce in so far as its activities in Georgia are concerned.\" 213 Ga. 713, 719, 101 S. E. 2d 197, 201.\n\n\n It is vital to realize that in no case prior to this decision in which the taxing power of a State has been upheld when applied to corporations engaged in interstate commerce, was there a total absence of activities pursued or \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 471]\n\u00a0\n advantages conferred within the State severable from the very process which constitutes interstate commerce.\n\nThe case that argumentatively comes the closest to the situation now before the Court is West Publishing Co. v. McColgan, \n328 \nU.S. 823\n.\n1\n But in that case too, as the \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 472]\n\u00a0\n opinion of the California Supreme Court which we there summarily sustained clearly set forth, 27 Cal. 2d 705, 166 P.2d 861, the West Publishing Company did not merely complete in California the business which began in Minnesota. It employed permanent workers who engaged in business activities localized in California, activities which were apart from and in addition to the purely interstate sale of law books. These activities were more than an essential part of the process of interstate commerce; they were, in legal shorthand, local California activities constituting interstate business. In dealing with those purely local activities the State could properly exert its taxing power in relation to opportunities and advantages which it had given and which it could have withheld by simply not allowing a foreign corporation to do local business, whereas no State may withhold from a foreign corporation within its borders the right to exercise what is part of a process of exclusively interstate commerce. The State gives to a corporation so engaged nothing which it can withhold and therefore nothing for which it can charge a price, whether the price be the cost of a license to do interstate business or a tax on the profits accruing from that business. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 473]\n\u00a0\n\n\nI venture to say that every other decision - I say decision, not talk or dicta - on which reliance is placed, presented a situation where conjoined with the interstate commerce was severable local state business on the basis of which the state taxing power became constitutionally operative. The difference between those situations and this, as a matter of economics, involves the distinction between taking into account the total activity of the enterprise as a going business in determining a fairly apportioned tax based on locally derived revenues, and taxing a portion of revenue concededly produced by exclusively interstate commerce. To be sure, such a distinction is a nice one, but the last word on the necessity of nice distinctions in this area was said by Mr. Justice Holmes in Galveston, H. & S. A. R. Co. v. Texas, \n210 \nU.S. 217, 225\n: \"It being once admitted, as of course it must be, that not every law that affects commerce is a regulation of it in a constitutional sense, nice distinctions are to be expected.\"\n\nAccordingly, today's decision cannot rest on the basis of adjudicated precedents. This does not bar the making of a new precedent. The history of the Commerce Clause is the history of judicial evolution. It is one thing, however, to recognize the taxing power of the States in relation to purely interstate activities and quite another thing to say that that power has already been established by the decisions of this Court. If new ground is to be broken, the ground must be justified and not treated as though it were old ground.\n\nI do not think we should take this new step. My objection is the policy that underlies the Commerce Clause, namely, whatever disadvantages may accrue to the separate States from making of the United States a free-trade territory are far outweighed by the advantages not only to the United States as a Nation, but to the component States. I am assuming, of course, that today's decision \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 474]\n\u00a0\n will stimulate, if indeed it does not compel, every State of the Union, which has not already done so, to devise a formula of apportionment to tax the income of enterprises carrying on exclusively interstate commerce. As a result, interstate commerce will be burdened not hypothetically but practically, and we have been admonished again and again that taxation is a practical matter.\n\nI think that interstate commerce will be not merely argumentatively but actively burdened for two reasons:\n\nFirst. It will not, I believe, be gainsaid that there are thousands of relatively small or moderate size corporations doing exclusively interstate business spread over several States. To subject these corporations to a separate income tax in each of these States means that they will have to keep books, make returns, store records, and engage legal counsel, all to meet the divers and variegated tax laws of forty-nine States, with their different times for filing returns, different tax structures, different modes for determining \"net income,\" and different, often conflicting, formulas of apportionment. This will involve large increases in bookkeeping, accounting, and legal paraphernalia to meet these new demands. The cost of such a far-flung scheme for complying with the taxing requirements of the different States may well exceed the burden of the taxes themselves, especially in the case of small companies doing a small volume of business in several States.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nSecond. The extensive litigation in this Court which has challenged formulas of apportionment in the case of railroads and express companies\n3\n - challenges addressed \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 475]\n\u00a0\n to the natural temptation of the States to absorb more than their fair share of interstate revenue - will be multiplied many times when such formulas are applied to the infinitely larger number of other businesses which are engaged in exclusively interstate commerce. The division in this Court on these railroad apportionment cases is a good index of what might reasonably be expected when cases involving the more numerous non-transportation industries come before the Court. This is not a suggestion that the convenience of the Court should determine our construction of the Commerce Clause, although it is important in balancing the considerations relevant to the Commerce Clause against the claims of state power that this Court should be mindful of the kind of questions it will be called upon to adjudicate and its special competence for adjudicating them. Wholly apart from that, the necessity for litigation based on these elusive and essentially non-legal questions casts a burden on businesses, and consequently on interstate commerce itself, which should not be imposed.\n\nThese considerations do not at all lead to the conclusion that the vast amount of business carried on throughout all the States as part of what is exclusively interstate commerce should not be made to contribute to the cost of maintaining state governments which, as a practical matter, necessarily contribute to the conduct of that commerce by the mere fact of their existence as governments. The question is not whether a fair share of the profits derived from the carrying on of exclusively interstate commerce should contribute to the cost of the state governments. The question is whether the answer to this problem rests with this Court or with Congress.\n\nI am not unmindful of the extent to which federal taxes absorb the taxable resources of the Nation, while at the same time the fiscal demands of the States are on the increase. These conditions present far-reaching problems \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 476]\n\u00a0\n of accommodating federal-state fiscal policy. But a determination of who is to get how much out of the common fund can hardly be made wisely and smoothly through the adjudicatory process. In fact, relying on the courts to solve these problems only aggravates the difficulties and retards proper legislative solution.\n\nAt best, this Court can only act negatively; it can determine whether a specific state tax is imposed in violation of the Commerce Clause. Such decisions must necessarily depend on the application of rough and ready legal concepts. We cannot make a detailed inquiry into the incidence of diverse economic burdens in order to determine the extent to which such burdens conflict with the necessities of national economic life. Neither can we devise appropriate standards for dividing up national revenue on the basis of more or less abstract principles of constitutional law, which cannot be responsive to the subtleties of the interrelated economies of Nation and State.\n\nThe problem calls for solution by devising a congressional policy. Congress alone can provide for a full and thorough canvassing of the multitudinous and intricate factors which compose the problem of the taxing freedom of the States and the needed limits on such state taxing power.\n4\n Congressional, committees can make \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 477]\n\u00a0\n studies and give the claims of the individual States adequate hearing before the ultimate legislative formulation of policy is made by the representatives of all the States. The solution to these problems ought not to rest on the self-serving determination of the States of what they are entitled to out of the Nation's resources. Congress alone can formulate policies founded upon economic realities, perhaps to be applied to the myriad situation involved by a properly constituted and duly informed administrative agency.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The West case was a per curiam affirmance without opinion. The Court cited four cases in support: United States Glue Co. v. Town of Oak Creek, \n247 \nU.S. 321\n; Interstate Busses Corp. v. Blodgett, \n276 \nU.S. 245\n; Memphis Natural Gas Co. v. Beeler, \n315 \nU.S. 649, 656\n; International Shoe Co. v. Washington, \n326 \nU.S. 310\n. Not one of these cases presented the issue now here; in none had the Court to sustain a state net income tax on a business whose revenue derived solely from interstate commerce.\n\nIn United States Glue Co. v. Town of Oak Creek, supra, this Court upheld an apportioned net income tax levied by the State of Wisconsin on a Wisconsin corporation having its principal office and manufacturing establishment in that State. A substantial part of the corporation's business was intrastate. The only issue before the Court was the power of the State to include interstate income in its apportionment computation.\n\nInterstate Busses Corp. v. Blodgett, supra, decided that appellant had not sustained the burden of showing that an excise tax of one cent per mile levied by Connecticut on motor vehicles using its highways in interstate commerce fell with discriminating weight on interstate commerce when the tax was viewed as part of the State's entire taxing scheme. Aside from this issue of discrimination, the case was merely another instance of a State charging for the use of its highways.\n\nThe Court in Memphis Natural Gas Co. v. Beeler, supra, upheld a net income tax imposed by the State of Tennessee on revenues earned by the Memphis Gas Company from shipping gas into the State and selling it, together with another company, to retail consumers in that State. The decision was explicitly based on a determination that the revenue was, in fact, derived from intrastate rather than interstate commerce. In addition the Memphis Company was licensed to do business in Tennessee, maintained its principal place of business there, and sold much of its gas in that State. It is true that on the page cited in Beeler the opinion indulged in a dictum that net income from interstate commerce was taxable. But this was \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 472]\n\u00a0\n an almost by-the-way observation, itself relying on citations which do not support it, by a writer prone to uttering dicta.\n\nInternational Shoe Co. v. Washington, supra, decided that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did not prohibit the State of Washington from exercising jurisdiction over the International Shoe Co., in the light of the frequency and extent of the company's business contacts within the State. There was no doubt that the unemployment compensation contributions exacted by Washington were entirely consistent with the Commerce Clause, since Congress had explicitly authorized such levies.\n\nThus none of the cases cited in West support an interpretation of that decision which goes beyond the actual situation of severable local activities presented in that case. Nor do they support the present taxes levied on exclusively interstate business.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] For a detailed exposition of the manifold difficulties in complying with the diverse and complex taxing systems of the States, see Cohen, State Tax Allocations and Formulas which Affect Management Operating Decisions, 1 Jour.

No. 141, 79th Cong., 1st Sess. This report of the Board was a 158-page document whose length and complex economic content in dealing with only a single subject of state taxation, illustrate the difficulties and nonjudicial nature of the problem. Following the presentation of this extensive report, several bills were introduced into Congress providing for a single uniform apportionment formula \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 477]\n\u00a0\n to be used by the States in taxing airlines. H. R. 1241, 80th Cong., 1st Sess.; S. 2453, 80th Cong., 2d Sess.; S. 420, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. None of these bills was enacted.\n\nAustralia has resolved the problem of conflicting and burdensome state taxation of commerce by a national arrangement whereby taxes are collected by the Commonwealth and from these revenues appropriate allocations are made annually to the States through the mechanism of a Premiers' Conference - the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth and the Premiers of the several States.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER, with whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER and MR. JUSTICE STEWART join, dissenting.\n\nI respectfully dissent. My disagreement with the Court is over what I think are constitutional fundamentals. I think that the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, 8, cl. 3, as consistently interpreted by this Court until today, precludes the States from laying taxes directly on, and thereby regulating, \"exclusively interstate commerce.\" But the Court's decision today holds that the States may do so.\n\nThe statutes, facts and findings involved are clear, sharp and undisputed. There is no room to doubt that the statutes involved were designed to tax income derived \"exclusively [from] interstate commerce\"; that the courts of the States concerned have found that the income involved derived \"exclusively [from] interstate commerce\"; \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 478]\n\u00a0\n and that the taxes in question were laid directly on that interstate commerce.\n\nNorthwestern States Portland Cement Company, an Iowa corporation maintaining its principal office and only manufacturing plant in Mason City in that State, has for many years sold its cement locally in Iowa and, in interstate commerce, to dealers in neighboring States including Minnesota. Although the \"exclusively\" interstate character of the commerce done by Northwestern in Minnesota is not disputed, the course of its conduct in that State is summarized in the margin.\n1\n In 1950 Minnesota, \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 479]\n\u00a0\n acting under its statutory \"three factor formula\" now contained in Minnesota Statutes, 1957, 290.19,\n2\n apportioned and allocated to Minnesota a substantial part of Northwestern's net income for each of the years 1933 through 1948. Upon the amount of net income so allocated, Minnesota assessed a tax against Northwestern for each of those years under what is now Minnesota Statutes, 1957, 290.03, which, in pertinent part, provides:\n\n \"290.03 . . . Classes of taxpayers. An annual tax for each taxable year, computed in the manner and at the rates hereinafter provided, is hereby imposed upon the taxable net income for such year of the following classes of taxpayers:\n\n\n \"(1) Domestic and foreign corporations . . . whose business within this state during the taxable year consists exclusively of . . . interstate commerce . . . .\"\n\n\n Upon Northwestern's refusal to pay those taxes, Minnesota brought this action in its own court to recover them. Northwestern defended upon the grounds (1) that \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 480]\n\u00a0\n 290.03, as applied, imposed the taxes directly upon interstate commerce and, hence, regulated it in violation of the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, 8, cl. 3, and (2) that the income involved was not subject to Minnesota's jurisdiction and its action in taxing it violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. At the conclusion of the trial, the court made formal findings of fact including the following:\n\n \"[Northwestern's] activities in this state were an integral part of its interstate activities, and all revenue received by it from customers in Minnesota resulted from its operations in interstate commerce.\"\n\n\n But the trial court, nevertheless, sustained the tax and entered judgment for the State. Northwestern appealed to the Supreme Court of Minnesota which, without challenging the finding of fact above-quoted, affirmed, 250 Minn. 32, 84 N. W. 2d 373, and the case is here on Northwestern's appeal. \n355 \nU.S. 911\n.\n\nStockham Valves & Fittings, Inc., is a Delaware corporation maintaining its principal office and only manufacturing plant in Birmingham, Alabama. It makes valves and pipefittings which it sells locally in Alabama and, in interstate commerce, to wholesalers and jobbers in Georgia as well as in all other States of the Union. Although the facts are stipulated and the \"exclusively\" interstate character of the commerce done by Stockham in Georgia is not in dispute, the course of its conduct in that State is summarized in the margin.\n3\n Petitioner, as \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 481]\n\u00a0\n State Revenue Commissioner of Georgia, acting under the \"Three Factor Ratio\" of the Code of Georgia, 1933, as amended, 92-3113 (4),\n4\n apportioned and allocated to Georgia a part of Stockham's net income for each of the years 1952, 1954, and 1955. Upon the amounts of net income so allocated, petitioner assessed a tax against Stockham for each of those years under the Code of \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 482]\n\u00a0\n Georgia of 1933, as amended, 92-3113, which, in pertinent part, provides:\n\n \"Corporations, allocation and apportionment of income. - The tax imposed by this law shall apply to the entire net income, as herein defined, received by every corporation, foreign or domestic, owning property or doing business in this State. Every such corporation shall be deemed to be doing business within this State if it engages within this State in any activities or transactions for the purpose of financial profit or gain, . . . whether or not any such activity or transaction is connected with interstate or foreign commerce.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n Upon demand, Stockham paid the taxes and, after denial of timely claim for refund, brought this suit to recover the amount paid, contending (1) that 92-3113, as applied, imposed the taxes directly upon interstate commerce and, hence, regulated it in violation of the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, and (2) that the income involved was not subject to Georgia's jurisdiction and its action in taxing it violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The trial court sustained the tax. Stockham appealed to the Supreme Court of Georgia. It found that:\n\n \"[W]ithout dispute [Stockham] was engaged exclusively in interstate commerce in so far as its activities in Georgia are concerned . . . .\" 213 Ga. 713, 719, 101 S. E. 2d 197, 201.\n\n\n And it held that 92-3113, as applied, violated the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. It thereupon reversed the judgment, 213 Ga. 713, 101 S. E. 2d 197, and we granted Georgia's petition for certiorari. \n356 \nU.S. 911\n.\n\nI submit that these simple recitals clearly show (1) that the Minnesota and Georgia statutes, in plain terms, purport to tax income derived \"exclusively [from] \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 483]\n\u00a0\n interstate commerce,\" (2) that the Minnesota and Georgia courts have found that the income involved was derived \"exclusively [from] interstate commerce,\" and (3) that the taxes were laid directly on that interstate commerce. There is no room to dispute these admitted facts. Yet, I believe, the Court does not squarely face them but veiledly treats the cases as though intrastate commerce were to some extent involved. It says, referring to the Minnesota case, (a) that one of the salesmen was known as \"district manager,\" (b) that the Minneapolis sales office was used \"as a clearing house,\" (c) that \"Orders were solicited and received from [builders, contractors and architects], on special forms furnished by appellant, directed to an approved local dealer who in turn would fill them by placing a like order with appellant, [and that] [t]hrough this system appellant's salesmen would in effect secure orders for local dealers which in turn were filled by appellant in the usual manner,\" and (d) that \"Salesmen would also receive and transmit claims against appellant for loss or damage in any shipments made by it, informing the company of the nature thereof and requesting instructions concerning the same.\" These recitals, if found true, might very well have supported a finding, had there been one, that the taxpayer was engaged in interstate commerce in Minnesota. Particularly might the statement about the salesmen taking orders from builders, contractors and architects for local dealers have done so, for it was expressly held in Cheney Brothers Co. v. Massachusetts, \n246 \nU.S. 147, 155\n, that such conduct amounted to engaging in the local business of selling products for such dealers. But no such finding was made by the Minnesota courts. And there is more than colorable basis for believing that Minnesota did not desire such a finding, as any such practice could easily be ended by Northwestern, and Minnesota's purpose was not to rest on such a basis but to obtain an adjudication that \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 484]\n\u00a0\n its statute, 290.03, constitutionally imposed a tax upon the taxpayer's net income from Minnesota customers though derived \"exclusively [from] interstate commerce.\" Nor can the Court's seeming disdain of the word \"commerce\" and its frequent use, instead, of \"activities\" obscure the fact that it was \"exclusively interstate commerce\" that was taxed. The abstract use of the word \"activities,\" as applied to a commerce question and distinguished from a due process one, has no legal significance. What is of legal consequence is whether the \"activities\" were in intrastate or in interstate commerce. Here, the Minnesota and Georgia courts have found that the income which was taxed had derived \"exclusively [from] interstate commerce.\"\n\nSo if anything is plain it is that we are not presented with cases involving the doing of any interstate commerce in Minnesota or Georgia by the taxpayers. The courts of those States have expressly found that there was none. Therefore, we do not have a situation where a taxpayer was doing both intrastate and interstate commerce within the taxing State, thus to invoke application of the State's apportionment statute in order to determine how much of the total income of the taxpayer had derived from intrastate commerce in the taxing State, and was, therefore, subject to its taxing power. Instead we have here only interstate commerce, which the States are prohibited from regulating, by direct taxation or otherwise, by the Commerce Clause of the Constitution.\n\nYet, the Court \"conclude[s] that net income from the interstate operations of a foreign corporation may be subjected to state taxation provided the levy is not discriminatory and is properly apportioned to local activities within the taxing State forming sufficient nexus to support the same.\" (Emphasis added.) I respectfully submit that this is novel doctrine, and that this Court has never before so held. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 485]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Court refers to our past opinions in this field as creating a \"quagmire,\" and says \"there is a `need for clearing up the tangled underbrush of past cases' with reference to the taxing power of the States . . . .\" I respectfully submit that this Court's past opinions, rightly understood and aligned in their proper categories, are remarkably consistent in a field so varied and complex, and that they do not deserve the characterizations given them. It is quite true in this field - as I think is the case in almost every field - that loose statements can be found in some of the opinions which when considered in isolation, and certainly when taken out of context, are seemingly outside the line of the law. But I think it is entirely fair to say that such confusion as exists is mainly due to a failure properly to analyze, understand, categorize and apply the decisions.\n\nIn applying the Court's opinions in the field of state income taxation of commerce, it is at least necessary sharply to discern (1) whether the tax was laid upon the general income of a resident or domiciliary of the taxing State, (2) whether the taxpayer's production, manufacturing, distribution or management facilities, or some of them, were located in the taxing State, (3) whether the taxpayer conducted both intrastate and interstate commerce in the taxing State, and, if so, (4) whether the tax was directly laid on income derived from interstate commerce, or - what is the equivalent - on the whole of the income, or whether the whole of the income was used as one of the several factors in an apportionment formula merely for the purpose of fairly measuring the uncertain percentage or proportion of the total income that was earned within the taxing State.\n\nLet us start our consideration with fundamentals. Of course, the foundation is the Commerce Clause itself. It provides: \"The Congress shall have Power . . . To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 486]\n\u00a0\n States, and with the Indian Tribes . . . .\" U.S. Const., Art. I, 8, cl. 3. That clause \"by its own force created an area of trade free from interference by the States.\" Freeman v. Hewit, \n329 \nU.S. 249, 252\n. \"[N]o State has the right to lay a tax on interstate commerce in any form. . . . [T]he reason is that such taxation is a burden on that commerce, and amounts to a regulation of it, which belongs solely to Congress.\" Leloup v. Port of Mobile, \n127 \nU.S. 640, 648\n. And see the thirteen cases in this Court there cited in support of the quoted text. Mr. Justice Brandeis, speaking for the Court in Sprout v. South Bend, \n277 \nU.S. 163, 171\n, declared that \"in order that [a State] fee or tax shall be valid, it must appear that it is imposed solely on account of the interstate business; that the amount exacted is not increased because of the interstate business done; that one engaged exclusively in interstate commerce would not be subject to the imposition; and that the person taxed could discontinue the intrastate business without withdrawing also from the interstate business.\" (Emphasis added.) The same declaration was made for the Court by Mr. Justice Butler in East Ohio Gas Co. v. Tax Commission, \n283 \nU.S. 465, 470\n, and again by Mr. Chief Justice Hughes in Cooney v. Mountain States Tel. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 384, 393\n.\n\nFrom this alone it would seem necessarily to follow that the taxes here challenged, which were laid by the States directly on \"exclusively interstate commerce,\" burdened that commerce and, hence, regulated it in violation of the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. But there is more. This Court has consistently struck down state taxes which were laid on business that was exclusively interstate in character. Cheney Brothers Co. v. Massachusetts, \n246 \nU.S. 147, 153\n; Alpha Portland Cement Co. v. Massachusetts, \n268 \nU.S. 203\n; Ozark Pipe Line Corp. v. Monier, \n266 \nU.S. 555\n; Spector Motor Service v. O'Connor, \n340 \nU.S. 602\n. Cf. Joseph v. Carter & Weekes Co., \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 487]\n\u00a0\n \n330 \nU.S. 422\n; Freeman v. Hewit, supra. Neither the Court nor counsel have cited, and our research has not disclosed, a single opinion by this Court that has upheld a state tax laid on \"exclusively interstate commerce,\" and we are confident none exists.\n\nThe Court recognizes that \"the States, under the Commerce Clause, are not allowed `one single-tax-worth of direct interference with the free flow of commerce.' Freeman v. Hewit, \n329 \nU.S. 249\n,256.\" It then says \"On the other hand, it has been established since 1918 that a net income tax on revenues derived from interstate commerce does not offend constitutional limitations upon state interference with such commerce. The decision of Peck & Co. v. Lowe, \n247 \nU.S. 165\n, pointed the way.\" What way did it point? There the 1913 federal income tax Act, imposing a tax upon the \"entire net income arising or accruing from all sources during the preceding calendar year,\" was applied by the Federal Government to the whole net income of one who derived about three-fifths of it from \"buying goods in the several States, shipping them to foreign countries and there selling them.\" The question was whether such a tax validly could be imposed in the light of Art. I, 9, cl. 5 of the Constitution which provides that \"No Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State.\" This Court held that the export clause only precluded taxation of \"articles in course of exportation,\" and did not prohibit federal taxation of general income of the taxpayer \"from all sources,\" and that the tax was \"not laid on income from exportation because of its source,\" but upon general income \"from all sources,\" and was, therefore, within the federal power to levy. \n247 \nU.S., at 174\n. But here the States of Minnesota and Georgia \"laid [the taxes directly] on income from [exclusively interstate commerce] because of its source.\" They do not contend that they were laid on any intrastate commerce but admit \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 488]\n\u00a0\n there was none. I submit that the Lowe case does not in any sense \"point the way\" for direct taxation by a State of that which it finds and admits to be \"exclusively interstate commerce.\"\n\nThe Court then says \"The first case in this Court applying the doctrine [of the Lowe case] to interstate commerce was that of U.S. Glue Co. v. Town of Oak Creek, \n247 \nU.S. 321\n.\" I submit that nothing in that case is authority for the proposition that a State may tax \"exclusively interstate commerce.\" Exactly to the contrary, it sustained a tax only on \"that proportion of [the taxpayer's] income derived from business transacted . . . within the State . . . .\" \n247 \nU.S., at 329\n. That was the whole point of the case. There the Glue Company, a Wisconsin corporation, maintained its principal office and its only manufacturing plant in the town of Oak Creek, in that State. It also maintained stocks in branches in other States. It sold its products both locally in Wisconsin, and in other States in interstate commerce, shipping either directly from its plant in Wisconsin or from one of its branches in another State. In the year involved, about one-seventh of its sales were made locally in Wisconsin, four-sevenths of them were made, and the goods shipped from its factory directly to customers in other States, in interstate commerce, and two-sevenths of them were made from stocks in its branches in other States. Wisconsin's income tax statutes provided, in pertinent part, that \"any person engaged in business within and without the state shall . . . be taxed only upon that proportion of such income as is derived from business transacted . . . within the state.\" \"In order to determine what part of the income of a corporation engaged in business within and without the State . . . is to be taxed as derived from business transacted . . . within the State, reference is had to a formula prescribed by another statute,\" which employed the total income of the taxpayer \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 489]\n\u00a0\n as one of its several factors. \"This formula was applied in apportioning [the taxpayer's] net `business income' for the year\" involved, which produced an amount substantially exceeding one-seventh of its total income - the amount of its local sales. \"[U]pon the portion thus attributed to the State . . . the tax in question was levied.\" \n247 \nU.S., at 323\n-325. The Glue Company resisted the tax, contending that it was imposed directly upon interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, and, failing of relief in the Supreme Court of the State, it brought the case here on writ of error. This Court affirmed, concluding that the tax was \"measured . . . by the net proceeds from this part of plaintiff's business, along with a like imposition upon its income derived from other sources, and in the same way that other corporations doing business within the State are taxed upon that proportion of their income derived from business transacted . . . within the State . . . .\" \n247 \nU.S., at 329\n. (Emphasis added.)\n\nIt would seem too obvious for debate that if a taxpayer maintains its factory and produces all its goods in one State but sells the whole in other States in interstate commerce, it has derived some portion of its income in the State of manufacture or production. It should be obvious, too, that where such a manufacturer has sold some of its products locally and others of them in interstate commerce, that the mere ratio of intrastate sales to interstate ones well might not constitute a fair basis for determining what part of the net income was derived from intrastate commerce on the one hand, and interstate commerce on the other. Inasmuch as it has always been thought by American lawyers that the States cannot tax interstate commerce but may tax intrastate commerce, it has been deemed necessary for the State to determine what portion of the total income of the taxpayer was derived from intrastate commerce done within its borders \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 490]\n\u00a0\n and is therefore subject to its taxing power. To accomplish that purpose, most States, like Wisconsin in the U.S. Glue case, and like Minnesota and Georgia in the cases here, have adopted apportionment statutes, applicable to situations where the taxpayer is doing business both within and without the State, which use, as one of the several factors, the total income of the taxpayer in measuring the part of the income that was derived from within the taxing State. Those were the principles applied in the U.S. Glue case.\n\nThose principles were again made unmistakably clear, and were applied, by Mr. Justice Brandeis, in Underwood Typewriter Co. v. Chamberlain, \n254 \nU.S. 113\n, next relied on by the Court. That case does not hold that \"exclusively interstate commerce\" may be taxed by a State. It holds just the contrary. There Underwood Typewriter Company, though a Delaware corporation, had become a domiciliary of Connecticut and manufactured all of its machines at its factory in that State. It sold them both locally in Connecticut and in other States in interstate commerce. In the year involved, about 33 percent of its dollar volume of sales was made in Connecticut and the remainder in other States in interstate commerce. To determine the amount of Underwood's net income derived from intrastate commerce, Connecticut applied the formula prescribed by its apportionment statute. This resulted in a determination that 47 percent of Underwood's net income had been derived from intrastate commerce in Connecticut. Upon that amount it computed and assessed its 2 percent net income tax. This Court, in sustaining the tax, over Underwood's objection that it violated the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, said: \"This tax is based upon the net profits earned within the State. That a tax measured by net profits is valid, although these profits may have been derived in part, or \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 491]\n\u00a0\n indeed mainly, from interstate commerce is settled. U.S. Glue Co. v. Oak Creek, \n247 \nU.S. 321\n; Shaffer v. Carter, \n252 \nU.S. 37, 57\n. Compare Peck & Co. v. Lowe, \n247 \nU.S. 165\n. . . . The profits of the corporation were largely earned by a series of transactions beginning with manufacture in Connecticut and ending with sale in other States. In this it was typical of a large part of the manufacturing business conducted in the State. The legislature in attempting to put upon this business its fair share of the burden of taxation was faced with the impossibility of allocating specifically the profits earned by the processes conducted within its borders. It, therefore, adopted a method of apportionment which, for all that appears in this record, reached, and was meant to reach, only the profits earned within the State.\" \n254 \nU.S., at 120\n-121. (Emphasis added.)\n\nThe Court next takes up the case of Memphis Natural Gas Co. v. Beeler, \n315 \nU.S. 649\n. That case does not at all hold that \"exclusively interstate commerce\" may be taxed by a State. It, too, holds just the contrary. There Memphis Natural Gas Company purchased gas in Louisiana which it transported through its interstate pipe line to Tennessee where it sold 20 percent of it in interstate commerce, but it delivered 80 percent of it to Memphis Power & Light Company. \"That company distributes it to consumers under a contract with taxpayer which the Supreme Court of Tennessee has found to be a joint undertaking of the two companies whereby taxpayer furnishes gas from its pipeline, the Memphis company furnishes facilities and service for distribution and sale to consumers, and the proceeds of the sale, after deduction of specified costs and expenses, are divided between the two companies.\" \n315 \nU.S., at 652\n. A Tennessee statute imposed a tax on all foreign and domestic corporations of \"three per cent. of the net earnings . . . arising \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 492]\n\u00a0\n from business done wholly within the state, excluding earnings arising from interstate commerce.\" Ibid. Acting under that statute, a tax \"was laid on [the taxpayer's] net earnings from the distribution of gas under its contract with the Memphis company.\" \n315 \nU.S., at 653\n. This Court said that \"if the Supreme Court of Tennessee correctly construed taxpayer's contract with the Memphis company as establishing a profit-sharing joint adventure in the distribution of gas to Tennessee consumers, the taxpayer's net earnings under the contract were subject to local taxation.\" \n315 \nU.S., at 653\n-654. (Emphasis added.) This Court then found that the Supreme Court of Tennessee had correctly construed the contract and that the taxpayer's activities \"constituted participation in the business of distributing the gas to consumers after its delivery into the service pipes of the Memphis company,\" and sustained the tax, concluding: \"There is no contention or showing here that the tax assessed is not upon net earnings justly attributable to Tennessee.\" \n315 \nU.S., at 656\n, 657. (Emphasis added.)\n\nIt is true that Mr. Chief Justice Stone's opinion in the Beeler case contains the following language at page 656:\n\n \"In any case, even if taxpayer's business were wholly interstate commerce, a nondiscriminatory tax by Tennessee upon the net income of a foreign corporation having a commercial domicile there, cf. Wheeling Steel Corp. v. Fox, [298 \nU.S. 193], or upon net income derived from within the state, Shaffer v. Carter, \n252 \nU.S. 37, 57\n; Wisconsin v. Minnesota Mining Co., \n311 \nU.S. 452\n; cf. New York ex rel. Cohn v. Graves, \n300 \nU.S. 308\n, is not prohibited by the commerce clause on which alone taxpayer relies. U.S. Glue Co. v. Oak Creek, \n247 \nU.S. 321\n; Underwood Typewriter Co. v. Chamberlain, \n245 \nU.S. 113, 119\n-20 . . . .\" (Emphasis added.) \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 493]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The first sentence of that quotation caused Mr. Justice Burton to say, in Spector Motor Service v. O'Connor, \n340 \nU.S. 602, 609\n, note 6, that the statement was \"not essential to the decision in the case.\" But it is a mistake to say that Mr. Chief Justice Stone's language even comes near holding that exclusively interstate commerce may be taxed by a State. Note that he spoke of a foreign corporation \"having a commercial domicile\" in the taxing State. That connotes the conduct of intrastate commerce in the taxing State, such as was involved in the Fox case which he cited, i. e., the maintenance in the taxing State of the taxpayer's \"principal office\" in which its principal officers were located and conducted their business, and where a duplicate stock ledger and the records of capital stock transactions of the taxpayer were continuously kept. Of course that conduct amounted to the doing of intrastate commerce, and naturally the State could tax that intrastate commerce. And that's all the State did in Fox. Interstate commerce was not taxed either in Beeler or in Fox.\n\nThe Court then cites Bass, Ratcliff & Gretton, Ltd., v. State Tax Commission, \n266 \nU.S. 271\n, and Norfolk & W. R. Co. v. North Carolina, \n297 \nU.S. 682\n. But from the Court's own recitals respecting those cases it appears that the taxpayers there \"carried on substantial local activities\" within the taxing States, which permitted the States to lay taxes on that intrastate commerce, \"measured on a proportional formula.\" Those cases are exactly in line with the U.S. Glue, Underwood, and Beeler cases. They did not sustain a state tax on exclusively interstate commerce.\n\nThe Court next cites this Court's per curiam in West Publishing Co. v. McColgan, \n328 \nU.S. 823\n, and quotes from the California opinion, which was there affirmed, only the following: \"The employees were given space in the offices of attorneys in return for the use of plaintiff's \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 494]\n\u00a0\n books stored in such offices.\" It will be seen by reference to the California opinion that the California court had found considerably more intrastate commerce. It had found that the taxpayer \"regularly employed solicitors in [that] state who . . . were authorized to receive payments on orders taken by them, to collect delinquent accounts, and to make adjustments in case of complaints by customers, [and who] were given space in the offices of attorneys in return for the use of [the taxpayer's] books stored in such offices [which were] advertised as its local offices . . . .\" 27 Cal. 2d 705, 707, 166 P.2d 861, 862. That finding established the usual criteria which this Court has consistently held to constitute the doing of intrastate commerce. California determined and taxed only the amount of that intrastate commerce. It did not tax any interstate commerce. This Court in its per curiam affirmance cited the landmark Commerce Clause cases of U.S. Glue Co. v. Oak Creek, supra; Memphis Natural Gas Co. v. Beeler, supra, and the landmark Due Process Clause case of International Shoe Co. v. Washington, \n326 \nU.S. 310\n. Surely this makes it clear that at least this Court did not sustain any tax on interstate commerce.\n\nThe Court's quotation from Wisconsin v. Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co., \n311 \nU.S. 452\n, shows on its face that Wisconsin there taxed only income \"attributable to earnings within the taxing state . . . .\"\n\nSpector Motor Service v. O'Connor, \n340 \nU.S. 602\n, is quite consistent with the prior cases. There, by a process of elimination, the Court determined what the tax was not in arriving at what it was, and concluded that it was a tax which attached \"solely to the franchise of petitioner to do interstate business.\" The Court then said:\n\n \"This Court heretofore has struck down, under the Commerce Clause, state taxes upon the privilege of carrying on a business that was exclusively interstate in character. The constitutional infirmity of such a \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 495]\n\u00a0\n tax persists no matter how fairly it is apportioned to business done within the state.\" (Citing Alpha Portland Cement Co. v. Massachusetts, \n268 \nU.S. 203\n; Ozark Pipe Line Corp. v. Monier, \n266 \nU.S. 555\n; and referring, for comparison, to Interstate Pipe Line Co. v. Stone, \n337 \nU.S. 662, 669\n; Joseph v. Carter & Weekes Co., \n330 \nU.S. 422\n; Freeman v. Hewit, \n329 \nU.S. 249\n.)\n\n\n \"Our conclusion is not in conflict with the principle that, where a taxpayer is engaged both in intrastate and interstate commerce, a state may tax the privilege of carrying on intrastate business and, within reasonable limits, may compute the amount of the charge by applying the tax rate to a fair proportion of the taxpayer's business done within the state . . . .\" \n340 \nU.S., at 609\n-610.\n\n\n Is it not plain that this recent case holds that \"exclusively\" interstate commerce may not be taxed by a State?\n\nWith this demonstration of the holdings in the commerce cases relied upon by the Court, surely we can repeat, with the conviction of demonstrated truth, our statement that none of the cases relied on by the Court supports its holding \"that net income from the interstate operations of a foreign corporation may be subjected to state taxation provided the levy is not discriminatory and is properly apportioned to local activities within the taxing State . . . .\" The fact that such taxes may be fairly or \"properly apportioned\" is without legal consequence, for \"The constitutional infirmity of such a tax persists no matter how fairly it is apportioned to business done within the state.\" Spector Motor Service v. O'Connor, supra, at 609. That this Court has always sustained state taxes on fairly determined amounts of intrastate income should be evident enough from the shown fact that it has struck them down only when there was none. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 496]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Court says \"We believe that the rationale of these cases, involving income levies by States, controls the issues here.\" I agree that the rationale of those cases controls the issues here. But I cannot agree that those cases involved like \"income levies by States.\" They involved levies of income taxes on intrastate commerce, not on \"exclusively interstate commerce.\" Whereas, here both the Minnesota and Georgia courts have found that the income taxed by those States had derived \"exclusively [from] interstate commerce,\" and that the tax was not levied upon any intrastate commerce for there was none.\n\nIn these circumstances, I submit it is idle to say that the taxes were not laid \"on\" interstate commerce, but on the taxpayer's general income after all commerce had ended, and, therefore, did not burden, nor hence regulate, interstate commerce. For in addition to the plainness of the fact, the courts of Minnesota and Georgia have explicitly held in these cases that the income involved was derived \"exclusively [from] interstate commerce,\" and that the taxes were laid on that income. The taxes do not purport to have been, and could not have been, laid on any income derived from intrastate commerce in those States for there was none. It necessarily follows that the taxes were \"laid on income from [interstate commerce] because of its source,\" Peck & Co. v. Lowe, supra, at 174, just as in Spector Motor Service v. O'Connor, supra.\n\nThe Commerce Clause denies state power to regulate interstate commerce. It vests that power exclusively in Congress. Direct taxation of \"exclusively interstate commerce\" is a substantial regulation of it and, therefore, in the absence of congressional consent, the States may not directly tax it. This Court has so held every time the question has been presented here until today. Without congressional consent, the States of Minnesota and Georgia have laid taxes directly on what they admit was \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 497]\n\u00a0\n \"exclusively interstate commerce.\" Hence, in my view, those levies plainly violated the Commerce Clause of the Constitution and cannot stand consistently therewith and with our prior cases. I would, therefore, reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Minnesota in No. 12 and affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of Georgia in No. 33.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Northwestern did not qualify, under Minnesota laws, to do business in that State. During the years involved it maintained a small sales office in Minneapolis where it employed two salesmen and a secretary. Her duties were wholly clerical. It also employed from two to three salesmen at other points in Minnesota who worked out of their homes. Apart from a small amount of furniture in its Minneapolis office and two salesmen's automobiles, it owned no property within the State, nor did it have a bank account therein, and all salaries and reimbursable expenses of the salesmen and the secretary, office rent, telephone bills and all other expenses of the Minneapolis office, were paid directly from the home office. The salesmen solicited and took orders from dealers but they were not authorized to accept orders or make contracts for the company, nor were they authorized to receive payments, collect accounts or adjust claims. Orders which they received were mailed to the home office for approval of credit and for acceptance or rejection. The orders were acknowledged and accepted or rejected in writing, mailed from the home office directly to the purchasers. Accepted orders were filled by delivery of the cement to a rail carrier, f. o. b. plant at Mason City, and consigned to the purchasers. Sales invoices were prepared in and mailed from the home office directly to the purchasers who made payment directly to the company at its home office. The salesmen also called on contractors and other users of cement, not to solicit orders, but for the purpose of acquainting them with the merits of Northwestern's product and of advising them of the names of the local dealers where it might be purchased. There was evidence which might have supported a finding that these salesmen sometimes, in effect, took orders from contractors for, and delivered them to, \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 479]\n\u00a0\n local dealers who stocked Northwestern's cement, and thus were engaged in the local business of selling cement for such dealers, Cheney Brothers Co. v. Massachusetts, \n246 \nU.S. 147, 155\n. But no such finding was made, and there is more than colorable basis for believing that Minnesota did not press for such a finding, as any such practice could easily be ended by Northwestern and Minnesota's evident object was not to rest on such a basis, but to obtain an adjudication that its statute, 290.03, validly imposed a tax upon Northwestern's net income from Minnesota customers though derived \"exclusively [from] interstate commerce.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Minnesota Statutes, 1957, 290.19, provides, in substance, that where business is done \"partly within and partly without this state\" there shall be apportioned and allocated to Minnesota, as income derived from the intrastate commerce done in that State, an amount equal to the ratio which the taxpayer's (a) sales made within that State, (b) tangible property owned or used in that State, and (c) total payrolls paid in that State bear to the taxpayer's totals of those factors.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] To facilitate the conduct of its commerce, Stockham keeps a stock of its products in public warehouses in Birmingham, Chicago, Houston and Vernon (California), and maintains in each of those cities, and in each of 8 other widely separated industrial centers, including Atlanta, a small sales office. It has not qualified, under Georgia laws, to do business in that State. Its Atlanta office, which is listed in the Atlanta telephone and city directories, is staffed with \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 481]\n\u00a0\n one salesman and a secretary. Her duties are entirely clerical. The salesman spends about one-third of his working time in Georgia, and the remainder in four other southeastern States, calling on persons who are in position to recommend or specify the use of particular building supplies in construction work, such as architects, engineers and contractors, and on independent wholesalers and jobbers, endeavoring to impress them with the merits of, and to induce them to specify or recommend the use of, Stockham's products. Although he has no authority to accept orders or to make contracts for the company, he solicits orders from wholesalers and jobbers, and transmits such as he receives to the home office for approval of credit and acceptance or rejection, but \"for the most part\" orders are mailed directly by the purchasers to the home office in Birmingham. Accepted orders are filled by delivery of the goods to the purchasers, or to a common carrier consigned to the purchasers, at the Birmingham plant. Sales invoices are prepared and mailed by the home office directly to the purchasers who remit to the home office. The salesman does not receive payments, collect accounts or adjust claims. Except for the small amount of office furniture in its Atlanta sales office the company has no property in Georgia, nor does it have a bank account there, and the salaries of the salesman and secretary and their reimbursable expenses, the office rent, telephone bills and all other expenses of the Atlanta office are paid directly from the home office.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Code of Georgia, 1933, as amended, 92-3113 (4) provides that \"Where income is derived from the manufacture, production, or sale of tangible personal property, the portion of the net income therefrom attributable to property owned or business done within this State shall be taken to be the portion arrived at by\" the arithmetical average which the ratios of the taxpayer's (a) inventories of products held in the State, (b) compensation paid or incurred in the State, and (c) gross receipts from business done within the State bear to the taxpayer's totals of those factors. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 450, 498]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","133":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOHIO EX REL. EATON v. PRICE(1959)\nNo. 699\nArgued: Decided: June 8, 1959\n\n\n\n\n By a vote of four to four, the Court noted probable jurisdiction of the appeal in this case, which was believed by the four Members voting against such action to turn on the same question as that decided by a five-to-four vote on May 4, 1959, in Frank v. Maryland, \n359 \nU.S. 360\n.\n\n Reported below: 168 Ohio St. 123, 151 N. E. 2d 523.\n\nJ. Harvey Crow for appellant.\n\nCharles S. Rhyne and Joseph P. Duffy for appellee.\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\nProbable jurisdiction is noted.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, who voted to note probable jurisdiction, filed a separate memorandum.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, MR. JUSTICE CLARK, MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, and MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER, who voted against noting probable jurisdiction, filed a separate memorandum.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK, who voted against noting probable jurisdiction, filed a separate memorandum.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART took no part in the consideration or decision of this application.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN.\n\nThe Court's practice, when considering a jurisdictional statement whereby a litigant attempts to invoke the Court's jurisdiction on appeal, is quite similar to its well-known one on applications for writs of certiorari. That \n\n[360 \nU.S. 246, 247]\n\u00a0\n is, if four Justices or more are of opinion that the questions presented by the appeal should be fully briefed and argued orally, an order noting probable jurisdiction or postponing further consideration of the jurisdictional questions to a hearing on the merits is entered. Even though this action is taken on the votes of only a minority of four of the Justices, the Court then approaches plenary consideration of the case anew as a Court; votes previously cast in Conference that the judgment of the court appealed from be summarily affirmed, or that the appeal be dismissed for want of a substantial federal question, do not conclude the Justices casting them, and every member of the Court brings to the ultimate disposition of the case his judgment based on the full briefs and the oral arguments. Because of this, disagreeing Justices do not ordinarily make a public notation, when an order setting an appeal for argument is entered, that they would have summarily affirmed the judgment below, or have dismissed the appeal from it for want of a substantial federal question. Research has not disclosed any instance of such notations until today.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nThe reasons for such forbearance are obvious. Votes to affirm summarily, and to dismiss for want of a substantial federal question, it hardly needs comment, are votes on the merits of a case, and public expression of views on the merits of a case by a Justice before argument and decision \n\n[360 \nU.S. 246, 248]\n\u00a0\n may well be misunderstood; the usual practice in judicial adjudication in this country, where hearings are held, is that judgment follow, and not precede them. Public respect for the judiciary might well suffer if any basis were given for an assumption, however wrong in fact, that this were not so. Thus, the practice of not noting dissents from such orders has been followed, regardless of how strongly Justices may have felt as to the merits of a case or how clearly they have thought decision in it controlled by past precedent.\n2\n A precedent which appears to some Justices, upon the preliminary consideration given a jurisdictional statement, to be completely controlling may not appear to be so to other Justices. Plenary consideration can change views strongly held, and on close, reflective analysis precedents may appear inapplicable to varying fact situations. I believe that this approach will obtain in this case despite the unusual notation made today by four of my colleagues.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Likewise, dissents from orders granting certiorari are ordinarily not publicly noted, even though the grant or denial of certiorari, as we have often said, expresses no intimation as to the merits of a case. The sole exception found appears to be Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, \n343 \nU.S. 937\n, where the extraordinary power to grant certiorari before judgment in the Court of Appeals was exercised, and two Justices expressed their view that judgment in that court should have been obtained before this Court reviewed the case. Of course, in these circumstances, the notation could not possibly have implied or have been taken to imply any view of the case on the merits.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Notation of dissent from a denial of certiorari, or from a summary disposition of an appeal, is a completely different matter. Such notations occur with some frequency and I have made them myself. They are expressions of a Justice's view that a case should be heard when the Court decides not to have a hearing. Obviously such notations do not tend to foreclose or embarrass consideration of the case when it is later heard, since by definition it is not to be heard.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, MR. JUSTICE CLARK, MR. JUSTICE HARLAN and MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER are of the view that this case is controlled by, and should be affirmed on the authority of, Frank v. Maryland, \n359 \nU.S. 360\n.\n\nThe Frank case was decided on May 4. Application to review this case came before us within two weeks of the Frank decision. Since we deem the decision in the Maryland case to be completely controlling upon the Ohio decision, we are of the opinion that it would manifest \n\n[360 \nU.S. 246, 249]\n\u00a0\n disrespect by the Court for its own process to indicate its willingness to create an opportunity to overrule a case decided only a fortnight ago after thorough discussion at the bar and in the briefs and after the weightiest deliberation within the Court.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK.\n\nThis case cannot be considered in isolation. In his jurisdictional statement filed February 12, 1959, appellant stated that No. 278, Frank v. Maryland, \"is similar to the facts in this case at bar and involves the same constitutional questions,\" thus raising \"substantially the same problems presented by this appeal.\" We, therefore, held this case awaiting the decision in No. 278, Frank v. Maryland. It was decided May 4, 1959, by a 5-4 vote. \n359 \nU.S. 360\n. Thereafter this case was again considered and Brother STEWART, who was with the majority in Frank recused himself because the case came from Ohio's Supreme Court, where his father then served. After a study of the two cases I agreed with appellant that this case was \"similar to the facts,\" involved the same constitutional questions and raised \"substantially the same problems\" as the Frank case. In fact, as presented here, the cases appeared to be on all fours, except that the penalty provision in Maryland's Act is $20, while that of Ohio's law is a maximum of $200, or a jail sentence not exceeding 30 days. I therefore voted to affirm. My brothers in the majority in Frank voted likewise. However, the four dissenters in Frank voted to note probable jurisdiction and bring the case on for argument. The result, for all practical purposes, is a reconsideration of the constitutional question decided in Frank by a full Court. This flies in the face of the real purpose, as well as the intended effect, of our Rule 58 which permits rehearings only \"at the instance of a justice who concurred in the judgment or decision . . . .\" It likewise is, in my \n\n[360 \nU.S. 246, 250]\n\u00a0\n view, very poor judicial administration, especially since Frank was decided less than four weeks ago and only an eight-man Court can sit to review the question decided there.\n\nBelieving that the Bar will be confused by this action today, which beyond doubt will be characterized as a reconsideration of the Frank holding, I have noted my adherence to Frank. Otherwise my silence would be construed as acquiescence in a reconsideration of that case. While I have followed a policy of not noting my vote in Conference, except on the merits, our reports are full of such notations. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 246, 251]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","134":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOHIO v.

UNITED STATES(1959)\nNo. 471\nArgued: April 28, 1959Decided: June 22, 1959\n\n\n\n\n During the trial in a Federal District Court at which petitioner was convicted of knowingly and willfully evading the payment of income taxes for the years 1950, 1951 and 1952, an important issue was whether his handwritten record of dividends received in 1951 and 1952 had been given to an accounting firm while it was preparing his returns for those years rather than in 1953, after revenue agents had begun investigating his returns. To impeach the testimony of a partner in the accounting firm that they had not received this record until 1953, petitioner called for and obtained the production of certain documents in the possession of the Government; but he was denied production of a 600-word memorandum summarizing parts of a 3 1\/2-hour interrogation of the witness by a government agent. Held: Such memorandum was not a \"statement\" of the kind required to be produced under the so-called Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. 3500; its production was properly denied; and the conviction is sustained.

On the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Rice, Joseph F. Goetten and Lawrence K. Bailey.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner was convicted of knowingly and willfully evading the payment of income taxes for the years 1950, 1951 and 1952. A substantial part of the alleged evasion was failure to report income from dividends. Among the Government's exhibits at trial was a record, presumably \n\n[360 \nU.S. 343, 344]\n\u00a0\n contemporaneous and in the petitioner's handwriting, of dividends received during 1951 and 1952. This record reflected an amount of dividend income for 1951 substantially larger than that reported on the 1951 return. Petitioner contended that this record had been turned over to the accounting firm which regularly prepared his return, Arthur R. Sanfilippo & Co., in early 1952 for use in preparing his 1951 return, but that the figures had not been accurately entered on the return by the accountants. The Government's contention was that the record had not been given to the accounting firm until early 1953, subsequent to the initiation of the investigation of petitioner's tax affairs and long after the filing of the 1951 return. The time at which the record had been given to the accountants thus became directly relevant to the issue of criminal intent in the charge against the petitioner. Arthur R. Sanfilippo, an important government witness and the principal partner in the accounting firm, testified that his firm had not received the handwritten record of dividend income until early 1953.\n\nPrior to the trial, on July 16, 1956, during the course of an interrogation by agents of the Internal Revenue Service, Sanfilippo had been unable to recall when the dividend record had been received. More than a month later, August 23, 1956, Sanfilippo had met with revenue agents to verify and sign the transcript of his earlier testimony. At this meeting he executed a supplementary affidavit reciting that he wished to clarify his original answers and that he remembered that his firm had not received the dividend record until after revenue agents had begun their investigation of petitioner's tax returns. A memorandum of the conference at which this affidavit was executed was made by one of the agents present. On cross-examination of Sanfilippo the defense demanded and received various documents including the transcript of the July 16 interrogation and the August 23 \n\n[360 \nU.S. 343, 345]\n\u00a0\n affidavit. The defense also requested production of any memoranda, or of any part thereof summarizing what Sanfilippo had said, which had been made of the August 23 conference. The trial judge denied this request on the ground that the Act of September 2, 1957, 71 Stat. 595, 18 U.S.C. 3500 - the so-called \"Jencks\" Act - governing the production of statements made to government agents by government witnesses, precluded production of the requested memorandum since it was not within the definition of \"statement\" in (e) of the Act.\n1\n The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed. 258 F.2d 397. Together with several other cases raising Jencks Act problems, we granted certiorari, \n358 \nU.S. 905\n, to determine the scope and meaning of this new statute.\n\nAccurate analysis of these problems as a basis of their appropriate solution requires due appreciation of the background against which the statutory terms must be projected.\n\nExercising our power, in the absence of statutory provision, to prescribe procedures for the administration of justice in the federal courts, this Court, on June 3, 1957, in Jencks v. United States, \n353 \nU.S. 657\n, decided that the defense in a federal criminal prosecution was entitled, under certain circumstances, to obtain, for impeachment purposes, statements which had been made to government agents by government witnesses. These statements were therefore to be turned over to the defense at the time of cross-examination if their contents related to the subject matter of the witness' direct testimony, and if a demand had been made for specific statements which had been written by the witness or, if orally made, as recorded by \n\n[360 \nU.S. 343, 346]\n\u00a0\n agents of the Government. We also held that the trial judge was not to examine the statements to determine if they contained material inconsistent with the testimony of the witness before deciding whether he would turn them over to the defense. Once the statements had been shown to contain related material only the defense was adequately equipped to decide whether they had value for impeachment. This decision only concerned production and therefore did not purport to modify the laws of evidence governing the admissibility of prior statements of a witness.\n\nThe decision promptly gave rise to sharp controversy and concern. The day following our opinion the House of Representatives was told that the decision in Jencks posed a serious problem of national security and that legislation would be introduced. 103 Cong. Rec. 8290. The same day H. R. 7915, the first of eleven House bills dealing with what became the Jencks problem, was introduced in the House.\n2\n Defendants' counsel began to invoke the Jencks decision to justify demands for production far more sweeping than that involved in Jencks, and under circumstances far removed from those of that case, and some federal trial judges acceded to those excessive demands.\n3\n The Department of Justice, concerned over these rapid intrusions of Jencks into often totally unrelated \n\n[360 \nU.S. 343, 347]\n\u00a0\n areas, drafted legislation to clarify and delimit the reach of Jencks. See 103 Cong. Rec. 15781. On June 24, 1957, this legislation was introduced into the Senate by Senator O'Mahoney acting for himself and several other Senators. 103 Cong. Rec. 10057. After study by a subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee the bill was reported out, 103 Cong. Rec. 10601, then withdrawn and a completely new measure substituted. 103 Cong. Rec. 14913. When the bill reached the floor for debate Senator O'Mahoney proposed an amendment in the nature of a substitute which was adopted, 103 Cong. Rec. 15938, and the bill passed the Senate on August 26. Ibid. In the House the original H. R. 7915, after being amended in Committee, see 103 Cong. Rec. 10925, was passed on August 27, 103 Cong. Rec. 16130, and then substituted for the text of the Senate bill. 103 Cong. Rec. 16131. The two versions went to Conference. The Conference Report was agreed to by the Senate on August 29, 103 Cong. Rec. 16490, and by the House the next day. 103 Cong. Rec. 16742. The Act was approved on September 2, and became law as 3500 of the Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C.\n4\n Congress \n\n[360 \nU.S. 343, 348]\n\u00a0\n had determined to exercise its power to define the rules that should govern in this particular area in the trial of criminal cases instead of leaving the matter to the lawmaking of the courts. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 343, 349]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn almost every enactment there are gaps to be filled and ambiguities to be resolved by judicial construction. This statute is not free from them. Here, however, the detailed particularity with which Congress has spoken has narrowed the scope for needful judicial interpretation to an unusual degree. The statute clearly defines procedures and plainly indicates the circumstances for their application. Since this case is the first calling for authoritative exposition of an Act that frequently comes into use in federal criminal prosecutions we deem it appropriate to explicate the construction of the statute required by the circumstances of this case.\n\n1. Subsection (a) requires that no statement of a government witness made to an agent of the Government and in the Government's possession shall be turned over to the defense until the witness has testified on direct examination. This section manifests the general statutory aim to restrict the use of such statements to impeachment. Subsections (b), (c) and (d) provide procedures for the production of \"statements,\" and for the consequences to the Government of failure to produce. Subsection (e) restrictively defines with particularity the term \"statement\" as used in the three preceding sections. The suggestion that the detailed statutory procedures restrict only the production of the type of statement described in subsection (e), leaving all other statements, e. g., non-verbatim, non-contemporaneous records of oral statements, to be produced under pre-existing rules of procedure as if the statute had not been passed at all, flouts the whole history and purpose of the enactment. It would mock Congress to attribute to it an intention to surround the production of the carefully restricted and most trustworthy class of statements with detailed procedural safeguards, while allowing more dubious and less \n\n[360 \nU.S. 343, 350]\n\u00a0\n reliable documents a more favored legal status, free from safeguards in the tournament of trials. To state such a construction demonstrates its irrationality; the authoritative legislative history precludes its acceptance.\n\nTo be sure, the statute does not, in so many words, state that it is the exclusive, limiting means of compelling for cross-examination purposes the production of statements of a government witness to an agent of the Government. But some things too clearly evince a legislative enactment to call for a redundancy of utterance. One of the most important motive forces behind the enactment of this legislation was the fear that an expansive reading of Jencks would compel the undiscriminating production of agent's summaries of interviews regardless of their character or completeness. Not only was it strongly feared that disclosure of memoranda containing the investigative agent's interpretations and impressions might reveal the inner workings of the investigative process and thereby injure the national interest, but it was felt to be grossly unfair to allow the defense to use statements to impeach a witness which could not fairly be said to be the witness' own rather than the product of the investigator's selections, interpretations and interpolations. The committee reports of both Houses and the floor debates clearly manifest the intention to avoid these dangers by restricting production to those statements specifically defined in the bill.\n5\n Indeed both the House \n\n[360 \nU.S. 343, 351]\n\u00a0\n and Senate bills as they went to Conference explicitly so stated. See 103 Cong. Rec. 16130; 103 Cong. Rec. 16125. Nothing in the Conference Reports or the limited debate following Conference intimated the slightest intention to change the exclusive nature of the measure. Indeed the reports and debate proceeded on the explicit assumption that the bill retained as a major purpose the barring of all statements not specifically defined.\n6\n The purpose of the Act, its fair reading and its overwhelming legislative history compel us to hold that statements of a government witness made to an agent of the Government which cannot be produced under the terms of 18 U.S.C. 3500 cannot be produced at all.\n\n2. Since the statutory procedures are exclusive they constitute the rule of law governing the production of the statement at issue in this case and it becomes necessary to determine the scope and meaning of the statutory definition of \"statement\" contained in (e). Clause (1) of (e) permits the production of \"a written statement made by said witness and signed or otherwise adopted or approved by him . . . .\" Although some situations may arise, creating peripheral problems of construction, its import is clear. Clause (2) widens the definition of \"statement\" to include \"a stenographic, mechanical, electrical, or other recording, or a transcription thereof, which is a substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement made by said witness to an agent of the Government and recorded contemporaneously with the making of such oral statement.\" Clearly this provision allows the production of mechanical or stenographic recordings of oral statements, \n\n[360 \nU.S. 343, 352]\n\u00a0\n even though later transcribed. A preliminary problem for determining that the statement now before us may be produced is whether the statutory phrase \"other recording\" allows an even wider scope for production. We find the legislative history persuasive that the statute was meant to encompass more than mere automatic reproductions of oral statements.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nHowever, such a finding is only the beginning of the task of construction. It is clear that Congress was concerned that only those statements which could properly be called the witness' own words should be made available to the defense for purposes of impeachment.\n8\n It was important that the statement could fairly be deemed to reflect fully and without distortion what had been said to the government agent. Distortion can be a product of selectivity as well as the conscious or inadvertent infusion of the recorder's opinions or impressions. It is clear from the continuous congressional emphasis on \"substantially verbatim recital,\" and \"continuous, narrative statements made by the witness recorded verbatim, or nearly so . . .,\" see Appendix B, post, p. 358, that the legislation was designed to eliminate the danger of distortion and misrepresentation inherent in a report which merely selects portions, albeit accurately, from a lengthy oral recital. Quoting out of context is one of the most frequent and powerful modes of misquotation. We think it consistent with this legislative history,\n9\n and with the generally restrictive terms of the statutory provision, to require that summaries of an oral statement which evidence substantial \n\n[360 \nU.S. 343, 353]\n\u00a0\n selection of material, or which were prepared after the interview without the aid of complete notes, and hence rest on the memory of the agent, are not to be produced. Neither, of course, are statements which contain the agent's interpretations or impressions. In expounding this standard we do not wish to create the impression of a \"delusive exactness.\" The possible permutations of fact and circumstance are myriad. Trial courts will be guided by the indicated standard, informed by fidelity to the congressional purposes we have outlined. There is nothing impalpable about these provisions. Since we feel the statutory standard has guiding definiteness, it would be idle to attempt a minute enumeration of particular situations to which it is to be applied. Such a vain attempt at forecasting myriad diversities with minor variance is as futile and uncalled for in this as in so many other areas of the law. That is what the judicial process is for - to follow a generally clear direction in dealing with a new diversity as it may occasionally arise. Final decision as to production must rest, as it does so very often in procedural and evidentiary matters, within the good sense and experience of the district judge guided by the standards we have outlined,\n10\n and subject to the appropriately limited review of appellate courts.\n11\n\u00a0\n\n[360 \nU.S. 343, 354]\n\u00a0\n\n\n3. The statute itself provides no procedure for making a determination whether a particular statement comes within the terms of (e) and thus may be produced if related to the subject matter of the witness' testimony. Ordinarily the defense demand will be only for those statements which satisfy the statutory limitations. Thus the Government will not produce documents clearly beyond the reach of the statute for to do so would not be responsive to the order of the court. However, when it is doubtful whether the production of a particular statement is compelled by the statute, we approve the practice of having the Government submit the statement to the trial judge for an in camera determination. Indeed, any other procedure would be destructive of the statutory purpose. The statute governs the production of documents; it does not purport to affect or modify the rules of evidence regarding admissibility and use of statements once produced. The Act's major concern is with limiting and regulating defense access to government papers, and it is designed to deny such access to those statements which do not satisfy the requirements of (e), or do not relate to the subject matter of the witness' testimony. It would indeed defeat this design to hold that the defense may see statements in order to argue whether it should be allowed to see them.\n\nIt is also the function of the trial judge to decide, in light of the circumstances of each case, what, if any, evidence \n\n[360 \nU.S. 343, 355]\n\u00a0\n extrinsic to the statement itself may or must be offered to prove the nature of the statement. In most cases the answer will be plain from the statement itself. In others further information might be deemed relevant to assist the court's determination. This is a problem of the sound and fair administration of a criminal prosecution and its solution must be guided by the need, reflected in so much of our law of evidence, to avoid needless trial of collateral and confusing issues while assuring the utmost fairness to a criminal defendant. See, e. g., Nardone v. United States, \n308 \nU.S. 338, 342\n.\n\nIn light of these principles the case before us is clear. Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals correctly held that the sole standard governing production of the agent's memorandum of his conference with Sanfilippo was 18 U.S.C. 3500. The district judge and a unanimous Court of Appeals held that the statement was not within the definition of statement in (e) as properly understood by them. We have examined the statement and the record and find that the determination of the two courts below was justified and therefore must be sustained.\n12\n It would bespeak a serious reflection on the conscience and capacity of the federal judiciary if both a trial judge and a Court of Appeals were found to have disregarded the command of Congress, duly interpreted, \n\n[360 \nU.S. 343, 356]\n\u00a0\n for making available a prior statement of a government witness in a case. Against such a contingency there is always the safeguard of this Court's reviewing power.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n [For opinion of MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, see post, p. 360.]\n\n  APPENDIX A TO OPINION OF THE COURT.\n\n\n SUMMARY OF LEGISLATIVE HISTORY DEMONSTRATING  THE INTENT OF THE CONFERENCE MEASURE TO RETAIN AS A PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THE ACT A PROHIBITION OF  PRODUCTION OF ALL STATEMENTS NOT DESCRIBED IN  SUBSECTION (E). (SEE PP. 350-351, ANTE.)\n\n\n The bills as they went to Congress contained explicit provisions making them exclusive. For example, the Senate bill provided in subsection (a):\n\n \"In any criminal prosecution brought by the United States, no statement or report of a Government witness or prospective Government witness (other than the defendant) made to an agent of the Government which is in the possession of the United States shall be the subject of subpena, or inspection, except, if provided in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, or as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.\" (Emphasis added.) 103 Cong. Rec. 16130.\n\n\n The House bill contained a similar provision.\n\nAlthough the last phrase of this section was dropped out when the section was rewritten to eliminate reference to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, see 103 Cong. Rec. 16488; H. R. Rep. No. 1271, 85th Cong., 1st Sess., there is no indication that its omission was intended \n\n[360 \nU.S. 343, 357]\n\u00a0\n to work a silent and radical change in the entire concept and purpose of the Act. Both the Conference Report of the House Managers and the floor remarks of the Senate Conferees enumerate the particular changes which had been made to meet earlier specific differences and objections. No mention is made, nor can an intimation be found, of any intention to change the exclusive nature of the measure. The House Conference Report enumerates the specific changes and then states that \"To remove any doubt as to the kinds of statements affected by the bill as agreed to by the conferees, a new paragraph `e' was added . . . expressly defining the term `statement.'\" H. R. Rep. No. 1271, 85th Cong., 1st Sess. 3. In the Senate, Senator O'Mahoney, in response to a question, gave the specific changes which had been made in the bill by the Conference, and he did not give the slightest indication that it had lost its exclusive nature. 103 Cong. Rec. 16487.\n\nWhat small debate there was following the Conference Report supports the conclusion that no change in the exclusiveness of the bill was intended. For example, Senator O'Mahoney, introducing the conference measure, stated that, \"[t]here was some fear upon the part of the Department of Justice that the Senate bill would create a greater latitude for the examination of irrelevant reports of agents. The language which was devised by the conferees has cleared up the doubts . . . .\" 103 Cong. Rec. 16487. See also 103 Cong. Rec. 16488-16489. In the House, Representative Keating, one of the Conferees, explained that \"The conferees provided that the only statements a defendant could see, and then only in the courtroom were those actually signed or formally approved by the witness or a stenographic verbatim recital of a statement made by a witness which is recorded contemporaneously with the making of such oral statement. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 343, 358]\n\u00a0\n In other words, only those statements need be produced in court by the Government which could be shown in court to impeach the credibility of the witness.\" 103 Cong. Rec. 16739. See also 103 Cong. Rec. 16742.\n\n  APPENDIX B TO OPINION OF THE COURT.\n\n\n PARTIAL SUMMARY OF LEGISLATIVE HISTORY BEARING  ON THE PROPER CONSTRUCTION OF SUBSECTION (E).   (SEE PP. 351 AND 352, ANTE.)\n\n\n The original Senate bill, as passed by the Senate, allowed the production of \"any transcriptions or records of oral statements made by the witness to an agent of the Government . . . .\" See 103 Cong. Rec. 16130. During the course of the Senate debate an amendment had been offered to limit this provision to mechanical transcriptions or recordings. See 103 Cong. Rec. 15930-15931. This amendment was rejected after Senator O'Mahoney, sponsor of the legislation, had argued that it would leave the bill too \"limited.\" \"All we are asking,\" he stated, \"is that the records which are relevant and competent, which deal with the oral statements made by Government witnesses whom the Government puts on the stand, with respect to the matters concerning which they testify, be made available.\" 103 Cong. Rec. 15932. Thus the bill as it left the Senate was clearly not confined to automatic reproductions of oral statements, although its further reach was not explicitly demarcated.\n\nThe House bill, as passed, allowed only the production of written statements signed by the witness or otherwise adopted or approved. 103 Cong. Rec. 16125. The present language emerged from the Conference.\n\nSenator O'Mahoney, sponsor of the original Senate bill and one of the Senate Conferees, in submitting the conference bill, made it clear that (e) \"would include a memorandum \n\n[360 \nU.S. 343, 359]\n\u00a0\n made by an agent of the Government of an oral statement made to him by a Government witness . . . .\" 103 Cong. Rec. 16488. Senator Javits then asked:\n\n\". . . what has been done with the so-called records provision is to tie it down to those cases in which the agent actually purports to make a substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement that the witness has made to him - not the agent's own comments or a recording of his own ideas, but a substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement which the witness has made to him, and as transcribed by him; is that correct?\" Ibid.\n\n\n Senator O'Mahoney replied, \"Precisely.\" Thus although the Senate history indicates that the bill was restricted to a \"substantially verbatim recital,\" it is apparent that the Act was not designed to be restricted to mere mechanical transcription.\n\nThe proceedings in the House are less clear. It is true that Representative Keating, one of the House Conferees, did say that only stenographic verbatim recitals need be produced. 103 Cong. Rec. 16739. But this was said in reply to Representative Celler's statement that the conference measure was as liberal as the original Senate bill. Representative Celler was also a House Conferee. The report of the House Managers, signed by all the House Conferees, after pointing out that the term \"statement\" had been defined in the bill, stated:\n\n \"It is believed that the provisions of the bill as agreed to by the conferees are in line with the standard enunciated by Judge George H. Moore of the eastern district of Missouri in . . . U.S. v. Anderson . . . which is set forth at page 14552 [sic] of the daily Congressional Record of August 26, 1957.\" H. R. Rep. No. 1271, 85th Cong., 1st Sess. 3. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 343, 360]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n In the opinion referred to, Judge Moore had explicitly limited the type of oral statement which could be produced under the Jencks decision to\n\n\". . . only continuous, narrative statements made by the witness recorded verbatim, or nearly so, and does not include notes made during the course of an investigation (or reports compiled therefrom) which contain the subjective impressions, opinions, or conclusions of the person or persons making such notes.\" 103 Cong. Rec. 15940.\n\n\n This standard, explicitly incorporated into the House Report, has a dual significance. It not only goes beyond mechanical or stenographic statements, in defining the statements which must be made available to the defense, but indicates that once beyond that point a very restrictive standard is to be applied.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] We reject the Government's contention that, at trial, petitioner asserted only that the statute did not cover his request for production, and failed to assert that, if the statute was applicable, the memorandum could be produced under its terms. We find that objection to the interpretation of the statute was adequately made.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 103 Cong. Rec. 8327. The other House bills were H. R. 8225, 103 Cong. Rec. 9572; H. R. 8243, 103 Cong. Rec. 9746; H. R. 8335, 103 Cong. Rec. 10181; H. R. No. 8341, 103 Cong. Rec. 10181; H. R. 8388, 103 Cong. Rec. 10403; H. R. 8393, 103 Cong. Rec. 10403; H. R. 8414, 103 Cong.

Rec. 10589.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Many of the cases in the lower federal courts after Jencks and prior to the enactment of the statute are collected in the statement of the Attorney General contained in H. R. Rep. No. 700, 85th Cong., 1st Sess., and in S. Rep. No. 569, 85th Cong., 1st Sess. See also S. Rep. No. 981, 85th Cong., 1st Sess.; 103 Cong. Rec. 15939-15941.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The statute provides:\n\n\"(a) In any criminal prosecution brought by the United States, no statement or report in the possession of the United States which was made by a Government witness or prospective Government witness (other than the defendant) to an agent of the Government shall be the subject of subpena, discovery, or inspection until said witness has testified on direct examination in the trial of the case.\n\n\n\"(b) After a witness called by the United States has testified on direct examination, the court shall, on motion of the defendant, order the United States to produce any statement (as hereinafter defined) of the witness in the possession of the United States which relates to the subject matter as to which the witness has testified. If the entire contents of any such statement relate to the subject matter of the testimony of the witness, the court shall order it to be delivered directly to the defendant for his examination and use.\n\n\n\"(c) If the United States claims that any statement ordered to be produced under this section contains matter which does not relate \n\n[360 \nU.S. 343, 348]\n\u00a0\n to the subject matter of the testimony of the witness, the court shall order the United States to deliver such statement for the inspection of the court in camera. Upon such delivery the court shall excise the portions of such statement which do not relate to the subject matter of the testimony of the witness. With such material excised, the court shall then direct delivery of such statement to the defendant for his use. If, pursuant to such procedure, any portion of such statement is withheld from the defendant and the defendant objects to such withholding, and the trial is continued to an adjudication of the guilt of the defendant, the entire text of such statement shall be preserved by the United States and, in the event the defendant appeals, shall be made available to the appellate court for the purpose of determining the correctness of the ruling of the trial judge. Whenever any statement is delivered to a defendant pursuant to this section, the court in its discretion, upon application of said defendant, may recess proceedings in the trial for such time as it may determine to be reasonably required for the examination of such statement by said defendant and his preparation for its use in the trial.\n\n\n\"(d) If the United States elects not to comply with an order of the court under paragraph (b) or (c) hereof to deliver to the defendant any such statement, or such portion thereof as the court may direct, the court shall strike from the record the testimony of the witness, and the trial shall proceed unless the court in its discretion shall determine that the interests of justice require that a mistrial be declared.\n\n\n\"(e) The term `statement,' as used in subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section in relation to any witness called by the United States, means -\n\n\n\"(1) a written statement made by said witness and signed or otherwise adopted or approved by him; or\n\n\n\"(2) a stenographic, mechanical, electrical, or other recording, or a transcription thereof, which is a substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement made by said witness to an agent of the Government and recorded contemporaneously with the making of such oral statement.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] See, e. g., H. R. Rep. No. 700, 85th Cong., 1st Sess.; S. Rep. No. 569, 85th Cong., 1st Sess.; S. Rep. No. 981, 85th Cong., 1st Sess. The statements in the reports are frequent and clear. There are many like expressions on the floor of both chambers. For example, there was a lengthy debate in the Senate over an amendment which would have restricted the type of statement which could be produced beyond the limitations already incorporated in the Senate bill. The entire debate proceeded on the explicit assumption that only those \n\n[360 \nU.S. 343, 351]\n\u00a0\n statements which were enumerated in the bill could be produced at all. 103 Cong. Rec. 15930-15935. See also 103 Cong. Rec. 16116. There are many similar expressions during the debates.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] See legislative history summarized in Appendix A, post, p. 356.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] See legislative history summarized in Appendix B, post, p. 358.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] See, e. g., 103 Cong. Rec. 16739. See also many statements to the same effect in the House and Senate Reports.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] See legislative material cited and quoted in Appendix B, post, p. 358.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Of course the statute does not provide that inconsistency between the statement and the witness' testimony is to be a relevant consideration. Neither is it significant whether or not the statement is admissible as evidence.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] The statute as interpreted does not reach any constitutional barrier. Congress has the power to prescribe rules of procedure for the federal courts, and has from the earliest days exercised that power. See 37 Harv. L. Rev., at 1086 and 1093-1094, for a collection of such legislation. The power of this Court to prescribe rules of procedure and evidence for the federal courts exists only in the absence of a relevant Act of Congress. See Funk v. United States, \n290 \nU.S. 371\n, \n\n[360 \nU.S. 343, 354]\n\u00a0\n 382; Gordon v. United States, \n344 \nU.S. 414, 418\n. Much of the law of evidence and of discovery is concerned with limitations on a party's right to have access to, and to admit in evidence, material which has probative force. It is obviously a reasonable exercise of power over the rules of procedure and evidence for Congress to determine that only statements of the sort described in (e) are sufficiently reliable or important for purposes of impeachment to justify a requirement that the Government turn them over to the defense.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] The statement consists of a brief agent's summary, of approximately 600 words, of a conference lasting 3 1\/2 hours. It was made up after the conference and consists of several brief statements of information given by Sanfilippo in response to questions of the agent. The typed agent's memorandum is clearly not a virtually verbatim narrative of the conference but represents the agent's selection of those items of information deemed appropriate for inclusion in the memorandum. Thus by applying the governing standard set forth at pp. 352 and 353, supra, it is clear that the lower courts did not err in refusing to hand the statement over to the defense.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS join, concurring in the result.\n\nI concur in the result but see no justification for the Court's ranging far afield of the necessities of the case in an opinion essaying obiter a general interpretation of the so-called \"Jencks Act,\" 18 U.S.C. (Supp. V) 3500. Many more concrete cases must be adjudicated in the District Courts before we shall be familiar with all the problems created by the statute.\n\nWe of this Court, removed as we are from the tournament of trials, must be careful to guard against promulgating general pronouncements which prevent the trial judges from exercising their traditional responsibility. The Court's opinion well observes that the hope for a fair administration of the statute rests in the final analysis with its responsible application in the federal trial courts. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 343, 361]\n\u00a0\n This responsibility of the federal trial judge, it goes without saying, is not to be delegated to the prosecutor. Questions of production of statements are not to be solved through one party's determination that interview reports fall without the statute and hence that they are not to be produced to defense counsel or to the trial judge for his determination as to their coverage. I am confident that federal trial judges will devise procedural methods whereby their responsibility is not abdicated in favor of the unilateral determination of the prosecuting arm of the Government.\n\nCongress had no thought to invade the traditional discretion of trial judges in evidentiary matters beyond checking extravagant interpretations of our decision in Jencks v. United States, \n353 \nU.S. 657\n, which were said to have been made by some lower courts. Indeed Congress took particular pains to make it clear that the legislation \"reaffirms\" that decision's holding that a defendant on trial in a criminal prosecution is entitled to relevant and competent reports and statements in possession of the Government touching the events and activities as to which a government witness has testified at the trial. S. Rep. No. 981, 85th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 3. And see H. R. Rep. No. 700, 85th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 3, 4. I see no necessity in the circumstances of this case which calls for a decision whether 3500 is the sole vehicle whereby production of prior statements of government witnesses to government agents may be made to the defense. Certainly nothing in the statute or its legislative history justifies our stripping the trial judge of all discretion to make nonqualifying reports available in proper cases. Take the case of a memorandum of a government agent simply stating that a person interrogated for several hours as to his knowledge of the defendant's alleged criminal transactions, denied any knowledge of \n\n[360 \nU.S. 343, 362]\n\u00a0\n them. Then suppose that person is called as a government witness at the trial and testifies in great detail as to the defendant's alleged criminal conduct. The agent's summary would not be a detailed account of the several hours' interrogation of the witness by the Government, and would not meet the definition of statement in subsection (e) of the statute; but it is inconceivable that Congress intended, by the Jencks statute, to strip the trial judge of discretion to order such a summary produced to the defense. Even the Government, in oral argument, conceded that the statute did not strip the district judges of discretion to order production of such a statement under some circumstances.\n1\n There is an obvious constitutional problem in an interpretation that the statute restrains the trial judge from ordering such a statement produced. Less substantial restrictions than this of the common-law rights of confrontation of one's accusers have been struck down by this Court under the Sixth Amendment. See Kirby v. United States, \n174 \nU.S. 47\n. And in such circumstances, there becomes pertinent the command of that Amendment that criminal defendants have compulsory process to obtain witnesses for their defense. See United States v. Schneiderman, 106 F. Supp. 731, 738. It is true that our holding in Jencks was not put on constitutional grounds, for it did not have to be; but it would be idle to say that the commands of the Constitution were not close \n\n[360 \nU.S. 343, 363]\n\u00a0\n to the surface of the decision; indeed, the Congress recognized its constitutional overtones in the debates on the statute.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nNo express language of the statute forbids the production, after a witness has testified, of any statement outside the coverage of the definition in subsection (e), and certainly the legislative history is no adequate support for reading an absolute prohibition into it. It is true that until the Conference Report the bill contained a provision making it in terms exclusive; but this language was deleted in Conference. I should think this change would support an inference negating any absolute exclusivity. To be sure, the change was not explained in the hurried floor discussions which followed the agreement in Conference, in the hectic closing days of the session,\n3\n but the absence of an explanation for the change can argue in favor of its being taken at face value. Certainly this Court should not decide the contrary against the backdrop of a serious question of potential invasion of Sixth Amendment rights. This is not to ignore the obvious intent of Congress that the statute provide the primary tests of what the Government should produce; it is only to recognize that it is not inconsistent with achievement of the statute's aim to require the production of statements outside the scope of the statute where the fair administration of criminal justice so demands. And certainly the statute cannot be said to be exclusive where the Constitution demands production. Of course, the trial judge may fashion procedural safeguards as to those producible statements lying outside the statute's purview, perhaps by analogy to the statutory procedures for the excision of irrelevant matter. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 343, 364]\n\u00a0\n It is sufficient to say in this case that the summary in controversy does not appear to fall within the category of statements, outside the definition in subsection (e), as to which the trial judge's discretion might be exercised.\n4\n Decision need turn on no broader ground. Cf. Lee v. Madigan, \n358 \nU.S. 228, 230\n-231. What was stated in the agent's summary was already known in every important detail to the defense from the transcript of the interview of July 16 and the affidavit of August 23.\n\nThe summary in this case does not present the question whether the statute requires the production of a statement which records part of, but not the entire interview between the witness and the government agent. This is a problem which also should be left to the development of the interpretive case law, and in fact I do not read the Court's opinion as essaying a definitive answer. It is a problem I suppose which would be raised by a stenographic, electrical or mechanical transcript of only part of an interview. There is nothing in the legislative history of the statute to indicate that a stenographic transcript of a 10-minute segment of an hour's interview would not be producible under the statute. If such a transcript would be producible, how distinguish a substantially faithful reproduction, made by the interviewer from his notes or from memory, of any part of the interview? Since, as the Court's opinion concedes, statements made up from interviewer's notes\n5\n are not per se unproducible, one would \n\n[360 \nU.S. 343, 365]\n\u00a0\n suppose that a summary, part of which gave a substantial verbatim account of part of the interview, would, as to that part, be producible under the statute. Certainly a statement can be most useful for impeachment even though it does not exhaust all that was said upon the occasion. We must not forget that when confronted with his prior statement upon cross-examination the witness always has the opportunity to offer an explanation. The statute is to be given a reasonable construction, and the courts must not lose sight of the fact that the statute regulates production of material for possible use in cross-examination, and does not regulate admissibility into evidence - as the Court properly observes. Here too, the constitutional question close to the surface of our holding in Jencks must be borne in mind.\n\nI repeat that Congress made crystal clear its purpose only to check extravagant interpretations of Jencks in the lower courts while reaffirming the basic holding that a defendant on trial should be entitled to statements helpful in the cross-examination of government witnesses who testify against him. Although it is plain that some restrictions on production have been introduced, it would do violence to the understanding on which Congress, working at high speed under the pressures of the end of a session, passed the statute, if we were to sanction applications of it exalting and exaggerating its restrictions, in disregard of the congressional aim of reaffirming the basic Jencks principle of assuring the defendant a fair opportunity to make his defense. Examination of the papers so sedulously kept from defendant in this case and companion cases does not indicate any governmental interest, outside of the prosecution's interest in conviction, that is served by nondisclosure, and one may wonder whether this is not usually so. There inheres in an overrigid interpretation and application of the statute the hazard \n\n[360 \nU.S. 343, 366]\n\u00a0\n of encouraging a practice of government agents' taking statements in a fashion calculated to insulate them from production. I am confident that the District Courts will bear all these factors in mind in devising practical solutions to the problems of production in the many areas which cannot fairly be said to be determined by the affirmance of the judgment in this case.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In response to a case put similar to the one given here, government counsel suggested that the primary remedy of the defendant was to call the interviewer. Of course this would only be adequate if the defense had some reason to believe that an interview of such character had taken place and if the witness recalled the interviewer's name. Pressed further as to cases of the nonavailability of the interviewer, government counsel made it clear that \"I would certainly not want to carry the burden of saying that in some extraordinary situation where there was no other possible way of getting hold of it [the summary] that there might not be exceptions read into the statute - what I am talking about now is the normal, ordinary case.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See H.

JUSTICE WHITTAKER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThese tax refund cases present the question whether petitioners, Parsons in No. 218 and Huss in No. 305, are entitled to an allowance for depletion on amounts received by them under contracts with the owners of coal-bearing lands for the strip mining of coal from those lands and the delivery of it to the landowners. The cases were heard by the same courts below. The District Court ruled that petitioners had no depletable interest in the coal in place and rendered judgment for the respondent - collector in each case. The Court of Appeals affirmed both judgments. 255 F.2d 595, 599. Because of an asserted conflict with the principles applicable under the decisions of this Court, we granted certiorari in both cases. \n358 \nU.S. 814\n.\n\nThe pertinent facts in each case were found by the District Court and are not challenged here. In substance, they are as follows:\n\nPARSONS, No. 218. Petitioners were members of a partnership (\"Parsons\") which, until the transactions involved here, was primarily engaged in road building. Rockhill Coal Co. (\"Rockhill\") owned bituminous coal-bearing lands in Pennsylvania. Much of the coal was located relatively near the surface and was therefore removable by the strip mining process.\n1\n In 1942 Parsons expressed a desire to strip mine coal from Rockhill's lands, but it refused to sign the written contract offered because the firm did not wish to be bound by a contract \"which would take a long time, since, if an opportunity opened up, [it] wanted to go back to road building.\" It was then agreed that Parsons would, and it did, proceed under \n\n[359 \nU.S. 215, 217]\n\u00a0\n an oral agreement. Under that agreement Parsons was to strip mine coal from such sites and seams, within a generally described area of Rockhill's lands, as were designated by Rockhill. Parsons was to furnish at its own expense all of the equipment, facilities and labor which it thought necessary to strip mine and deliver the coal to Rockhill's cars at a fixed point. For each ton of coal so mined and delivered Rockhill was to pay Parsons a stated amount of money.\n2\n Parsons was not authorized to keep or sell any of the coal but was required to deliver all that was mined to Rockhill. The agreement was not for a definite term, nor did it obligate Parsons to mine the tract to exhaustion, but, to the contrary, it was agreed that \"if Parsons or Rockhill wanted to quit, all that was necessary to terminate the arrangement was the giving of a ten-day notice.\" However, if Rockhill thus canceled the agreement and if \"Parsons had previously gone to the expense of removing the overburden (thereby performing the heavy part of the work, as well as meeting wages and expenses in so doing), then Parsons would have the privilege of taking out the coal [so uncovered] and of being paid for it [even though] this took more than ten days.\" Operations continued under the agreement without notice of termination until August 1, 1950, when Parsons gave Rockhill notice that it would \"quit\" the work on September 1, 1950, and it ceased these operations on or near that date. Large amounts of strippable coal still remained on the tract and strip mining thereon was continued by another contractor. Parsons' investment in equipment used in the work ran from a low in 1943 of $60,000 to a high in 1947 of $250,000. The equipment was movable \n\n[359 \nU.S. 215, 218]\n\u00a0\n and there is no evidence that it was not usable elsewhere or for other purposes.\n\nHUSS, No. 305. Petitioners were members of a partnership (\"Huss\") engaged in the business of strip mining coal. Philadelphia and Reading Coal & Iron Co. (\"Reading\") owned anthracite coal-bearing lands in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. Much of the coal was so located that it could be removed by strip mining. In 1944 Reading and Huss entered into a written contract\n3\n under which Huss undertook to strip mine the coal from such areas, within a generally described tract of Reading's land, as might be designated by Reading and that was not lying deeper than a prescribed distance from the surface. Huss was to furnish at its own expense all of the equipment, facilities and labor necessary to mine and deliver the coal to Reading's colliery. For each ton of coal so mined and delivered Reading was to pay Huss a stated sum.\n4\n That sum was agreed to be in \"full compensation for the full performance of all work and for the furnishing of all material, labor, power, tools, machinery, implements and equipment required for the work.\" Huss was not authorized to keep or sell any of the coal. The contract was expressly terminable by Reading at any time upon 30 days' written notice \"without specifying any reason therefor\" and without liability for \"any loss of anticipated profits or any other damages whatever.\" This right of termination was not exercised. Operations continued under the contract until July 1947, by which time \n\n[359 \nU.S. 215, 219]\n\u00a0\n Huss had mined most of the strippable coal on the lands covered by the contract that lay within the stipulated distance from the surface, and the contract was then canceled by mutual agreement. Huss' investment in equipment used in the work ran from a low in 1944 of $100,000 to a high in 1947 of $500,000. All of the equipment was movable and usable elsewhere in strip mining and some of it was usable for other purposes.\n\nWhether a deduction from gross income shall be permitted for depletion of mineral deposits, or any interest therein, is entirely a matter of grace.\n5\n We therefore must look, first, to the provisions and purposes of the statutes and to the decisions construing them to see what interests are permitted a deduction for depletion, and, next, to the contracts involved to see whether they gave to petitioners such an interest.\n\nThe applicable statutes are 23 (m) and 114 (b) (4) (A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, 26 U.S.C. (1952 ed.) 23 (m) and 26 U.S.C. (1946 ed.) 114 (b) (4) (A). Section 23 (m) directs that a reasonable allowance for depletion shall be made \"in the case of mines, . . . according to the peculiar conditions in each case; such reasonable allowance in all cases to be made under rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Commissioner, with the approval of the Secretary,\" and that \"[i]n the case of leases the deductions shall be equitably apportioned between the lessor and lessee.\" And 114 (b) (4) (A) provides that the allowance shall be, \"in the case of coal mines, 5 percentum . . . of the gross income from [mining]\n6\n the property during the taxable year, excluding \n\n[359 \nU.S. 215, 220]\n\u00a0\n . . . any rents or royalties paid or incurred by the taxpayer in respect of the property.\"\n\nThe purpose of the deduction for depletion is plain and has been many times declared by this Court. \"It is permitted in recognition of the fact that the mineral deposits are wasting assets and is intended as compensation to the owner for the part used up in production.\" Helvering v. Bankline Oil Co., \n303 \nU.S. 362, 366\n. And see United States v. Ludey, \n274 \nU.S. 295, 302\n; Helvering v. Elbe Oil Land Development Co., \n303 \nU.S. 372, 375\n; Anderson v. Helvering, \n310 \nU.S. 404, 408\n; Kirby Petroleum Co. v. Commissioner, \n326 \nU.S. 599, 603\n. \"[The depletion] exclusion is designed to permit a recoupment of the owner's capital investment in the minerals so that when the minerals are exhausted, the owner's capital is unimpaired.\" Commissioner v. Southwest Exploration Co., \n350 \nU.S. 308, 312\n. Save for its application only to gross income from mineral deposits and standing timber, the purpose of \"the deduction for depletion does not differ from the deduction for depreciation.\" United States v. Ludey, \n274 \nU.S., at 303\n. In short, the purpose of the depletion deduction is to permit the owner of a capital interest in mineral in place to make a tax-free recovery of that depleting capital asset.\n\nAlthough the sentence in 23 (m) that \"In the case of leases the deductions shall be equitably apportioned between the lessor and lessee\" presupposes \"that the deductions may be allowed in other cases\" (Palmer v. Bender, \n287 \nU.S. 551, 557\n), the statute \"must be read in the light of the requirement of apportionment of a single depletion allowance\" (Helvering v. Twin Bell Oil Syndicate, \n293 \nU.S. 312, 321\n), for two or more persons \"cannot be entitled to depletion on the same income\" (Commissioner v. Southwest Exploration Co., \n350 \nU.S. 308, 309\n). It follows that if petitioners are entitled to a depletion allowance on the amounts earned under their contracts, \n\n[359 \nU.S. 215, 221]\n\u00a0\n the amounts allowable to the landowners for the depletion of their coal deposits would be correspondingly reduced.\n\nDealing specifically with the problem of what interests in mineral deposits were permitted a deduction for depletion under the practically identical predecessors of 23 (m) and 114, this Court said in Palmer v. Bender, \n287 \nU.S. 551, 557\n: \"The language of the statute is broad enough to provide, at least, for every case in which the taxpayer has acquired, by investment, any interest in the oil in place, and secures, by any form of legal relationship, income derived from the extraction of the oil, to which he must look for a return of his capital.\" The Court further said that the deduction is not \"dependent upon the particular legal form of the taxpayer's interest in the property to be depleted, [and that] [i]t is enough if . . . he has retained a right to share in the oil produced. If so he has an economic interest in the oil, in place, which is depleted by production.\"\n7\n Ibid. (Emphasis added.) The Court went on to hold that lessees of oil producing properties, by reserving from an assignment a royalty of \"one-eighth of all the oil produced and saved,\" retained \n\n[359 \nU.S. 215, 222]\n\u00a0\n an economic interest in the oil in place and were therefore entitled to an allowance for depletion against their gross income from that interest.\n\nFive years later, in 1938, the Court in Helvering v. Bankline Oil Co., \n303 \nU.S. 362\n, reaffirmed the test laid down in Palmer and added: \"But the phrase `economic interest' is not to be taken as embracing a mere economic advantage derived from production, through a contractual relation to the owner, by one who has no capital investment in the mineral deposit.\" \n303 \nU.S., at 367\n. Applying that principle, the Court held that a processor who, by contracts with the owners of gas and oil wells, had acquired the right to take wet gas from the wellheads and to extract and sell the gasoline therefrom, paying the well owners a percentage of the proceeds of such sales, had not acquired an economic interest in the depleting gas in place but only an economic advantage to be derived from the processing operations, and that therefore the \n\n[359 \nU.S. 215, 223]\n\u00a0\n income from those operations was not subject to the depletion deduction.\n\nIn his first regulations prescribed under the Internal Revenue Act of 1939, the Commissioner adopted almost literally the language we have quoted from Palmer and Bankline as the tests to be administratively applied in determining what interests in mineral deposits are entitled to the depletion allowance. See Treas. Reg. 103, 19.23 (m)-1, August 23, 1939. That language, with immaterial changes, has remained in the regulations ever since. During the years here involved, 1942 through 1950, the regulation in force was Treas. Reg. 111, 29.23 (m)-1, which, in pertinent part, provides:\n\n \"Under [the provisions of 23 (m) and 114] the owner of an economic interest in mineral deposits or standing timber is allowed annual depletion deductions. An economic interest is possessed in every case in which the taxpayer has acquired, by investment, any interest in mineral in place or standing timber and secures, by any form of legal relationship, income derived from the severance and sale of the mineral or timber, to which he must look for a return of his capital. But a person who has no capital investment in the mineral deposit or standing timber does not possess an economic interest merely because, through a contractual relation to the owner, he possesses a mere economic advantage derived from production . . . .\"\n\n\n Such are the interests that are permitted a deduction for depletion by the statutes as consistently interpreted by this Court and by the Commissioner.\n\nPetitioners do not dispute that these are the controlling principles, but rather they contend that they come within those that allow the deduction. They argue that by their contracts to mine the coal, and particularly by contributing \n\n[359 \nU.S. 215, 224]\n\u00a0\n their equipment, organizations and skills to the mining project as required by those contracts, they, in legal effect, made a capital investment in, and thereby acquired an economic interest in, the coal in place, which was depletable by production, and that they are therefore entitled to take the deduction against their gross income derived from those mining operations.\n\nWe take a different view. It stands admitted that before and apart from their contracts, petitioners had no investment or interest in the coal in place. Their asserted right to the deduction rests entirely upon their contracts. Is there anything in those contracts to indicate that petitioners made a capital investment in, or acquired an economic interest in, the coal in place, as distinguished from the acquisition of a mere economic advantage to be derived from their mining operations? We think it is quite plain that there is not.\n\nBy their contracts, which were completely terminable without cause on short notice, petitioners simply agreed to provide the equipment and do the work required to strip mine coal from designated lands of the landowners and to deliver the coal to the latter at stated points, and in full consideration for performance of that undertaking the landowners were to pay to petitioners a fixed sum per ton. Surely those agreements do not show or suggest that petitioners actually made any capital investment in the coal in place, or that the landowners were to or actually did in any way surrender to petitioners any part of their capital interest in the coal in place. Petitioners do not factually assert otherwise. Their claim to the contrary is based wholly upon an asserted legal fiction. As stated, they claim that their contractual right to mine coal from the designated lands and the use of their equipment, organizations and skills in doing so, should be regarded as the making of a capital investment in, and the acquisition of an economic interest in, the coal in place. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 215, 225]\n\u00a0\n But that fiction cannot be indulged here, for it is negated by the facts.\n\nTo recapitulate, the asserted fiction is opposed to the facts (1) that petitioners' investments were in their equipment, all of which was movable - not in the coal in place; (2) that their investments in equipment were recoverable through depreciation - not depletion; (3) that the contracts were completely terminable without cause on short notice; (4) that the landowners did not agree to surrender and did not actually surrender to petitioners any capital interest in the coal in place; (5) that the coal at all times, even after it was mined, belonged entirely to the landowners, and that petitioners could not sell or keep any of it but were required to deliver all that they mined to the landowners; (6) that petitioners were not to have any part of the proceeds of the sale of the coal, but, on the contrary, they were to be paid a fixed sum for each ton mined and delivered, which was, as stated in Huss, agreed to be in \"full compensation for the full performance of all work and for the furnishing of all [labor] and equipment required for the work\"; and (7) that petitioners, thus, agreed to look only to the landowners for all sums to become due them under their contracts. The agreement of the landowners to pay a fixed sum per ton for mining and delivering the coal \"was a personal covenant and did not purport to grant [petitioners] an interest in the [coal in place].\" Helvering v. O'Donnell, \n303 \nU.S. 370, 372\n. Surely these facts show that petitioners did not actually make any capital investment in, or acquire any economic interest in, the coal in place, and that they may not fictionally be regarded as having done so.\n\n\"Undoubtedly, [petitioners] through [their] contracts obtained an economic advantage from [their] production of the [coal], but that is not sufficient. The controlling fact is that [petitioners] had no interest in the [coal] in \n\n[359 \nU.S. 215, 226]\n\u00a0\n place.\" Helvering v. Bankline Oil Co., \n303 \nU.S., at 368\n. Of course, the parties might have provided in their contracts that petitioners would have some capital interest in the coal in place, but they did not do so - apparently by design. Instead, petitioners simply entered into contracts, terminable without cause on short notice, with the owners of coal-bearing lands to provide the equipment and do the work required to strip mine and deliver coal from those lands, as independent contractors, for fixed unit prices. \"[Petitioners thus] bargained for and obtained an economic advantage from the [mining] operations but that advantage or profit did not constitute a depletable interest in the [coal] in place\" (Helvering v. O'Donnell, \n303 \nU.S., at 372\n), and having \"no capital investment in the mineral deposit which suffered depletion, [petitioners are] not entitled to the statutory allowance\" (Helvering v. Bankline Oil Co., \n303 \nU.S., at 368\n). The judgments must therefore be\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Strip mining is done from the surface of the earth. In general, it is performed by stripping off the earth, known as overburden, which lies over the coal and then removing the coal so uncovered.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] It was contemplated by the parties that in the event of an increase in the union labor wage scale the amount per ton to be paid to Parsons would be increased and on several occasions it was increased to cover higher costs for both labor and material used in the work.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] During the tax years involved, which were 1944 to 1947, other like contracts were entered into by the parties, but they were all identical, except for areas covered and prices per ton to be paid to Huss, and it will therefore be unnecessary to treat with them individually.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The contract provided, however, that in the event of an increase in the union labor wage scale the amount per ton to be paid to Huss would be, and on several occasions during the operation it was, increased sufficiently to cover increased labor costs.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Helvering v.

Southwest Exploration Co., \n350 \nU.S. 308, 312\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Section 114 (b) (4) (B) provided that \"the term `gross income from the property' means the gross income from mining.\" 26 U.S.C.

Bankline Oil Co., \n303 \nU.S. 362, 367\n, literally adopted the language of the Palmer case upon the point.\n\nIn Helvering v. O'Donnell, \n303 \nU.S. 370, 371\n, it was said: \"The question is whether respondent had an interest, that is, a capital investment, in the oil and gas in place. . . . Palmer v. Bender, \n287 \nU.S. 551, 557\n; Helvering v. Twin Bell Oil Syndicate, \n293 \nU.S. 312, 321\n; Thomas v. Perkins, \n301 \nU.S. 655, 661\n; Helvering v. Bankline Oil Co., supra.\"\n\nHelvering v. Elbe Oil Land Development Co., \n303 \nU.S. 372, 375\n-376, declared that \"The words `gross income from the property,' as used in the statute governing the allowance for depletion, mean gross income received from the operation of the oil and gas wells by one \n\n[359 \nU.S. 215, 222]\n\u00a0\n who has a capital investment therein, - not income from the sale of the oil and gas properties themselves.\"\n\nAnderson v. Helvering, \n310 \nU.S. 404, 408\n-409, repeated the statement last quoted.\n\nIn Kirby Petroleum Co. v. Commissioner, \n326 \nU.S. 599, 603\n, the Court said: \"The test of the right to depletion is whether the taxpayer has a capital investment in the oil in place which is necessarily reduced as the oil is extracted.\"\n\nIn Burton-Sutton Oil Co. v. Commissioner, \n328 \nU.S. 25, 32\n, the Court said: \"It seems generally accepted that it is the owner of a capital investment or economic interest in the oil in place who is entitled to the depletion.\"\n\nCommissioner v. Southwest Exploration Co., \n350 \nU.S. 308, 314\n, reannounced substantially the rule declared in the Palmer case. It said \"that a taxpayer is entitled to depletion where he has: (1) `acquired, by investment, any interest in the oil in place,' and (2) secured by legal relationship `income derived from the extraction of the oil, to which he must look for a return of his capital.' . . . These two factors, usually considered together, constitute the requirement of `an economic interest.'\" \n\n[359 \nU.S. 215, 227]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","138":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPATTERSON v.

Duncan, and Leonard L. Sullivan, were injured in the course of their employment with the United States while aboard vessels operated by the Government and engaged in merchant service. Petitioner Patterson is the administrator of the estate of Edgar A. Doody, Jr., who died as the result of injuries sustained by him while he was similarly employed. Each of the petitioners filed a libel in personam against the United States under the Suits in Admiralty Act, 41 Stat. 525 et seq., 46 U.S.C. 741 et seq. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed dismissal of the libels on the ground that petitioners' exclusive remedy was under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act, \n\n[359 \nU.S. 495, 496]\n\u00a0\n 39 Stat. 742 et seq., 5 U.S.C. 751 et seq., 258 F.2d 702.

Doyle, 204 F.2d 874.\n\nIn Johansen v. United States, \n343 \nU.S. 427, 441\n, the Court held \"that the Federal Employees Compensation Act is the exclusive remedy for civilian . . .\" employees of the United States on government vessels engaged in public service and that the United States was therefore not liable to such employees under the Public Vessels Act. 43 Stat. 1112 et seq., 46 U.S.C. 781 et seq. The considerations which led to that conclusion are equally applicable to cases where the government vessel is engaged in merchant service. The United States \"has established by the Compensation Act a method of redress for its employees. There is no reason to have two systems of redress.\" \n343 \nU.S., at 439\n.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nThe major portion of petitioners' argument, however, is addressed to the proposition that Johansen was incorrectly decided and that we should avail ourselves of this opportunity to reconsider it. We decline to do so. No arguments are presented by petitioners which were not fully considered in Johansen and rejected. \"[W]hen the questions are of statutory construction, not of constitutional import, Congress can rectify our mistake, if such it was, or change its policy at any time, and in these circumstances reversal is not readily to be made.\" United States v.

If civilian seamen employed by the Government are to \n\n[359 \nU.S. 495, 497]\n\u00a0\n be accorded rights different from or greater than those which they enjoy under the Compensation Act, it is for Congress to provide them.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nAccordingly, the judgments of dismissal entered against petitioners Hays, Duncan, Sullivan, and Patterson are affirmed.

Held: Notwithstanding his retirement from service, the National Railroad Adjustment Board had exclusive primary jurisdiction over this dispute arising under a collective bargaining agreement, and the District Court properly dismissed the complaint. Pp. 548-554.\n\n 258 F.2d 62, reversed and cause remanded.\n\nRichard N. Clattenburg argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief were F. Morse Archer, Jr., John P. Hauch, Jr. and John B. Prizer.\n\nJames M. Davis, Jr. argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was John A. Matthews.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nIn April 1955 Charles A. DePriest began an action in the District Court for the District of New Jersey, claiming $27,000 in additional compensation from the Pennsylvania Railroad. DePriest had been employed as a locomotive engineer by the Railroad from May 1918 to March 1955, at which time he resigned his employment and applied for an annuity. He alleged that under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement between the Railroad \n\n[360 \nU.S. 548, 549]\n\u00a0\n and Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers of which he was a member, he was entitled to an extra day's pay for each of the 1,000-1,500 times he had been assigned to leave his switching limits and perform service for his employer on tracks belonging to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Co. He relied on a provision of the collective bargaining agreement which provided extra compensation for engineers who were used beyond their switching limits under specially defined circumstances. DePriest further alleged that his claim had been rejected by his employer's representatives, including the Railroad's chief operating officer for the region in which he was employed. His retirement from service occurred immediately after this alleged rejection. Jurisdiction was based on diversity of citizenship. The District Court stayed the proceedings awaiting the disposition of similar claims against the Pennsylvania Railroad then pending before the First Division of the National Railroad Adjustment Board, 145 F. Supp. 596. An appeal from this interlocutory decision, not one granting or denying an injunction, was dismissed. 243 F.2d 485. In the interim DePriest died and was replaced by an administrator. Following a rejection by the National Railroad Adjustment Board of claims against the Pennsylvania Railroad involving the same provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, the District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that the Board's interpretations were final and as such binding on respondent, 155 F. Supp. 695. The Court of Appeals reversed, 258 F.2d 62, holding that the determination by the Board of claims to which respondent was not a party was not binding on him, and that the District Court had jurisdiction over the claim. We granted certiorari, \n358 \nU.S. 878\n, since this decision raised an important question in the administration of the Railway Labor Act of 1934. That Act, 48 Stat. 1185, 45 U.S.C. 151 et seq., established a broad framework for the regulation \n\n[360 \nU.S. 548, 550]\n\u00a0\n and adjustment of industrial controversies involving railroads.\n\nThe Act establishes, inter alia, the National Railroad Adjustment Board with the following purposes and functions:\n\n \"The disputes between an employee or group of employees and a carrier or carriers growing out of grievances or out of the interpretation or application of agreements concerning rates of pay, rules, or working conditions, including cases pending and unadjusted on the date of approval of this Act, shall be handled in the usual manner up to and including the chief operating officer of the carrier designated to handle such disputes; but, failing to reach an adjustment in this manner, the disputes may be referred by petition of the parties or by either party to the appropriate division of the Adjustment Board with a full statement of the facts and all supporting data bearing upon the disputes.\" Railway Labor Act, 3, First (i), 45 U.S.C. 153, First (i).\n\n\n The clash of economic forces which led to the passage of this Act, the history of its enactment, and the legislative policies which it expresses and which guide judicial interpretation have been too thoroughly and recently canvassed by this Court to need repetition.\n1\n On the basis of these guides to judicial construction we have held that the National Railroad Adjustment Board had exclusive primary jurisdiction over disputes between unions and carriers based on the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement. Slocum v. Delaware, L. & W. R. Co., \n339 \nU.S. 239\n. On the same day, we also decided Order of \n\n[360 \nU.S. 548, 551]\n\u00a0\n Railway Conductors v. Southern R. Co., \n339 \nU.S. 255\n holding that the principles of Slocum were fully applicable to a claim by a group of conductors that they were entitled to extra compensation for certain \"side trips\" under the terms of their agreement with the carrier. That case, like the case now before us, involved claims for compensation which could only be adjudicated by a determination of the relevant facts and construction of the collective bargaining agreement. However, here, as was not the case in Order of Railway Conductors, the claimant has retired from railroad service. The immediate question is whether that factual difference makes a legal difference.\n\nThe Act grants jurisdiction to the Board of \"disputes between an employee . . . and a carrier . . . .\" It defines \"employee\" as including:\n\n\". . . every person in the service of a carrier (subject to its continuing authority to supervise and direct the manner of rendition of his service) who performs any work defined as that of an employee or subordinate official in the orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission . . . .\"\n\n\n The National Railroad Adjustment Board was established as a tribunal to settle disputes arising out of the relationship between carrier and employee. All the considerations which led Congress to entrust an expert administrative board with the interpretation of collective bargaining agreements are equally applicable when, as here, the employee has retired from service after initiating a claim for compensation for work performed while on active duty. The nature of the problem and the need for experience and expert knowledge remain the same. The same collective bargaining agreement must be construed with the same need for uniformity of interpretation and orderly adjustment of differences. There is \n\n[360 \nU.S. 548, 552]\n\u00a0\n nothing in the Act which requires that the employment relationship subsist throughout the entire process of administrative settlement. The purpose of the Act is fulfilled if the claim itself arises out of the employment relationship which Congress regulated. The Board itself has accepted this construction and adjudicates the claims of retired employees.\n2\n This uniform administrative interpretation is of great importance, reflecting, as it does, the needs and fair expectations of the railroad industry for which Congress has provided what might be termed a charter for its internal government. Moreover, the discharged employee may challenge the validity of his discharge before the Board, seeking reinstatement and back pay. See Union Pacific R. Co. v. Price, post, p. 601. Thus it is plain both from a reading of the Act in light of its purpose and the needs of its administration and from the settled administrative interpretation that the Board has jurisdiction over respondent's claim for compensation.\n\nSince the Board has jurisdiction, it must have exclusive primary jurisdiction. All the considerations of legislative meaning and policy which have compelled the conclusion that an active employee must submit his claims to the Board, and may not resort to the courts in the first instance, are the same when the employee has retired and seeks compensation for work performed while he remained on active service. A contrary conclusion would create a not insubstantial class of preferred claimants.\n3\n\u00a0\n\n[360 \nU.S. 548, 553]\n\u00a0\n Retired employees would be allowed to bypass the Board specially constituted for hearing railroad disputes whenever they deemed it advantageous to do so, whereas all other employees would be required to present their claims to the Board. This case forcefully illustrates the difficulties of such a construction. Several active workers have had claims similar to that of respondent rejected by the Board. To allow respondent now to try his claim in the District Court would only accentuate the danger of inequality of treatment and its consequent discontent which it was the aim of the Railway Labor Act to eliminate. We can take judicial notice of the fact that provisions in railroad collective bargaining agreements are of a specialized technical nature calling for specialized technical knowledge in ascertaining their meaning and application. Wholly apart from the adaptability of judges and juries to make such determinations, varying jury verdicts would imbed into such judgments varying constructions not subject to review to secure uniformity. Not only would this engender diversity of proceedings but diversity through judicial construction and through the construction of the Adjustment Board. Since nothing is a greater spur to conflicts, and eventually conflicts resulting in strikes, than different pay for the same work or unfair differentials, not to respect the centralized determination of these questions through the Adjustment Board would hamper if not defeat the central purpose of the Railway Labor Act.\n\nOur decision in Moore v. Illinois Central R. Co., \n312 \nU.S. 630\n, does not stand in the way of this. The decision in that case has been given its proper, limited scope in Slocum v. Delaware, L. & W. R. Co., \n339 \nU.S. 239\n. Moore carved out from the controlling doctrine of primary jurisdiction the unusual and special situation of wrongful discharge where the aggrieved employee had been expelled from the employment relationship. Moreover, \n\n[360 \nU.S. 548, 554]\n\u00a0\n since the discharge had been accepted as final by the employee, it is probable that the damages accrued primarily after the employment relationship had terminated.\n\nOur consistent regard for the importance of having disputes between railroad employees and carriers settled by the administrative Board which Congress established for that purpose requires respondent to resort to the NRAB for adjudication of his claim.\n\nThe judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded, in order that the case may be returned to the District Court, with instructions to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n   Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See, e. g., Railroad Trainmen v.

H. R. Doc. No. 278, 85th Cong., 2d Sess.\n\nThe inapplicability of United States v. Interstate Commerce Comm'n, \n337 \nU.S. 426\n, to the problem of this case, like its inapplicability to the problem in Union Pacific R. Co. v. Price, post, p. 601, decided today, is dealt with in the Court's opinion in that case.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS concur, dissenting.\n\nI would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for two reasons: I do not agree that the Railway Labor Act requires retired railroad employees to submit their back-wage claims to the National Railroad Adjustment Board; I believe that Act, as here construed to grant railroads court trials of wage claims against them while compelling the employees to submit their claims to the Board for final determination, denies employees equal protection of the law in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Cf. Bolling v. Sharpe, \n347 \nU.S. 497\n.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nThe Court holds that the Railway Labor Act gives the National Railroad Adjustment Board exclusive jurisdiction of back-pay disputes between retired railroad employees and their ex-employer railroads. I cannot read the Labor Act that way. The controlling provision, 3 First (i), confers power on the Board to adjust \"disputes \n\n[360 \nU.S. 548, 555]\n\u00a0\n between an employee or a group of employees and a carrier or carriers . . . .\"\n1\n Seemingly to highlight the fact that the Act is to govern active workers only, Congress defined \"employee\" as \"every person in the service of a carrier (subject to its continuing authority to supervise and direct the manner of rendition of his service) who performs any work defined as that of an employee . . . .\"\n2\n The railway engineer who brought this suit was not an employee within this definition. Prior to suit he had resigned his job, and had claimed an annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937, which requires a worker making such a claim to relinquish all rights to return to railroad service in the future.\n3\n Under these circumstances, the retired employee could not be, and was not \"in the service\" of the railroad or \"subject to its continuing authority to supervise the manner of rendition of his service.\" No other language in the Act brings retired railroad employees within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Adjustment Board. I think the Court's holding represents an altogether unjustifiable interpretative liberty.\n\nThere are perhaps few statutes providing less of an excuse for departing from congressional language than the Railway Labor Act, at least insofar as its coverage is concerned. It is but one step in a series of congressional efforts to establish machinery for peaceful settlement of quarrels between railroads and railroad workers in order to avoid strikes and resulting interruption of railroad service. The Act as a whole is a product of many years of thought, study, conferences, discussions, and experiments. Many witnesses, including representatives \n\n[360 \nU.S. 548, 556]\n\u00a0\n of railroads and employees, have testified at many congressional hearings. The hearings show a solicitous interest by both groups in the language of the legislation. The Act touches sensitive subjects of importance to industrial peace, and represented as enacted a balance of interests reasonably satisfactory to all groups. As such, the plain meaning of its language should not lightly be disturbed.\n\nThe Court finds reasons outside the language of the Act, however, for expanding the Board's jurisdiction beyond the boundaries set by the definitions of Congress. These reasons, in my judgment, do not support the expansion of the Act's coverage which the Court makes. The Court argues that \"All the considerations which led Congress to entrust an expert administrative board with the interpretation of collective bargaining agreements are equally applicable when, as here, the employee has retired from service after initiating a claim for compensation for work performed while on active duty.\" I am afraid this statement assumes a knowledge which the Court does not and cannot have. Of course some of the same considerations apply. I agree, for example, that the same collective bargaining agreement must be construed whether wages are claimed by an ex-employee or by an active employee. This is equally true, however, when an ex-employee sues for wrongful discharge under a collective bargaining agreement. Yet we have not hesitated on three separate occasions to say that such actions for wrongful discharge can be adjudicated in the courts, and that the courts themselves may construe the bargaining agreement. Moore v. Illinois Central R. Co., \n312 \nU.S. 630\n; Slocum v. Delaware, L. & W. R. Co., \n339 \nU.S. 239\n; Transcontinental & Western Air, Inc., v. Koppal, \n345 \nU.S. 653\n. Similarly, when the Board makes an award adverse to the railroad and the employee is forced to go \n\n[360 \nU.S. 548, 557]\n\u00a0\n to the courts to have the award enforced, courts have felt free to interpret collective bargaining agreements differently from the way the Board had.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nMoreover, I do not agree with the Court that the problems involved in suits by ex-employees and active employees are necessarily the same. One cannot know all the complex of considerations which led Congress to adopt the Act. One can only surmise its reasons for carefully limiting the Act's scope to disputes between active railroad workers and their employers. It is clear, however, that active employees work together from day to day; their work frequently makes them live together in the same neighborhood; they, in fact, constitute almost a separate family of people, discussing their interests and affairs, and airing among themselves their complaints and grievances against the company. In such an atmosphere individual dissatisfactions tend to become those of the group, breeding industrial disturbances and strikes. We cannot know that this is true of retired employees, as the Court seems to take for granted. Instead, the very opposite would seem a much more likely assumption. Retired employees give up their daily work contact with active workers, frequently even move a long way off from their old working localities, and therefore their personal grievances are not so likely to breed group dissatisfaction leading to strikes. Consequently, it seems wrong to intimate that the grievances retired workers may have over claims for back pay are as likely to create strife productive of railroad strikes as the same grievances would, if entertained by active railroad workers. Certainly, the Court's questionable assumption to this effect supplies a very slim basis for departing from the clear language of the Act. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 548, 558]\n\u00a0\n\n\nBut if external considerations are to be used to interpret the statute. I think that the \"lop-sided\" effect courts have given to the Act's provisions for review of Board awards furnishes a very weighty reason for excluding retired employees from the exclusive jurisdiction of the Board. The Act provides that either a railroad worker or an employee can invoke the compulsory jurisdiction of the Adjustment Board.\n5\n Section 3 First (m) states that \"awards shall be final and binding upon both parties to the dispute, except insofar as they shall contain a money award.\"\n6\n As construed, this provision prohibits an employee from seeking review of an adverse Board ruling in the courts.\n7\n And courts, determining that a Board denial of an employee's money claim is not a \"money award\" falling within the exception of 3 First (m), have refused workers a judicial trial of their money claims against the railway after these have been rejected by the Board.\n8\n Today's decision in Union Pacific R. Co. v. Price, post, p. 601, appears to adopt this position. In contrast, however, a railroad may obtain a trial substantially de novo of any award adverse to it. For, under 3 First (p) \n\n[360 \nU.S. 548, 559]\n\u00a0\n of the Act, if a carrier does not voluntarily comply with the Board's award, including wage awards for money damages, a wage earner can enforce the Board's order only by bringing, in a United States District Court, a suit which \"shall proceed in all respects as other civil suits, except that on the trial of such suit the findings and order of the division of the Adjustment Board shall be prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated . . . .\"\n9\n\u00a0\n\nConstrued this way, the Act creates a glaring inequality of treatment between workers and railroads. After denial by the Adjustment Board, workers can get no judicial trial of their claims; railroads, however, can get precisely the same kind of trial they would have were there no Adjustment Board, except that the Board's findings constitute prima facie evidence in the case. For the reasons stated by MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS in his dissent in Price, I think the Railway Labor Act should be construed to grant a railroad employee the same kind of redetermination by judge and jury of a Board order denying him a \"money award\" that the Act affords a railroad for a money award against it. The Court rejected this view in Price. The unfairness of the discriminatory procedure there upheld seems manifest to me. In my judgment, it is bound to incite the kind of bitter resentment among railroad workers which will produce discord and strikes interrupting the free flow of commerce and creating the very evil Congress sought to avoid by this Act. These reasons seem to me to provide compelling arguments against judicial expansion of the Act to retired railroad \n\n[360 \nU.S. 548, 560]\n\u00a0\n workers plainly not covered by its language. Since the Court refuses to construe the Act to exclude such workers, however, I am forced to reach and consider the constitutional contentions raised by respondent.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nRespondent argues that giving the Adjustment Board jurisdiction to make a \"final and binding\" determination of his wage claim deprives him of a jury trial in violation of the Seventh Amendment since wage disputes were \"Suits at common law . . . .\"\n10\n His contention is all the more serious where, as here, he is compelled to submit his claim to the Board and - as I understand the Court's holding here and in Price - is never allowed to take it to the courts for trial. In a comparable situation, Congress amended the reparation provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act for the specific purpose of avoiding constitutional difficulties by guaranteeing a railroad a full jury trial of money claims against it.\n11\n Significantly, 3 First (p) of the Railway Labor Act, which provides the kind of court trial a railway can get before an award \n\n[360 \nU.S. 548, 561]\n\u00a0\n against it can be enforced, is copied substantially verbatim from 16 (2) of the amended Commerce Act.\n12\n That section ( 16 (2)) had been construed by this Court long before the Railway Labor Act was passed so as to assure that it did not \"abridge the right of trial by jury or take away any of its incidents.\" Meeker v. Lehigh Valley R. Co., \n236 \nU.S. 412, 430\n. It is hard for me to believe that Congress enacted the Railway Labor Act on the assumption that a railroad worker is any less entitled to a jury trial under the Constitution than is a railroad. And I would construe the Act on the basis that Congress believed both are entitled to such a trial. See Union Pacific R. Co. v. Price, post, p. 617 (dissenting opinion) decided today. Instead the Court in Price rejects this construction, from which it must follow that respondent here is deprived of a jury trial, although the railroad can get one.\n\nIt would surely not be easy to uphold the constitutionality of a procedure which takes away from both parties to a wage dispute their ancient common-law right \n\n[360 \nU.S. 548, 562]\n\u00a0\n to a trial by court and jury.\n13\n It should be impossible to uphold it when, as here, the procedure grants both parties an administrative hearing and then gives one of them a second chance before a judge and jury while denying it to the other. Such an unequal procedure cannot be a fair trial since it gives one side a far better chance to win than the other. Analogous practices in both criminal and civil cases have been consistently struck down by this and many other courts.\n14\n Yet today the Court upholds this \n\n[360 \nU.S. 548, 563]\n\u00a0\n procedure without so much as discussing it. It does this although I can hardly think of a case where discrimination between litigants is less justified. Indeed, the only \"justification\" that has been attempted is that at the time the Railway Labor Act was passed certain representatives of the Railroad Brotherhoods were willing to forego their right to trial by judge and jury in exchange for certain benefits the law allegedly gave them. See Union Pacific R. Co. v. Price, post, p. 601. Taken as a whole I do not read the legislative history of the law as supporting any such concession by the unions. But even if it did, I would not be able to uphold the procedure here involved. For, assuming that an individual can contract away his constitutional right to an equal trial, and assuming additionally the still more doubtful proposition that representatives of an organization can, by contract, estop its members from claiming equal treatment in the courts in cases or controversies arising thereafter, I cannot agree that the statements of some union leaders to Congress when it enacted this law can be taken to have such an effect. A fair trial is too valuable a safeguard of our liberty for us to allow it to be so easily discarded. I would hold that respondent has a right to jury trial equal to that accorded the railroad, and that his constitutional contention is well taken.\n\nFor all these reasons I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 48 Stat. 1191, 45 U.S.C. 153 First (i).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 44 Stat. 577, as amended, 45 U.S.C. 151 Fifth.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 50 Stat. 309, as amended, 45 U.S.C. 228b.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Brotherhood of Railway Clerks v.

And in his dissent in Union Pacific R. Co. v. Price, post, p. 617, MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS calls attention to the fact that the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act have been construed, in United States v.

TENNESSEE-MISSOURI COMM'N.(1959)\nNo. 233\nArgued: March 4, 1959Decided: April 20, 1959\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner sued in a Federal District Court to recover under the Jones Act for the death of her husband while working aboard a Mississippi River ferryboat owned by respondent, an agency of the States of Tennessee and Missouri created by a compact entered into between them with the consent of Congress. The compact authorizes respondent \"to sue and be sued,\" and the Act of Congress approving it provides that it shall not be construed \"to affect, impair, or diminish any right, power or jurisdiction of . . . any court . . . of the United States, over or in regard to any navigable waters, or any commerce between the States.\" Held:\n\n 1. By entering into the compact and acting under it after Congressional approval, the States waived whatever immunity from a suit such as this in a federal court respondent, as their agency, might have enjoyed under the Eleventh Amendment. Pp. 276-282.\n\n\n (a) The construction of a compact sanctioned by Congress under Art. I, 10, cl. 3, of the Constitution presents a federal question over which this Court has the final say. Pp. 278-279.\n\n\n (b) Congress approved the sue-and-be-sued clause in the compact here involved under conditions that make it clear that the States accepting it waived any immunity from suit which they otherwise might have had. Pp. 279-280.\n\n\n (c) The above-quoted proviso in the Act of Congress approving the compact, read in the light of the sue-and-be-sued clause in the compact, reserves the jurisdiction of the federal courts to act in any matter arising under the compact over which they would have jurisdiction by virtue of the fact that the Mississippi is a navigable stream and that interstate commerce is involved. Pp. 280-282.\n\n\n 2. Respondent, as a bi-state corporation, is not excepted from the term \"employer\" as used in the Jones Act. Pp. 282-283.\n\n\n 254 F.2d 857, reversed. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 275, 276]\n\u00a0\n\n\nDouglas MacLeod argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief were Charles W. Miles III, W. Morris Miles and Fred Robertson.\n\nJames M. Reeves argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nWhen the Court in 1793 held that a State could be sued in the federal courts by a citizen of another State\n1\n (Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419), the Eleventh Amendment\n2\n was passed precluding it. But this is an immunity which a State may waive at its pleasure (Missouri v. Fiske, \n290 \nU.S. 18, 24\n) as by a general appearance in litigation in a federal court (Clark v. Barnard, \n108 \nU.S. 436, 447\n-448) or by statute. Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury, \n323 \nU.S. 459, 468\n-470. The conclusion that there has been a waiver of immunity will not be lightly inferred. Murray v. Wilson Distilling Co., \n213 \nU.S. 151, 171\n. Nor will a waiver of immunity from suit in state courts do service for a waiver of immunity where the litigation is brought in the federal court. Chandler v. Dix, \n194 \nU.S. 590\n, \n\n[359 \nU.S. 275, 277]\n\u00a0\n 591-592. And where a public instrumentality is created with the right \"to sue and be sued\" that waiver of immunity in the particular setting may be restricted to suits or proceedings of a special character in the state, not the federal, courts. Cf. Delaware River Comm'n v. Colburn, \n310 \nU.S. 419\n. Suits against agencies of a State based on maritime torts are no exception to these rules. Ex parte New York, \n256 \nU.S. 490\n.\n\nThe question here is whether Tennessee and Missouri have waived their immunity under the facts of this case.\n\nCongress, under conditions specified in 33 U.S.C. 525 et seq., gave its consent to the construction of bridges over the navigable waters in the United States. Respondent is a \"body corporate and politic\" created by Missouri (13 Vernon's Ann. Stat., Tit. 14, 234.360) and Tennessee (P. L. 1949, cc. 167, 168) acting pursuant to the Compact Clause of the Constitution. Art. I, 10, cl. 3.\n3\n The compact prepared by the two States and submitted to the Congress provided in Art. I, 1 and 2, that respondent should have the power to build a bridge and operate ferries across the Mississippi at specified points and in Art. I, 3, that it should have the power \"to contract, to sue and be sued in its own name.\" Congress granted its consent to the compact, 63 Stat. 930, stating in a proviso:\n\n\"That nothing herein contained shall be construed to affect, impair, or diminish any right, power, or jurisdiction of the United States or of any court, department, board, bureau, officer, or official of the United States, over or in regard to any navigable waters, or any commerce between the States or with foreign countries, or any bridge, railroad, highway, pier, wharf, or other facility or improvement, or any \n\n[359 \nU.S. 275, 278]\n\u00a0\n other person, matter, or thing, forming the subject matter of the aforesaid compact or agreement or otherwise affected by the terms thereof.\" (Italics added.)\n\n\n The facts are that petitioner's husband was employed on a ferryboat operated by respondent as a common carrier across the Mississippi between a point in Missouri and one in Tennessee. He met his death when he was trapped in the pilothouse of the ferryboat as it sank, following a collision with another boat. Suit was brought under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. 688, charging respondent with negligence.\n\nThe District Court granted the motion to dismiss, holding that respondent is an agency of the States of Tennessee and Missouri and immune from suit in tort. 153 F. Supp. 512. The Court of Appeals, agreeing with that view, affirmed. 254 F.2d 857. The case is here on certiorari. \n358 \nU.S. 811\n.\n\nThe construction of a compact sanctioned by Congress under Art. I, 10, cl. 3, of the Constitution presents a federal question. Delaware River Comm'n v. Colburn, supra, at 427. Moreover, the meaning of a compact is a question on which this Court has the final say.\n4\n Dyer v. Sims, \n341 \nU.S. 22, 28\n. The rule is no different when the contention is that a State has, by compact, waived its immunity from suit. Of course, when the alleged basis of waiver of the Eleventh Amendment's immunity is a state statute, the question to be answered is whether the State has intended to waive its immunity. Chandler v. Dix, supra. But where the waiver is, as here, claimed to \n\n[359 \nU.S. 275, 279]\n\u00a0\n arise from a compact between several States, the Court is called on to interpret not unilateral state action but the terms of a consensual agreement, the meaning of which, because made by different States acting under the Constitution and with congressional approval, is a question of federal law. Delaware River Comm'n v. Colburn, supra. In making that interpretation we must treat the compact as a living interstate agreement which performs high functions in our federalism,\n5\n including the operation of vast interstate enterprises.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nThe Court of Appeals laid emphasis on the law of Missouri, which, it said, construes a sue-and-be-sued provision as not authorizing a suit for negligence against a public corporation. It likewise cited Tennessee decisions strictly construing statutes permitting suits against the State. We assume arguendo that this suit must be considered as one against the States since this bi-state corporation is a joint or common agency of Tennessee and Missouri. But we disagree with the construction given \n\n[359 \nU.S. 275, 280]\n\u00a0\n by the Court of Appeals to the sue-and-be-sued clause. For the resolution of that question we turn to federal not state law. Congress might of course adopt as federal law the law of either or both of the States. Delaware River Comm'n v. Colburn, supra. Cf. Commissioner v. Stern, \n357 \nU.S. 39\n; Helvering v. Stuart, \n317 \nU.S. 154\n; Myers v. Matley, \n318 \nU.S. 622\n. But Congress took no such step here. It approved a sue-and-be-sued clause in a compact under conditions that make it clear that the States accepting it waived any immunity from suit which they otherwise might have.\n\nThis compact, approved by Congress in 1949, was made in an era when the immunity of corporations performing governmental functions was not in favor in the federal field. In Keifer & Keifer v. Reconstruction Finance Corp., \n306 \nU.S. 381\n, decided nearly 10 years before the present compact was made, the authority to sue and be sued contained in a federal charter granted a government corporation was held to be broad enough to include suits in torts, at least where the duties relied upon \"have their source in contract even though the guilty agents may be merely tort-feasors.\" Id., at 395. There the underlying contract was a bailment; here it is employment. To draw a distinction in either the Keifer case or in this case between tort and contract would be to \"make application of a steadily growing policy of governmental liability contingent upon irrelevant procedural factors. These, in our law, are still deeply rooted in historical accidents to which the expanding conceptions of public morality regarding governmental responsibility should not be subordinated.\" Id., at 396.\n\nThis case, like the Keifer case, involves the launching of a governmental corporation into an industrial or business field. In view of the federal climate of opinion which by that time had grown up around the sue-and-be-sued clause, we cannot believe that Congress intended to \n\n[359 \nU.S. 275, 281]\n\u00a0\n confine it more narrowly here than in the Keifer case. But we need not rest on that alone. Congress, when it approved this compact, attached a condition that \"nothing herein contained shall be construed to affect, impair, or diminish any right, power, or jurisdiction of . . . any court . . . of the United States over or in regard to any navigable waters or any commerce between the States . . . .\" We need not stop to catalogue all the ends that may be served by this proviso. See S. Rep. No. 1198, 81st Cong., 1st Sess.; H. R. Rep. No. 1429, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. It is argued that the proviso was included to make plain that the bonds issued by the agency were taxable by the United States. We must go further, however, to find a rational purpose since another proviso of the Act of Congress specifically stated: \"That any obligations issued and outstanding, including the income derived therefrom, under the terms of the compact or agreement, and any amendments thereto, shall be subject to the tax laws of the United States.\" Whatever may be the several effects of the other proviso with which we are presently concerned, one result seems to us clear. This proviso, read in light of the sue-and-be-sued clause in the compact, reserves the jurisdiction of the federal courts to act in any matter arising under the compact over which they would have jurisdiction by virtue of the fact that the Mississippi is a navigable stream and that interstate commerce is involved. There is no more apt illustration of the involvement of the commerce power and the power over maritime matters than the Jones Act. O'Donnell v. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co., \n318 \nU.S. 36, 39\n-43. This is not enlarging the jurisdiction of the federal courts but only recognizing as one of its appropriate applications the business activities of an agency active in commerce and maritime matters.\n\nThe States who are parties to the compact by accepting it and acting under it assume the conditions that Congress \n\n[359 \nU.S. 275, 282]\n\u00a0\n under the Constitution attached.\n7\n So if there be doubt as to the meaning of the sue-and-be-sued clause in the setting of the compact prior to approval by Congress, the doubt dissipates when the condition attached by Congress is accepted and acted upon by the two States.\n\nFinally we can find no more reason for excepting state or bi-state corporations from \"employer\" as used in the Jones Act than we could for excepting them either from the Safety Appliance Act (United States v. California, \n297 \nU.S. 175\n) or the Railway Labor Act (California v. Taylor, \n353 \nU.S. 553\n). In the latter case we reviewed at length federal legislation governing employer-employee relationships and said, \"When Congress wished to exclude state employees, it expressly so provided.\" \n353 \nU.S., at 564\n. The Jones Act (46 U.S.C. 688) has no exceptions from the broad sweep of the words \"Any seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment may\" etc. The rationale of United States v. California, \n\n[359 \nU.S. 275, 283]\n\u00a0\n supra, and California v. Taylor, supra, makes it impossible for us to mark a distinction here and hold that this bi-state agency is not an employer under the Jones Act.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BLACK, MR. JUSTICE CLARK and MR. JUSTICE STEWART concur in the judgment and opinion of the Court with the understanding that we do not reach the constitutional question as to whether the Eleventh Amendment immunizes from suit agencies created by two or more States under state compacts which the Constitution requires to be approved by the Congress.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"When Chisholm dared to sue the `sovereign state' of Georgia, all the states were so indignant that Congress moved with vehement speed to prevent subsequent affronts to the dignity of states. More than the dignity of a sovereign state was probably at issue, however. When the Eleventh Amendment was proposed many states were in financial difficulties and had defaulted on their debts. The states could therefore use the new amendment not only in defense of theoretical sovereignty but also in a more practical way to forestall suits by individual creditors!\" Irish and Prothro, The Politics of American Democracy (1959), p. 123.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] \"The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] \"No State shall, without the consent of Congress, . . . enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State . . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] That is true even though the matter in dispute concerns a question of state law on which the courts or other agencies of the State have spoken. Dyer v. Sims, \n341 \nU.S. 22, 30\n-32. While we show deference to state law in construing a compact, state law as pronounced in prior adjudications and rulings is not binding. Ibid.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The Court in Hinderlider v. La Plata Co., \n304 \nU.S. 92, 104\n, spoke of two methods under our Constitution of settling controversies between States. One is our original jurisdiction defined in Art. III, 2. The other is the compact: \"The compact - the legislative means - adapts to our Union of sovereign States the age-old treaty-making power of independent sovereign nations. Adjustment by compact without a judicial or quasi-judicial determination of existing rights had been practiced in the Colonies, was practiced by the States before the adoption of the Constitution, and had been extensively practiced in the United States for nearly half a century before this Court first applied the judicial means in settling the boundary dispute in Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 12 Pet. 657, 723-25.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] See Port of New York Authority, 42 Stat. 174; New York and New Jersey Tunnel Agreement, 41 Stat. 158; Kansas City Water Works Agreement, 42 Stat. 1058; New York-Vermont Bridge Agreement, 45 Stat. 120; Delaware River Toll Bridge Compact, 61 Stat. 752; Menominee River Bridge Compact, 45 Stat. 300.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] \"Historically the consent of Congress, as a prerequisite to the validity of agreements by States, appears as the republican transformation of the needed approval by the Crown. But the Constitution plainly had two very practical objectives in view in conditioning agreement by States upon consent of Congress. For only Congress is the appropriate organ for determining what arrangements between States might fall within the prohibited class of `Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation', and what arrangements come within the permissive class of `Agreement or Compact.' But even the permissive agreements may affect the interests of States other than those parties to the agreement: the national, and not merely a regional, interest may be involved. Therefore, Congress must exercise national supervision through its power to grant or withhold consent, or to grant it under appropriate conditions. The framers thus astutely created a mechanism of legal control over affairs that are projected beyond State lines and yet may not call for, nor be capable of, national treatment. They allowed interstate adjustments but duly safeguarded the national interest.\" Frankfurter and Landis, The Compact Clause of the Constitution - A Study in Interstate Adjustments, 34 Yale L. J. 685, 694-695.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, whom MR. JUSTICE HARLAN and MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER join, dissenting.\n\nThe Court, acknowledging the applicability of the provisions of the Eleventh Amendment to the Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Commission, states: \"The question here is whether Tennessee and Missouri have waived their immunity under the facts of this case.\" Ante, p. 277. The Court finds such a waiver in the words \"sue and be sued\" included in Art. I, 3, of the Compact creating respondent Commission. The Supreme Court of Missouri has said: \"A statutory provision that such a public corporation `may sue and be sued' does not authorize a suit against it for negligence.\" Todd v. Curators of the University of Missouri, 347 Mo. 460, 465, 147 S. W. 2d 1063, 1064. The Tennessee courts have not ruled on the significance of this clause, but the Supreme Court of Tennessee has been emphatic in its holding that waivers of sovereign immunity from suit are to be narrowly construed. Hill v. Beeler, 199 Tenn. 325, 286 S. W. 2d 868. The Court of Appeals below held that in neither Missouri nor Tennessee would the language \"sue and be sued\" render a public corporation liable for suit in tort. 254 F.2d 857. Three times during this Term the Court followed \n\n[359 \nU.S. 275, 284]\n\u00a0\n its settled practice in dealing with a doubtful state statute by deferring to interpretations of local law rendered by the lower federal courts.\n1\n We should not now disregard this settled practice but should accept the interpretation of Missouri and Tennessee law as found by the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.\n\nDespite the fact that it has been authoritatively held that neither State waives sovereign immunity by the \"sue and be sued\" provision, this Court finds that those words constitute a waiver by the States of the immunity from suit, in the federal courts, afforded them by the Eleventh Amendment.\n\nThe legal consequences of the terms of a Compact are not, as a generalized proposition, for the originating construction of this Court. What was held in Dyer v. Sims, \n341 \nU.S. 22\n, does not support such a claim. That case arose under a Compact among eight States to control pollution in the Ohio River System. Seven of the States asserted that under the Compact West Virginia was obligated to appropriate funds for administrative expenses of the Joint Commission formed under the Compact. By a self-serving construction of its duty under the Compact. West Virginia resisted the claims of the other States to the Compact. Here was a typical controversy among States, a controversy as to the undertaking of a Compact among States, for the peaceful solution of which the Constitution designed Art. III, 2. The very nature of the controversy made it necessary for this Court to construe the terms of the Compact, that is, the contractual obligations assumed by West Virginia vis-a-vis the other parties to the Compact. The problem presented by this case has no kinship with that presented by Dyer v. Sims. This is a suit by an individual against the States over which the \n\n[359 \nU.S. 275, 285]\n\u00a0\n federal courts have jurisdiction only if the States have authorized such suits. Both States deny having given such authorization and the Court of Appeals has justified their denial in its finding of their law. Since a Compact comes into being through an Act of Congress, its construction gives rise to a federal question. Delaware River Comm'n v. Colburn, \n310 \nU.S. 419, 427\n. But a federal question does not require a federal answer by way of a blanket, nationwide substantive doctrine where essentially local interests are at stake. See, e. g., Board of County Comm'rs v. United States, \n308 \nU.S. 343\n. A Compact is, after all, a contract. Ordinarily, in the interpretation of a contract, the meaning the parties attribute to the words governs the obligations assumed in the agreement. Similarly, since these States had the freedom to waive or to refuse to waive immunity granted by the Eleventh Amendment, the language they employed in the Compact, not modified by Congress, should be limited to the legal significance that these States have placed upon such language, not to avoid the obligations they undertook, but to enforce the meaning of conventional language used in their law.\n\nThis Court, however, finds that Congress, in granting the necessary consent to the Compact, imposed suability in the federal courts upon the States as a condition to its consent. No doubt Congress could have insisted upon a provision waiving immunity from suit in the federal courts as the price of obtaining its consent to the Compact. The fact that this Court in Keifer & Keifer v. Reconstruction Finance Corp., \n306 \nU.S. 381, 389\n-391, indicated that governmental immunity from suit had fallen into disfavor may well have been a good reason why Congress should have done just this in passing upon the Tennessee-Missouri Compact. It is a bad reason for this Court to write in such a waiver when Congress has not done so. Surely the doctrine of sovereign immunity was \n\n[359 \nU.S. 275, 286]\n\u00a0\n not so obsolete that a waiver of immunity did not require a clear indication that Congress had exacted a waiver by the States as the price of consent. The disfavor which was referred to by this Court in Keifer has not attained such acceptance as to lead this Court to disregard the strictness with which States continue to enforce it. See Great Northern Life Ins. Co. v. Read, \n322 \nU.S. 47\n. Moreover, the Court's conclusion that Congress must have understood the \"sue and be sued\" clause to be a waiver of the Eleventh Amendment and that therefore their consent must have been predicated on that understanding finds no support in the legislative history.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nAs the evidence from which the Court finds an implied imposed withdrawal of the States' immunity from suit is tenuous, the basis for its finding of an explicit imposition of waiver is non-existent. Such an explicit imposition is deemed to lie in the language in the Act which states that nothing in the Compact \"shall be construed to affect, impair, or diminish any right, power, or jurisdiction of the United States or of any court, . . . over or in regard to any navigable waters, or any commerce between the States . . . .\" Read as this should be read on the natural understanding of the phrasing, there is nothing to indicate that the subject of immunity from suit was in \n\n[359 \nU.S. 275, 287]\n\u00a0\n contemplation. In addition, this clause has a history of more than one hundred years which confirms and emphasizes the plain intendment of the language.\n\nThe use of clauses preserving \"jurisdiction . . . of any court\" dates back to a Compact between New York and New Jersey approved by Congress in 1834: \"Provided, That nothing therein contained shall be construed to impair or in any manner affect, any right of jurisdiction of the United States in and over the islands or waters which form the subject of the said agreement.\"\n3\n Substantially this same language may be found in other early congressional Acts consenting to interstate Compacts.\n4\n An alternate but similar provision regarding federal jurisdiction is found in some other congressional consents: \"Nothing herein contained shall be construed to affect the right of the United States to regulate commerce, or the jurisdiction of the United States over navigable waters.\"\n5\n A third variation has been: \"Provided, That nothing therein contained shall be construed as impairing or in any manner affecting any right or jurisdiction of the United States in and over the region which forms the subject of said agreement.\"\n6\n In not one of the ten cited Compacts thus approved was there any language which could be construed as a waiver of the constitutional immunity granted to States from suits in the federal courts. And yet the language before us, in essence conveying the same meaning, is said to have that effect.\n7\n Indeed, the identical \n\n[359 \nU.S. 275, 288]\n\u00a0\n clause upon which the Court today rests its finding of an imposed waiver of the Eleventh Amendment has appeared in at least two prior consents to Compacts. One of these Compacts contained a \"sue and be sued\" provision,\n8\n but the other did not.\n9\n The history of these federal jurisdiction provisions demonstrates beyond peradventure that the clause was unrelated to the question of waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity.\n\nThe conclusion that what the language in the Act alone would not do it accomplishes when \"read in light of the sue-and-be-sued clause,\" ante, p. 281, violates the very congressional language on which it relies. Had there been no \"sue and be sued\" clause in the Compact, this Bridge Commission could not have been sued in the federal courts despite the fact that it was operating a vessel on navigable water and in interstate commerce. The Eleventh Amendment would not have permitted it. By finding that language in the Compact permits this suit, the Court is construing the Compact to \"affect,\" by enlarging, the jurisdiction of the United States courts over activities conducted in interstate commerce.\n\nThe constitutional requirement of consent by Congress to a Compact between the States was designed for the protection of national interests by the power to withhold consent or to grant it on condition of appropriate safeguards of those interests. The Compact may impair the \n\n[359 \nU.S. 275, 289]\n\u00a0\n course of interstate commerce in a way found undesirable by Congress. Or the national interest may derive from the necessity of maintaining a properly balanced federal system by vetoing a Compact which would adversely affect States not parties to the Compact. To imply from a congressional consent changes in the law of the Compact States of merely local concern, such as dislodging a State's policy on suability for torts attributable to the administration of the bridge (while necessarily leaving unaffected the State's suability for torts not attributable to its administration), would constitute a complete disregard of the purpose of the Constitution in requiring congressional consent to Compacts. Such disregard would introduce a wholly irrational disharmony in the application of local policy.\n\nIn view of the authorities cited by the Court for the proposition that the Jones Act applies to the Commission,\n10\n I assume that the Court is referring solely to the substantive applicability of that Act. Believing as I do that the federal courts have no jurisdiction over this suit. I do not reach that substantive question.\n\nI would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sims v. United States, \n359 \nU.S. 108\n; The Tungus v. Skorgaard, \n358 \nU.S. 588\n; United Pilots Assn. v. Halecki, \n358 \nU.S. 613\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See S. Rep. No. 1198, 81st Cong., 1st Sess.; H. R. Rep. No. 1429, 81st Cong., 1st Sess.; 95 Cong. Rec. 14589-14590, 14982-14983. In letters to the House and Senate Committees considering the bill consenting to this Tennessee-Missouri Compact, Acting Secretary of Commerce Thomas C. Blaisdell, Jr., expressed his belief that \"this provision is intended to avoid the application to the Federal Government of the specific provision found in the compact that `Such bonds shall be the negotiable bonds of the Commission, the income from which shall be tax free.'. . .\" S. Rep. No. 1198, supra, at 3; H. R. Rep. No. 1429, supra, at 3. To avoid the possibility that the provision was not sufficiently clear, Congress added specific language stating that the bonds issued by the Commission were taxable by the United States. 63 Stat. 930.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 4 Stat. 711.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] 20 Stat. 483; 21 Stat. 352 (added \"jurisdiction of its courts\"); 25 Stat. 553 (added \"jurisdiction of its courts\"); 34 Stat. 861.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] 40 Stat. 515. Similar language is found in 41 Stat. 158.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] 42 Stat. 180. See similar language in 45 Stat. 301; 45 Stat. 121.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] In some Compacts there have been similar though not identical federal jurisdiction clauses in the Compacts themselves, although those Compacts did not contain suability provisions. 66 Stat. 74, 77-78; 68 Stat. 690, 697. In the recently approved Compact between \n\n[359 \nU.S. 275, 288]\n\u00a0\n California and Oregon involving the Klamath River Basin, 71 Stat. 497, the Compact itself contains clauses rendering suits possible against state agencies and also a clause reserving federal jurisdiction, in its terms similar to the provisions in prior congressional consents to Compacts. Yet another provision states that nothing in the Compact shall be construed as \"Enlarging, diminishing or otherwise affecting the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States.\" 71 Stat. 508.

United States, also on certiorari to the same Court, argued April 29, 1959.\n\n Petitioners were convicted in a Federal District Court of conspiring to fix prices of plain plate glass mirrors in violation of 1 of the Sherman Act. After a key government witness had testified at their trial and had admitted that he had testified on the same general subject matter before the grand jury which indicted petitioners, their counsel moved for production of the grand jury minutes, not attempting to show any particularized need for them but claiming an absolute right to their production under Jencks v. United States, \n353 \nU.S. 657\n. This motion was denied by the trial judge. Held: Under Rule 6 (e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure the question whether the grand jury minutes should be produced was committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge; no abuse of his discretion has been shown; and petitioners' conviction is sustained. Pp. 396-401.\n\n (a) Neither Jencks v. United States, supra, nor 18 U.S.C. 3500, which superseded its doctrine, has any bearing on this case, since neither of them relates to grand jury minutes.

JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioners stand convicted on a single-count indictment charging a conspiracy under 1 of the Sherman Act. They contend that the trial judge erred in refusing to permit them to inspect the grand jury minutes covering the testimony before that body of a key government witness at the trial. The Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions, 260 F.2d 397. With reference to the present claim, it held that Rule 6 (e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure\n1\n committed the inspection or not of grand jury minutes to the sound discretion of the trial judge, \n\n[360 \nU.S. 395, 397]\n\u00a0\n and that in this instance, no abuse of that discretion had been shown. We granted certiorari limited to the question posed by this ruling. \n358 \nU.S. 917, 918\n. We conclude that in the circumstances of this case the trial court did not err in refusing to make Jonas' grand jury testimony available to petitioners for use in cross-examination.\n\nThe indictment returned in the case named as defendants seven corporations, all manufacturers of mirrors, and three of their officers. However, only three of the corporations are petitioners here, along with one individual, J. A. Messer, Sr. The indictment charged a conspiracy to fix the price of plain plate glass mirrors sold in interstate commerce. It is not necessary for our purposes to detail the facts of this long trial, the record of which covers 860 pages. It is sufficient to say that the Government proved its case through 10 witnesses, the last of whom was Jonas. He was President of a large North Carolina mirror manufacturing company and had a reputation for independence in the industry. Although neither he nor his corporation was indicted, the latter was made a co-conspirator. The evidence indicates that the conspiracy was consummated at two meetings held on successive days during the week of the annual meeting of the Mirror Manufacturers Association in 1954 at Asheville, North Carolina. Jonas, not being a member of the Association, did not attend the convention. Talk at the convention regarding prices culminated in telephone calls by several representatives of mirror manufacturers to Jonas concerning his attitude on raising prices. On the day following these calls Jonas and three of the participants in the conspiracy met at an inn away from the convention headquarters and discussed \"prices.\" Within three days thereafter each of the manufacturers announced an identical price increase, which was approximately 10 percent. Jonas' testimony, of course, was confined to the telephone calls and the meeting at the inn \n\n[360 \nU.S. 395, 398]\n\u00a0\n where the understanding was finalized. The Government admits that he was an \"important\" witness. However, proof of the conspiracy was overwhelming aside from Jonas' testimony. While he was the only witness who characterized the outcome of the meetings as an \"agreement\" on prices, no witness negatived this conclusion and the identical price lists that followed the meeting at the inn were little less than proof positive.\n\nAfter the conclusion of Jonas' testimony, defense counsel interrogated him as to the number of times he appeared and the subject of his testimony before the grand jury. Upon ascertaining that Jonas had testified three times on \"the same general subject matter,\" counsel moved for the delivery of the grand jury minutes. He stated that the petitioners had \"a right . . . to inspect the Grand Jury record of the testimony of this witness after he has completed his direct examination\" relating to \"the same general subject matter\" as his trial testimony.\n2\n As authority for \"the automatic delivery of Grand Jury transcripts\" under such circumstances counsel cited Jencks v. United States, \n353 \nU.S. 657\n (1957). As previously indicated, the motion was denied.\n\nIt appears to us clear that Jencks v. United States, supra, is in nowise controlling here. It had nothing to do with grand jury proceedings and its language was not intended to encompass grand jury minutes. Likewise, it is equally clear that Congress intended to exclude those minutes from the operation of the so-called Jencks Act, 71 Stat. 595, 18 U.S.C. (Supp. V, 1958) 3500.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nPetitioners concede, as they must, that any disclosure of grand jury minutes is covered by Fed. Rules Crim. Proc. 6 (e) promulgated by this Court in 1946 after the \n\n[360 \nU.S. 395, 399]\n\u00a0\n approval of Congress. In fact, the federal trial courts as well as the Courts of Appeals have been nearly unanimous in regarding disclosure as committed to the discretion of the trial judge.\n4\n Our cases announce the same principle,\n5\n and Rule 6 (e) is but declaratory of it.\n6\n As recently as last Term we characterized cases where grand jury minutes are used \"to impeach a witness, to refresh his recollection, to test his credibility and the like\" as instances of \"particularized need where the secrecy of the proceedings is lifted discretely and limitedly.\" United States v. Procter & Gamble, \n356 \nU.S. 677, 683\n (1958).\n\nPetitioners argue, however, that the trial judge's discretion under Rule 6 (e) must be exercised in accordance with the rationale of Jencks; namely, upon a showing on cross-examination that a trial witness testified before the grand jury - and nothing more - the defense has a \"right\" to the delivery to it of the witness' grand jury testimony.\n\nThis conclusion, however, runs counter to \"a long-established policy\" of secrecy, United States v. Procter & Gamble, supra, at 681, older than our Nation itself. The reasons therefor are manifold, id., at 682, and are compelling when viewed in the light of the history and modus operandi of the grand jury. Its establishment in the Constitution \"as the sole method for preferring charges in serious criminal cases\" indeed \"shows the high place it [holds] as an instrument of justice.\" Costello v. United States, \n350 \nU.S. 359, 362\n (1956). Ever since this action \n\n[360 \nU.S. 395, 400]\n\u00a0\n by the Fathers, the American grand jury, like that of England, \"has convened as a body of laymen, free from technical rules, acting in secret, pledged to indict no one because of prejudice and to free no one because of special favor.\" Ibid. Indeed, indictments may be returned on hearsay, or for that matter, even on the knowledge of the grand jurors themselves. Id., at 362, 363. To make public any part of its proceedings would inevitably detract from its efficacy. Grand jurors would not act with that independence required of an accusatory and inquisitorial body. Moreover, not only would the participation of the jurors be curtailed, but testimony would be parsimonious if each witness knew that his testimony would soon be in the hands of the accused. Especially is this true in antitrust proceedings where fear of business reprisal might haunt both the grand juror and the witness. And this \"go slow\" sign would continue as realistically at the time of trial as theretofore.\n\nIt does not follow, however, that grand jury minutes should never be made available to the defense. This Court has long held that there are occasions, see United States v. Procter & Gamble, supra, at 683, when the trial judge may in the exercise of his discretion order the minutes of a grand jury witness produced for use on his cross-examination at trial. Certainly \"disclosure is wholly proper where the ends of justice require it.\" United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., supra, at 234.\n\nThe burden, however, is on the defense to show that \"a particularized need\" exists for the minutes which outweighs the policy of secrecy. We have no such showing here. As we read the record the petitioners failed to show any need whatever for the testimony of the witness Jonas. They contended only that they had a \"right\" to the transcript because it dealt with subject matter generally covered at the trial. Petitioners indicate that the trial judge required a showing of contradiction \n\n[360 \nU.S. 395, 401]\n\u00a0\n between Jonas' trial and grand jury testimony. Such a preliminary showing would not, of course, be necessary. While in a colloquy with counsel the judge did refer to such a requirement, we read his denial as being based on the breadth of petitioners' claim. Petitioners also claim error because the trial judge failed to examine the transcript himself for any inconsistencies. But we need not consider that problem because petitioners made no such request of the trial judge. The Court of Appeals apparently was of the view that even if the trial judge had been requested to examine the transcript he would not have been absolutely required to do so. It is contended here that the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has reached a contrary conclusion. United States v. Spangelet, 258 F.2d 338. Be that as it may, resolution of that question must await a case where the issue is presented by the record. The short of it is that in the present case the petitioners did not invoke the discretion of the trial judge, but asserted a supposed absolute right, a right which we hold they did not have. The judgment is therefore.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"Rule 6. The Grand Jury.\n\n.  .  .  .  .\n\n\n\"(e) Secrecy of Proceedings and Disclosure. Disclosure of matters occurring before the grand jury other than its deliberations and the vote of any juror may be made to the attorneys for the government for use in the performance of their duties. Otherwise a juror, attorney, interpreter or stenographer may disclose matters occurring before the grand jury only when so directed by the court preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding or when permitted by the court at the request of the defendant upon a showing that grounds may exist for a motion to dismiss the indictment because of matters occurring before the grand jury. No obligation of secrecy may be imposed upon any person except in accordance with this rule. The court may direct that an indictment shall be kept secret until the defendant is in custody or has given bail, and in that event the clerk shall seal the indictment and no person shall disclose the finding of the indictment except when necessary for the issuance and execution of a warrant or summons.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The fact that the trial testimony and that before the grand jury included the same \"subjects\" or related to \"the same general subject matter\" is not contested.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See S.

JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS join, dissenting.\n\nIn the words of the Court of Appeals, Jonas was the Government's \"principal prosecuting witness.\"\n1\n He was President of Lenoir Mirror Company, which company was \n\n[360 \nU.S. 395, 402]\n\u00a0\n a participant in the alleged price-fixing conspiracy, but was not indicted. After Jonas testified on direct examination defense counsel asked for the production of his relevant grand jury testimony. The trial judge immediately made clear his intention not to grant the motion: \"Unless you can show some sound basis that contradicts between what happened in the Grand Jury room and his testimony before the Grand Jury and his testimony in this trial, I am not going to require the production of the Grand Jury records. It would be easy for any attorney to get access to the records of the Grand Jury by just such a motion as you are making here.\" Defense counsel protested, \"we are not attempting that. We want just a transcript of his testimony before the Grand Jury regarding the subjects to which he has testified on direct examination.\" (Emphasis supplied.) This request thus encompassed all of Jonas' grand jury testimony only if all of that testimony covered the subject matter of Jonas' trial testimony. The court replied, \"You have stated what you want to ask him and I am denying your right to do it.\" Plainly defense counsel were not asking to see the minutes of the entire grand jury proceedings, nor even of all of Jonas' testimony before the grand jury unless all of it was on the same subject matter as his trial testimony. Their motion was carefully limited to a request for so much of Jonas' grand jury testimony as \"covered the substance of his testimony on direct examination.\" This request that secrecy be \"lifted discretely and limitedly,\" United States v. Procter & Gamble, \n356 \nU.S. 677, 683\n, necessarily implied a request that the trial judge inspect the grand jury minutes and turn over to the defense only those parts dealing with Jonas' testimony on the same subject matter as his trial testimony. In this posture, then, the question for our decision is the narrow one whether the trial judge erred in denying the defense request for inspection of the grand jury testimony of a \n\n[360 \nU.S. 395, 403]\n\u00a0\n key government witness which covered the subject matter of that witness' trial testimony.\n2\n I dissent from the Court's affirmance of the trial judge's ruling denying this carefully circumscribed request.\n\nGrand jury secrecy is, of course, not an end in itself. Grand jury secrecy is maintained to serve particular ends. But when secrecy will not serve those ends or when the advantages gained by secrecy are outweighed by a countervailing interest in disclosure, secrecy may and should be lifted, for to do so in such a circumstance would further the fair administration of criminal justice. See McNabb v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 332\n. It is true that secrecy is not to be lifted without a showing of good reason, but it is too late in the day to say, as the Court as a practical matter does here, that the Government may insist upon grand jury secrecy even when the possible prejudice to the accused in a criminal case is crystal clear and none of the reasons justifying secrecy is present. \"[A]fter the grand jury's functions are ended, disclosure is wholly proper where the ends of justice require it.\" United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., \n310 \nU.S. 150, 234\n. Thus grand jury minutes have been made available to a defendant accused of committing perjury before the grand jury so that he could adequately prepare his defense, United States v. Remington, 191 F.2d 246; United States v. Rose, 215 F.2d 617, and to a defendant who can show an inconsistency between the trial testimony and grand jury testimony of a government witness, United States v. Alper, 156 F.2d 222; Burton v. United States, 175 F.2d 960; Herzog v. United States, 226 F.2d 561; United States v. H. J. K. Theatre Corp., 236 F.2d 502. On occasion the Government itself has recognized the fairness of permitting the defense access to the grand jury testimony of \n\n[360 \nU.S. 395, 404]\n\u00a0\n government witnesses even though it considered that it was not bound to do so, United States v. Grunewald, 162 F. Supp. 621. This Court has implied that grand jury minutes would be discoverable by a defendant in a civil antitrust suit instituted by the Government on a showing of \"particularized need,\" United States v. Procter & Gamble, \n356 \nU.S. 677, 683\n.\n3\n Nor can we overlook that the Government uses grand jury minutes to further its own interests in litigation. It is apparently standard practice for government attorneys to use grand jury minutes in preparing a case for trial, see United States v. Procter & Gamble, \n356 \nU.S. 677, 678\n, in refreshing the recollection of government witnesses at trial, see United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., \n310 \nU.S. 150, 233\n, and, when the need arises, in impeaching witnesses at trial, see United States v. Cotter, 60 F.2d 689. Of course, when the Government uses grand jury minutes at trial the defense is ordinarily entitled to inspect the relevant testimony in those minutes. United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., \n310 \nU.S. 150, 233\n; United States v. Cotter, 60 F.2d 689. Indeed, Rule 6 (e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal \n\n[360 \nU.S. 395, 405]\n\u00a0\n Procedure itself recognizes that grand jury testimony is discoverable under appropriate circumstances.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nThe Court apparently agrees with the conclusion compelled by these precedents, for its opinion states that grand jury minutes are discoverable when \"`a particularized need' exists for the minutes which outweighs the policy of secrecy.\" But the Court pays only lip service to the principle in view of the result in this case. It is clear beyond question, I think, that the application of that principle to this case requires a holding that Jonas' grand jury testimony is discoverable to the limited extent sought. Since there are no valid considerations which militate in favor of grand jury secrecy in this case, simple justice requires that the petitioners be given access to the relevant portions of Jonas' grand jury testimony so that they have a fair opportunity to refute the Government's case.\n\nEssentially four reasons have been advanced as justification for grand jury secrecy.\n5\n (1) To prevent the accused from escaping before he is indicted and arrested or from tampering with the witnesses against him. (2) To prevent disclosure of derogatory information presented to the grand jury against an accused who has not been indicted. (3) To encourage complainants and witnesses to come before the grand jury and speak freely without fear that their testimony will be made public thereby subjecting them to possible discomfort or retaliation. (4) To encourage the grand jurors to engage in uninhibited investigation and deliberation by barring disclosure of their votes and comments during the proceedings. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 395, 406]\n\u00a0\n\n\nNone of these reasons dictates that Jonas' grand jury testimony, to the limited extent it is sought, should be kept secret. The Court, while making obeisance to \"a long-established policy\" of secrecy, makes no showing whatever how denial of Jonas' grand jury testimony serves any of the purposes justifying secrecy. Certainly disclosure at this stage of the proceedings would not enable the defendants to escape from custody or to tamper with the witness who has already testified against them on direct examination. Certainly, also, protection of an innocent accused who has not been indicted has no bearing on this case. Discovery has been sought only of Jonas' grand jury testimony on the same subject matter as his testimony at trial. This testimony will have condemned someone to whom he did not refer at trial only if he has concealed information at the trial, and this creates the very situation in which it is imperative that the defense have access to the grand jury testimony if we are to adhere to the standards we have set for ourselves to assure the fair administration of criminal justice in the federal courts. Similarly, disclosure of Jonas' relevant grand jury testimony could not produce the apprehended results of retaliation or discomfort which might induce a reluctance in others to testify before grand juries. Jonas has already taken the stand and testified freely in open court against the defendants. His testimony has been extremely damaging. Disclosure of his testimony before the grand jury is hardly likely to result in any embarrassment that his trial testimony has not already produced. \"If he tells the truth, and the truth is the same as he testified before the grand jury, the disclosure of the former testimony cannot possibly bring to him any harm . . . which his testimony on the open trial does not equally tend to produce.\" 8 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed. 1940), 2362, at 725. Witnesses before a grand jury necessarily know that once called by the Government to testify at trial they cannot \n\n[360 \nU.S. 395, 407]\n\u00a0\n remain secret informants quite apart from whether their grand jury testimony is discoverable. Finally, the defense seeks nothing which would disclose the votes or opinions of any of the grand jurors involved in these proceedings. All that is sought is the relevant testimony of Jonas. If there are questions by grand jurors intertwined with Jonas' testimony disclosure of which would indicate the jurors' opinions or be embarrassing to them, the names of the grand jurors asking the questions can be excised. Cf. United States v. Grunewald, 162 F. Supp. 621.\n\nPlainly, then, no reason justifying secrecy of Jonas' relevant grand jury testimony appears. The Court's insistence on secrecy exalts the principle of secrecy for secrecy's sake in the face of obvious possible prejudice to the petitioners' defense against Jonas' seriously damaging testimony on the trial. Surely \"Justice requires no less,\" Jencks v. United States, \n353 \nU.S. 657, 669\n, than that the defense be permitted every reasonable opportunity to impeach a government witness, and that a criminal conviction not be based on the testimony of untruthful or inaccurate witnesses. The interest of the United States in a criminal prosecution, it must be emphasized, \"is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done.\" Berger v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 78, 88\n.\n\nObviously the impeachment of the Government's key witness on the basis of prior inconsistent or contradictory statements made under oath before a grand jury would have an important effect on a trial. Thus it has long been held that a defendant may have access to inconsistent grand jury testimony for use in cross-examination if he can somehow show that an inconsistency between the trial and grand jury testimony exists. United States v. Alper, 156 F.2d 222; Burton v. United States, 175 F.2d 960; Herzog v. United States, 226 F.2d 561; United States v. H. J. K. Theatre Corp., 236 F.2d 502. But in an analogous situation we have pointed \n\n[360 \nU.S. 395, 408]\n\u00a0\n out the folly of requiring the defense to show inconsistency between the witness' trial testimony and his previous statements on the same subject matter before it can obtain access to those very statements. In Jencks v. United States, \n353 \nU.S. 657\n, we said that it offers no protection to permit a defendant to obtain inconsistent statements to impeach a witness unless he may inspect statements to determine if in fact they are inconsistent with the trial testimony. We said in Jencks:\n\n \"Requiring the accused first to show conflict between the reports and the testimony is actually to deny the accused evidence relevant and material to his defense. The occasion for determining a conflict cannot arise until after the witness has testified, and unless he admits conflict, as in Gordon, [Gordon v. United States, \n344 \nU.S. 414\n] the accused is helpless to know or discover conflict without inspecting the reports. A requirement of a showing of conflict would be clearly incompatible with our standards for the administration of criminal justice in the federal courts and must therefore be rejected.\" \n353 \nU.S., at 667\n-668.\n\n\n The considerations which moved us to lay down this principle as to prior statements of government witnesses made to government agents obviously apply with equal force to the grand jury testimony of a government witness. For the defense will rarely be able to lay a foundation for obtaining grand jury testimony by showing it is inconsistent with trial testimony unless it can inspect the grand jury testimony, and, apparently in recognition of this fact, the Court holds today that a preliminary showing of inconsistency by the defense would not be necessary in order for it to obtain access to relevant grand jury minutes. It is suggested by the Government, however, that rather than permit the defense to inspect the \n\n[360 \nU.S. 395, 409]\n\u00a0\n relevant grand jury minutes for possible use on cross-examination, the trial judge should inspect them and turn over to the defense only those portions, if any, that the judge considers would be useful for purposes of impeachment. This procedure has sometimes been utilized in the past as a way to limit discovery of grand jury minutes. See United States v. Alper, 156 F.2d 222; United States v. Consolidated Laundries, 159 F. Supp. 860. But we pointed out in Jencks the serious disadvantages of such a procedure and expressly disapproved of it. We said:\n\n\"Flat contradiction between the witness' testimony and the version of the events given in his reports is not the only test of inconsistency. The omission from the reports of facts related at the trial, or a contrast in emphasis upon the same facts, even a different order of treatment, are also relevant to the cross-examining process of testing the credibility of a witness' trial testimony.\n\n\n .  .   .   .  .\n\n\n \". . . We hold . . . that the petitioner is entitled to inspect the reports to decide whether to use them in his defense. Because only the defense is adequately equipped to determine the effective use for purpose of discrediting the Government's witness and thereby furthering the accused's defense, the defense must initially be entitled to see them to determine what use may be made of them. Justice requires no less.\" \n353 \nU.S., at 667\n-669.\n\n\n From Jonas' own admission it appears that his grand jury testimony covered the subject matter of his trial testimony. The reasons for permitting the defense counsel rather than the trial judge to decide what parts of that testimony can effectively be used on cross-examination are certainly not less compelling than in regard to the FBI reports involved in Jencks. For grand jury \n\n[360 \nU.S. 395, 410]\n\u00a0\n testimony is often lengthy and involved, and it will be extremely difficult for even the most able and experienced trial judge under the pressures of conducting a trial to pick out all of the grand jury testimony that would be useful in impeaching a witness. See United States v. Spangelet, 258 F.2d 338. His task should be completed when he has satisfied himself what part of the grand jury testimony covers the subject matter of the witness' testimony on the trial, and when he has given that part to the defense. Then the defense may utilize the grand jury testimony for impeachment purposes as it may deem advisable in its best interests, subject of course to the applicable rules of evidence.\n\nI would reverse the Court of Appeals and order a new trial for failure of the trial judge to order the production of Jonas' relevant grand jury testimony.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Jonas was the only witness to testify that the defendants had actually agreed to a uniform price increase. Furthermore, his testimony was necessary to refute other testimony that the President of petitioner Galax Mirror Co., Inc., had stated that he would follow his pricing policy regardless of what the other manufacturers did. Jonas' testimony was also instrumental in connecting petitioner Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. to the price-fixing agreement.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] As the Court points out, discovery of grand jury minutes is not affected by the Jencks statute, 18 U.S.C. (Supp. V) 3500.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] United States v. Procter & Gamble, upon which the Court relies, actually is authority for permitting discovery in this case. The Court in that case recognized that grand jury minutes were discoverable where the need outweighed the advantages of secrecy, but held that such was not the case in the circumstances because, unlike this case, Procter & Gamble concerned a demand for a transcript of the entire grand jury proceedings to be used in pretrial preparation of a civil suit. This case, of course, concerns a demand for discovery of a particular witness' relevant testimony for use on cross-examination at trial in a criminal prosecution. The Court specifically stated in Procter & Gamble: \"We do not reach in this case problems concerning the use of the grand jury transcript at the trial to impeach a witness, to refresh his recollection, to test his credibility and the like.

DOOR COUNTY(1959)\nNo. 396\nArgued: March 26, 1959Decided: May 4, 1959\n\n\n\n\n A county, a general contractor and a plumbing contractor sued in a State Court to enjoin picketing by a plumbers' union, because of the employment of nonunion plumbers, which had stopped work on an addition to the county courthouse, about half of the total cost of which was the cost of materials brought from outside the State. Held: The controversy was exclusively within the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board, and the State Court had no jurisdiction.

Wessel.\n\nSolicitor General Rankin, Jerome D. Fenton, Thomas J. McDermott and Dominick L. Manoli filed a brief for the National Labor Relations Board, as amicus curiae. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 354, 355]\n\u00a0\n\n\nOpinion of the Court by MR. JUSTICE BLACK, announced by MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS.\n\nRespondent, County of Door, Wisconsin, is a municipal corporation; petitioners are a Plumbers' Union Local and a Council of Trade Unions. The County hired respondent Oudenhoven to do the general contracting work on an addition to the Door County Courthouse. At the same time some eight contracts covering specific items of construction were entered into by the County with various other firms. Among the contractors was respondent Zahn who had successfully bid for the plumbing work in the project. Unlike the other successful bidders, however, Zahn employed nonunion labor. This disturbed the Plumbers' Union which attempted to induce him to sign a union agreement. After Zahn refused, a picket was assigned to walk around the courthouse carrying a placard which stated that nonunion workers were employed on the project. The picketing, though peaceful, effectively stopped all the work since union members employed by other contractors refused to cross the picket line.\n\nTo end the interruption respondents Door County, Zahn, and Oudenhoven sought an injunction in the local Circuit Court. Petitioners defended by claiming, among other things, that under the National Labor Relations Act\n1\n the state courts had no jurisdiction and that the controversy was exclusively subject to National Labor Relations Board control. The trial court, believing that interstate commerce was not affected by the dispute, denied that the Board had jurisdiction and held that state power existed. It found that state law had been violated by the picketing and issued an injunction. On appeal the Wisconsin Supreme Court affirmed. 4 Wis. 2d 142, 89 N. W. 2d 920. It apparently disagreed with the basis of the lower court's holding and assumed that the dispute \n\n[359 \nU.S. 354, 356]\n\u00a0\n did affect interstate commerce, but held that the N. L. R. B. had no jurisdiction because Door County, a governmental subdivision, was among those seeking relief. Since the N. L. R. B. had no power, the court ruled, state laws were not pre-empted and the injunction could stand. Under similar circumstances both the National Labor Relations Board and the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit have concluded that the N. L. R. B. has jurisdiction.\n2\n We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict. \n358 \nU.S. 878\n.\n\nThere can be no doubt that were Door County not a party to the litigation state courts would have no power over the dispute. The stipulated facts show that the total cost of the project was about $450,000. Roughly half of this was the cost of materials brought from outside Wisconsin. On similar facts this Court has often found a sufficient effect on commerce to give the N. L. R. B. jurisdiction. See, e. g., Labor Board v. Denver Bldg. & Constr. Trades Council, \n341 \nU.S. 675, 683\n-684. We see no reason to deviate from those holdings. It is also admitted that the dispute here involved is the kind over which the Labor Board normally has exclusive power. Respondents allege an attempt to force Zahn and the County to stop doing business with each other or, alternatively, to coerce Zahn into making his employees organize a union shop. Both of these allegations, if proved, would constitute unfair labor practices under 8 (b) (4) of the National Labor Relations Act.\n3\n If the charges are not proved the \n\n[359 \nU.S. 354, 357]\n\u00a0\n conduct might well be \"protected\" under 7 of the Labor Act.\n4\n In either case this Court has held that the determination must be made be made by the N. L. R. B. and that \"state [courts] must decline jurisdiction in deference to the tribunal which Congress has selected. . . .\"\n5\n\u00a0\n\nIt is claimed, however, that the presence of Door County somehow deprives the Board of jurisdiction and re-establishes state power. This contention is based on the fact that political subdivisions are expressly excluded from the definition of \"employer\" in the Labor Relations Act and therefore are not subject to many of its provisions.\n6\n To allow the County to file a complaint against the union would, it has been argued, give the County the advantages of the Labor Relations Act without subjecting it to the correlative responsibilities the statute imposes. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 354, 358]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn Local 25, Int'l Bro. of Teamsters v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co., \n350 \nU.S. 155\n, we decided that a railroad could seek relief before the Board although railroads, like political subdivisions, are expressly excluded from the term \"employer\" in the Act.\n7\n Our opinion pointed out that \"the N. L. R. B. is empowered to issue complaints whenever `it is charged' that any person subject to the Act is engaged in any proscribed unfair labor practice,\" and that Board regulations allow such a charge to be filed by \"any person\" as defined in the Act, \n350 \nU.S., at 160\n.\n8\n \"Since railroads are not excluded from the Act's definition of `person' . . .\"\n9\n we held that \"they are entitled to Board protection from the kind of unfair labor practice proscribed by 8 (b) (4) (A),\" reasoning that this result would best effectuate congressional policies of uniform control over labor abuses and protection of the parties injured by such practices. Ibid.\n\nThe position of a county and a railroad would seem to be identical under the Act, and the policy considerations which guided us in Local 25, like the statutory language there construed, would seem to apply equally here.\n10\n\u00a0\n\n[359 \nU.S. 354, 359]\n\u00a0\n Respondents attempt to distinguish the case by claiming that a political subdivision must be expressly included in a statute if it is to be considered within the law's coverage and that essential state functions will be impaired if the county is subjected to N. L. R. B. coverage. But this Court has many times held that government bodies not expressly included in a federal statute may, nevertheless, be subject to the law.\n11\n And Board jurisdiction to grant relief, far from interfering with county functions, serves to safeguard the interests of such political subdivisions. Accordingly, we find neither of respondents' contentions convincing.\n\nWe do not, of course, attempt to decide whether the Union's conduct in this dispute violates 8 (b) (4), is protected by 7, or is covered by neither provision of the Labor Act. Those are questions for the Board to determine in a proper proceeding brought before it. See, e. g., Weber v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., \n348 \nU.S. 468, 481\n. We merely hold that the Board has jurisdiction in this case and that, therefore, it was error for the Wisconsin courts to exercise jurisdiction.\n\nThe judgment of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin is reversed and the cause is remanded to that court for action not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 61 Stat. 136, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 151-168.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Labor Board v.

VIRGINIA(1959)\nNo. 38\nArgued: October 15, 1958Decided: February 24, 1959\n\n\n\n\n1. \nA Virginia statute provides a separate system of taxation for express companies. In lieu of all taxes on their other intangible property and rolling stock, it levies on express companies a \"franchise tax\" measured by gross receipts from their operations within Virginia, including receipts derived from transportation within the State of express transported through, into or out of the State. Held: As applied to appellant, a foreign corporation doing an exclusively interstate business in Virginia and owning property there, this tax does not violate the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution. Pp. 435-443.\n\n (a) Railway Express Agency v. Virginia, \n347 \nU.S. 359\n, distinguished. Pp. 438-439.\n\n\n (b) The descriptive words used by a state legislature in labelling a tax statute have no magic effect upon its validity or invalidity; but, where the plain language of the statute shows that the legislature intended to levy the tax upon intangible property and \"going concern\" value and that interpretation is buttressed by a unanimity of opinion of all state agencies, including the State's highest court, great weight must be given to the descriptive words so used in determining the natural and reasonable effect of the statute. Pp. 440-441.\n\n\n (c) When measuring \"going concern\" value, the State has the right to use any fair formula which would give effect to the intangible factors which influence real values, and that is exactly what the State has done here. Pp. 441-442.\n\n\n (d) The exclusive express privileges enjoyed by appellant on the railroads, admittedly valuable contract rights, cannot be said to have no value because all of appellant's net income is paid over to the railroads for the specific purpose of precluding it from having any net taxable income, thus frustrating the collection of an otherwise fair tax. P. 442.\n\n\n (e) The fact that Virginia could not prevent appellant from engaging in its exclusively interstate business does not prevent Virginia from taxing the \"good will\" or \"going concern\" value built up by such interstate business. Pp. 442-443. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 434, 435]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n2. \nIn its tax return, appellant failed to furnish information showing its gross receipts allocated to Virginia, which was called for under the statute and requested by the tax authorities. This prevented the tax authorities from obtaining the correct amount except by some method of approximation, and they used a formula which, in effect, ascribed to Virginia such proportion of appellant's gross receipts as the mileage of carriers within Virginia bore to the total national mileage of the same carriers. Held: In these circumstances, this method of calculating the tax was not so palpably unreasonable as to deprive appellant of its property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Merrill Pasco.\n\nFrederick T. Gray, Special Assistant Attorney General of Virginia, argued the cause for appellee. With him on the brief was Albertis S. Harrison, Jr., Attorney General.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nOnce again the effort of the Commonwealth of Virginia to levy a tax against express agencies is before us for decision. Nearly five years ago this Court struck down as a \"privilege tax\" violative of the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution its tax statute under which was laid an assessment on appellant's \"privilege of doing business\" in Virginia.\n1\n Railway Express Agency v. Virginia, \n347 \nU.S. 359\n (1954). Subsequently the Virginia General Assembly enacted the Act here involved levying a \"franchise tax\" on express companies, measured by gross receipts from operations within Virginia, in lieu of all other property taxes on intangibles and rolling stock. In due course an assessment against appellant was made thereunder for 1956. Both the State Corporation Commission, \n\n[358 \nU.S. 434, 436]\n\u00a0\n which has jurisdiction of such levies in Virginia, and the Commonwealth's highest court have upheld the validity of the new law as well as the assessment made thereunder, Railway Express Agency v. Virginia, 199 Va. 589, 100 S. E. 2d 785. Appellant levels a dual attack, the first being that the statute is a \"privilege tax\" and like the former one violates the Commerce Clause; or, secondly, that in any event the assessment under it is calculated in such a manner as to deprive appellant of its property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. On appeal we noted probable jurisdiction, \n356 \nU.S. 929\n (1958). We believe that Virginia has eliminated the Commerce Clause objections sustained against its former tax law. While the tax is in lieu of other property taxes which Virginia can legally assess and should be their just equivalent in amount, Postal Telegraph Cable Co. v. Adams, \n155 \nU.S. 688, 696\n (1895), we will not inquire into the exactitudes of the formula where appellant has not shown it to be so baseless as to violate due process. Nashville, C. & St. L. R. v. Browning, \n310 \nU.S. 362\n (1940). The failure of the appellant to furnish, in its return, certain necessary information showing its gross receipts allocated to Virginia, called for under the statute and requested by the Commonwealth, has left the correct amount unobtainable by the latter except by some method of approximation and places the burden on appellant to come forward with affirmative evidence of extraterritorial assessment.\n\n  BACKGROUND AND ACTIVITY OF APPELLANT IN VIRGINIA.\n\n\n Since the opinion in the former appeal, supra, at pp. 360-361, relates the factual details concerning appellant's operations in Virginia, we believe it sufficient to say here that it is a Delaware corporation, owned by 68 of the railroads of the United States. It is engaged in both an interstate \n\n[358 \nU.S. 434, 437]\n\u00a0\n and intrastate express business throughout the Nation, save in Virginia, where a constitutional provision bars foreign corporations from possessing or exercising any of the powers or functions of public service corporations. There it operates a wholly owned subsidiary, a Virginia corporation, which carries on its intrastate functions within the Commonwealth. Appellant's Virginia business is thus of an exclusively interstate nature. Through exclusive contract arrangements with 177 of the railroads of the Nation appellant is the sole operator of express facilities on their lines, including Virginia. It pays therefor all of its net income, thus achieving one of the stated purposes of the agreement - that appellant \". . . shall have no net taxable income.\" In turn, appellant's Virginia subsidiary pays all of its net income over to it for the privilege of exercising appellant's exclusive contracts in intrastate business in the Commonwealth. Appellant owns property within Virginia, its return filed with the Commonwealth for tax purposes showing $120,110.70 in cash on deposit; automotive equipment and trucks $262,719.63; real estate of the value of $32,850; and office equipment listed at $42,884.83.\n\n   VIRGINIA'S GENERAL TAXING SYSTEM.\n\n\n The Commonwealth has a comprehensive tax structure covering public service corporations.\n2\n It empowers local governments to levy ad valorem taxes on the \"dead\" value of all real property and tangible personal property, except rolling stock, located within their respective jurisdictions. This leaves free for state purposes taxes on rolling stock, money and other intangibles, and the \"live\" or \"going-concern\" value of the business in Virginia. We are concerned only with the state tax which is levied on \n\n[358 \nU.S. 434, 438]\n\u00a0\n the franchises of express companies. It provides\n3\n in pertinent part that\n\n\"[e]ach express company . . . shall . . . pay to the State a franchise tax which shall be in lieu of taxes upon all of its other intangible property and in lieu of property taxes on its rolling stock.\"\n\n\n The franchise tax is measured by \"the gross receipts derived from operations within\" Virginia which is deemed\n\n\"to be all receipts on business beginning and ending within this State and all receipts derived from the transportation within this State of express transported through, into, or out of this State.\"\n\n\n The State Corporation Commission is directed, after notice, to assess the franchise tax on the basis of a report to be filed by the company involved or, in case of its failure to file such report, the Commission is to base the assessment \"upon the best and most reliable information that it can procure.\"\n\n  THE ISSUES UNDER THE STATUTE.\n\n\n First, let us clear away the dead underbrush of the old law. The new tax is not denominated a license tax laid on the \"privilege of doing business in Virginia\"; nor is it \"in addition to the property tax\" levied against appellant, nor a condition precedent to its engaging in interstate commerce in the Commonwealth. The General Assembly has made crystal-clear that the tax is now a franchise tax laid on the intangible property of appellant, and is levied \"in lieu of taxes upon all of its other intangible property and . . . rolling stock.\" The measure of the tax is on gross receipts, fairly apportioned, and, as to appellant, is laid only on those \"derived from the transportation \n\n[358 \nU.S. 434, 439]\n\u00a0\n within this State of express transported through, into, or out of this State.\"\n\nAppellant concedes that the Commerce Clause does not prohibit the States from levying a tax on property owned by a concern doing an interstate business. It agrees that it has rolling stock and money in the Commonwealth, as well as intangibles, including its exclusive express privileges with the railroads. It readily admits that the latter agreements are \"valuable contract rights\" and contribute a principal element to the \"going concern value\" of its business in the Commonwealth. Subsuming that a valid tax levy might be levied on such intangibles, it argues, however, that the incidence of the tax is on appellant's privilege to carry on an exclusively interstate business in Virginia rather than on intangible property. Our sole question under the Commerce Clause is whether the tax in practical operation is on property or on privilege.\n\nThe due process issue is entangled with appellant's failure to file, in its report, data covering its gross receipts allocated to Virginia.\n4\n Failing to do this the State Corporation \n\n[358 \nU.S. 434, 440]\n\u00a0\n Commission used a formula which in effect ascribed to Virginia the proportion of such receipts as the mileage of carriers within Virginia bore to the total national mileage of the same lines.\n5\n Appellant contends that the assessment made in this manner is violative of due process and that the resulting amount of tax levied was confiscatory.\n\nIn any event, appellant argues, the \"in lieu\" provisions of the law, as applied to it, are invalid. Admitting that it had cash, intangibles and rolling stock that were subject to a state tax but which suffered none because of the \"in lieu\" provisions of this law, it contends that the tax assessed under the latter was no just equivalent of the \"in lieu\" taxes but was greatly in excess thereof and violative of due process.\n\n VALIDITY OF THE LAW UNDER THE COMMERCE CLAUSE.\n\n\n As we have pointed out, the statute levies a franchise tax in lieu of all taxes on \"other intangible property\" and rolling stock. (Emphasis added.) This leaves no room for doubt that the General Assembly intended to levy a tax upon appellant's intangibles. Moreover, supporting this interpretation, both the State Commission and the Supreme Court of Appeals have construed it as a tax on appellant's intangible property and \"going concern\" value. This trinity of agreement by three state agencies, though not conclusive, has great weight in our determination of the natural and reasonable effect of the statute. Railway Express v. Virginia, supra; Spector Motor Service v. O'Connor, \n340 \nU.S. 602\n (1951); Cudahy Packing Co. v. Minnesota, \n246 \nU.S. 450\n (1918); United States Express \n\n[358 \nU.S. 434, 441]\n\u00a0\n Co. v. Minnesota, \n223 \nU.S. 335, 346\n (1912). This is not to say that a legislature may effect a validation of a tax, otherwise unconstitutional, by merely changing its descriptive words. Lawrence v. State Tax Commission, \n286 \nU.S. 276, 280\n (1932); Galveston, H. & San Antonio R. Co. v. Texas, \n210 \nU.S. 217, 227\n (1908). One must comprehend, however, the difference between the use of magic words or labels validating an otherwise invalid tax and their use to disable an otherwise constitutional levy. The latter this Court has said may sometimes be done. Railway Express Agency v. Virginia, supra, at 364; Spector Motor Service v. O'Connor, supra, at 607; McLeod v. Dilworth Co., \n322 \nU.S. 327, 330\n (1944).\n\nAppellant buttresses its argument with reasoning that a tax on \"going concern\" value just cannot be measured by fairly apportioned gross receipts. While it may be true that gross receipts are not the best measure, it is too late now to question its constitutionality. Illinois Cent. R. Co. v. Minnesota, \n309 \nU.S. 157\n (1940); Great Northern R. Co. v. Minnesota, \n278 \nU.S. 503\n (1929); Pullman Co. v. Richardson, \n261 \nU.S. 330\n (1923); Cudahy Packing Co. v. Minnesota, \n246 \nU.S. 450\n (1918); United States Express Co. v. Minnesota, \n223 \nU.S. 335\n (1912); Wisconsin & M. R. Co. v. Powers, \n191 \nU.S. 379\n (1903). These decisions are still in good standing on our books. Even on the former appeal this Court used the following language:\n\n \"Of course, we have held, and it is but common sense to hold, that a physical asset may fluctuate in value according to the income it can be made to produce. A live horse is worth more than a dead one, though the physical object may be the same, and a smooth-going automobile is worth more than an unassembled collection of all its parts. The physical facilities used in carrying on a prosperous business are worth more than the same assets in \n\n[358 \nU.S. 434, 442]\n\u00a0\n bankruptcy liquidation or on sale by the sheriff. No one denies the right of the State, when assessing tangible property, to use any fair formula which will give effect to the intangible factors which influence real values. Adams Express Co. v. Ohio State Auditor,\n6\n\u00a0\n166 \nU.S. 185\n. But Virginia has not done this.\" \n347 \nU.S., at 364\n.\n\n\n We feel that Virginia has now done just that.\n\nWe are not convinced by appellant's \"boot strap\" argument that the express privileges it enjoys have no value to it because all of its net income by agreement with the railroads is paid over to them. We believe it more accurate to rely on its admission that \"No one would question the fact that Appellant's exclusive express privileges on the railroads are valuable contract rights.\" This concession, when taken in the light of the expressed purpose of appellant that the payment of its net income for the use of the express privileges was solely to make certain \"that the Express Company shall have no net taxable income,\" exposes the frivolous nature of this contention. We are not so blinded to business realities as to permit such a manipulation of the finances of appellant, the railroads' wholly owned subsidiary, to frustrate the Commonwealth in its effort to collect an otherwise fair tax.\n\nNor is there any substance to the contention that since Virginia could not prohibit appellant from engaging in its exclusively interstate business, it therefore may not tax \"good will\" or \"going concern\" value which is built up thereby. We need only cite some of the cases of this Court holding to the contrary: Great Northern R. Co. v. Minnesota, \n278 \nU.S. 503\n (1929); Pullman Co. v. Richardson, \n261 \nU.S. 330\n (1923); Cudahy Packing Co. v. Minnesota, \n\n[358 \nU.S. 434, 443]\n\u00a0\n \n246 \nU.S. 450\n (1918); United States Express Co. v. Minnesota, \n223 \nU.S. 335\n (1912); Adams Express Co. v. Ohio, \n165 \nU.S. 194\n (rehearing \n166 \nU.S. 185\n (1897)); Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Taggart, \n163 \nU.S. 1\n (1896); Cleveland, C., C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Backus, \n154 \nU.S. 439\n (1894).\n\n  VALIDITY OF THE TAX UNDER THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE.\n\n\n In view of the fact that appellant failed to file the required information as to its gross receipts, thus placing an almost insurmountable burden on the Commonwealth to ascertain them, it is necessary that appellant make an affirmative showing that the mileage method used by Virginia is so palpably unreasonable that it violates due process. This it has failed to do. Appellant rests its argument not on facts and figures covering its actual gross income in Virginia but on comparative statistics based on tangible assets. It points out that during the taxable year the value of its tangible assets in Virginia ($475,065) was only 0.6% of its total assets ($79,700,426), while the amount of gross receipts apportioned to Virginia by the State Corporation Commission was 1.7% ($6,499,519) of its total gross receipts ($387,241,764).\n\nThe difference in the two percentages, appellant contends, must represent intangible values on which Virginia cannot operate because located outside of its jurisdiction. This syllogism does not take into account the facts of business life. Tangible assets in Virginia may produce much more income than like assets elsewhere. Death Valley Scotty generated much less gross from his desert sightseeing wagon than did his counterpart in Central Park. The utter fallacy of using tangible assets as the test of going-concern value here is demonstrated by the fact that appellant's tangible assets in Virginia depend entirely on whether it elects to retain title to tangible property or place it in the name of its subsidiary, \n\n[358 \nU.S. 434, 444]\n\u00a0\n the Virginia company. By placing them in the Virginia company it could thus, on a tangible asset formula, escape all tax on its intangibles.\n\nThere is nothing in the record even to indicate that the tangible assets that appellant carries in its own name in Virginia did not actually generate the amount of gross receipts attributed to it by the State Corporation Commission. In this connection, we note that 1.9% of appellant's total contract mileage was located there. Even where taxpayers have attempted to show through evidence, as this appellant has not, that a given apportionment formula effected an appropriation of more than that to which the State was entitled, this Court has required \"`clear and cogent evidence' that it results in extraterritorial values being taxed.\" Butler Bros. v. McColgan, \n315 \nU.S. 501, 507\n (1942); Norfolk & Western R. Co. v. North Carolina, \n297 \nU.S. 682, 688\n (1936); cf. Bass, Ratcliff & Gretton, Ltd., v. Tax Comm'n, \n266 \nU.S. 271, 282\n-284 (1924). As this Court said in Nashville, C. & St. L. R. v. Browning, \n310 \nU.S. 362, 365\n-366 (1940):\n\n \"In basing its apportionment on mileage, the Tennessee Commission adopted a familiar and frequently sanctioned formula. Pullman's Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n141 \nU.S. 18\n; Maine v. Grand Trunk Ry. Co., \n142 \nU.S. 217\n; Pittsburgh, C., C. & St. L. Ry. Co. v. Backus, \n154 \nU.S. 421\n; Branson v. Bush, \n251 \nU.S. 182\n. See 2 Cooley on Taxation, pp. 1660-64. Its asserted inapplicability to the particular situation is rested on petitioner's evidence as to the comparative revenue-producing capacity of its lines in and out of Tennessee. But both the Commission and the Supreme Court of the state thought that this evidence, however weighty, was insufficient to displace the relevance of the formula. In a matter where exactness is concededly unobtainable and the feel of judgment so important a factor, we must be on guard lest \n\n[358 \nU.S. 434, 445]\n\u00a0\n unwittingly we displace the tax officials' judgment with our own. Certainly we cannot say that the combined judgment of Commission, Board, and state courts is baseless.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n Appellant's final argument is to the effect that the tax in question, in the amount of $139,739.66, is \"no just equivalent\" of the tax \"in lieu of which\" it was levied, and therefore violates the Due Process Clause. This argument is based upon a false premise which can be quickly disposed of. Appellant states that under Virginia's system of segregation of property for state and local taxation the only property which the Commonwealth had the power to tax was cash on hand and on deposit and appellant's rolling stock, which, under the old rates, would have yielded a tax of $679.77. Appellant is clearly in error. As we read the Virginia statutes, and as they were construed below, the Commonwealth (as contrasted with the local) government also had the power to tax the \"going concern\" value of all of appellant's Virginia property, as well as its other intangible property rights such as its valuable express privileges. Thus, the new tax is not only in lieu of the previous tax on rolling stock and cash on hand, but also reaches intangible rights of great value which since Railway Express, supra, had escaped taxation altogether.\n\nIt follows from what we have said that the tax is valid. and the judgment below is therefore\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER concurs in the result.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Va. Code, 1950, 58-547.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See Va. Const., 170; and Va. Code, 1950, 58-9, 58-10.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Va. Code, 1950, 58-546, et seq., as amended by Va. Acts 1956, c. 612.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] In its return, appellant stated that it was \"unable\" to ascertain its gross receipts from express transported \"through, into or out of\" the Commonwealth. The record contains testimony to this effect by one of appellant's officers. The record also shows, from one of appellant's own exhibits, that since 1931 the tax year in question is the only year in which appellant has been \"unable\" to report this information. From 1931 to 1953, appellant managed to find a way of compiling or computing and reporting such data, and in only 7 of these 23 years did the Commonwealth disagree with appellant's figures. Due to the downfall of the old tax in Railway Express Agency v. Virginia, supra, there was no reporting requirement for 1954 and 1955. Under the new tax, for 1956, appellant made no attempt to present evidence to show what reductions should be made in the Commission's figures, nor did it explore the possibility of an agreement about it as it apparently had in prior years. Cf. Cohan v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (C. A. 2d Cir. 1930), 39 F.2d 540, 543-544. Instead, it relied completely upon its claim that the tax was unconstitutional.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Actually, the amounts paid to such carriers for Virginia traffic were ascertained by that method. Since the carrier payments represent only net receipts, the Virginia gross receipts were determined by applying to the Virginia carrier payments the ratio that its total gross receipts bore to its total carrier payments.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Parenthetically, it might be noted that the Adams case involved a \"going concern\" valuation of $488,265 as compared to a \"dead\" valuation of property in the amount of $28,438. \n165 \nU.S. 194, 237\n.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring.\n\nI share the reservations of MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN as to the propriety of considering the tax described in the opinion of the Court as a property tax. I find myself unable, however, to distinguish in any constitutional \n\n[358 \nU.S. 434, 446]\n\u00a0\n sense the \"in lieu\" tax here involved from similar levies the validity of which has been sustained as applied to interstate enterprises in the line of cases cited in the Court's opinion, and therefore join the opinion.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, concurring.\n\nWhile I join the opinion and judgment of the Court, I must admit to some reservations whether the tax at bar can fairly be thought of as a property tax. The discussion of the Court in this case's predecessor, Railway Express Agency, Inc., v. Virginia, \n347 \nU.S. 359, 364\n-367, cast serious doubt on the propriety of viewing Virginia's former tax as a property tax, and I share that doubt. The only modification in the mathematical demonstration of the prior decision necessitated by the revision of the tax statute is brought about by the new statute's provision that the tax is in lieu of other taxes on the appellant's intangible property and rolling stock. In practical effect, this means that payment of this $139,739.66 tax is \"in lieu\" of a 1\/5% tax on $120,110.70 of cash, amounting to $240.22; a tax, amounting to $427.56, on the value, apportioned to the State, of the appellant's refrigerator cars; and a 2 1\/2% tax on its trucks,\n*\n valued at $262,719, amounting to $6,567.98. These taxes, in lieu of which the $139,739.66 tax at bar is payable, aggregate $7,235.76. It seems to me doubtful whether this makes a significant \n\n[358 \nU.S. 434, 447]\n\u00a0\n alteration in the demonstration the Court made on the prior appeal with respect to the status as a property tax of the gross receipts tax on express companies. While the tax may be a rough equivalent of some sort of property tax that Virginia might conceivably levy on express companies, I do not see that it has been made clear that it bears any equivalence to any sort of property tax that she in fact levies on other sorts of businesses or has in fact previously levied on express companies. Cf. Pullman Co. v. Richardson, \n261 \nU.S. 330, 339\n. On the other hand, I cannot deny that this Court has, in decisions cited by the Court's opinion, frequently admitted gross receipts taxes to the characterization of \"property taxes\" in situations where their equivalence with any actual property tax was somewhat tenuous. See, e. g., Illinois Central R. Co. v. Minnesota, \n309 \nU.S. 157\n.\n\nTo me, the more realistic way of viewing the tax and evaluating its constitutional validity is to take it as what it is in substance, a levy on gross receipts fairly apportionable to the taxing State. Virginia has a comprehensive scheme of state income and gross receipts taxes on business corporations, with net income taxes the standard in the case of ordinary businesses and gross receipts taxes in the case of most categories of utility or \"public service\" corporations. The gross receipts taxing structure does not single out this interstate transportation company, or discriminate against it, but rather requires it only to pay its share, at a tax rate comparable to the rates on the gross receipts of other categories of public service corporations, and in fact lower than those on many important ones. To restrict the gross receipts subject to the tax to an amount representing that part of appellant's interstate movements which takes place within the State, the State has employed an apportionment formula. That formula is not on its face unfair or discriminatory toward interstate commerce or indicative of an imposition on out-of-state \n\n[358 \nU.S. 434, 448]\n\u00a0\n activities, and the opinion of the Court amply demonstrates that this appellant cannot maintain a challenge to the details of its application here. The label of the tax as a \"privilege\" or \"license\" tax, proscribed by this case's predecessor, has been eliminated, as the Court's opinion shows. This Court's decisions sustain the application of a fairly apportioned general gross receipts tax to an interstate transportation company. Canton R. Co. v. Rogan, \n340 \nU.S. 511, 515\n-516; Central Greyhound Lines, Inc., v. Mealey, \n334 \nU.S. 653, 663\n-664. Cf. Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, \n303 \nU.S. 250, 256\n. In my view, the most compelling reason for affirming the judgment of the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia is the application of the principles of these cases here.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] The State informs us that the appellant's trucks have been ruled to be \"rolling stock\" and therefore shielded by the \"in lieu\" provision of the new statute. While the Virginia Code does not in terms set forth a rate of taxation for the rolling stock of express companies, the rates provided for the rolling stock of railway and of freight car companies are 2 1\/2% ad valorem. Va. Code 58-515, 58-560. This rate would appear appropriate for exploring the equivalence of this \"in lieu\" tax to a corresponding property tax, and in fact the rate, as established by the latter section, has been used before the \"in lieu\" provision as a basis for the taxation of appellant's refrigerator cars.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER, with whom MR. JUSTICE STEWART joins, dissenting.\n\nI cannot agree. Let me very briefly put the case in perspective, as I see it. Taxation of the property of appellant's Virginia subsidiary, which does an intrastate business in Virginia, is not at all involved here. The Court properly observes the fact that \"Appellant's Virginia business is . . . of an exclusively interstate nature.\" In the year involved it owned in Virginia tangible real and personal property which was taxed by Virginia under other statutes and is not involved in this case. Virginia also claims that appellant had intangible property in Virginia. It is upon those intangibles, so claimed to have been present in the State, that Virginia sought to lay its \"franchise tax,\" said by it to be a \"property tax\" measured by appellant's gross receipts, allocable to Virginia, from \"exclusively\" interstate commerce. Admittedly appellant had a bank account and some \"rolling stock\" in Virginia, upon which, doubtless, Virginia validly could lay an ad valorem tax. But the dispute is over the following. Virginia claims that appellant should be deemed to have \n\n[358 \nU.S. 434, 449]\n\u00a0\n had in Virginia, and subject to the taxing statute here involved, substantially that percentage of the value of its national \"good will,\" and of its exclusive express carriage contract with the railroads, which the ratio of the mileage of carriers which it uses in interstate commerce in Virginia bears to the total mileage of the same carriers which it uses everywhere in such commerce. Appellant contends that Virginia's claim in these respects is unconstitutional. Which of them is right? I think it is appellant. I think so for two reasons. First, the exclusive carriage contract which appellant has with the railroads requires it, as the Court observes, to pay \"all of its net income\" to the railroads. Therefore, as a matter of both fact and law, that contract can have no dollar value to appellant, distinguished from the railroads, to be taxed to it anywhere. Second, appellant's \"good will,\" if any, does not consist of anything localized in Virginia, but inheres solely in its \"exclusively\" interstate business - a business that Virginia cannot reach or regulate, by direct taxation or otherwise, because it is prohibited from doing so by the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, 8, cl. 3. My views on that subject are fully stated in my dissenting opinion in No. 12, Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v. Minnesota, and No. 33, Williams v. Stockham Valves & Fittings, Inc., post, at p. 477. I would therefore reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 434, 450]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","147":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRALEY v.

Held:\n\n 1. The appeals are dismissed for want of jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1257 (2), since appellants have not demonstrated that an attack was made by them in the state courts on the validity of a state statute under the Federal Constitution; but certiorari is granted, since various rights, privileges and immunities under the Federal Constitution were claimed in the state courts, as required by 28 U.S.C. 1257 (3).

JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThese two appeals involve convictions of four appellants for refusal to answer certain questions put to them at sessions of the \"Un-American Activities Commission\" of the State of Ohio, established in the legislative branch of the Ohio Government.\n1\n The appellants had claimed the privilege against self-incrimination in refusing to answer each of the questions. The cases are before us for the second time; on prior appeals the judgments below were vacated and the causes remanded for reconsideration in the light of Sweezy v. New Hampshire, \n354 \nU.S. 234\n, and Watkins v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 178\n. See \n354 \nU.S. 929\n. The remand resulted in a reaffirmance of the prior judgment without discussion, 167 Ohio St. 295, 147 N. E. 2d 847, and on the present appeals we postponed \n\n[360 \nU.S. 423, 425]\n\u00a0\n further consideration of the jurisdictional questions presented until the arguments on the merits. \n358 \nU.S. 862, 863\n.\n\nThe issues tendered by the parties range broadly and involve the power of the Ohio Legislature, in view of existing federal legislation, to investigate activities deemed subversive of the forms of government within the Nation, cf. Pennsylvania v. Nelson, \n350 \nU.S. 497\n; the power of the State to compel disclosure of matters interconnected with the protected freedoms of speech and assembly, cf. NAACP v. Alabama, \n357 \nU.S. 449\n; Sweezy v. New Hampshire, supra; the existence of an expressed legislative interest for such an inquiry, and its definition and articulation to the person summoned, cf. Watkins v. United States, supra; Sweezy v. New Hampshire, supra; Scull v. Virginia, \n359 \nU.S. 344\n; and the effect on testimonial compulsion of state immunity statutes not affording immunity from federal prosecution, cf. Knapp v. Schweitzer, \n357 \nU.S. 371\n. But our disposition of these cases makes it unnecessary to consider the application of the principles of the cases just cited. The appellants were informed by the Commission that they had a right to rely on the privilege against self-incrimination afforded by Art. I, 10, of the Ohio Constitution. The Ohio Supreme Court, however, held that the appellants were presumed to know the law of Ohio - that an Ohio immunity statute deprived them of the protection of the privilege - and that they therefore had committed an offense by not answering the questions as to which they asserted the privilege. We hold that in the circumstances of these cases, the judgments of the Ohio Supreme Court affirming the convictions violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and must be reversed, except as to one conviction, as to which we are equally divided. After the Commission, speaking for the State, acted as it did, to sustain the Ohio Supreme Court's judgment \n\n[360 \nU.S. 423, 426]\n\u00a0\n would be to sanction an indefensible sort of entrapment by the State - convicting a citizen for exercising a privilege which the State had clearly told him was available to him. We agree with that part of Judge Stewart's dissenting opinion in the Ohio Supreme Court in which he said: \"since the defendants were apprised by the commission at the time they were testifying that they had a right to refuse to answer questions which might incriminate them, they could not possibly in following the admonition of the commission be in contempt of it . . . .\" 164 Ohio St., at 563, 133 N. E. 2d, at 125. A rather detailed description of the proceedings below must be made to illuminate the basis of decision below and the turning point of our review of it here.\n\nMrs. Morgan, appellant in No. 463, was summoned before the Commission and interrogated mainly in regard to Communist Party activities. She appeared without counsel. To each question put she answered, \"I regret that I cannot answer your question under the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution, because to do so would give your Committee an opportunity to incriminate me,\" or some more abbreviated form of words to the same effect. Such responses were given to virtually all the questions and in almost every case the Commission proceeded directly to ask its next question after receiving the response. In no case did the Commission direct that she answer its question. In one or two cases Commission members expressed surprise that she might consider an answer incriminating, and on such an occasion the Chairman asked her, \"Mrs. Morgan, are you aware of the fact that your failure to answer questions - some questions of this Commission, might also tend to put you in an embarrassing situation?\" At another point, the Chairman positively informed her, \"I should like to advise you under the Fifth Amendment, you are permitted to refuse to answer questions that might tend to incriminate \n\n[360 \nU.S. 423, 427]\n\u00a0\n you. . . . But you are not permitted to refuse to answer questions simply for your own convenience.\"\n\nRaley, Stern, and Brown, appellants in No. 175, appeared before the Commission successively on another occasion, about six months later. They were interrogated about subversive activities in the labor movement. Raley answered some questions, but to most of them asserted the privilege against self-incrimination of the Federal and Ohio Constitutions. Most of his assertions of the privilege, including his initial ones, were not made the subject of comment or question by the Commission, the next question in the inquiry being put at once. On some few occasions, when Raley claimed the privilege, the Commission members indicated their doubts whether any answer to a specific question put could be incriminating. On one occasion, the Commission asked Raley as to whether he recollected a certain interview. Raley claimed the privilege. The Chairman took the view that Raley was required to speak as to whether he recalled the interview, but assured him that the privilege existed as to the details of the interview: \"If you recall it, and we ask you as to your recollection, then you are privileged to claim your rights under the Constitution . . . .\" This and one other occasion were the only ones in which the Commission even approached directing an answer to a question by Raley; but in one case the Chairman finally asked Raley to confer with his counsel to determine whether in his opinion the privilege applied, and in another Raley did so of his own accord; then, upon an affirmative reply by Raley's counsel, the Commission passed at once to the next question.\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[360 \nU.S. 423, 428]\n\u00a0\n\n\nStern was the next person to appear at the inquiry. After giving his name, he claimed the privilege against self-incrimination at the very next question, which called for his address. Commission counsel asked him, \"Is there something about the nature or character of the home in which you live that to admit you live there would make you subject to criminal prosecution?\" On Stern's continued refusal to answer, the Chairman directed an answer to the question, which was refused. To most subsequent questions, Stern again claimed the privilege against self-incrimination, and on the great majority of questions, the Commission simply passed on to the next question. The Chairman and Stern worked out a short form of words whereby he would be understood to be claiming the privilege \n\n[360 \nU.S. 423, 429]\n\u00a0\n as to a particular question.\n3\n At one point Stern asked the Commission if the Commission had the right to go into his opinions and to require him to speak as to them. The Chairman informed him, \"Not if in your opinion by so doing, you might tend to incriminate yourself.\" On a few occasions the Chairman requested that Stern answer a question, but except for the question as to his residence, the occasions were those in which Stern had neither given a direct answer nor invoked the privilege, and upon assertion of the privilege in these cases the request was not renewed.\n4\n\u00a0\n\n[360 \nU.S. 423, 430]\n\u00a0\n\n\nBrown then was subjected to inquiry. He claimed the privilege as to self-incrimination to most of the questions put to him. While the Chairman never told him in so many words (as he had told the other three appellants) that the privilege was available, Brown and the Chairman engaged in long colloquies in an attempt by the Chairman to clarify that by using a certain form of words Brown was claiming the privilege.\n5\n The Chairman's concern \n\n[360 \nU.S. 423, 431]\n\u00a0\n is inexplicable on any other basis than that he deemed the privilege available at the inquiry, and his statements would tend to create such an impression in one appearing at the inquiry. When once he made it clear that he was claiming the privilege as to a question, Brown was never directed to answer. He was on a couple of occasions directed to answer a question when he was engaging in a colloquy with the Commission without either having answered it directly or having claimed the privilege; upon his claim of the privilege, the next question was at once put.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nThe Ohio immunity statute extends, so far as is here relevant, to any person appearing before a legislative committee and grants immunity from state prosecutions or penalties \"on account of a transaction, matter, or thing, concerning which he testifies\"; the statute declares that the testimony given on such an appearance \"shall not be used as evidence in a criminal proceeding\" against the person testifying. Ohio Rev. Code 101.44. For reasons unexplained, the existence of this immunity was never suggested by the Commission to any of the appellants, and in fact, as the above statement makes evident, \n\n[360 \nU.S. 423, 432]\n\u00a0\n the Commission's actions were totally inconsistent with a view on its part that the privilege against self-incrimination was not available. The Commission thought the privilege available, and it gave positive advice that it could be used. As the Chairman testified in the proceedings below: \"It was the policy of the commission not [to] press questions which we felt would be of an incriminating nature. For instance, whenever a witness was asked a question - I believe every witness before the commission was asked the question - Are you or have you ever been a member of the communist party, and if the witness refused to answer that question, we did not press it. Frequently I made statements which indicated the policy of the commission.\"\n\nIndictments were found against the four appellants for failure to answer various of the questions put to them at the inquiry. In the cases of Raley, Stern, and Brown - who were indicted at the same time and tried together, but in a different court from Mrs. Morgan - only a few of the questions were made the subject of the indictment.\n7\n There appears to have been some effort to restrict their indictments to those questions to which the prosecution thought no answer could have been incriminating. On the other hand, virtually every question asked Mrs. Morgan was made the subject of her indictment.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nA jury was waived by Raley, Stern, and Brown, and they were found guilty on each of the relatively few counts found against them, the trial court filing no opinion or conclusions of law. The Court of Appeals affirmed the \n\n[360 \nU.S. 423, 433]\n\u00a0\n convictions on some of the counts as to Raley, on one of the two counts as to Stern, and on all the counts as to Brown, and reversed the convictions on some of the counts as to Raley and on one count as to Stern.\n9\n 100 Ohio App. 75, 99-100, 136 N. E. 2d 295, 315-316. It held that there was sufficient direction to the witnesses to answer the questions involved, so that their refusal was willful. The touchstone by which it affirmed some of the counts of the convictions and reversed others was whether, in the court's view, an answer to the question might have in fact been incriminating. While the court indicated that the immunity statute applied, it did not rely upon it in its judgment - as it expressly stated, 100 Ohio App., at 99, 136 N. E. 2d, at 315, and as its reversals of certain of the counts indicated.\n\nA jury was also waived by Mrs. Morgan and she too was found guilty by a trial judge. The judge acquitted her on a few counts as to questions found not pertinent to the inquiry or duplicative of other questions. But as to the remaining counts, he ruled that her plea of self-incrimination was not valid, because she had referred solely to the Fifth Amendment and not to the appropriate provision of the Ohio Constitution guaranteeing freedom from compulsory self-incrimination. Ohio Const., Art. I, 10. Because of this, he held that it was unnecessary to have directed Mrs. Morgan to answer the questions or to have advised her at the inquiry that her plea of the privilege against self-incrimination was rejected. Further constitutional claims were summarily rejected. The Court of Appeals - a different one from that which passed on the appeal of Raley, Stern, and Brown - affirmed the judgment for the reasons stated in the trial court's opinion.\n\nOn appeal, the Supreme Court of Ohio, though affirming the convictions, abandoned reliance on the theories \n\n[360 \nU.S. 423, 434]\n\u00a0\n under which the appellants were found guilty by the courts below. It ruled that a fair reference to the privilege against self-incrimination of the United States Constitution was adequate to invoke the privilege under the Ohio Constitution, finding such reference made. 164 Ohio St., at 538-539, 133 N. E. 2d, at 111-112. And it did not discuss the theory on which the Court of Appeals relied in the case of Raley, Stern, and Brown; its basis for affirming the judgment was entirely independent of that of the Court of Appeals. The Supreme Court placed its reliance entirely on the immunity statute. It held that the immunity under the statute was automatically available to the appellants, that even though it did not preclude federal prosecution it was adequate to make answers compellable, and that since \"the immunity granted . . . precluded the possibility of justifying a refusal\" to answer on the grounds of self-incrimination, 164 Ohio St., at 553, 133 N. E. 2d, at 120, a direction by the Commission to the appellants to answer was not necessary. Various objections to the convictions under state law were also passed on and rejected. As we have noted, on remand from this Court, the Ohio Supreme Court passed on contentions made under Sweezy v. New Hampshire, supra, and Watkins v. United States, supra, and adhered to its former judgments.\n\nFirst. We must examine our jurisdiction over these appeals. Appellants assert jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1257 (2), a grant of jurisdiction on appeal, \"where is drawn in question the validity of a statute of any state on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties or laws of the United States, and the decision is in favor of its validity.\" In their notices of appeal to this Court, appellants have phrased some of their federal constitutional claims as attacks on the constitutionality of the Ohio statute authorizing the Commission and the statute providing for immunity. But this does not suffice: \n\n[360 \nU.S. 423, 435]\n\u00a0\n \"It is essential to our jurisdiction on appeal . . . that there be an explicit and timely insistence in the state courts that a state statute, as applied, is repugnant to the federal Constitution, treaties or laws.\" Charleston Federal Savings & Loan Assn. v. Alderson, \n324 \nU.S. 182, 185\n. Despite the import of our order postponing the consideration of jurisdiction till the hearing on the merits, see Rule 16 (4) of this Court,\n10\n appellants have made no effort to support their burden of demonstrating an attack made by them on the validity of a state statute in the state courts, and we have found none. Accordingly the appeals are dismissed. See Sweezy v. New Hampshire, supra, at 236. But since various rights, privileges and immunities under the Federal Constitution were claimed below, 28 U.S.C. 1257 (3), we consider the appeal papers as petitions for certiorari, and in view of the public importance of the questions presented, grant certiorari. 28 U.S.C. 2103.\n\nThe view we take of the merits of the case requires us to examine whether the appellants made a proper challenge to their convictions below, on federal constitutional grounds, on the theory that they were being convicted for claiming the privilege against self-incrimination after not being given to understand at the time of the inquiry that such a privilege was unavailable. In the lower Ohio courts, federal constitutional questions as to the adequacy of the insistence of the Commission on an answer to its questions were involved in the lower courts' discussion of the cases. In the appeal of Raley, Stern and Brown, the Court of Appeals discussed the extent to which the Commission gave the defendants to understand that answers were in fact desired to particular questions, and this as \n\n[360 \nU.S. 423, 436]\n\u00a0\n part of its consideration of constitutional claims under both the Federal and Ohio Constitutions. 100 Ohio App., at 87-90, 136 N. E. 2d, at 308-310. The trial court's opinion in Mrs. Morgan's case refers to the contention that a direction to answer was not given to the defendant, and also recites that a due process claim under the Federal Constitution was made.\n\nThe assignments of error made by Mrs. Morgan in the State Supreme Court show that she claimed in that court that the judgment of conviction was violative of due process, as guaranteed by the Federal Constitution, in that while she claimed the privilege, she was not \"charged with refusal to answer any questions asked by members of the Commission and that she was not notified that her claim of the privilege was rejected by the Commission.\" The State Supreme Court passed on this claim,\n11\n holding that a direction to answer was unnecessary because of the immunity statute, and stated generally that its reasoning and conclusions in her case \"apply with equal force to the appeal of Raley, Stern and Brown.\" 164 Ohio St., at 532, 133 N. E. 2d, at 108. There can be no question as to the proper presentation of a federal claim when the highest state court passes on it. See Manhattan Life Ins. Co. v. Cohen, \n234 \nU.S. 123, 134\n. We think this sufficient here to satisfy the statutory requirement that the federal \n\n[360 \nU.S. 423, 437]\n\u00a0\n right sought to be vindicated in this Court be one claimed below. 28 U.S.C. 1257 (3).\n12\n\u00a0\n\nSecond. We conclude that the judgments of conviction rendered below violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, with an exception to be later noted. We need not decide whether there is demanded of state investigating bodies as explicit a rejection of a claimed privilege against self-incrimination as has been held to be necessary under the statute punishing contempts of Congress. Quinn v. United States, \n349 \nU.S. 155\n; Emspak v. United States, \n349 \nU.S. 190, 202\n; Bart v. United States, \n349 \nU.S. 219\n. Nor need we decide whether it would be a sufficient basis for reversal here simply that the appellants were not given notice of the immunity law at the inquiry, though in analogous contexts we have insisted that state investigators make clear to those before them the basis on which an answer is required. Scull v. Virginia, \n359 \nU.S. 344, 353\n. This case is more than that; here the Chairman of the Commission, who clearly appeared to be the agent of the State in a position to give such assurances, apprised three of the appellants that the privilege in fact existed, and by his behavior toward the fourth obviously gave the same impression. Other members of the Commission and its counsel made statements which \n\n[360 \nU.S. 423, 438]\n\u00a0\n were totally inconsistent with any belief in the applicability of the immunity statute, and it is fair to characterize the whole conduct of the inquiry as to the four as identical with what it would have been if Ohio had had no immunity statute at all. Yet here the crime said to have been committed by the appellants, as defined by the State Supreme Court, was simply that of declining to answer any relevant question on the ground of possible self-incrimination. This was because the Court held that the Ohio immunity statute automatically removed any basis for a valid claim of the privilege, which generally exists under Ohio law.\n13\n Ohio Const., Art. I, 10. Accordingly, any refusal to answer, based on a claim of the privilege, was said to constitute the offense. While there is no suggestion that the Commission had any intent to deceive the appellants, we repeat that to sustain the judgment of the Ohio Supreme Court on such a basis after the Commission had acted as it did would be to sanction the most indefensible sort of entrapment by the State - convicting a citizen for exercising a privilege which the State clearly had told him was available to him. Cf. Sorrells v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 435, 442\n. A State may not issue commands to its citizens, under criminal sanctions, in language so vague and undefined as to afford no fair warning of what conduct might transgress them. Lanzetta v. New Jersey, \n306 \nU.S. 451\n. Inexplicably contradictory commands in statutes ordaining criminal penalties have, in the same fashion, judicially been denied the force of criminal sanctions. United States v. Cardiff, \n344 \nU.S. 174\n. Here there were more than commands simply vague or even contradictory. There was active misleading. Cf. Johnson v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 189, 197\n. The State Supreme Court dismissed the statements of \n\n[360 \nU.S. 423, 439]\n\u00a0\n the Commission as legally erroneous, but the fact remains that at the inquiry they were the voice of the State most presently speaking to the appellants.\n14\n We cannot hold that the Due Process Clause permits convictions to be obtained under such circumstances.\n\nWe cannot reach a contrary conclusion by joining with the speculation of the court below that some of appellants might have behaved the same way regardless of what the Commission told them. We think it impermissible in a criminal case to excuse fatal defects by assuming that a person summoned to an inquiry, simply because he expresses defiance beforehand, will continue to be defiant even if a proper explanation is made of what the inquiry wants of him and the basis on which it is wanted. See Flaxer v. United States, \n358 \nU.S. 147, 151\n. It is alleged that the personal attitudes of the appellants toward the Commission were defective in various ways, but of course the indictments and convictions were had simply for refusing to answer questions. Neither can we find any ground for affirmance in the fact that certain refusals to answer occurred before the Chairman's assurances to the various appellants that the privilege existed became explicit. Certainly such assurances removed any reason for the appellants to reconsider their prior assertions of the privilege. And the positive assurances given only made explicit an attitude that the Commission had manifested throughout its interviews with these appellants. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 423, 440]\n\u00a0\n We cannot carve the inquiry into segments; the record does not suggest any picture of the Commission's negation of the privilege followed by an acquiescence in its use.\n\nFinally, it is argued that the convictions may be supportable here as to those questions which an appellant was directed to answer after claiming the privilege. As the statement of the case we have made indicates, it is not shown that there was such a direction as to any question except one put to Stern,\n15\n which stands as the basis for the sole count on which his conviction rests. As to the conviction based on this question, the Court is equally divided. To four of us, the matter is plain. Under the circumstances of the inquiry, the direction to answer given Stern was obviously not given because of the immunity statute, but because the Commission took the position that a generally available privilege did not \n\n[360 \nU.S. 423, 441]\n\u00a0\n exist as to a particular question, since no answer to it could possibly incriminate. Stern made his decision not to answer, it must be assumed, in the light of the Commission's attitude that the privilege generally applied, and on the basis of his own determination that the answer would tend to incriminate him. The Ohio Supreme Court has not disagreed with him on the issue on which he was directed to answer; it made no finding that the Commission was correct on the basis on which it ordered the answer - that no response to the question possibly could incriminate.\n16\n Four of us think that the same affront to the Due Process Clause as is generally presented in this case is presented by a judgment ignoring the grounds on which the Commission's direction to answer was given, and affirming the conviction by reason of an immunity statute whose existence the Commission negated. To four of us, it is obvious that Stern was as much \"entrapped\" as the others. It is hardly an answer, in our view, to say he was directed to answer the question. In effect, the Commission said to Stern: \"We recognize your privilege against self-incrimination in this inquiry, but you must take care that you claim it only where your answer might really tend to be incriminating. We do not see how saying where you live might incriminate you, so as to this question we reject your claim of privilege and order you to answer.\" Stern's refusal to answer after \n\n[360 \nU.S. 423, 442]\n\u00a0\n the direction opened him to the risk that a court might hold that he was wrong and that the Commission properly ruled that no answer could be incriminatory. But the Ohio Supreme Court has not held this; it has not held that Stern's decision that the answer would tend to incriminate him was wrong, but only that the Commission was wrong in telling him that the privilege applied at all. It may have been at his peril that Stern made his decision that the answer was incriminatory, but four of us cannot see how consistently with the Due Process Clause it can be said that he thereby also assumed the very different peril that the basic premise of what the Commission was telling him - that the privilege existed - was one hundred percent in error. We four regret that our Brethren remain unpersuaded on this score, and that accordingly as to Stern the judgment must be affirmed by an equally divided Court.\n\n  Appeals dismissed.\n\n\n  On writs of certiorari, judgments reversed as to  Raley, Brown and Morgan; judgment affirmed  as to Stern by an equally divided Court.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE STEWART took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The three appellants in No. 175, Raley, Stern, and Brown, were convicted in a joint trial in a different Common Pleas Court from the one in which appellant in No. 463, Mrs. Morgan, was convicted. The judgments as to Raley, Stern, and Brown were affirmed in the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County, 100 Ohio App. 75, 136 N. E. 2d 295, and that of Mrs. Morgan in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County. The cases were decided by the Ohio Supreme Court in a single opinion, 164 Ohio St. 529, 133 N. E. 2d 104, which affirmed the convictions.\n\nRaley, Stern, and Brown were convicted under the then applicable provisions of Ohio General Code 12137, which provided that \"a failure . . . to answer as a witness, when lawfully required\" may be punished \"as . . . for a contempt.\" Mrs. Morgan was convicted under Ohio General Code 12845, which punished those, summoned before a Committee of the State Legislature, who refuse \"to answer a question pertinent to the matter under inquiry.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] After the Chairman's initial statement quoted in the text, and some exchange between the Chairman and Raley's counsel, the following occurred:\n\n\"Chairman Renner: I should like for you to consult with counsel to determine whether in his opinion you are required to answer \n\n[360 \nU.S. 423, 428]\n\u00a0\n the question, whether you recollect having had such an interview.\n\n\n\"The Witness: I have been advised by counsel that the privilege does apply, if I desire to use it.\n\n\n\"Chairman Renner: Counsel [for the Commission] may proceed.\"\n\n\n Whereupon the next question was put. In the other instance Raley appears to have consulted with counsel of his own accord:\n\n\"Chairman Renner: Mr. Raley, would you explain to the Commission how you could incriminate yourself by acknowledging the location of the headquarters of Local 766 on that date?\n\n\n\"The Witness: I don't believe, Mr. Chairman, that I have to give a reason for asserting the privileges of the Constitution, so my answer would be the same to that that I gave Mr. Isaacs. [The Commission Counsel.] I will assert my privileges.\n\n\n\"Chairman Renner: I nevertheless request an answer.\n\n\n\"The Witness: Just a second while I confer with counsel.\n\n\n\"Mr. Berger [Raley's counsel]: I would like to hear the question read.\n\n\n\"Chairman Renner: Read the question, please.\n\n\n\"(Several questions and answers read by the reporter.)\n\n\n\"Mr. Berger: That is what I thought.\n\n\n\"(The witness conferred with counsel.)\n\n\n\"The Witness: I think I was correct in view of the line of questions that I have to assert my privileges under the Constitution.\n\n\n\"Chairman Renner: Counsel will proceed.\"\n\n\n And again the next question was forthwith put.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] \"Chairman Renner: Counsel, just a moment. When you say you claim the privilege, you claim the privilege of not replying by reason of the fact that your answer might tend to incriminate you?\n\n\"The Witness: I claim the privilege of not answering under the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution, and Section 1, Article 10 of the Ohio Constitution, as I understand them.\n\n\n\"Chairman Renner: I do not insist that you recite in full the precise article or section of the Bill of Rights of the state of Ohio, or the Federal Constitution, but in your reply, if you are resorting to those sections, make it clear that you are resorting to those sections, or let us have an understanding that when you say, `The same answer,' that that is what it means.\n\n\n\"The Witness: It means that I claim the privilege of the Fifth Amendment, of the United States Constitution, and Article 1, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution, as I understand them.\n\n\n\"Chairman Renner: And when you say, `I claim the privilege,' that is what you mean in full; is that correct?\n\n\n\"The Witness: That is correct.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] One such exchange was as follows:\n\n\"Chairman Renner: The chair will ask the witness to answer the question that has been placed by Counsel. It is to be presumed that the witness is excused from answering the previous question. We are trying to make it easier for you, Mr. Stern.\n\n\n\"The Witness: I plead the privilege.\n\n\n\"By Mr. Isaacs:\n\n\n\"Q. I take it you are not making the denial that you started to make before?\n\n\n\"A. I invoke the privilege.\"\n\n\n Whereupon the next question was put.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] \"Chairman Renner: What do you mean when you say `The answer is the same'?\n\n\"The Witness: I mean when I say `The answer is the same,' the preceding question that was asked me, linking up with the next question that is asked me, I answered the first question. I said I invoked the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\n\n\n\"Chairman Renner: You mean you refuse to answer?\n\n\n\"The Witness: I did not say I refuse. I didn't refuse and I don't know what you mean. I said, `invoked.' Do you know what the word `invoked' means?\n\n\n\"Chairman Renner: Do you refuse to answer?\n\n\n\"The Witness: The answer is the same.\"\n\n\n Later, the Chairman tried again:\n\n\"Chairman Renner: Each time you have replied by saying, `The answer is the same,' that full explanation that you have given, is that what you mean; is that correct?\n\n\n\"The Witness: I understand this amendment to mean that I can't be forced to testify against myself.\n\n\n\"Chairman Renner: And each time that you say the answer is the same, you mean to invoke that right; is that correct?\n\n\n\"The Witness: When a question is projected to me -\n\n\n\"Chairman Renner: Will you answer my question?\n\n\n\"The Witness: By you, I will answer that question on the basis of that question that is projected at that time. . . .\n\n\n\"Chairman Renner: I am simply trying to clarify for the record what you mean each time you say, `The answer is the same.'\"\n\n\n On another occasion, the Chairman had the matter cleared up, at least for a while:\n\n\"Chairman Renner: What do you mean, `the answer is the same'?\n\n\n\"The Witness: In regard to that question, in the manner in which \n\n[360 \nU.S. 423, 431]\n\u00a0\n that question was phrased, I again invoke - see - the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, see? Do you understand what that means?\n\n\n\"Chairman Renner: That is what I wanted.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The following is illustrative:\n\n\"Q. I ask you if it is not a fact that in February of 1950, you caused to be distributed a leaflet stated to be issued by the Workers Club, Emmett C. Brown, Chairman, 1064 Flint Street?\n\n\n\"A. Is that a fact?\n\n\n\"Q. I am asking you to affirm or deny that fact.\n\n\n\"A. If you know it, why ask me to affirm?\n\n\n\"Chairman Renner: Answer the question, Mr. Brown.\n\n\n\"The Witness: I invoke the privileges of the Fifth Amendment.\"\n\n\n Whereupon the next question was asked.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Sixteen against Raley, two against Stern, four against Brown. These were minor fractions of the numbers of questions put them to which the privilege was pleaded.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] The only omissions appear to be in regard to several pleas of self-incrimination made by Mrs. Morgan, when, in handing a statement to the Commission for the record, she was asked whether it was her statement.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] The State did not appeal the reversals.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] \"If consideration of the question of jurisdiction is postponed, counsel should address themselves, at the outset of their briefs and oral argument, to the question of jurisdiction.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] Said the court: \"It is argued also that the Quinn case, supra, [Quinn v. United States, \n349 \nU.S. 155\n] is, in effect, a mandate by the Supreme Court of the United States to all legislative bodies, both national and state, that they must specifically direct a witness to answer before he may be cited for contempt, and a directive to all judicial tribunals in the nation that such must be the case before a witness may be convicted of contempt.\" 164 Ohio St., at 545, 133 N. E. 2d, at 115. Clearly this was a discussion of whether the theory of the Quinn case, that a witness must be apprised of the rejection of the privilege, was binding on the States as a matter of the Federal Constitution.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] It is true that the assertion of violation of federal rights through the lack of a direction to answer, passed on below, does not precisely match the dispositive ground of the case, that is, not merely the absence of a direction to answer on the part of the Commission, but the positive assurances that the privilege was available. But this is really only a variation of the former theme, put into sharper focus by the State Supreme Court's theory of decision. See Dewey v. Des Moines, \n173 \nU.S. 193, 198\n. The claim made and passed on was, in essence, lack of knowledge by the appellants, because of the Commission's actions, that they were being considered as unlawfully refusing to answer the questions. The Supreme Court's conclusion added more force to the contention but did not change its nature.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] Accordingly, the applicability of Twining v. New Jersey, \n211 \nU.S. 78\n, to the present case need not be discussed.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] The State Supreme Court relied on Sinclair v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 263, 299\n, in support of its holding. Sinclair dealt with a witness at an investigation who refused to answer questions by reason of a legal theory he entertained, where the Committee rejected his legal theory explicitly and ordered him to answer. He refused and was convicted. The Court found his legal theory in error, and held that under the circumstances the entertaining of this erroneous legal theory in good faith was no defense to the witness. That Sinclair is wholly inapposite here requires no further statement.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] It is suggested that Brown declined to answer one question other than on grounds of self-incrimination. No such finding was made by the Ohio Supreme Court, which treated the entire case as involving pleas of self-incrimination; accordingly, so do we. No direction to answer as to this question was given by the Commission. It may be well to quote the entire context:\n\n\"Q. And what has been your educational background?\n\n\n\"A. I refuse to answer that question. I invoke my rights and privileges under the Fifth Amendment.\n\n\n\"Q. Is there some particular illegal institution which you attended or some Communist Party school that you attended that makes you hesitate to reveal where you were educated?\n\n\n\"A. No, I just don't think it is your business.\n\n\n\"Chairman Renner: We will determine that, Mr. Brown.\n\n\n\"By Mr. Isaacs:\n\n\n\"Q. Do I understand, for the record, you are refusing to answer the question because you feel it is not our business?\n\n\n\"A. The answer is the same.\n\n\n\"Mr. Isaacs: May the record show that, please.\n\n\n\"Q. [Going on to the next question] What has been your employment record in recent years, Mr. Brown?\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] While one of the Ohio Courts of Appeals put its affirmance of some of the counts on this basis, the issue whether any particular questions were free of the possibility of an incriminating answer was not considered by the Ohio Supreme Court, and was in fact irrelevant to the court, under the view it took of the case. We review its judgment here, and it is basic that after finding constitutional error in a state court judgment we cannot affirm it here by postulating some ground of state law not relied on below. Murdock v. Memphis, 20 Wall. 590, 636, proposition 7; cf. Bi-Metallic Investment Co. v. State Board of Equalization, \n239 \nU.S. 441, 444\n.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK, with whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, MR. JUSTICE HARLAN and MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER join.\n\nWe think the conviction of Stern must be affirmed. Like our Brethren who would reverse as to him we, too, agree with Judge Stewart, of Ohio's Supreme Court. But, as we read his opinion, he swept with a whisk broom not a carpet sweeper. Our Brothers take too broad a swath. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 423, 443]\n\u00a0\n\n\nJudge Stewart said that since Ohio's Commission advised appellants that they had a right to refuse to answer questions which might incriminate them, \"they could not possibly in following the admonition of the Commission be in contempt of it\" in refusing to answer any such queries. Brother BRENNAN'S opinion characterizes the action of the Commission as an \"indefensible sort of entrapment . . . convicting a citizen for exercising a privilege which the State clearly had told him was available to him.\" We agree that such was true as to three of these appellants, and therefore concur in the opinion as to Brown, Raley and Morgan. But, as Judge Stewart went on to point out, the record clearly shows that Stern was not so entrapped.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nStern was convicted for refusal to answer the question, \"Where do you reside, Mr. Stern?\" The Chairman refused to accept Stern's plea of the privilege\n2\n and twice \n\n[360 \nU.S. 423, 444]\n\u00a0\n unequivocally directed him to answer the question. Stern persisted in his refusal. The due process ground used in our Brother BRENNAN'S opinion to invalidate the convictions of Brown, Raley and Morgan is, therefore, not present as to Stern. There was no \"entrapment\" in the above question upon which he was convicted, since it was made clear, even without reference to the Ohio immunity statute, that as to that question the privilege was not available. The reason given by the Commission, except where bad faith is necessary which is not true here,\n3\n is irrelevant. The test is whether the witness was commanded to answer regardless. Neither Morgan nor Raley was so directed, but Stern was categorically instructed to do so.\n4\n\u00a0\n\n[360 \nU.S. 423, 445]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdmitting that the direction to answer was \"obviously . . . [given] because the Commission took the position that a generally available privilege did not exist,\" four members of the Court still refuse to affirm as to Stern because the State Supreme Court did not go on that ground. But they overlook the sweep of their own opinion. It is the Federal Due Process Clause that is being applied and the Court must take the facts as shown by the record. It clearly shows that Stern was not entrapped by the statements of the Chairman as to the availability of the privilege for the question forming the basis of the only count of the indictment before us. Unlike the others, he was specifically ordered to answer. In this posture of the facts there could be no entrapment and hence no lack of due process. We would therefore affirm as to Stern.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Judge Stewart said that the witnesses could not have been in contempt \"except as to the few questions which two of them were directed to answer.\" 164 Ohio St., at 564, 133 N. E. 2d, at 126. The second witness whom Judge Stewart had in mind would seem from the record before us to be Brown. The first count of Brown's indictment was based on a refusal to answer the question, \"And what has been your educational background?\" After pleading the privilege, Brown was pressed for an explanation as to why his answer would be incriminating. Brown responded \"I just don't think it is your business.\" When pressed further, Brown reverted to the privilege. On the record here, we find no specific direction to Brown to answer, and thus we must concur in the reversal of Brown's conviction. The question of the sufficiency of the plea will, of course, be open on remand.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The pertinent colloquy following Stern's refusal to answer was as follows:\n\n\"Q. What is there in either of those constitutions [Ohio and federal] that permits a witness to refuse to state where he resides?\n\n\n\"A. I claim the privilege under the Fifth Amendment of the \n\n[360 \nU.S. 423, 444]\n\u00a0\n United States Constitution, and Section 1, Article 10 of the Ohio Constitution.\n\n\n\"Q.

CO.(1959)\nNo. 80\nArgued: March 13, 1958Decided: February 24, 1959\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner, a Spanish subject, was employed on board a ship of Spanish flag and registry, owned by a Spanish corporation, for a voyage beginning and ending in Spain. He was injured while the ship was in American territorial waters, and he filed suit on the law side of a Federal District Court in New York. He claimed damages under the Jones Act and under the general maritime law for unseaworthiness, maintenance and cure and negligence against his Spanish employer and a New York corporation which acted as its husbanding agent in New York. Damages for negligence under the general maritime law were claimed against two other American corporations engaged in operations related to loading freight in New Jersey. The District Court dismissed the complaint and the Court of Appeals affirmed. Held:\n\n 1. Jurisdiction under the Jones Act was adequately alleged. P. 359.\n\n\n 2. Jurisdiction on the law side of claims based on the general maritime law is not granted by 28 U.S.C. 1331. Pp. 359-380.\n\n\n 3. There was jurisdiction, \"pendent\" to jurisdiction under the Jones Act, to determine whether the claims against the Spanish corporation based on general maritime law stated a cause of action.

Neither the Jones Act nor the general maritime law of the United States is applicable to the claims against the foreign shipowner. Pp. 381-384.\n\n\n 6. The claims for unseaworthiness and maintenance and cure against the husbanding agent were properly dismissed in light of the District Court's findings of fact. Pp. 384-385. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 355]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n 7. The case must be remanded for consideration of the claims against the three American corporations based on negligence.

With them on the brief was Charles A. Ellis.\n\nJohn L. Quinlan argued the cause for Compania Trasatlantica and Garcia & Diaz, Inc., respondents. With him on a brief for Compania Trasatlantica (also known as the Spanish Line) was John M. Aherne.\n\nSidney A. Schwartz argued the cause for the Quin Lumber Co., Inc., respondent. With him on the brief was William J. Kenney.\n\nJohn P.

Stonebridge for the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and for the Government of Denmark.\n\nJames M. Estabrook and David P. H. Watson filed a brief for Skibsfartens Arbeidsgiverforening (Norwegian Shipping Federation) and Sveriges Redareforening (Swedish Shipowner's Association), as amici curiae, urging that the dismissal of the complaint as to the Spanish Line be affirmed.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner Francisco Romero, a Spanish subject, signed on as a member of the crew of the S. S. Guadalupe for a voyage beginning about October 10, 1953. The Guadalupe was of Spanish registry, sailed under the Spanish \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 356]\n\u00a0\n flag and was owned by respondent Compania Trasatlantica (also known as Spanish Line), a Spanish corporation. At the completion of the voyage for which he signed, Romero continued uninterruptedly to work on the Guadalupe. Thereby, under the law of Spain, the terms and conditions of the original contract of hire remained in force. Subsequently the S. S. Guadalupe departed from the port of Bilbao in northern Spain, touched briefly at other Spanish ports, and sailed to the port of New York at Hoboken. From here the ship made a brief trip to the ports of Vera Cruz and Havana returning to Hoboken where, on May 12, 1954, Romero was seriously injured when struck by a cable on the deck of the Guadalupe. Thereupon petitioner filed suit on the law side of the District Court for the Southern District of New York.\n\nThe amended complaint claimed damages from four separate corporate defendants. Liability of Compania Trasatlantica and Garcia & Diaz, Inc., a New York corporation which acted as the husbanding agent for Compania's vessels while in the port of New York, was asserted under the Jones Act, 41 Stat. 1007, 46 U.S.C. 688, and under the general maritime law of the United States for unseaworthiness of the ship, maintenance and cure\n1\n and a maritime tort. Liability for a maritime tort was alleged against respondents International Terminal Operating Co. and Quin Lumber Co. These two companies were working on board the S. S. Guadalupe at the time of the injury pursuant to oral contracts with Garcia & Diaz, Inc. Quin, a New York corporation, was engaged in carpentry work preparatory to the receipt of a cargo \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 357]\n\u00a0\n of grain. International Terminal, incorporated in Delaware, was employed as stevedore to load the cargo. The jurisdiction of the District Court was invoked under the Jones Act and 1331\n2\n and 1332\n3\n of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.\n\nFollowing a pre-trial hearing the District Court dismissed the complaint. 142 F. Supp. 570.\n4\n The court \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 358]\n\u00a0\n held that the action under the Jones Act against Compania Trasatlantica must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction since that Act provided no right of action for an alien seaman against a foreign shipowner under the circumstances detailed above. The claims under the general maritime law against Compania also were dismissed since the parties were not of diverse citizenship and 28 U.S.C. 1331 did not confer jurisdiction on the federal law courts over claims rooted in federal maritime law. The District Court dismissed the Jones Act claim against Garcia & Diaz, Inc., pursuant to its finding that Garcia was not the employer of Romero nor, as a husbanding agent for Compania, did it have the operation and control of the vessel. The remaining claims, including those against the other respondents, were dismissed because of lack of the requisite complete diversity under the rule of Strawbridge v.Curtiss, 3 Cranch 267. Upon examination of the Spanish law the district judge also declined jurisdiction \"even in admiralty as a matter of discretion.\" 142 F. Supp., at 574. The Spanish law provides Romero with a lifetime pension of 35% to 55% of his seaman's wages which may be increased by one-half if the negligence of the shipowner is established; it also allows the recovery of the Spanish counterpart of maintenance and cure. These rights under the Spanish law may be enforced through the Spanish consul in New York.\n\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of the complaint, 244 F.2d 409. We granted certiorari, \n355 \nU.S. 807\n, because of the conflict among Courts of Appeals as to the proper construction of the relevant provision of the Judiciary Act of 1875 (now 28 U.S.C. 1331) and because of questions raised regarding the applicability of Lauritzen v. Larsen, \n345 \nU.S. 571\n, to the situation before us. The case was argued during the last Term and restored to the calendar for reargument during the present Term. \n356 \nU.S. 955\n. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 359]\n\u00a0\n\n\n    I. JURISDICTION.\n\n\n (a) Jurisdiction under the Jones Act. - The District Court dismissed petitioner's Jones Act claims for lack of jurisdiction. \"As frequently happens where jurisdiction depends on subject matter, the question whether jurisdiction exists has been confused with the question whether the complaint states a cause of action.\" Montana-Dakota Utilities Co. v. Northwestern Public Service Co., \n341 \nU.S. 246, 249\n. Petitioner asserts a substantial claim that the Jones Act affords him a right of recovery for the negligence of his employer. Such assertion alone is sufficient to empower the District Court to assume jurisdiction over the case and determine whether, in fact, the Act does provide the claimed rights. \"A cause of action under our law was asserted here, and the court had power to determine whether it was or was not well founded in law and in fact.\" Lauritzen v. Larsen, \n345 \nU.S. 571, 575\n.\n\n(b) Jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1331. - Petitioner, a Spanish subject, asserts claims under the general maritime law against Compania Trasatlantica, a Spanish corporation. The jurisdiction of the Federal District Court, sitting as a court of law, was invoked under the provisions of the Judiciary Act of 1875 which granted jurisdiction to the lower federal courts \"of all suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity, . . . arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States, . . . .\" (now 28 U.S.C. 1331).\n5\n Whether the Act of 1875 permits maritime claims rooted in federal law to be brought on \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 360]\n\u00a0\n the law side of the lower federal courts has recently been raised in litigation and has become the subject of conflicting decisions among Courts of Appeals. Jurisdiction has been sustained in the First Circuit, Doucette v. Vincent, 194 F.2d 834, and denied in the Second and Third, Jordine v. Walling, 185 F.2d 662; Paduano v.Yamashita Kisen Kabushiki Kaisha, 221 F.2d 615. See also Jenkins v. Roderick, 156 F. Supp. 299. Such conflict in the construction of an old and important statute calls for a full exposition of the problem.\n\nAbstractly stated, the problem is the ordinary task of a court to apply the words of a statute according to their proper construction. But \"proper construction\" is not satisfied by taking the words as if they were self-contained phrases. So considered, the words do not yield the meaning of the statute. The words we have to construe are not only words with a history. They express an enactment that is part of a serial, and a serial that must be related to Article III of the Constitution, the watershed of all judiciary legislation, and to the enactments which have derived from that Article. Moreover, Article III itself has its sources in history. These give content and meaning to its pithy phrases. Rationally construed, the Act of 1875 must be considered part of an organic growth - part of the evolutionary process of judiciary legislation that began September 24, 1789, and projects into the future.\n\nArticle III, 2. cl. 1 (3d provision) of the Constitution and section 9 of the Act of September 24, 1789, have from the beginning been the sources of jurisdiction in litigation based upon federal maritime law. Article III impliedly contained three grants. (1) It empowered Congress to confer admiralty and maritime jurisdiction on the \"Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court\" which were authorized by Art. I, 8, cl. 9. (2) It empowered the federal courts in their exercise of the admiralty \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 361]\n\u00a0\n and maritime jurisdiction which had been conferred on them, to draw on the substantive law \"inherent in the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction,\" Crowell v. Benson, \n285 \nU.S. 22, 55\n, and to continue the development of this law within constitutional limits. (3) It empowered Congress to revise and supplement the maritime law within the limits of the Constitution. See Crowell v. Benson, supra, at 55.\n\nSection 9 of the First Judiciary Act\n6\n granted the District Courts maritime jurisdiction. This jurisdiction has remained unchanged in substance to the present day.\n7\n Indeed it was recognition of the need for federal tribunals to exercise admiralty jurisdiction that was one of the controlling considerations for the establishment of a system of lower federal courts.\n8\n Such a system is not an inherent requirement of a federal government. There was strong opposition in the Constitutional Convention to any such inferior federal tribunals.\n9\n No comprehensive system of lower federal courts has \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 362]\n\u00a0\n been established in Canada or Australia. Congress could leave the enforcement of federal rights to state courts,\n10\n and indeed the state courts, in large measure, now exercise concurrent jurisdiction over a wide field of matters of federal concern, subject to review of federal issues by the Supreme Court.\n11\n\u00a0\n\nSection 9 not only established federal courts for the administration of maritime law; it recognized that some remedies in matters maritime had been traditionally administered by common-law courts of the original States.\n12\n This role of the States in the administration of maritime law was preserved in the famous \"saving clause\" - \"saving to suitors, in all cases, the right of a common-law remedy, where the common law is competent to give it.\"\n13\n Since the original Judiciary Act also endowed the federal courts with diversity jurisdiction, common-law remedies for maritime causes could be enforced by then Circuit Courts when the proper diversity of parties afforded access.\n\nUp to the passage of the Judiciary Act of 1875\n14\n these jurisdictional bases provided the only claim for jurisdiction \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 363]\n\u00a0\n in the federal courts in maritime matters.\n15\n The District Courts, endowed with \"exclusive original cognizance of all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction,\" sat to enforce the comprehensive federal interest in the law of the sea which had been a major reason for their creation. This jurisdiction was exercised according to the historic procedure in admiralty, by a judge without a jury. In addition, common-law remedies were, under the saving clause, enforcible in the courts of the States and on the common-law side of the lower federal courts when the diverse citizenship of the parties permitted. Except in diversity cases, maritime litigation brought in state courts could not be removed to the federal courts.\n16\n\u00a0\n\nThe Judiciary Act of 1875 effected an extensive enlargement of the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts. For the first time their doors were opened to \"all suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity, . . . arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States, or treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority . . . .\"\n17\n From 1875 to 1950 there is not to be found a hint or suggestion to cast doubt on the conviction that the language of that statute was taken straight from Art. III, 2, cl. 1, extending the judicial power of the United States \"to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority.\" Indeed what little legislative history there is \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 364]\n\u00a0\n affirmatively indicates that this was the source.\n18\n Thus the Act of 1875 drew on the scope of this provision of Clause 1, just as the Judiciary Act of 1789 reflected the constitutional authorization of Clause 1 of Section 2, which extended the judicial power \"to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction.\"\n\nThese provisions of Article III are two of the nine separately enumerated classes of cases to which \"judicial power\" was extended by the Constitution and which thereby authorized grants by Congress of \"judicial Power\" to the \"inferior\" federal courts. The vast stream of litigation which has flowed through these courts from the beginning has done so on the assumption that, in dealing with a subject as technical as the jurisdiction of the courts, the Framers, predominantly lawyers, used precise, differentiating and not redundant language. This assumption, reflected in The Federalist Papers,\n19\n was authoritatively confirmed by Mr. Chief Justice Marshall in American Ins. Co. v. Canter, 1 Pet. 511, 544:\n\n\"We are therefore to inquire, whether cases in admiralty, and cases arising under the laws and Constitution of the United States, are identical.\n\n\n \"If we have recourse to that pure fountain from which all the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts is derived, we find language employed which cannot well be misunderstood. The Constitution declares, that `the judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority; to all cases affecting ambassadors, or other public ministers, and \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 365]\n\u00a0\n consuls; to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.'\n\n\n \"The Constitution certainly contemplates these as three distinct classes of cases; and if they are distinct, the grant of jurisdiction over one of them does not confer jurisdiction over either of the other two. The discrimination made between them, in the Constitution, is, we think, conclusive against their identity.\" See also The Sarah, 8 Wheat. 391.\n\n\n This lucid principle of constitutional construction, embodied in one of Marshall's frequently quoted opinions, was never brought into question until 1952.\n20\n It \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 366]\n\u00a0\n had been treated as black-letter law in leading treatises.\n21\n It was part of the realm of legal ideas in which the authors of the Act of 1875 moved. Certainly the accomplished lawyers who drafted the Act of 1875\n22\n drew on \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 367]\n\u00a0\n the language of the constitutional grant on the assumption that they were dealing with a distinct class of cases, that the language incorporated in their enactment precluded \"identity\" with any other class of cases contained in Article III. Thus the grant of jurisdiction over \"suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity . . . arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States . . .,\" in the Act of 1875, as derived from Article III, could not reasonably be thought of as comprehending an entirely separate and distinct class of cases - \"Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction.\"\n23\n\u00a0\n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 368]\n\u00a0\n\n\nOf course all cases to which \"judicial power\" extends \"arise,\" in a comprehensive, non-jurisdictional sense of the term, \"under this Constitution.\" It is the Constitution that is the ultimate source of all \"judicial Power\" - defines grants and implies limits - and so \"all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction\" arise under the Constitution in the sense that they have constitutional sanction. But they are not \"Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States . . . .\"\n\nNot only does language and construction point to the rejection of any infusion of general maritime jurisdiction into the Act of 1875, but history and reason powerfully support that rejection. The far-reaching extension of national power resulting from the victory of the North, and the concomitant utilization of federal courts for the vindication of that power in the Reconstruction Era, naturally led to enlarged jurisdiction of the federal courts over federal rights. But neither the aim of the Act of 1875 to provide a forum for the vindication of new federally created rights, nor the pressures which led to its enactment, suggest, even remotely, the inclusion of maritime claims within the scope of that statute. The provision of the Act of 1875 with which we are concerned was designed to give a new content of jurisdiction to the federal courts, not to reaffirm one long-established, smoothly functioning since 1789.\n24\n We have uncovered no basis for finding the additional design of changing the method by which federal courts had administered admiralty law from the \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 369]\n\u00a0\n beginning. The federal admiralty courts had been completely adequate to the task of protecting maritime rights rooted in federal law. There is not the slightest indication of any intention, or of any professional or lay demands for a change in the time-sanctioned mode of trying suits in admiralty without a jury, from which it can be inferred that by the new grant of jurisdiction of cases \"arising under the Constitution or laws\" a drastic innovation was impliedly introduced in admiralty procedure, whereby Congress changed the method by which federal courts had administered admiralty law for almost a century. To draw such an inference is to find that a revolutionary procedural change had undesignedly come to pass. If we are now to attribute such a result to Congress the sole remaining justification for the federal admiralty courts which have played such a vital role in our federal judicial system for 169 years will be to provide a federal forum for the small number of maritime claims which derive from state law, and to afford the ancient remedy of a libel in rem in those limited instances when an in personam judgment would not suffice to satisfy a claim.\n25\n\u00a0\n\nIndeed, until 1950, in a dictum in Jansson v. Swedish American Line, 185 F.2d 212, 217-218 (C. A. 1st Cir.), followed by an opinion in Doucette v. Vincent, 194 F.2d 834, judges, scholars and lawyers alike made the unquestioned assumption that the original maritime jurisdiction of the federal courts had, for all practical purposes, been left unchanged since the Act of 1789. Thus Mr. Justice Clifford, an experienced admiralty judge, in 1876, one year after the passage of the Act here in question, could reiterate the classic formulation without the faintest indication of doubt as to its continued vitality. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 370]\n\u00a0\n \"Parties in maritime cases are not . . . compelled to proceed in the admiralty at all, as they may resort to their common-law remedy in the State courts, or in the Circuit Court, if the party seeking redress and the other party are citizens of different States.\"\n26\n On the basis of an examination of sixty-six treatises on federal jurisdiction and on admiralty, and of a search of the reports it can be confidently asserted that for the seventy-four years following Mr. Justice Clifford's opinion there is not a single professional utterance of legal opinion - by judges, lawyers, or commentators - disagreeing with his formulation.\n27\n Negative testimony is often as compelling as bits of affirmative evidence. It is especially compelling when it comes from those whose scholarly or professional specialty was the jurisdiction of the federal courts and the practice of maritime law. Petitioner now asks us to hold that no student of the jurisdiction of the federal courts or of admiralty, no judge, and none of the learned and alert members of the admiralty bar were able, for seventy-five years, to discern the drastic change now asserted to have been contrived in admiralty jurisdiction by the Act of 1875. In light of such impressive testimony from the past the claim of a sudden discovery of a hidden latent meaning in an old technical phrase is surely suspect.\n\nThe history of archaeology is replete with the unearthing of riches buried for centuries. Our legal history does not, however, offer a single archaeological discovery of new, revolutionary meaning in reading an old judiciary enactment.\n27a\n The presumption is powerful that such a farreaching, dislocating construction as petitioner would now have us find in the Act of 1875 was not uncovered by \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 371]\n\u00a0\n judges, lawyers or scholars for seventy-five years because it is not there.\n\nIt is also significant that in the entire history of federal maritime legislation, whether before the passage of the Act of 1875 (e. g., the Great Lakes Act - also a general jurisdictional statute and one often termed an anomaly in the maritime law because of its jury trial provision), or after (the Jones Act), Congress has not once left the availability of a trial on the law side to inference. It has made specific provision.\n28\n It is difficult to accept that in 1875, and in 1875 alone, a most far-reaching change was made subterraneously.\n\nNot only would the infusion of general maritime jurisdiction into the Act of 1875 disregard the obvious construction of that statute. Important difficulties of judicial policy would flow from such an interpretation, an interpretation which would have a disruptive effect on the traditional allocation of power over maritime affairs in our federal system.\n\nThus the historic option of a maritime suitor pursuing a common-law remedy to select his forum, state or federal, would be taken away by an expanded view of 1331,\n29\n since saving-clause actions would then be freely \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 372]\n\u00a0\n removable under 1441 of Title 28.\n30\n The interpretation of the Act of 1875 contended for would have consequences more deeply felt than the elimination of a suitor's traditional choice of forum. By making maritime cases removable to the federal courts it would make considerable inroads into the traditionally exercised concurrent jurisdiction of the state courts in admiralty matters - a jurisdiction which it was the unquestioned aim of the saving clause of 1789 to preserve. This disruption of principle is emphasized by the few cases actually involved.\n31\n This small number of cases is only important in that it negatives the pressure of any practical consideration for the subversion of a principle so long-established and so deeply rooted. The role of the States in the development of maritime law is a role whose significance is rooted in the Judiciary Act of 1789 and the decisions of this Court.\n32\n Recognition of the part the States have played from the beginning has a dual significance. It indicates the extent to which an expanded view of the Act of 1875 would eviscerate the postulates of the saving clause, and it undermines the theoretical basis for giving the Act of 1875 a brand new meaning. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 373]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough the corpus of admiralty law is federal in the sense that it derives from the implications of Article III evolved by the courts, to claim that all enforced rights pertaining to matters maritime are rooted in federal law is a destructive oversimplification of the highly intricate interplay of the States and the National Government in their regulation of maritime commerce. It is true that state law must yield to the needs of a uniform federal maritime law when this Court finds inroads on a harmonious system.\n33\n But this limitation still leaves the States a wide scope. State-created liens are enforced in admiralty.\n34\n State remedies for wrongful death and state statutes providing for the survival of actions, both historically absent from the relief offered by the admiralty,\n35\n have been upheld when applied to maritime causes of action.\n36\n Federal courts have enforced these statutes.\n37\n State rules for the partition and sale of ships,\n38\n state laws governing the specific performance of arbitration agreements,\n39\n state laws regulating the effect of a breach of warranty under contracts of maritime insurance\n40\n - all these laws and others have been accepted as rules of \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 374]\n\u00a0\n decision in admiralty cases, even, at times, when they conflicted with a rule of maritime law which did not require uniformity. \"In the field of maritime contracts,\" this Court has said, \"as in that of maritime torts, the National Government has left much regulatory power in the States.\"\n41\n Thus, if one thing is clear it is that the source of law in saving-clause actions cannot be described in absolute terms. Maritime law is not a monistic system. The State and Federal Governments jointly exert regulatory powers today as they have played joint roles in the development of maritime law throughout our history.\n42\n This sharing of competence in one aspect of our federalism has been traditionally embodied in the saving clause of the Act of 1789. Here, as is so often true in our \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 375]\n\u00a0\n federal system, allocations of jurisdiction have been carefully wrought to correspond to the realities of power and interest and national policy. To give a novel sweep to the Act would disrupt traditional maritime policies and quite gratuitously disturb a complementary, historic interacting federal-state relationship.\n\nAn infusion of general maritime jurisdiction into the \"federal question\" grant would not occasion merely an isolated change; it would generate many new complicated problems. If jurisdiction of maritime claims were allowed to be invoked under 1331, it would become necessary for courts to decide whether the action \"arises under federal law,\" and this jurisdictional decision would largely depend on whether the governing law is state or federal. Determinations of this nature are among the most difficult and subtle that federal courts are called upon to make.\n43\n Last Term's decision in McAllister v. Magnolia Petroleum Co., \n357 \nU.S. 221\n, illustrates the difficulties raised by the attempted application of a state statute of limitations to maritime personal injury actions. These problems result from the effort to fit state laws into the scheme of federal maritime law.\n\nThese difficulties, while nourishing academic speculation, have rarely confronted the courts. This Court has been able to wait until an actual conflict between state and federal standards has arisen, and only then proceed to resolve the problem of whether the State was free to \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 376]\n\u00a0\n regulate or federal law must govern. For example, if a State allowed the survival of a cause of action based on unseaworthiness as defined in the maritime law it was immaterial whether the standard was federal and governed by decisions of this Court, or was subject to state variations.\n44\n Thus we have been able to deal with such conceptual problems in the context of a specific conflict and a specific application of policy, as is so well illustrated by the McAllister case. However, such practical considerations for adjudication would be unavailable under an expanded view of 1331. Federal courts would be forced to determine the respective spheres of state and federal legislative competence, the source of the governing law, as a preliminary question of jurisdiction; for only if the applicable law is \"federal\" law would jurisdiction be proper under 1331. The necessity for jurisdictional determinations couched in terms of \"state\" or \"federal law\" would destroy that salutary flexibility which enables the courts to deal with source-of-law problems in light of the necessities illuminated by the particular question to be answered. Certainly sound judicial policy does not encourage a situation which necessitates constant adjudication of the boundaries of state and federal competence.\n\nTypical also of the consequences that are implicit in this proposed modification of maritime jurisdiction, is the restriction of venue that would result from this novel interpretation of 1331 of the Act of 1875. Litigants \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 377]\n\u00a0\n of diverse citizenship are now able to invoke the federal law forum for the trial of saving-clause cases. Such litigants are aided in their search for a federal forum by the liberality of the venue provisions applicable to actions based on diversity of citizenship. These provisions allow the action to be brought either \"where all plaintiffs or all defendants reside.\"\n45\n If saving-clause actions were to be brought within the scope of 1331, this choice could be no longer made. Plaintiffs would be subject to the rigid requirement that suit must be \"brought only in the judicial district where all defendants reside . . .,\"\n46\n and this would be so even where there is, in fact, diversity of citizenship.\n47\n\u00a0\n\nIn the face of the consistent and compelling inferences to be drawn from history and policy against a break with a long past in the application of the Act of 1875, what justification is offered for this novel view of the statute? Support is ultimately reduced, one is compelled to say, to empty logic, reflecting a formal syllogism. The argument may thus be fairly summarized. It was not until recently, in a line of decision culminating in Pope & Talbot, Inc., v. Hawn, \n346 \nU.S. 406\n, that it became apparent that the source of admiralty rights was a controlling body of federal admiralty law. This development led to a deepened consideration of the jurisdictional consequences of the federal source of maritime law. And so one turns to the Act of 1875. The Act of 1875 gave original \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 378]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction to the federal courts over all cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States. Maritime law was federal law based on a constitutional grant of jurisdiction. Thus maritime cases arose under the Constitution or federal laws. By this mode of reasoning the words of the jurisdictional statute are found to \"fit like a glove.\"\n48\n\u00a0\n\nAlthough it is true that the supremacy of federal maritime law over conflicting state law has recently been greatly extended, the federal nature of the maritime law administered in the federal courts has long been an accepted part of admiralty jurisprudence. The classic statement of Mr. Justice Holmes in The Western Maid, \n257 \nU.S. 419, 432\n, summed up the accepted view that maritime law derived its force from the National Government and was part of the laws of the United States; and this was merely a restatement of a view which was clearly set forth in 1874 in The Lottawanna, 21 Wall. 558.\n49\n Thus the theory which underlies the effort to infuse general maritime jurisdiction into the Act of 1875 rests on no novel development in maritime law, but on premises as available in 1875 as they are today.\n\nThe simple language of the Act of 1875 conceals complexities of construction and policy which have been already examined. When we apply to the statute, and to the clause of Article III from which it is derived, commonsensical and lawyer-like modes of construction, and the evidence of history and logic, it becomes clear that the words of that statute do not extend, and could not reasonably be interpreted to extend, to cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. The statute is phrased in \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 379]\n\u00a0\n terms which, as a matter of inert language, lifeless words detached from the interpretive setting of history, legal lore, and due regard for the interests of our federal system, may be used as playthings with which to reconstruct the Act to include cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. If the history of the interpretation of judiciary legislation teaches anything, it teaches the duty to reject treating such statutes as a wooden set of self-sufficient words - a failing to which the Court has not been subject since the Pacific Railroad Removal Cases.\n50\n The Act of 1875 is broadly phrased, but it has been continuously construed and limited in the light of the history that produced it, the demands of reason and coherence, and the dictates of sound judicial policy which have emerged from the Act's function as a provision in the mosaic of federal judiciary legislation. It is a statute, not a Constitution, we are expounding.\n51\n\u00a0\n\nThe considerations of history and policy which investigation has illuminated are powerfully reinforced by the deeply felt and traditional reluctance of this Court to expand the jurisdiction of the federal courts through a broad reading of jurisdictional statutes. A reluctance which must be even more forcefully felt when the expansion is proposed, for the first time, eighty-three years after the jurisdiction has been conferred. Mr. Justice Stone, speaking of the Act of 1875, pointed out that \"[t]he policy \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 380]\n\u00a0\n of the statute calls for its strict construction. . . . Due regard for the rightful independence of state governments, which should actuate federal courts, requires that they scrupulously confine their own jurisdiction to the precise limits which the statute has defined.\"\n52\n Certainly this wise counsel is deeply persuasive when we are asked to accept a doctrine which would cut into a jurisdiction exercised by the States since Colonial days. Of course if compelling reasons can be found for redefining the statute, if an ancient error cries out for rectification, we should not be deterred from applying new illuminations to the interpretation of past enactments. However, in our examination of the manifold considerations of history, of construction, of the policy which underlies the allocation of competence over maritime matters in our federal system, and the considerations of judicial administration and procedure called into question - all of which direct us to the rejection of the proposed infusion of general maritime jurisdiction into the Act of 1875 - we are pointed to no considerations which lead us to overturn the existing maritime jurisdictional system - a system which is as old, and as justified by the experience of history, as the federal courts themselves.\n\n(c) \"Pendent\" and Diversity Jurisdiction. - Rejection of the proposed new reading of 1331 does not preclude consideration of petitioner's claims under the general maritime law. These claims cannot, we have seen, be justified under 1331. However, the District Court may have jurisdiction of them \"pendent\" to its jurisdiction under the Jones Act. Of course the considerations which call for the exercise of pendent jurisdiction of a state claim related to a pending federal cause of action within the appropriate scope of the doctrine of Hurn v. Oursler, \n289 \nU.S. 238\n, are not the same when, as here, what is involved \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 381]\n\u00a0\n are related claims based on the federal maritime law. We perceive no barrier to the exercise of \"pendent jurisdiction\" in the very limited circumstances before us. Here we merely decide that a district judge has jurisdiction to determine whether a cause of action has been stated if that jurisdiction has been invoked by a complaint at law rather than by a libel in admiralty, as long as the complaint also properly alleges a claim under the Jones Act. We are not called upon to decide whether the District Court may submit to the jury the \"pendent\" claims under the general maritime law in the event that a cause of action be found to exist.\n\nRespondents Garcia & Diaz and Quin Lumber Company, New York corporations, and International Terminal Operating Company, a Delaware corporation, are of diverse citizenship from the petitioner, a Spanish subject. Since the Jones Act provides an independent basis of federal jurisdiction over the non-diverse respondent, Compania Trasatlantica, the rule of Strawbridge v. Curtiss, 3 Cranch 267, does not require dismissal of the claims against the diverse respondents. Accordingly, the dismissal of these claims for lack of jurisdiction was erroneous.\n\n II. THE CLAIMS AGAINST COMPANIA TRASATLANTICA -    THE CHOICE-OF-LAW PROBLEM.\n\n\n We now turn to the claims against Compania Trasatlantica under the Jones Act and the general maritime law. In light of our recent decision in Lauritzen v. Larsen, \n345 \nU.S. 571\n, these claims present the narrow issue, whether the maritime law of the United States may be applied in an action involving an injury sustained in an American port by a foreign seaman on board a foreign vessel in the course of a voyage beginning and ending in a foreign country. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 382]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhile Lauritzen v. Larsen involved claims asserted under the Jones Act, the principles on which it was decided did not derive from the terms of that statute. We pointed out that the Jones Act had been written \"not on a clean slate, but as a postscript to a long series of enactments governing shipping. All were enacted with regard to a seasoned body of maritime law developed by the experience of American courts long accustomed to dealing with admiralty problems in reconciling our own with foreign interests and in accommodating the reach of our own laws to those of other maritime nations.\" \n345 \nU.S., at 577\n. Thus the Jones Act was applied \"to foreign events, foreign ships and foreign seamen only in accordance with the usual doctrine and practices of maritime law.\" \n345 \nU.S., at 581\n. The broad principles of choice of law and the applicable criteria of selection set forth in Lauritzen were intended to guide courts in the application of maritime law generally. Of course, due regard must be had for the differing interests advanced by varied aspects of maritime law. But the similarity in purpose and function of the Jones Act and the general maritime principles of compensation for personal injury, admit of no rational differentiation of treatment for choice of law purposes. Thus the reasoning of Lauritzen v. Larsen governs all claims here.\n53\n\u00a0\n\nWe are not here dealing with the sovereign power of the United States to apply its law to situations involving one or more foreign contacts.\n54\n But in the absence of a contrary congressional direction, we must apply those principles of choice of law that are consonant with the needs of a general federal maritime law and with due \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 383]\n\u00a0\n recognition of our self-regarding respect for the relevant interests of foreign nations in the regulation of maritime commerce as part of the legitimate concern of the international community. These principles do not depend upon a mechanical application of a doctrine like that of lex loci delicti commissi. The controlling considerations are the interacting interest of the United States and of foreign countries, and in assessing them we must move with the circumspection appropriate when this Court is adjudicating issues inevitably entangled in the conduct of our international relations. We need not repeat the exposition of the problem which we gave in Lauritzen v. Larsen. Due regard for the relevant factors we there enumerated, and the weight we indicated to be given to each, preclude application of American law to the claims here asserted.\n\nIn this case, as in Lauritzen v. Larsen, the ship is of foreign registry and sails under a foreign flag. Both the injured seaman and the owner of the ship have a Spanish status: Romero is a Spanish subject and Compania Trasatlantica a Spanish corporation. Unlike the contract in Lauritzen, Romero's agreement of hire was entered into in Spain. By noting this fact, we do not mean to qualify our earlier view that the place of contracting is largely fortuitous and of little importance in determining the applicable law in an action of marine tort. Here, as in Lauritzen, the foreign law provides a remedy for the injury, and claims under that law may be conveniently asserted before the Spanish consul in New York.\n55\n\u00a0\n\nIn Lauritzen v. Larsen the injury occurred in the port of Havana and the action was brought in New York. Romero was injured while temporarily in American territorial waters. This difference does not call for a difference in result. Discussing the significance of the place of the \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 384]\n\u00a0\n wrongful act, we pointed out in Lauritzen that \"[t]he test of location of the wrongful act or omission, however sufficient for torts ashore, is of limited application to shipboard torts, because of the varieties of legal authority over waters she may navigate. . . . the territorial standard is so unfitted to an enterprise conducted under many territorial rules and under none that it usually is modified by the more constant law of the flag.\" \n345 \nU.S., at 583\n-584. Although the place of injury has often been deemed determinative of the choice of law in municipal conflict of laws, such a rule does not fit the accommodations that become relevant in fair and prudent regard for the interests of foreign nations in the regulation of their own ships and their own nationals, and the effect upon our interests of our treatment of the legitimate interests of foreign nations. To impose on ships the duty of shifting from one standard of compensation to another as the vessel passes the boundaries of territorial waters would be not only an onerous but also an unduly speculative burden, disruptive of international commerce and without basis in the expressed policies of this country. The amount and type of recovery which a foreign seaman may receive from his foreign employer while sailing on a foreign ship should not depend on the wholly fortuitous circumstance of the place of injury.\n\nThus we hold that the considerations found in Lauritzen v. Larsen to preclude the assertion of a claim under the Jones Act apply equally here, and affirm the dismissal of petitioner's claims against Compania Trasatlantica.\n\n III. THE CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER RESPONDENTS.\n\n\n (a) Petitioner made claims based both on the Jones Act and the general maritime law against Garcia & Diaz, Inc. At the pre-trial hearing the District Court concluded that Garcia & Diaz was not Romero's employer and did not operate and control the vessel at the time of \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 385]\n\u00a0\n the injury. These issues were properly adjudicated, and thus the claims for unseaworthiness and maintenance and cure were properly dismissed. However, the District Court did not consider, and its disposition of the case did not require it to consider, whether petitioner was asserting a claim based upon the negligence of Garcia & Diaz; a claim independent of the employment relationship or operation and control. Thus it is necessary to remand the case for further proceedings as to this respondent.\n\n(b) The claims against International Terminal Operating Co., and Quin Lumber Co., for a maritime tort, were dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Our decision on the jurisdictional issues necessitates the return of the claims against these respondents for further adjudication.\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n   Vacated and remanded.\n\n\n   APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT.\n\n\n The following is the list of treatises on federal procedure and jurisdiction and admiralty law which were examined to determine if any commentator gave any intimation that the Act of 1875 had swept admiralty jurisdiction within its scope. No such intimation is found in a single treatise. On the contrary, all those which dealt with the subject specifically assumed that the federal courts on the law side had jurisdiction over a maritime cause after the Act of 1875 as before only when the parties were of diverse citizenship.\n\n BOYCE, Manual of the Practice in the Circuit Courts (1869).\n\n ABBOTT, The United States Courts and Their Practice (1877).\n\n PHILLIPS, Statutory Jurisdiction and Practice of the Supreme Court  of the United States (1878). \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 386]\n\u00a0\n\n\n DESTY, Manual of the Law Relating to Shipping and Admiralty  (1879).\n\n CURTIS, Jurisdiction, Practice and Peculiar Jurisprudence of the  Courts in the United States (1880).\n\n BUMP, Federal Procedure (1881).\n\n MILLER and FIELD, Federal Practice (1881).\n\n COHEN, Admiralty - Jurisdiction, Law and Practice (1883).\n\n FIELD, Constitution and Jurisdiction of the Courts of the United  States (1883).\n\n SPEAR, Law of the Federal Judiciary (1883).\n\n THATCHER (Thatcher's Practice) - A Digest of Statutes, Equity  Rules and Decisions upon the Jurisdiction, Pleadings and Practice  of the Circuit Courts of the United States (1883).\n\n THATCHER (Thatcher's Practice) - A Digest of Statutes, Admiralty  Rules and Decisions upon the Jurisdiction, Pleadings and Practice  of the District Courts of the United States (1884).\n\n HENRY, Jurisdiction and Procedure of the Admiralty Courts (1885).\n\n HOLT, The Concurrent Jurisdiction of the Federal and State Courts  (1888).\n\n CURTIS, Jurisdiction, Practice and Peculiar Jurisprudence of the  Courts of the United States (rev. ed. 1896).\n\n BENEDICT, The American Admiralty (3d ed. 1898).\n\n GARLAND and RALSTON, Constitution and Jurisdiction of the U.S.  Courts (1898).\n\n SIMONTON, CHARLES H.

A pre-trial hearing on the issue of \"jurisdiction\" was held and the complaint was dismissed. Although the trial court viewed the issues as jurisdictional in the correct sense, the procedure followed was precisely that provided for a preliminary hearing to determine whether a claim was stated upon which relief can be granted. Fed. Rules Civ. Proc., 12 (d). Although the court considered evidence outside the pleadings, Federal Rule 12 (c) allows such evidence to be admitted, requiring the court then to treat the motion as one for summary judgment under Rule 56. Summary judgment is proper if \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and . . . the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. Rules Civ. Proc., 56(c). The determinations made by the District Court, in the course of its hearing on jurisdiction, insofar as they are relevant to our disposition, were within the properly conceived scope of Rule 56. Since all the requirements of Rule 12 (c), relating to a hearing on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, were satisfied and the findings made were properly relevant to such a hearing, we need not restrict our disposition to the issue of \"jurisdiction\" merely because the proceedings below were inartistically labeled.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Act of March 3, 1875, 1, 18 Stat. 470.

Lack of clarity in Marshall's opinion was suggested in Doucette v. Vincent, 194 F.2d 834, 843-844, n. 8.\n\nThe City of Panama, \n101 \nU.S. 453\n, decided in 1879, four years after the passage of the Act of 1875, does not countenance the notion that Chief Justice Marshall's strict differentiation between the two provisions of 2 of Art. III had been disapproved. That case only held that the Organic Act for the Territory of Washington granted the courts of that Territory the combined jurisdiction of the District and Circuit Courts of the United States, thereby including, of course, admiralty jurisdiction. See In re Cooper, \n143 \nU.S. 472, 494\n. This holding merely recognized the settled practice in the Territory of Washington since the Act of 1853, as well as the practice in other territories with similar Acts. The Court's statement in The City of Panama that \"Select passages of the opinion in that case [Canter], when detached from the context, may appear to support the theory of the respondents, but the actual decision of the court is explicitly and undeniably the other way\" merely indicated that Canter, like The City of Panama, interpreted a congressional statute to grant admiralty jurisdiction to territorial courts in light of the purposes of a particular statute. The City of Panama did not reject the principle of constitutional construction which Marshall used by way of reaching his \"actual decision.\" It did not question the conclusion in Canter that the two clauses of Article III are distinct grants of jurisdiction and that this truth is to be observed whenever it becomes relevant as it does here. The City of Panama, like other decisions, \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 366]\n\u00a0\n serves to illustrate that jurisdictional statutes are not to be read literally, and are not to be construed as abstract collections of words, but derive their meaning from their setting in history and practice, with due regard to the consequences of the construction given them. See American Security & Trust Co. v. Commissioners of the District of Columbia, \n224 \nU.S. 491\n; Boston Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 41\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 21\n] E. g., Abbott in his treatise on the United States Courts and their Practice (3d ed. 1877), 60, discusses the Marshall formulation:\n\n\"The several cases to which the judicial power extends are to be regarded as independent, in the sense that any one clause is sufficient to sustain jurisdiction in a case to which it applies, and that it is neither restrained nor enlarged by the other clauses, with the exception of the restraint imposed by amendment XI. . . .\" The author then discusses the classes of cases in Article III, concluding \"The grant of jurisdiction over one of these classes does not confer jurisdiction over either of the others; the discrimination is conclusive against their identity. A case of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction is not to be regarded as one `arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States,' merely because the exercise of judicial power in maritime cases is provided for in the Constitution and laws.\" (Citing American Ins. Co. v. Canter.)\n\n\n See also Spear, The Law of the Federal Judiciary (1883), 46. Discussing the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction as granted by the Constitution, the author says:\n\n\"The cases coming within this jurisdiction, as referred to in the Constitution, are not identical with, or embraced in, the cases of law and equity referred to in the same instrument, as arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States. They belong to a different category, and are provided for by a distinct and specific grant of judicial power.\" He then quotes from Marshall's opinion in Canter.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 22\n] The provision of the Act of 1875 under scrutiny originated in the Senate. The bill was sponsored and managed by Senator Matthew Hale Carpenter of Wisconsin. Its authorship has been attributed to him. 7 Reports of the Wisconsin State Bar Association 155, \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 367]\n\u00a0\n 186. On his death the bar journal of his state wrote that \"his love of and devotion to legal studies and pursuits - not as objects but as subjects - were the controlling passions of his life. . . .\n\n\". . . Such, however, was the devotion of Mr. Carpenter to his profession that his election to the United States senate seemed to be a matter of gratification principally for the broader field of professional labors which it enabled him to cultivate. . . .\" I Reports of Wisconsin State Bar Association 227.\n\n\n Among Senator Carpenter's collaborators on the Senate Judiciary Committee were men with outstanding professional experience as lawyers, professors of law and judges: George G. Wright of Iowa (a professor of law and a member of his State's Supreme Court), Allen G. Thurman (Chief Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court), John W. Stevenson (a professor of law, codifier of the law of Kentucky, President of the American Bar Association), and Frederic T. Frelinghuysen (eminent practitioner, Attorney General of New Jersey, subsequently Secretary of State).\n\nAfter leaving the Senate the bill went to conference and was reported out on the floor of the House by Luke Poland of Vermont, an esteemed Chief Justice of the Vermont Supreme Court.\n\nSuch men would not have made a revolutionary change in maritime jurisdiction sub silentio.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 23\n] All suits involving maritime claims, regardless of the remedy sought, are cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction within the meaning of Article III whether they are asserted in the federal courts or, under the saving clause, in the state courts. Romero's claims for damages under the general maritime law are a case of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. The substantive law on which \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 368]\n\u00a0\n these claims are based derives from the third provision of Art. III, 2, cl. 1. Without that constitutional grant Romero would have no federal claim to assert.

But these contentions proved unavailing and the principle was maintained that a State, in the exercise of its police power, may establish rules applicable on land and water within its limits, even though these rules incidentally affect maritime affairs, provided that the state action `does not contravene any acts of Congress, nor work any prejudice to the characteristic features of the maritime law, nor interfere with its proper harmony and uniformity in its international and interstate relations.' It was decided that the state legislation encountered none of these objections. The many instances in which state action had created new rights, recognized and enforced in admiralty, were set forth in The City of Norwalk, and reference was also made to the numerous local regulations under state authority concerning the navigation of rivers and harbors. There was the further pertinent observation that the maritime law was not a complete and perfect system and that in all maritime countries there is a considerable body of municipal law that underlies the maritime law as the basis of its administration. These views find abundant support \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 375]\n\u00a0\n in the history of the maritime law and in the decisions of this Court.\" Just v. Chambers, \n312 \nU.S. 383, 389\n-390.\n\n\"It is a broad recognition of the authority of the States to create rights and liabilities with respect to conduct within their borders, when the state action does not run counter to federal laws or the essential features of an exclusive federal jurisdiction.\" Id., at 391.\n\n\n Thus Congress was careful to make the Death on the High Seas Act applicable only outside state territorial waters so as not to intrude on state legislative competence. 59 Cong.

The court remarked that \"In discussing the question of the duty which the defendant owed to its passengers, all of the parties agreed that the law of California is to be applied. The trial court made a like assumption. We find it unnecessary to indicate any view as to whether in this the parties were correct for as we see it, no matter which law applies, the rule is the same, whether that of California, or that of the maritime law.\" Id., at 277.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 45\n] 28 U.S.C. 1391 (a).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 46\n] 28 U.S.C. 1391 (b).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 47\n] Macon Grocery Co. v.

Supp. 570, 573-574.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, dissenting.\n\nAlthough this case has aroused much discussion about the scope of jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1331, I cannot feel that the issue is either complex or earth-shaking. The real core of the jurisdictional controversy is whether a few more seamen can have their suits for damages passed on by federal juries instead of judges. For the reasons stated by MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN here and by Judge Magruder in Doucette v. Vincent, 194 F.2d 834, 839, I believe that federal jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1331 lies and a federal jury trial is proper. In particular I feel that technical or esoteric readings should not be given to congressional language which is perfectly understandable in ordinary English.\n\nMuch the same reason leads me also to dissent from Part II of the Court's opinion. By its terms the Jones Act applies to \"any seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment.\" 41 Stat. 1007, 46 U.S.C. 688. (Italics added.) This Court in Lauritzen v. Larsen, \n345 \nU.S. 571\n, held that the words \"any seaman\" did not include foreign seamen sailing foreign ships and injured in foreign waters. I dissented from that holding. It was based, I thought, on the Court's concepts of what would be good or bad for the country \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 389]\n\u00a0\n internationally rather than on an actual interpretation of the language of the Jones Act. Thus, it seemed to me that the Lauritzen holding rested on notions of what Congress should have said, not on what it did say. Such notions, weak enough in Lauritzen, seem much weaker still in this case where the tort involved occurred in our own waters. I cannot but feel that, at least as to torts occurring within the United States, Congress knew what it was doing when it said \"any seaman\" and I must dissent from today's further and, I believe, unjustifiable reduction in the scope of the Jones Act. Moreover since the tort occurred in the navigable waters of the United States, I think the complaint against Compania Trasatlantica stated a good cause of action under general maritime law whether jurisdiction of the cause is based, as I believe, on 28 U.S.C. 1331, or, as the Court assumes, on some theory of \"pendent jurisdiction.\"\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS joins in the first paragraph of this opinion. He believes that Lauritzen v. Larsen, \n345 \nU.S. 571\n, is inapposite to the present case, because of the numerous incidents connecting this transaction with the United States. He therefore agrees with MR. JUSTICE BLACK that the District Court should take jurisdiction over petitioner's claim against Compania Trasatlantica.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, dissenting in part and concurring in part.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nI regret that I cannot agree with the Court's holding that 1331 of the Judicial Code does not give jurisdiction to a Federal District Court, sitting at law, over a seaman's claims against his employer for maintenance and cure and for indemnity damages for injury caused by unseaworthiness, where the claims are asserted in the manner of a \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 390]\n\u00a0\n suit at common law and the requisite jurisdictional amount is in controversy. I believe that the jurisdictional statute and the logic of the principles of this Court's decisions construing it compel a contrary result. I think the Court's opinion attempts to turn aside the statutory language and the thrust of this Court's decisions with reasoning that is altogether too insubstantial.\n\nThe point on which the Court and I are at issue is one which has been much mooted in the Courts of Appeals, and I agree that it is appropriate that a thorough expression of views on it be presented. I propose first to explain why jurisdiction should be sustained under 1331, and then to offer some reply to specific arguments set forth by the Court which apparently proceed from supposed practical inconveniences that are thought to arise from sustaining the jurisdiction.\n\nThe petitioner brought this suit in a Federal District Court. The element in his action with which I am dealing is his claim for money damages from Compania Trasatlantica, his employer, for breach of the shipowner's duty to maintain a seaworthy ship and for maintenance and cure. Since there was no diversity of citizenship between petitioner and Compania Trasatlantica,\n1\n jurisdiction was predicated on the grant in 28 U.S.C. 1331 of jurisdiction in \"civil actions wherein the matter in controversy . . . arises under the Constitution, laws or treaties of the United States.\"\n2\n Jurisdiction of such claims \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 391]\n\u00a0\n could have been established on the admiralty side of the District Court since 28 U.S.C. 1333 specifically grants jurisdiction in the District Courts in \"case[s] of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction.\" The question is whether petitioner can bring this part of his action on the law side of a Federal District Court.\n\nFirst. In a long series of decisions tracing from Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, \n244 \nU.S. 205\n, this Court has made it clear that, in a seaman's action to recover damages for a maritime tort from his employer, the substantive law to be applied is federal maritime law made applicable as part of the laws of the United States by the Constitution itself, and that the right of recovery, if any, is a federally created right.\n3\n Chelentis v. Luckenbach S. S. Co., \n247 \nU.S. 372\n; Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart, \n253 \nU.S. 149\n; Garrett v. Moore-McCormack Co., \n317 \nU.S. 239\n; Pope & Talbot, Inc., v. Hawn, \n346 \nU.S. 406\n. Cf. Red Cross Line v. Atlantic Fruit Co., \n264 \nU.S. 109, 124\n-125.\n\nIt is true that early in our history maritime law was thought to be an international law merchant which was impartially administered by the several maritime nations of the world. This concept was expressed by Chief Justice Marshall's language in American Ins. Co. v. Canter, \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 392]\n\u00a0\n 1 Pet. 511, 545-546: \"A case in admiralty does not, in fact, arise under the Constitution or laws of the United States. These cases are as old as navigation itself; and the law, admiralty and maritime, as it has existed for ages, is applied by our Courts to the cases as they arise.\" But that this did not mean that there was some supranational law, by which American courts were bound, was made clear by Mr. Justice Bradley in The Lottawanna, 21 Wall. 558, 572, where he said for the Court: \"[I]t is hardly necessary to argue that the maritime law is only so far operative as law in any country as it is adopted by the laws and usages of that country. . . .\" This teaching was emphasized in The Western Maid, \n257 \nU.S. 419, 432\n, where Mr. Justice Holmes, speaking for the Court, said: \"[W]e must realize that however ancient may be the traditions of maritime law, however diverse the sources from which it has been drawn, it derives its whole and only power in this country from its having been accepted and adopted by the United States. There is no mystic over-law to which even the United States must bow.\"\n\nThe sovereign power which determines the rules of substantive law governing maritime claims of the sort which petitioner asserts here is federal power, speaking through Congress as in the case of the Jones Act, or through this Court in the case of judicially defined causes of action. Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, supra. This is an area where the federal courts have defined substantive rules themselves, and have not applied state law. Indeed, it is federal substantive law so created which the States must enforce in such actions brought in state courts, Garrett v. Moore-McCormack Co., supra, and which the federal courts have applied in actions at law in which diversity of citizenship has been relied upon as a jurisdictional basis, Pope & Talbot, Inc., v. Hawn, supra. The causes of action asserted against his employer by petitioner here present \"no claim created by or arising out \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 393]\n\u00a0\n of [state] law. His right of recovery . . . is rooted in federal maritime law.\" Id., at 409.\n\nSecond. Since petitioner's causes of action for unseaworthiness and for maintenance and cure are created by federal law, his case arises under \"the laws . . . of the United States\" within the meaning of 1331, for it is clear that \"a suit arises under the law that creates the cause of action.\" Holmes, J., in American Well Works Co. v. Layne & Bowler Co., \n241 \nU.S. 257, 260\n.\n4\n The contention cannot be accepted that since petitioner's rights are judicially defined, The Osceola, \n189 \nU.S. 158\n, they are not created by \"the laws . . . of the United States\" within the meaning of 1331; or, in other words, that only maritime rights created by Act of Congress are created by \"the laws . . . of the United States.\" In another context, that of state law, this Court has recognized that the statutory word \"laws\" includes court decisions. Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n. The converse situation is presented here in that federal courts have an extensive responsibility of fashioning rules of substantive law in maritime cases. See Wilburn Boat Co. v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co., \n348 \nU.S. 310, 314\n. These rules are as fully \"laws\" of the United States as if they had been enacted by Congress. Cf. Garrett v. Moore-McCormack Co., supra; Warren v. United States, \n340 \nU.S. 523, 526\n-528; and see Mater v. Holley, 200 F.2d 123.\n5\n\u00a0\n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 394]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThird. Notwithstanding these conclusions, jurisdiction under 1331 would, of course, not lie if it were beyond the constitutional power of Congress to vest jurisdiction over this action of a seaman against his employer, a matter falling admittedly within the \"admiralty or maritime jurisdiction,\" in a federal court sitting at law. But it is too late to make such an argument. The jurisdictional treatment of the rights of seamen under the Jones Act, a cause of action bound up with the cause of action in question here, is preclusive on the issue. The Jones Act was held in Panama R. Co. v. Johnson, \n264 \nU.S. 375\n, to be authorized by the legislative power residing in the Admiralty Clause of Article III. The right of action granted was, however, specifically stated by Congress to be exercisable \"at law, with the right of trial by jury\" and in the Federal District Courts. This treatment was upheld, against constitutional challenge, by the Court, which held that jurisdiction properly lay, at the option of the plaintiff, either in admiralty or on the law side of the District Court. \"[T]he constitutional provision interposes no obstacle to permitting rights founded on the maritime law or an admissible modification of it to be enforced as such through appropriate actions on the common-law side of the courts . . . .\" Id., at 388. And the unchallenged maintenance of the very cause of action in question here at law in the District Courts under 28 U.S.C. 1332, where diversity of citizenship is present, is further proof that no constitutional inhibition to the maintenance of such an action at law under 1331 exists. Cf. The Belfast, 7 Wall. 624, 644. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 395]\n\u00a0\n\n\nBut despite the constitutional power of Congress, jurisdiction under 1331 may still be defeated if that power has not there been exercised; in other words, if that jurisdictional grant is to be read as containing an implied exception as to cases falling within the \"admiralty or maritime jurisdiction.\" See Paduano v. Yamashita Kisen Kabushiki Kaisha, 221 F.2d 615; Jenkins v. Roderick, 156 F. Supp. 299, 302. This I take to be the net effect of the Court's reasoning. The gist of the argument, as it has been developed in the Courts of Appeals, is that 1331 was enacted \"to insure the availability of a forum designed to minimize the danger of hostility toward, and specially suited to the vindication of, federally created rights . . . .\" Paduano v. Yamashita Kisen Kabushiki Kaisha, supra, at 618. Continuously since 1789 Congress has provided specially for admiralty courts in which rights under the federal maritime law could be asserted. The argument runs that it follows that claims under the maritime law were not intended to fall within the scope of 1331. And here, the Court's conclusion rests primarily on an analysis of the terms and background of the 1875 Act which was the ancestor of 1331, and on various inferences drawn from silence after that Act's passage.\n\nThe members of the First Congress, in agreement that national courts of admiralty were an imperative necessity of the times, 1 Annals of Cong. 797-798 (1789), gave to the District Courts in 9 of the First Judiciary Act original jurisdiction over \"all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction . . . .\" 1 Stat. 76, 77. Under 21 the Circuit Courts were given appellate jurisdiction \"in causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction . . . .\" 1 Stat. 83. These phrases followed almost literally the wording of Art. III, 2, of the Constitution, extending the federal judicial power \"to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction . . . .\" Significantly, the First \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 396]\n\u00a0\n Judiciary Act granted to the District and Circuit Courts no general federal-question jurisdiction.\n\nSection 9 of the First Judiciary Act, however, contained the clause \". . . saving to suitors, in all cases, the right of a common law remedy, where the common law is competent to give it . . . .\" The Saving Clause survives in 28 U.S.C. 1333, phrased \". . . saving to suitors in all cases all other remedies to which they are otherwise entitled. . . .\" This provision, plainly, was a recognition that there were, prior to 1789, maritime claims within the concurrent jurisdiction of courts of admiralty and law, 1 Benedict, American Admiralty (6th ed. 1940), 20; Schoonmaker v. Gilmore, \n102 \nU.S. 118, 119\n, and it was clearly the intention of Congress to perpetuate this duality of remedy. It is true that certain classes of cases, such as the traditional in rem, prize, and seizure cases, lay within the exclusive jurisdiction of the admiralty, 1 Benedict, American Admiralty, 23; The Moses Taylor, 4 Wall. 411; The Hine v. Trevor, 4 Wall. 555; The Glide, \n167 \nU.S. 606\n, but all other suits under the maritime law of an in personam nature might be brought as well in the state courts or, under the diversity jurisdiction, in the Federal Circuit Courts. 11, 1 Stat. 78.\n\nIt is thus clear that any argument that 1333 is an exclusive grant of jurisdiction would be false to the history of enactments allocating the judicial power of the United States. The fact that, in a diversity case under 1332, the claimant is free to proceed on the law side of the federal court to enforce rights created by the federal maritime law, Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, \n328 \nU.S. 85, 88\n-89, clearly runs counter to any theory that the federal courts, because of 9 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, can adjudicate maritime claims only while sitting in admiralty. There is no compelling reason why 1333, which does not exclude maritime actions from being brought at law in a federal court under 1332, should exclude them \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 397]\n\u00a0\n from being so brought under 1331.\n6\n Indeed, I find it a gross anomaly to hold, as the Court holds today, that an action rooted in federal law can be brought on the law side of a federal court only if the diversity jurisdiction, usually a vehicle for the enforcement of state-created rights, can be invoked.\n\nPlainly there is nothing in the language of 1331 which would exclude jurisdiction of maritime claims of the nature asserted by petitioner. Rather, in more than a manner of speaking, the language of that section fits the cause of action in question here \"like a glove,\" Jenkins v. Roderick, 156 F. Supp. 299, 301. But the Court reasons that the section must be read restrictively because the corresponding jurisdictional grant in the Constitution speaks of \"Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States . . . .\" This specification of \"law and equity,\" reflected in the 1875 ancestor\n7\n of present 1331 as \"suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity . . . arising under the Constitution or laws . . .,\" is said to indicate that a suit arising under the substantive maritime law is not comprehended under the section. But the argument mistakes the nature of a Saving Clause action. An action brought under the Saving Clause is maintained \"at law\" or \"in \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 398]\n\u00a0\n equity,\" and the very action that Romero would assert here he would assert \"at law.\" The mere fact that the substantive claim a court enforces in a particular Saving Clause action is rooted in the general maritime law does not transform the proceedings from a suit \"at law' to one \"in admiralty\"; the state courts can hardly be said to sit \"in admiralty\" when they try actions under the Saving Clause. Cf. The Hamilton, \n207 \nU.S. 398, 404\n. The Saving Clause itself, in its 1789 form, stated that what it was \"saving\" was \"a common law remedy\" to be available in maritime fact situations. It can readily be admitted that a suit \"in admiralty\" is not the same thing as a suit \"at law.\" But this is not to say that a suit involving a maritime cause of action cannot be the subject of a suit \"at law\" in the federal courts. Obviously Saving Clause actions brought on the law side of the federal court, with diversity of citizenship present, are actions \"at law.\" In fact, the grant of diversity jurisdiction in the 1875 Act was in the very same terms as the grant of the \"arising under\" jurisdiction; the same introductory phrase, \"suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity,\" governed both grants. It seems to me very odd to say that this phrase, introducing two grants of jurisdiction, had the effect of excluding maritime causes of action entirely from the one but not at all from the other.\n\nThe legislative history of 1331 does not indicate any intent on the part of Congress to exclude claims asserted under federal maritime law from its ambit. The present section is but the latest recodification of the provisions of the Judiciary Act of 1875, 18 Stat. 470, alluded to above, which for the first time with any permanence vested in the federal courts an original general federal-question jurisdiction over any claim which \"arises under the Constitution, laws or treaties of the United States.\" The congressional debates focused so largely on proposed \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 399]\n\u00a0\n changes in the diversity jurisdiction that no considered scrutiny was given to the provisions which have become 1331. See 2 Cong. Rec. 4978-4988; Frankfurter and Landis, The Business of the Supreme Court (1927 ed.), 65-69. Nothing appears which would indicate a congressional intent to modify, by implication or otherwise, the sweep of the language of this Act, embodying as it does substantially the words of the constitutional grant.\n8\n And nothing appears which would indicate any intention that the Act's coverage be \"frozen\" to exclude federal causes of action which were not fully developed in 1875.\n\nThe Court argues, however, that Congress, aware of Chief Justice Marshall's statement that Article III created the admiralty jurisdiction as \"distinct\" from the \"arising under\" jurisdiction,\n9\n American Ins. Co. v. Canter, \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 400]\n\u00a0\n supra, at 545, intended that the jurisdictional statutes be mutually exclusive. The manager of the 1875 legislation in the Senate declared of the bill generally that it conferred \"precisely the power which the Constitution confers - nothing more, nothing less.\" 2 Cong. Rec. 4987. It is difficult to infer that Congress meant to crystallize any particular interpretation of the Constitution in the statute. But even if it were proper, in the absence of concrete indication, speculatively to breathe into our construction of 1331 views of the Constitution\n10\n which might have served as a silent premise of congressional \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 401]\n\u00a0\n action, I do not think that the Court here is called on to do so. Marshall's statement is not, when understood in its context, contrary to my position, and in fact its proper scope was recognized before 1875.\n\nBefore discussing the Canter case, I think it wise to restate the precise nature of the issue before the Court. This is so because I fear the Court, in an expansive reading of Canter not justified either by what was decided there or by what was said there considered in the light of what was decided, has blurred the issue for decision today. The issue before us is not whether all cases \"of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction\" are per se encompassed in the statutory \"arising under\" jurisdiction. A suit seeking the sort of remedy that the common law is not competent to give could not be fairly contended to lie under 1331; it would clearly be the sort of suit in which the jurisdictional grant of 1333 was intended to be exclusive. The issue before us concerns only actions maintainable in some forum \"at law\" under the Saving Clause. And again, the issue is not even the narrower one whether Saving Clause actions are per se cognizable under 1331. The tests of jurisdiction under 1331 must still be met, and there is no contention that they are met merely by a showing that an action is one maintainable under the Saving Clause and involving the requisite jurisdictional amount. The plaintiff's right to recovery must still be one rooted in federal substantive law, and it has quite recently been made clear that there are Saving Clause actions that do not meet that test. Wilburn Boat Co. v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co., \n348 \nU.S. 310\n. The issue before us is only whether the fact that an action is a Saving Clause action excludes it from 1331 where it would otherwise be maintainable thereunder.\n\nAt issue in American Ins. Co. v. Canter was the power of a territorial court to make a decree selling cargo to satisfy a maritime lien in rem existing in favor of its \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 402]\n\u00a0\n salvors. A state court, even under the Saving Clause, could not pass such a decree at all; it is the enforcement of the classic admiralty remedy, and a matter solely within the competence of the federal admiralty courts. The Hine v. Trevor, 4 Wall. 555. In the passage from Marshall's opinion relied upon, the Chief Justice was saying only that the Act of Congress which conferred on certain territorial courts jurisdiction in \"cases arising under the laws and constitution of the United States,\" 8, 3 Stat. 752, did not by that token alone grant them power to enforce a remedy peculiarly within the competence of admiralty courts.\n11\n In its broadest permissible interpretation, the dictum only means that the fact that the Constitution creates admiralty jurisdiction does not make all admiralty cases cases arising under the Constitution.\n12\n But Marshall's opinion does not say that an action seeking remedial relief of a sort which the common law is competent to give, and in which the plaintiff's right to recover is rooted in federal law, ceases to be a suit arising under the laws of the United States merely because it is of a maritime nature.\n13\n No one is contending here, \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 403]\n\u00a0\n of course, that 1331 is a grant of power to enforce remedies peculiar to the admiralty; the contention is solely that that section, which empowers a federal court to administer common-law remedies in vindication of rights of plaintiffs which take their origin from federal law, is not subject to an exception for rights taking their origin in federal maritime law. Marshall's opinion simply is not addressed to this question or dispositive of it.\n\nMuch is made by the Court of Marshall's language that the categories of actions he mentions are \"distinct\" and not \"identical.\" Of course this is so, in a real sense and the only sense in which Marshall meant it. A matter affecting an ambassador or a consul is not per se an action \"arising under,\" just as it is not per se a maritime action. But could not a case involving a consul be also a case of admiralty jurisdiction, under certain fact situations? And could not a suit by or against a consul happen, per-chance, to be also one \"arising under\"? The fact that the jurisdictional categories are separate and distinct, as Marshall demonstrates, does not mean that a particular action could not come under the heading of more than one of them. Everyone recognizes that this is the case in a maritime matter in which the parties are of diverse citizenship. I see no reason why it should not be true here of Romero's general maritime law claims against his employer. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 404]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt appears also to be clear that even before 1875 Marshall's opinion was not thought of as creating a situation in which it was impossible to say that there were maritime cases that could be also attributed to other categories of federal jurisdiction. Long before Congress contemplated the jurisdictional grant of 1875, this Court in Taylor v. Carryl, 20 How. 583, made it clear that there were fact situations which were of maritime cognizance, giving rise to rights for which the admiralty could supply a remedy, or for which alternatively proceedings at the course of common law lay. Maritime torts were specifically conceived of as within this category. The Court in that case followed the view of Mr. Justice Story expressed in his Commentaries on the Constitution, which were quoted with approval:\n\n\"`Mr. Chancellor Kent and Mr. Rawle seem to think that the admiralty jurisdiction given by the Constitution is, in all cases, necessarily exclusive. But it is believed that this opinion is founded on mistake. It is exclusive in all matters of prize, for the reason that, at the common law, this jurisdiction is vested in the courts of admiralty, to the exclusion of the courts of common law. But in cases where the jurisdiction of common law and admiralty are concurrent, (as in cases of possessory suits, mariners' wages, and marine torts,) there is nothing in the Constitution necessarily leading to the conclusion that the jurisdiction was intended to be exclusive; and there is no better ground, upon general reasoning, to contend for it. The reasonable interpretation . . . would seem to be, that it conferred on the national judiciary the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction exactly according to the nature and extent and modifications in which it existed in the jurisprudence of the common law. When the jurisdiction was exclusive, it remained so; when it was concurrent, \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 405]\n\u00a0\n it remained so. Hence the States could have no right to create courts of admiralty as such, or to confer on their own courts the cognizance of such cases as were exclusively cognizable in admiralty courts. But the States might well retain and exercise the jurisdiction in cases of which the cognizance was previously concurrent in the courts of common law. This latter class of cases can be no more deemed cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction than cases of common-law jurisdiction.' (3 Story's Com., sec. 1666, note.)\" 20 How., at 598.\n\n\n And it was understood before 1875 that this concurrent jurisdiction at law was not one merely existent in the state courts, but one available to suitors in the federal courts. See The Belfast, 7 Wall. 624, 644, infra, pp. 406-407.\n\nAccordingly, I cannot see how it can be concluded that Congress in 1875 read Marshall's opinion as creating some sort of gulf that would make it impossible for any maritime case to be also one \"arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States.\"\n14\n\u00a0\n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 406]\n\u00a0\n\n\nOf course, one cannot rely, to prove the Court's thesis, on dicta in cases decided before 1875 to the effect that Saving Clause actions could be brought on the law side of a federal court only when there is diversity of citizenship, and the Court does not so rely. The Belfast, 7 Wall. 624, 643-644; Leon v. Galceran, 11 Wall. 185, 188; Steamboat Co. v. Chase, 16 Wall. 522, 533. The 1875 Act for the first time with any permanence granted general federal-question jurisdiction to the federal courts of first instance. It can hardly be denied that these statements were correct when made, but it is equally plain that they are no authority for limiting the law-side jurisdiction to diversity cases once the 1875 Act had been passed. Moreover, I cannot seriously attach any significance, as the Court does, to the repetition, obiter, of their formulation in a case decided shortly after the Act's passage, where the effect of the new statute was not at all presented or discussed. Norton v. Switzer, \n93 \nU.S. 355, 356\n. In fact, the approach this Court followed in the interpretation of the Saving Clause during this period supports, rather than detracts from, my conclusion here. It was observed in 1869 that the remedies saved by the Saving Clause were saved \"to suitors, and not to the State courts, nor to the Circuit Courts\n15\n of the United States. . . . Congress intended by that provision to allow the party to seek redress in the admiralty if he saw fit to do so, but not to make it compulsory in any \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 407]\n\u00a0\n case where the common law is competent to give him a remedy. Properly construed, a party under that provision may proceed in rem in the admiralty, or he may bring a suit in personam in the same jurisdiction, or he may elect not to go into admiralty at all, and may resort to his common law remedy in the State courts or in the Circuit Court of the United States, if he can make proper parties to give that court jurisdiction of his case.\" The Belfast, 7 Wall. 624, 644. It is clear from the Court's language that the common-law remedies saved to suitors could properly be enforced in any tribunal otherwise having jurisdiction; the remedies saved were saved generally to suitors without discrimination as to any tribunal.\n\nNor can I consider it sound to place the reliance the Court has placed on the fact that the arguments we are considering today were not raised until 1950. Till then no court ever considered the problem that we discuss here at great length. None of the assortment of commentators listed in the Court's Appendix ever discussed it. The Court's argument, in fact, claims to draw force from the fact that it was not discussed at all. From the fact that the issue was never explored or tried at all till 1950, when Judge Magruder, in a dictum in Jansson v. Swedish American Line,\n16\n 185 F.2d 212, 216-218, took a point of view similar to the one expressed here, we are asked to infer that the argument for jurisdiction should not succeed when finally raised. I cannot accept this as a convincing argument in the construction of a broadly written statute which was intended, at least in some aspects, to be as broad and dynamic as the Constitution itself, and which has served as the basic jurisdictional entitlement for the vindication of the numerous and increasing types of federally created rights in the lower federal courts ever since its \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 408]\n\u00a0\n enactment. It is a modern development in legal science in this country's federal system that increasing concern is taken with the source of the substantive law administered by the courts. Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, supra, and notably Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, supra, are indications of this trend. When lawyers and judges in our federal system came to concentrate more and more on the source of the substantive law administered in the courts, and when this Court's opinions made it increasingly clear that there were kinds of maritime actions where the underlying right to recover was rooted in federally created law, inadmissible of significant modification by the States, it was an inevitable consequence that the relation of 1331 to maritime matters would come for the first time to be examined, as Judge Magruder examined it in the Jansson and Doucette cases. If one views the history of the common-law system of adjudication as the history of a process, one must conclude that the \"historical\" material relied upon by the Court has nothing to do with this sort of history at all, except to illustrate its antithesis.\n\nIt is, finally, true that this Court has adhered to a policy of construing jurisdictional statutes narrowly. Healy v. Ratta, \n292 \nU.S. 263, 270\n; Thomson v. Gaskill, \n315 \nU.S. 442, 446\n. In regard to the grant of federal-question jurisdiction to the District Courts, this Court has insisted that a claim created under federal law be a necessary part of the plaintiff's case, Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Mottley, \n211 \nU.S. 149\n, and that this claim be truly federal in nature, Gully v. First National Bank, \n299 \nU.S. 109\n. But the present problem is apart from this line of cases, for here it is clear that petitioner is presenting to a federal court a claim created by federal law, and the objection is that somehow Congress intended to exclude claims of this particular sort from the grant in 1331. But the arguments presented for such a narrow construction appear to me too insubstantial to withstand the logic of petitioner's \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 409]\n\u00a0\n position. However willing one might be to resolve doubtful language against jurisdiction, exceptions to statutory language cannot be manufactured in a manner unwarranted by the words themselves and derived from the pertinent history only by a process of futile speculation. I am compelled to the conclusion that it is the effect of the 1875 Act and its intent, judged by the lights by which the courts must discern legislative intent, that the federal courts possess original jurisdiction, at law, to determine claims arising under federal substantive maritime law, where the common law is competent to afford the remedy sought by the plaintiff.\n\nFourth. The Court envisions various unfortunate results, from a practical standpoint, that would ensue from a holding on the jurisdictional issue under 1331 contrary to its own. I shall comment briefly on its arguments.\n\nIt is first argued that the recognition of jurisdiction under 1331 would, combined with the removal provisions of 1441 (b) of the Judicial Code, operate to destroy the competence of the States in maritime matters altogether. A source cited by the Court itself\n17\n indicates that in the five-year period 1953 to 1957 inclusive only about 150 decisions in Saving Clause actions have been rendered in all of the state courts of the country. As I have developed, resolution of the jurisdictional issue contrary to the majority's view would not mean that all these cases would be assertable originally in the federal court or removable there, even present $10,000 in controversy. It is apparent then that the removability point addresses itself to a situation nearly de minimis. Saving Clause suitors seem long ago to have deserted the state courts. I therefore cannot share the concern that \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 410]\n\u00a0\n state judiciaries will be deprived of their historic active roles in the development of maritime law. Of the few actions that are left in the state courts, many may stay, for aught that can be predicted now. What sort of role do the state judiciaries now have in the development of the maritime law, with thirty-odd Saving Clause actions a year among them? Will the doctrine really put an end to this role, whatever it is? And it must be noted that such legislative competence as they possess remains to the States regardless of what may happen to the number of maritime cases in their courts; the view I have urged does not subtract one iota from the legislative competence of the States. And it is only because of an enlargement of removal that it affects their judicial competence; it does not take away their original jurisdiction at all, if suitors are content with it.\n\nIn further elaboration of the inroads on state competence which rejection of the Court's view is supposed to entail, it is stated that it is a destructive oversimplification to claim that all enforced rights pertaining to maritime matters are rooted in federal law. So it is; and no one is so claiming. The point is not that all Saving Clause actions meet the \"arising under\" test of 1331.\n18\n It is, however, perfectly evident from the past holdings of this Court that the seaman's action for unseaworthiness and maintenance and cure is rooted in federal law, and it is only this claim that need present the issue of the case as \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 411]\n\u00a0\n to 1331. I agree perfectly with the Court's observation that in our federal system allocations of jurisdiction have been carefully wrought to correspond to the realities of power and interest and national policy. I think that 1331 embodies this approach by vesting in the federal courts, in civil actions, jurisdiction, at the option of the suitors, over all suits seeking a legal or equitable remedy, arising under federal law and involving a specified amount, and that this is so whether they involve maritime matters or not. I cannot see how it fits with the \"realities of power and interest and national policy\" to say that there is federal jurisdiction at common law over federally defined maritime causes of action only if there is diversity of citizenship among the parties involved in them.\n\nThe Court next argues that a holding to the contrary of its own will produce venue problems, and will in fact be unduly restrictive toward plaintiffs in their choice of forums. Where the District Courts have jurisdiction under 1331 (even though diversity may also be present) 1391 (b) of the Judicial Code rather than 1391 (a) governs, and the suit must be brought in the defendants' residence district, and may not be brought in the plaintiffs' residence district, unless of course it also happens to be the defendants'. But one reading the discussion of the consequences this will have for plaintiffs is apt to forget (for the Court does not inform him) that defendants in maritime actions are most likely to be corporations (particularly in personal injury litigation, the sort of case we have at bar) and that 1391 (c) declares that the residence of a corporation for venue purposes is any district where it is incorporated or any district in which it is licensed to do, or actually doing business. With corporate venue so widely defined, it will be a rare plaintiff (and a rarer personal injury plaintiff, for seamen and longshoremen are apt to live near where their employers carry on business, or where the vessel owners their employers \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 412]\n\u00a0\n serve do business) who can take much advantage from the fact that he can sue in the district of his own residence in an action based solely on diversity and not otherwise. And of course, the existence of proper venue at his own residence does not mean the plaintiff can sue the defendants there; he must still serve them with process. Except that process can be run throughout the limits of the State, while venue speaks in terms of the district, this means that the broader diversity venue only is of assistance where there is a defendant who, while not \"doing business\" in an area, is nonetheless amenable to process there. Of course there are some such, but I think by now the dimensions of this \"practical\" reason for the Court's holding are patent.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nThe Court, though it rejects Romero's assertion of jurisdiction over his general maritime law claims against his employer under 1331, proceeds to adjudicate them on the merits. It reaches them through a \"pendent\" jurisdiction theory analogous to Hurn v. Oursler, \n289 \nU.S. 238\n. The Court's action appears unprecedented, as it appears to recognize. The prior applications of the doctrine recognized here have been limited to cases where claims arising under state law, over which there was no independent jurisdiction in the federal court, have been intertwined with federal claims. The theory has not been here applied to cases where there have been two types of claims, both admittedly within the District Court's jurisdiction, one of which was admittedly cognizable according to the forms of the common law and the other, except for the theory, not. Here a plaintiff comes into court desiring that his claims be adjudicated strictly according to the common law and disclaiming federal jurisdiction in admiralty. In short, he desires that a common-law jury pass upon his claims. If the federal \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 413]\n\u00a0\n courts do not have such jurisdiction over all his claims, there are state courts which do, and he may well prefer them in that event. The Court today tells him that though it is doubtful whether there is enough common-law jurisdiction in the federal courts to proceed to a plenary adjudication of his claim, there is enough certainly to award summary judgment against him on the merits. I must say I cannot understand a sort of jurisdiction that allows the federal courts to make a preliminary exploration of the merits of the case, and a binding adjudication upon them, but which may not allow them to go further.\n\nObviously what we have here, once the Court's view of 1331 is accepted, and as claims are presented which can survive summary judgment, is not a problem in pendent jurisdiction but a glaring problem in judicial administration and in the separation of functions between judge and jury. Crew members' maritime tort suits almost invariably urge claims under the Jones Act and under the general maritime law for breach of the duty to maintain a seaworthy vessel. These claims are legally, and generally factually, completely bound up with each other. McAllister v. Magnolia Petroleum Co., \n357 \nU.S. 221\n; Baltimore S. S. Co. v. Phillips, \n274 \nU.S. 316\n. It would be productive of extraordinary problems if the two elements of the claim are presented to different triers of fact at the same time, as would be one consequence of holding that there was no jurisdiction at law of any sort over unseaworthiness claims where diversity of citizenship was absent. Cf. Jenkins v. Roderick, 156 F. Supp. 299, 304-306. Should an advisory jury (with the same membership, doubtless, as the \"mandatory\" one hearing the Jones Act claim) hear the unseaworthiness claim? To what extent would its verdict bind the judge? If the judge passes on the issues himself, how to avoid overlapping damages, or contradictory findings? And what would be \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 414]\n\u00a0\n the effect of a finding of facts common to both claims made by the judge before the rendition of the jury's verdict, or vice versa? Would the doctrine of collateral estoppel apply? These problems arise in the wake of the Court's rejection of jurisdiction under 1331 and its restricted holding on any other jurisdictional basis (apart from 1333) of Romero's claims under the general maritime law against his employer. I cannot consider that the Court's solution of the controversy among the lower courts that has prevailed since the Jansson dictum has shed much light on them.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nSince under my view there would be jurisdiction at law (the only jurisdiction Romero invoked) to consider all his claims, I arrive at the merits of his claims against his employer, Compania Trasatlantica. As to them, I concur in the result set forth in Part II of the Court's opinion. I also agree with the Court's disposition of the claims against the other respondents, as set forth in Part III of its opinion.\n\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE joins in this opinion, and MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS join in it except to the extent indicated in their dissents.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The grant of diversity of citizenship jurisdiction contained in 28 U.S.C. 1332 contains no language which would include a suit by one alien against another, even where there might also be citizen defendants. For the constitutionality of a broader statute, at least under Art. III, 2, cl. 1, subclause 8, see Hodgson v. Bowerbank, 5 Cranch 303.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] At the time of the commencement of petitioner's suit, 1331 read:\n\n\"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions wherein the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 391]\n\u00a0\n of $3,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and arises under the Constitution, laws or treaties of the United States.\"\n\n\n Section 1, Act of July 25, 1958, 72 Stat. 415, increased the requisite jurisdictional amount to $10,000.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] It is true that to a certain extent state law may be consulted in this area, at least where it does not work \"material prejudice to the characteristic features of the general maritime law\" or interfere with \"the proper harmony and uniformity of that law. . . .\" Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, supra, at 216. For example, recovery has made use of state wrongful death acts, The Hamilton, \n207 \nU.S. 398\n; Western Fuel Co. v. Garcia, \n257 \nU.S. 233\n; Levinson v. Deupree, \n345 \nU.S. 648\n, and of state survival statutes, Just v. Chambers, \n312 \nU.S. 383\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] There is not presented here the problem of interpreting, in its periphery where state and federal elements are blended, the scope of the arising-under provisions of 1331. See Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust Co., \n255 \nU.S. 180\n; Gully v. First National Bank, \n299 \nU.S. 109\n; Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., \n339 \nU.S. 667\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Since 1331 is derived from 1 of the Judiciary Act of 1875, 18 Stat. 470, and since the language of the jurisdictional grant in that Act is taken from Art. III, 2, it is worthy of note that the earlier draft forms of Article III had provided that the judicial power should extend to \"cases arising under laws passed by the legislature of the \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 394]\n\u00a0\n United States.\" See Madison's Diary, for July 26, August 6, and August 27, 1787 (II Elliot's Debates (2d ed. 1941) 368, 376, 380); Warren, The Making of the Constitution (1937 ed.), 538-539; United States v. Flores, \n289 \nU.S. 137, 148\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] It is argued that the policy of 1331 \"to insure the availability of a forum designed to minimize . . . hostility . . . to the vindication of federally created rights,\" has no application here because of the availability of a federal forum under 1333. Substantially the same argument could be made in a diversity case under 1332 since it would be assumed that the admiralty would be impartial in treatment of out-of-state parties. Cf. Paduano v. Yamashita Kisen Kabushiki Kaisha, supra, at 618.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] 1, Act of March 3, 1875, c. 137, 18 Stat. 470. This was the first permanent statute vesting original \"arising under\" jurisdiction in the federal courts. Section 11 of the Act of February 13, 1801, c. 4, 2 Stat. 92, extended such jurisdiction, but it was shortly repealed by 1 of the Act of March 8, 1802, c. 8, 2 Stat. 132.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] I might say that I do not think impressive the Court's argument that because the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee and other Congressmen in 1875 were men of large legal attainments and learning they could not have intended a result contrary to the Court's when they participated in the enactment of the Judiciary Act. The Court states that men of such esteem would not \"silently\" have made such a \"revolutionary\" change in the maritime jurisdiction as a holding contrary to that of the Court's herein is supposed to be. But cf. Frankfurter and Landis, op. cit., supra, at 65: \"This development in the federal judiciary [\"arising-under\" jurisdiction], which in retrospect seems revolutionary, received hardly a contemporary comment.\" At any rate, the Court's argument, to me, combines an unwarranted historical \"cult of the personality\" with an attribution of one's own views to prior generations. What is not involved here is some sort of conspiratorially silent change in federal jurisdiction, but the question whether a tacit exception should be engrafted on a thoroughgoing and explicit new jurisdictional grant; whether we should \"read out\" of the statute \"what as a matter of ordinary English speech is in.\" United States v. Hood, \n343 \nU.S. 148, 151\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Marshall's statement in full is as follows:\n\n\"The Constitution and laws of the United States, give jurisdiction to the District Courts over all cases in admiralty; but jurisdiction over the case, does not constitute the case itself. We are therefore \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 400]\n\u00a0\n to inquire, whether cases in admiralty, and cases arising under the laws and Constitution of the United States, are identical.\n\n\n\"If we have recourse to that pure fountain from which all the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts is derived, we find language employed which cannot well be misunderstood. The Constitution declares, that `the judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority; to all cases affecting ambassadors, or other public ministers, and consuls; to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.'\n\n\n\"The Constitution certainly contemplates these as three distinct classes of cases; and if they are distinct, the grant of jurisdiction over one of them does not confer jurisdiction over either of the other two. The discrimination made between them, in the Constitution, is, we think, conclusive against their identity. If it were not so, if this were a point open to inquiry, it would be difficult to maintain the proposition that they are the same. A case in admiralty does not, in fact, arise under the Constitution or laws of the United States. These cases are as old as navigation itself; and the law, admiralty and maritime, as it has existed for ages, is applied by our Courts to the cases as they arise.\" 1 Pet., at 545-546.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] I advert to these constitutional views only for such light as they may shed on Congress' probable intent at the time the Act of 1875 was under consideration. Marshall's statement may be thought to have been made in constitutional terms. As I have developed above, there can be no constitutional argument against the power of Congress to allocate this type of action, at least concurrently, to the law side of a federal court.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] The power to enforce the remedy was in fact found in another section of the territorial organic act, 7, 3 Stat. 752, under which jurisdiction could be vested in the court in question, rather than in the territorial Superior Court, to which 8 related. Cf. note 14, infra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] This seems to be the import of the first sentence from the Marshall dictum quoted in note 9, supra. And see note 13, infra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] The opinion of Justice Johnson in the Canter case, rendering the judgment in the Circuit Court which Marshall's opinion affirmed on appeal, makes this very distinction. Johnson rejected the idea that the constitutional grant of admiralty jurisdiction made all admiralty cases cases arising under the Constitution. He did not believe that the cause of action for salvage arose under the Constitution or the laws of the United States. Yet he recognized, and enumerated, cases of a maritime nature where the substantive rights were rooted in federal law, and to which the grant of \"arising under\" \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 403]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction would extend. American Ins. Co. v. Canter, 1 Fed. Cas. No. 302a, at 662. Johnson sat in the Supreme Court on the appeal, and did not express any indication that Marshall's opinion was contrary to what he had said at circuit. In fact, Marshall's language that \"jurisdiction over the case, does not constitute the case itself,\" note 9, supra, appears to recognize Johnson's distinction; the constitutional grant of admiralty jurisdiction does not mean that all admiralty cases are \"arising under\" cases; the substantive law governing the case is determinative. Cf. Puerto Rico v. Russell & Co., \n288 \nU.S. 476, 483\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] Only four years after the passage of the 1875 Act, the Court rejected Marshall's dictum in the very narrow application that it had at the time it was originally delivered. In The City of Panama, \n101 \nU.S. 453\n, the Court again was considering the power of a territorial court to enforce remedies peculiarly within the competence of a court of admiralty. A counterpart to the section on which Marshall finally predicated the jurisdiction in Canter was not presented by the case, and the Court based jurisdiction on a section of the territorial organic act similar to the one Marshall had rejected, i. e., on 9, 10 Stat. 175, 176, which extended jurisdiction in certain \"cases arising under the constitution and laws of the United States.\" In holding that this \"arising under\" language granted admiralty jurisdiction, the Court referred to Canter: \"Select passages of the opinion in that case, when detached from the context, may appear to support the theory of the respondents, but the actual decision of the court is explicitly and undeniably the other way.\" \n101 \nU.S., at 458\n.\n\nOf course, the question whether \"arising under\" language in an organic act for a territory should be taken as vesting the entire \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 406]\n\u00a0\n admiralty jurisdiction, the subject of the Canter and Panama decisions, in itself has no relation to the issue here. It is not contended that 1331 somehow entitles the federal district courts to exercise all the admiralty power \"at law.\" The issue is whether that section grants them a jurisdiction at law over federally based claims that remains unaffected by the circumstance that particular claims may be of a maritime nature.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] The original repositories of the diversity jurisdiction, 11, Act of September 24, 1789, c. 20, 1 Stat. 78.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] Judge Magruder thoroughly developed his views in Doucette v. Vincent, 194 F.2d 834.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] The Seventh 5-Year Index-Digest of American Maritime Cases, 1953-1957 (1957), xliii-xlviii. This source reports all state court decisions, including those not published otherwise.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] The Court later, however, recognizes that no one is arguing that all Saving Clause actions per se are encompassed by 1331. But the argument then progresses that it will be unfortunate if the courts are forced to determine in limine whether various Saving Clause actions do or do not \"arise under\" for 1331 purposes. Is it really an obstacle to the efficient administration of justice if a trial court, at the first stage of litigation, is called upon precisely to determine what is the legal system that has created the cause of action on which the plaintiff is suing? \n\n[358 \nU.S. 354, 415]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","151":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nROSENBERG v. UNITED STATES(1959)\nNo. 451\nArgued: April 28, 1959Decided: June 22, 1959\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner was convicted in a Federal District Court of transporting in interstate commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 2314, a check obtained by the perpetration of a fraud to which he had been a party. Upon his demand at the trial for production for inspection of Federal Bureau of Investigation files, the United States Attorney delivered numerous documents from the Government's files to the trial judge, who gave them to petitioner's counsel. However, the trial judge withheld a few documents, and petitioner claimed that failure to permit him to inspect them required reversal of his conviction under Jencks v. United States, \n353 \nU.S. 657\n. Held: The conviction is sustained. Pp. 368-371.\n\n 1. Since its enactment, 18 U.S.C. 3500 - not the Jencks decision - governs the production of statements of government witnesses for a defendant's inspection at trial. Palermo v. United States, ante, p. 343. P. 369.\n\n\n 2. Two reports of F. B. I. investigators were properly withheld as not being \"statements\" of the kind required to be produced by 18 U.S.C. 3500, since they were neither signed nor otherwise adopted by any witness at the trial nor were they reproductions of any statement made by any witness at the trial. P. 369.\n\n\n 3. A third document did comply with the requirement of the statute, since it was a typewritten copy of a statement given to the F. B. I. by petitioner's confessed associate in the crime, who testified against him, it was signed by the associate and it was pertinent to the trial of the case; but its production would have served no useful purpose, since petitioner's counsel had been given the original statement of which this was merely a copy. Pp. 369-370.\n\n\n 4. Among the documents withheld were five letters written by the victim to the F. B. I. and signed by her; but they failed to meet the requirement of 18 U.S.C. 3500 (b) that only statements which relate to the subject matter as to which the witness has testified need be produced. P. 370. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 367, 368]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n 5. A letter written by the victim to the United States Attorney, signed by her, and stating that she feared that her memory was poor as to the matters she testified about should have been produced; but failure to produce it was harmless error, since the same information was revealed by the victim to petitioner's counsel under cross-examination and upon questioning by the trial judge. Pp. 370-371.\n\n\n 257 F.2d 760, affirmed.\n\nEdward M. Dangel argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief was Leo E. Sherry.\n\nBeatrice Rosenberg argued the cause for the United States. With her on the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Wilkey and Kirby W. Patterson.\n\nA. L. Wirin and Fred Okrand filed a brief for Arthur L. Harris, Sr. et al., as amici curiae, in support of petitioner.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner was convicted in the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, 146 F. Supp. 555, for transporting in interstate commerce a check obtained by the perpetration of a fraud to which he had been a party. 18 U.S.C. 2314. That conviction was reversed by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit on the ground that Jencks v. United States, \n353 \nU.S. 657\n, which had been decided after conviction but before appeal, required production for petitioner's inspection of certain statements in the prosecutor's possession. 245 F.2d 870. The second trial thus ordered also resulted in a conviction, 157 F. Supp. 654, which was sustained by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, 257 F.2d 760. We granted certiorari, \n358 \nU.S. 904\n, limited to the questions of the application of the Jencks rule to this prosecution, the effect of the statute enacted establishing legislative \n\n[360 \nU.S. 367, 369]\n\u00a0\n rules concerning the production of documents. 18 U.S.C. (Supp. V) 3500, and the propriety of the ruling of the Court of Appeals that if the trial judge had erred in failing to deliver to petitioner certain documents, the error was harmless and therefore not grounds for reversal.\n\nIn the second trial, upon a demand for production for inspection of Federal Bureau of Investigation files, the United States Attorney delivered to the trial judge, and the trial judge in turn gave to petitioner's counsel, numerous documents from the Government's files. Many of these would not have been required to be provided under either the Jencks decision or the statute enacted subsequent to it. Petitioner complains that the few documents withheld by the trial judge were required to be submitted for his inspection by our opinion in Jencks and that the failure to give him that opportunity requires a reversal. We have today held in Palermo v. United States, ante, p. 343, that since its enactment 18 U.S.C. (Supp. V) 3500 and not the Jencks decision governs the production of statements of government witnesses for a defendant's inspection at trial.\n\nIn accordance with 18 U.S.C. (Supp. V) 3500 (c), the material withheld was preserved in the record to permit review of the correctness of the trial judge's rulings. As did the Court of Appeals, we have reviewed the documents withheld by the trial judge. Two are reports by FBI investigators which in no sense complied with subsection (e) of the statute. They were neither signed nor otherwise adopted by any witness at the trial, nor were they reproductions as statutorily required of any statement made by any witness at the trial. A third document did comply with such requirement. It is a typewritten copy of a statement given by Rosenberg's confessed associate in the crime, Meierdiercks, to the FBI. It is signed by Meierdiercks and its contents were pertinent to the trial of the case. However, the original handwritten \n\n[360 \nU.S. 367, 370]\n\u00a0\n statement, of which this was, as already stated, merely a copy, was itself given to petitioner's attorney. No relevant purpose could have been served by giving petitioner's counsel a typewritten copy of a document which he had already been given in its original form, no advantage to the petitioner was denied by withholding it.\n\nThe last group of documents in controversy is a series of letters written by the victim Florence Vossler to the FBI. They were signed by her and thus met the requirement of subsection (e). However, of the six letters withheld by the trial judge, five clearly fail to meet the statutory requirement that only that statement \"which relates to the subject matter as to which the witness has testified\" need be produced. 18 U.S.C. (Supp. V) 3500 (b). These five were totally irrelevant to the proceedings. In the sixth of this group of letters, Florence Vossler wrote to the Assistant United States Attorney that her memory had dimmed in the three years that had passed since the fraud had been perpetrated and that to refresh her failing memory she would have to reread the original statement she had given before the first trial to the FBI.\n\nA statement by a witness that she fears her memory as to the events at issue was poor certainly \"relates to the subject matter as to which the witness has testified\" and should have been given to defendant. This was recognized as error by the Court of Appeals. 257 F.2d 760, 763. That court, however, found that the same information which was contained in the letter was revealed to defendant's counsel by statements made by Florence Vossler under cross-examination and upon questioning by the trial judge. A review of the record, portions of which are reproduced in an Appendix, precludes us from rejecting the judgment on which the Court of Appeals based its conclusion that the failure to require \n\n[360 \nU.S. 367, 371]\n\u00a0\n production of this letter was empty of consequence. Since the same information that would have been afforded had the document been given to defendant was already in the possession of the defense by way of the witness' admissions while testifying, it would deny reason to entertain the belief that defendant could have been prejudiced by not having had opportunity to inspect the letter.\n\nAn appellate court should not confidently guess what defendant's attorney might have found useful for impeachment attorney might have found useful for impeachment purposes in withheld documents to which the defense is entitled. However, when the very same information was possessed by defendant's counsel as would have been available were error not committed, it would offend common sense and the fair administration of justice to order a new trial. There is such a thing as harmless error and this clearly was such. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is therefore\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n [For dissenting opinion of MR.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS join, dissenting.\n\nThe Government's case against petitioner rested on the testimony of Charles Meierdiercks, a confessed accomplice in the swindle that concerns us here, and Florence Vossler, the victim. Meierdiercks testified, in considerable detail, that he and the petitioner obtained Miss Vossler's check by fraud and that petitioner transported that check in interstate commerce before cashing it. Miss Vossler's testimony corroborated that of Meierdiercks to a considerable extent, but did not implicate petitioner. Since a conviction would have been impossible unless the jury \n\n[360 \nU.S. 367, 374]\n\u00a0\n believed Meierdiercks, it seems apparent that the Government put Miss Vossler on the stand in the hope that her detailed corroboration of Meierdiercks' story would lend credence in the eyes of the jury to the testimony of the confessed swindler. If the defense could have effectively impeached Miss Vossler, the Government would have had to rely on the essentially uncorroborated testimony of Meierdiercks for a conviction.\n\nDefense counsel moved at the end of Miss Vossler's direct testimony for production of \"pertinent material in the possession of the government concerning this particular witness.\" The trial judge, pursuant to this motion, ordered the delivery of some material to the defense but did not include a letter to the Assistant United States Attorney - handwritten and signed by Miss Vossler shortly before the trial - which stated in part: \"As a matter of fact, as time goes on, I am more hazy about the whole transaction and might not fare too well under a cross-examination, though I have here my statement with which to refresh my memory. It will be 3 years in January 1958 since the above swindle took place; therefore, I could not be accurate as to day to day occurrences after such a period, though, as stated, possibly a review of my statement would help.\" The Court of Appeals and this Court both agree that this letter was a statement relevant to the subject matter as to which the witness testified on direct examination, and thus should have been given to the defense under the command of the Jencks statute, 18 U.S.C. (Supp. V) 3500. The Court holds, however, that: \"There is such a thing as harmless error and this clearly was such.\" I dissent because it plainly appears that the harmless error doctrine should not be invoked in the circumstances of this case.\n\nThe principle underlying our decision in Jencks v. United States, \n353 \nU.S. 657\n, was that it is impossible \n\n[360 \nU.S. 367, 375]\n\u00a0\n for a judge to be fully aware of all the possibilities for impeachment inhering in a prior statement of a government witness, \"Because only the defense is adequately equipped to determine [its] . . . effective use for purpose of discrediting the Government's witness and thereby furthering the accused's defense . . . .\" \n353 \nU.S., at 668\n-669.\n\nThe Jencks statute was clearly designed to effectuate this principle. The statute, while delimiting the statements which are to be turned over to the defense, obviously comprehends that statements which are producible under it must be given to the defense regardless of a judge's opinion as to how useful they might be on cross-examination, for only the defense can fully appreciate their possible utility for impeachment. This is the rationale of the Jencks case, and this is the rationale of the statute. As the Senate reported: \"the proposed legislation, as here presented, reaffirms the decision of the Supreme Court in its holding that a defendant on trial in a criminal prosecution is entitled to relevant and competent reports and statements in possession of the Government touching the events and activities as to which a Government witness has testified at the trial . . . .\" S. Rep. No. 981, 85th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 3; and see H. R. Rep. No. 700, 85th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 3, 4. Although we need not go so far as those courts which have suggested that the harmless error doctrine can never apply as to statements producible under the statute, see Bergman v. United States, 253 F.2d 933; United States v. Prince, 264 F.2d 850, fidelity to the principle underlying Jencks and the Jencks statute requires, I think, that when the defense has been denied a statement producible under the statute, an appellate court should order a new trial unless the circumstances justify the conclusion that a finding that such a denial was harmful error would \n\n[360 \nU.S. 367, 376]\n\u00a0\n be clearly erroneous. In that determination, appellate courts should be hesitant to take it upon themselves to decide that the defense could not have effectively utilized a producible statement. This must necessarily be the case if the appellate court is to give effect to the underlying principle of Jencks, affirmed by the statute, which, I repeat, is that \"only the defense is adequately equipped to determine [its] . . . effective use for purpose of discrediting the Government's witness . . . .\" Indeed, another consideration which should move the appellate court to be especially hesitant to substitute its judgment as to trial strategy for that of defense counsel is that, under the procedure established by the statute, the defense does not see the statement and has no opportunity to present arguments showing prejudice from its withholding.\n\nIn short, only a very strict standard is appropriate for applying the harmless error doctrine in these cases. Under such a standard, I cannot conclude that defense counsel could not have put Miss Vossler's letter to effective use in impeaching her. Although she stated on cross-examination that she had refreshed her memory before testifying by reference to a statement she had made previously, this oral testimony was obviously not as useful for impeachment purposes as her written admission shortly before trial that her memory of the events in question was failing. Defense counsel, if armed with the letter, might well have probed more deeply than he did in testing how her memory of the events to which she testified was refreshed. The trial strategy of defense counsel, familiar with his case and aware of the various possible lines of defense, might have been entirely different had he been in possession of the letter. At least I cannot bring myself to assume that this would not have been the case.\n\nThis is not a case in which the statement erroneously withheld from the defense merely duplicated information \n\n[360 \nU.S. 367, 377]\n\u00a0\n already in the defense's possession;\n*\n it is not a case in which the witness' testimony was unimportant to the proofs necessary for conviction; and it is not a case in which the witness' statement was wholly void of possible use for impeachment. In this case, the defense was denied a letter written by a key government witness shortly before trial making statements which raised serious questions as to her memory of the events about which she testified in considerable detail at the trial. In such a circumstance, I think it was error for the Court of Appeals to second-guess defense counsel as to the possible use of the letter on cross-examination. If we are to be faithful to the standards we have set for ourselves in the administration of criminal justice in the federal courts we must order a new trial in a case such as this where the possible utility to the defense of the erroneously withheld statement cannot be denied. \"The inquiry cannot be merely whether there was enough to support the result, apart from the phase affected by the error. It is rather, even so, whether the error itself had substantial influence. If so, or if one is left in grave doubt, the conviction cannot stand.\" Kotteakos v. United States, \n328 \nU.S. 750, 765\n. (Emphasis supplied.)\n\nI would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] The defense was not given a typed statement signed by Meierdiercks which was discoverable under the statute, but this was harmless error since the defense was given a handwritten statement from which the typed statement had been copied. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 367, 378]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","152":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nS. E. C. v. VARIABLE ANNUITY CO.(1959)\nNo. 290\nArgued: Decided: March 23, 1959\n\n\n\n\n Respondent corporations, calling themselves \"life insurance\" companies and submitting to regulation by the insurance commissioners of the District of Columbia and several States, offer for sale in interstate commerce so-called \"variable annuity\" contracts, which have some of the features of conventional life insurance and annuity contracts but which entitle the purchasers, not to a specified definite amount per annum, but only to fluctuating amounts based upon pro rata participations in respondents' investment portfolios and the gains and losses thereon. Held: Such \"variable annuity\" contracts are \"securities\" which must be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, and the issuers are subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, since such contracts are not \"insurance\" policies or \"annuity\" contracts and respondents are not \"insurance\" companies or engaged in the \"business of insurance,\" within the meaning of the exemption provisions of those Acts or the McCarran-Ferguson Act. Pp. 66-73.\n\n (a) While the States have traditionally regulated the business of insurance, their characterization of particular contracts is not conclusive, since the construction of the exemption provisions of the Federal Acts presents federal questions.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis is an action instituted by the Securities and Exchange Commission\n1\n to enjoin respondents from offering their annuity contracts to the public without registering them under the Securities Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 74, 15 U.S.C. 77a, and complying with the Investment Company Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 789, 15 U.S.C. 80a. The District Court denied relief, 155 F. Supp. 521; and the Court of Appeals affirmed, 103 U.S. App. D.C. 197, 257 F.2d 201. The case is here on petitions for writs of certiorari which we granted, \n358 \nU.S. 812\n, because of the importance of the question presented. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 65, 67]\n\u00a0\n\n\nRespondents are regulated under the insurance laws of the District of Columbia and several other States. It is argued that that fact brings into play the provisions of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 59 Stat. 33, 15 U.S.C. 1011,  2 (b) of which provides that \"No Act of Congress shall be construed to invalidate, impair or supersede any law enacted by any State for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance . . . .\" It is said that the conditions under which that law is applicable are satisfied here. The District of Columbia and some of the States are \"regulating\" these annuity contracts and, if the Commission is right, the Federal Acts would at least to a degree \"supersede\" the state regulations since the Federal Acts prescribe their own peculiar requirements.\n2\n Moreover, \"insurance\" or \"annuity\" contracts are exempt from the Securities Act when \"subject to the supervision of the insurance commissioner . . . of any State . . . .\"\n3\n Respondents are also exempt from the Investment Company Act if they are \"organized as an insurance company, whose primary and predominant business activity is the writing of insurance . . . and which is subject to supervision by the insurance commissioner . . . of a State . . . .\"\n4\n While the term \"security\" as defined in the Securities Act\n5\n is broad enough to include any \n\n[359 \nU.S. 65, 68]\n\u00a0\n \"annuity\" contract, and the term \"investment company\" as defined in the Investment Company Act\n6\n would embrace an \"insurance company,\" the scheme of the exemptions lifts pro tanto the requirements of those two Federal Acts to the extent that respondents are actually regulated by the States as insurance companies, if indeed they are such. The question common to the exemption provisions of the Securities Act and the Investment Company Act and to 2 (b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act is whether respondents are issuing contracts of insurance.\n\nWe start with a reluctance to disturb the state regulatory schemes that are in actual effect, either by displacing them or by superimposing federal requirements on transactions that are tailored to meet state requirements. When the States speak in the field of \"insurance,\" they speak with the authority of a long tradition. For the \n\n[359 \nU.S. 65, 69]\n\u00a0\n regulation of \"insurance,\" though within the ambit of federal power (United States v. Underwriters Assn., \n322 \nU.S. 533\n), has traditionally been under the control of the States.\n\nWe deal, however, with federal statutes where the words \"insurance\" and \"annuity\" are federal terms. Congress was legislating concerning a concept which had taken on its coloration and meaning largely from state law, from state practice, from state usage. Some States deny these \"annuity\" contracts any status as \"insurance.\"\n7\n Others accept them under their \"insurance\" statutes.\n8\n It is apparent that there is no uniformity in the rulings of the States on the nature of these \"annuity\" contracts. In any event how the States may have ruled is not decisive. For, as we have said, the meaning of \"insurance\" or \"annuity\" under these Federal Acts is a federal question.\n\nWhile all the States regulate \"annuities\" under their \"insurance\" laws, traditionally and customarily they have been fixed annuities, offering the annuitant specified and definite amounts beginning with a certain year of his or her life. The standards for investment of funds underlying these annuities have been conservative. The variable annuity introduced two new features. First, premiums collected are invested to a greater degree in common stocks and other equities. Second, benefit payments vary with the success of the investment policy. The first variable annuity apparently appeared in this country about 1952 when New York created the College Retirement Equities Fund\n9\n to provide annuities for teachers. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 65, 70]\n\u00a0\n It came into existence as a result of a search for a device that would avoid paying annuitants in depreciated dollars.\n10\n The theory was that returns from investments in common stocks would over the long run tend to compensate for the mounting inflation. The holder of a variable annuity cannot look forward to a fixed monthly or yearly amount in his advancing years. It may be greater or less, depending on the wisdom of the investment policy. In some respects the variable annuity has the characteristics of the fixed and conventional annuity: payments are made periodically; they continue until the annuitant's death or in case other options are chosen until the end of a fixed term or until the death of the last of two persons; payments are made both from principal and income; and the amounts vary according to the age and sex of the annuitant. Moreover, actuarially both the fixed-dollar annuity and the variable annuity are calculated by identical principles. Each issuer assumes the risk of mortality from the moment the contract is issued. That risk is an actuarial prognostication that a certain number of annuitants will survive to specified ages. Even if a substantial number live beyond their predicted demise, the company issuing the annuity - whether it be fixed or variable - is obligated to make the annuity payments on the basis of the mortality prediction reflected in the contract. This is the mortality risk assumed both by respondents and by those who issue fixed annuities. It is this feature, common to both, that respondents stress when they urge that this is basically an insurance device.\n11\n\u00a0\n\n[359 \nU.S. 65, 71]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe difficulty is that, absent some guarantee of fixed income, the variable annuity places all the investment risks on the annuitant, none on the company.\n12\n The holder gets only a pro rata share of what the portfolio of equity interests reflects - which may be a lot, a little, or nothing. We realize that life insurance is an evolving institution. Common knowledge tells us that the forms have greatly changed even in a generation. And we would not undertake to freeze the concepts of \"insurance\" or \"annuity\" into the mold they fitted when these Federal Acts were passed. But we conclude that the concept of \"insurance\" involves some investment risk-taking on the part of the company. The risk of mortality, assumed here, gives these variable annuities an aspect of insurance. Yet it is apparent, not real; superficial, not substantial. In hard reality the issuer of a variable annuity that has no element of a fixed return assumes no true risk in the insurance sense. It is no answer to say that the risk of declining returns in times of depression is the reciprocal of the fixed-dollar annuitant's risk of loss of purchasing power when prices are high and gain of purchasing power when they are low. We deal with a more conventional concept of risk-bearing when we speak of \"insurance.\" For in common understanding \"insurance\" involves a guarantee that at least some fraction of the benefits will be payable in fixed amounts. See Spellacy v. American Life Ins. Assn., 144 Conn. 346, 354-355, 131 A. 2d 834, 839; Couch, Cyclopedia of Insurance Law, Vol. 1, 25; Richards, Law of Insurance, Vol. 1, 27; Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice, Vol. 1, 81. The companies that issue these annuities take the risk of failure. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 65, 72]\n\u00a0\n But they guarantee nothing to the annuitant except an interest in a portfolio of common stocks or other equities\n13\n - an interest that has a ceiling but no floor.\n14\n\u00a0\n\n[359 \nU.S. 65, 73]\n\u00a0\n There is no true underwriting of risks,\n15\n the one earmark of insurance as it has commonly been conceived of in popular understanding and usage.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., petitioner in No. 237, and the Equity Annuity Life Ins.

Howey Co., \n328 \nU.S. 293, 298\n-299:\n\n\". . . an investment contract for purposes of the Securities Act means a contract, transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party, it being immaterial whether the shares in the enterprise are evidenced by formal certificates or by nominal interests in the physical assets employed in the enterprise.\" See Loss and Cowett, Blue Sky Law (1958), pp. 351, 356-357.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] These companies use an assumed net investment rate of 3 1\/2 percent per annum in the actuarial calculation of the initial annuity payment. If the net investment rate were at all times precisely 3 1\/2 percent, the amount of annuity payments would not vary. But there is no guarantee as to this. The companies use a reporting device, the annuity unit, the value of which informs the annuity holder of the variations in the company's actual returns from the assumed investment rate of 3 1\/2 percent. To state the matter in more detail: the amount of any payment depends on the value of the \"annuity unit\" and the number of such units held by the annuitant. At the time when he has paid all of his premium and is entitled to his first annuity payment, he will have a certain monetary interest in the fund (determined by the number of \"accumulation units\" he holds). The first payment is determined by reference to standard annuity tables, assuming a net investment return of 3 1\/2 percent per annum. It is the amount per month which a capital contribution of the annuitant's interest in the fund by a person of his age and sex would buy. This figure is converted into annuity units by dividing it by the then value of an annuity unit. The number of annuity units held by the annuitant remains constant throughout the payout period.\n\nThe value of an annuity unit is determined each month as follows: The value of the unit for the preceding month is multiplied by the net investment factor (adjusted to neutralize the 3 1\/2 percent interest factor used in the annuity table), which is the sum of one plus the net investment rate. The net investment rate is (after a slight reduction for a margin to cover expenses, and provide for contingency reserves and addition to surplus) the ratio of investment income plus (minus) net realized and unrealized capital gains (losses) less certain \n\n[359 \nU.S. 65, 73]\n\u00a0\n taxes to the value of the fund during that month. The number of annuity units held times the value of each unit in a month produces the annuity payment for that month.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] There is one true insurance feature to some of these policies, though it is ancillary and secondary to the annuity feature. If the applicant is insurable and 60 years of age or under, he gets life insurance on a decreasing basis for a term of five years.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom MR. JUSTICE STEWART joins, concurring.\n\nI join the opinion and judgment of the Court. However, there are additional reasons which lead me to the Court's result, and since the nature of this case lends it to rather extended treatment, I will express these reasons separately.\n\nFirst. The facts of this case are quite complex, but the basic problem involved is much more simple. I will try to point it up before developing the details of the sort of contracts sold by the respondents. It is one of the coverage of two Acts of Congress which concentrated on applying specific forms of regulatory controls to the various ways in which organizations get and administer other people's money - the Securities Act of 1933\n1\n and the Investment Company Act of 1940.\n2\n These Acts were specifically drawn to exclude any \"insurance policy\" and any \"annuity contract\" (Securities Act 3 (a) (8)) \n\n[359 \nU.S. 65, 74]\n\u00a0\n and any \"insurance company\"\n3\n (Investment Company Act 3 (c) (3)) from their coverage. These exclusions were to take effect where the issuer of the policy or contract was subject to the supervision of the state \"insurance commissioner, bank commissioner, or any agency or officer performing like functions\" (Securities Act 3 (a) (8)) or where a company classifiable as an \"insurance company\" was \"subject to supervision by the insurance commissioner or a similar official or agency of a State\" (Investment Company Act 2 (a) (17)). The exclusions left these contracts and companies to the sole control of such state officials. Except for these exclusions, there is little doubt that these contracts and the companies issuing them would be subject to the Federal Acts.\n4\n\u00a0\n\n[359 \nU.S. 65, 75]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhy these exclusions? They could not have been made out of some general desire on the part of Congress to avoid any concurrent regulation by both the Federal Government and the States of investments or companies subject to the two Acts. On the contrary, 18 of the Securities Act and 50 of the Investment Company Act preserve generally the jurisdiction of state officials over their subject matter; the former in terms of \"the jurisdiction of the securities commission (or any agency or office performing like functions) of any State\" and the latter in terms of \"the jurisdiction of any other commission, board, agency, or officer of . . . any State or political subdivision.\" Conversely, of course, however adequately State Securities Commissioners might regulate an investment, it was not for that reason to be freed from federal regulation. Concurrent regulation, then, was contemplated by the Acts as a quite generally prevailing matter. Nor is it rational to assume that Congress thought that any business whatsoever regulated by a specific class of officials, the State Insurance Commissioners, would be for that reason so perfectly conducted and regulated that all the protections of the Federal Acts would be unnecessary. This approach of personally selective deference to the state administrators is hardly to be attributed to Congress. The point must have been that there then was a form of \"investment\" known as insurance (including \"annuity contracts\") which did not present very squarely the sort of problems that the Securities Act and the Investment Company Act were devised to deal with, and which were, in many details, subject to a form of state regulation of a sort which made the federal regulation even less relevant.\n\nAt this time, of course, the sort of \"variable annuity\" contract with which we are concerned in this case did not exist. When Congress made the exclusions provided for in the Acts, it did not make them with the \"variable \n\n[359 \nU.S. 65, 76]\n\u00a0\n annuity\" contract before it. Of course, the point is not that if the insurance industry seeks to retain its exemption, it must limit itself to the forms of policies and contracts in effect in 1933 and 1940. But if a brand-new form of investment arrangement emerges which is labeled \"insurance\" or \"annuity\" by its promoters, the functional distinction that Congress set up in 1933 and 1940 must be examined to test whether the contract falls within the sort of investment form that Congress was then willing to leave exclusively to the State Insurance Commissioners. In that inquiry, an analysis of the regulatory and protective purposes of the Federal Acts and of state insurance regulation as it then existed becomes relevant.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nAt the core of the 1933 Act are the requirements of a registration statement and prospectus to be used in connection with the issuance of \"securities\" - that term being very broadly defined.\n6\n Detailed schedules, set forth \n\n[359 \nU.S. 65, 77]\n\u00a0\n in the Act, list the material that the registration statement and the prospectus are to contain.\n7\n The emphasis is on disclosure; the philosophy of the Act is that full disclosure of the details of the enterprise in which the investor is to put his money should be made so that he can intelligently appraise the risks involved.\n\nThe regulation of life insurance and annuities by the States proceeded, and still proceeds, on entirely different principles. It seems as paternalistic as the Securities Act of 1933 was keyed to free, informed choice. Prescribed contract clauses are ordained legislatively or administratively. Solvency and the adequacy of reserves to meet the company's obligations are supervised by the establishment of permissible categories of investments and through official examination.\n8\n The system does not depend on disclosure to the public, and, once given this form of regulation and the nature of the \"product,\" it might be difficult in the case of the traditional life insurance or annuity contract to see what the purpose of it would be.\n\nThis congressional division of regulatory functions is rational and purposeful in the case of a traditional life insurance or annuity policy, where the obligations of the company were measured in fixed-dollar terms and where the investor could not be said, in any meaningful sense, to be a sharer in the investment experience of the company. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 65, 78]\n\u00a0\n In fact, one of the basic premises of state regulation would appear to be that in one sense the investor in an annuity or life insurance company not become a direct sharer in the company's investment experience; that his investment in the policy or contract be sufficiently protected to prevent this. But the situation changes where the coin of the company's obligation is not money but is rather the present condition of its investment portfolio. To this extent, the historic functions of state insurance regulation become meaningless. Prescribed limitations on investment and examination of solvency and reserves become perfectly circular to the extent that there is no obligation to pay except in terms measured by one's portfolio. But beyond controlling corporate solvency and the adequacy of reserves, and maintaining observance of the legal list of investments, the state plans of regulation do not go in regulating investment policy. Where the nature of the obligation assumed is such, the federally protected interests in disclosure to the investor of the nature of the corporation to whom he is asked to entrust his money and the purposes for which it is to be used become obvious and real. The contract between the investor and the organization no longer squares with the sort of contract in regard to which Congress in 1933 thought its \"disclosure\" statute was unnecessary.\n\nThe provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which passes beyond a simple \"disclosure\" philosophy, also are informed by policies that are very relevant to the contracts involved in this case. While the Act does cover face-amount certificate companies whose obligations are specified in fixed-dollar amounts,\n9\n the majority of its provisions are of greatest regulatory relevance in the case of the much more common sort of \n\n[359 \nU.S. 65, 79]\n\u00a0\n investment company, where the investors (or at least certain categories of them) participate on an \"equity\" basis in the investment experience of the enterprise. Salient regulatory provisions call for registration and recital, by an investment company, of its investment policies and operating practices;\n10\n regulate the relationships between the company and its investment adviser, including fees and provisions for termination of the contract;\n11\n regulate trading practices,\n12\n changes in investment policy,\n13\n the issuance of senior securities,\n14\n proxies and voting trusts,\n15\n the terms of redemption by investors of their interests in the company;\n16\n regulate, in the case of periodic investment plans (which were made subject to special regulation), the \"sales load,\" or amount of the investor's payment that does not become part of his interest in the enterprise;\n17\n and provide for detailed reports to investors.\n18\n While these controls apply in many cases to fixed-dollar obligations, like face-amount certificates and the bonds of closed-end investment companies, they are of particular relevance to situations where the investor is committing his funds to the hands of others on an equity basis, with the view that the funds will be invested in securities and his fortunes will depend on the success of the investment. The traditional state insurance department regulation of contract terms, reserves, solvency, and permissible investments simply does not touch the points of definition of investment policy and investment technique, and control over investment policy changes and over the interests of the men who shape the policies of investment and furnish investment advice that the 1940 Federal Act provides. These controls may be largely irrelevant to traditional banks and insurance companies, which Congress clearly exempted; they were not investing \n\n[359 \nU.S. 65, 80]\n\u00a0\n heavily in equity securities and holding out the possibilities of capital gains through fund management; but where the investor is asked to put his money in a scheme for managing it on an equity basis, it is evident that the Federal Act's controls become vital.\n\nThis is not to say that because subjection of the contracts in question here to federal regulation is desirable, it has in fact been accomplished; but one must apply a test in terms of the purposes of the Federal Acts as a guide to interpreting the scope of an exemption from their coverage for \"insurance.\" Cf. Securities & Exchange Comm'n v. W. J. Howey Co., \n328 \nU.S. 293, 299\n. When Congress passed the Securities Act of 1933 and the Investment Company Act of 1940, no State Insurance Commissioner was, incident to his duties in regulating insurance companies, engaged in the sort of regulation, outlined above as provided in the Federal Acts, that Congress thought would be appropriate for the protection of people entrusting their money to others to be invested on an equity basis. There is no reason to suppose that Congress intended to make an exemption of forms of investment to which its regulatory scheme was very relevant in favor of a form of state regulation which would not be relevant to them at all.\n\nSecond. Much bewilderment could be engendered by this case if the issue were whether the contracts in question were \"really\" insurance or \"really\" securities - one or the other. It is rather meaningless to view the problem as one of pigeonholing these contracts in one category or the other. Obviously they have elements of conventional insurance, even apart from the fixed-dollar term life insurance and the disability waiver of premium insurance sold with some of these contracts (both of which are quite incidental to the main undertaking). They patently contain a significant annuity feature (unless one defines an annuity as a contract necessarily providing fixed-sum payments),\n19\n\u00a0\n\n[359 \nU.S. 65, 81]\n\u00a0\n and the granting of annuities has been considered part of the business of life insurance.\n20\n Of course, some urge that even the traditional annuity has few \"insurance\" features and is basically a form of investment. 1 Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice, 83; Prudential Ins. Co. v. Howell, 29 N. J. 116, 121-122, 148 A. 2d 145, 148. But the point is that, even though these contracts contain, for what they are worth, features of traditional annuity contracts, administering them also involves a very substantial and in fact predominant element of the business of an investment company, and that in a way totally foreign to the business of a traditional life insurance and annuity company, as traditionally regulated by state law. This is what leads to the conclusion that it is not within the intent of the 1933 and 1940 statutes to exempt them.\n\nThe individual deferred variable annuity contract of respondent Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company (VALIC) gives a basis for exploration of this. A sample \n\n[359 \nU.S. 65, 82]\n\u00a0\n contract, given in evidence in the District Court, is one issued to a 35-year-old male, providing for his making 30 annual payments of $1,000 each. Of this, $39.60 is the consideration for an undertaking by the company by which payment of the annual $1,000 is waived in the event of disability. Of the remaining $960.40, designated the \"basic annuity premium,\" specified percentages are used to credit to the account of the investor certain \"accumulation units.\" Of the first year's \"basic annuity premium,\" less than 45% is so used; for the next 4 years, the percentage is in the approximate range of 85% to 87%;\n21\n for years 6 through 10, the figure is 89%, and for the remainder of the 30-year pay-in period it is 92%. Declining term life insurance in a fixed-dollar amount, beginning at five times the annual \"basic annuity premium\" the first year and declining through a period of 5 years to nil, is provided as a benefit over and above the \"accumulation units\" credited to the account of the investor.\n22\n The contract is said to build up a \"cash value\" as the investor's payment \"buys\" further accumulation units, but while the value is one which can and would be finally settled by the payment of dollars, the obligation owed by the company to the investor is not one owed to him in dollar terms. It is one which is measured only in terms of \"units\" - the petitioners suggest a resemblance to \"shares\" - in a portfolio. The units are established by an \n\n[359 \nU.S. 65, 83]\n\u00a0\n arbitrary computation which has the effect of dividing the company's investment assets as of a starting day into a number of units, and assigning to each unit its share of the over-all market value - though the division is not in fact made.\n23\n Then monthly the value of the units is recomputed. This is done, broadly, by taking into account all interest and dividends paid on the company's portfolio and all realized capital gains and losses, with relevant income taxes, together with all unrealized capital shrinkage and increase, less a monthly surcharge of 0.15% (1.8% per annum) of asset value.\n24\n New dollars from investors which \"buy\" units buy them at the new rate, thus preventing dilution, and those investors who draw down their accumulated units receive cash for them at such rate.\n25\n\u00a0\n\n[359 \nU.S. 65, 84]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe contract uses insurance terminology throughout and many of the common features of life insurance and annuity policies are operative in regard to it at this \"pay-in\" stage. There are \"incontestability\" and \"suicide\" clauses (which mainly relate to the term insurance); a \"grace period\" allowed for the payment of premiums; a provision for \"policy loans\" (the drawing down of accumulated units in cash, subject to replacement later to the extent that repayment of the amount of money received will then permit, the transaction bearing a resemblance to the liquidation by a common stock investor of his holdings in anticipation of a \"bear market\"); and provision for a \"cash value\" (that is, for the cashing in of the accumulated units, subject to a surrender charge in the early years). And very certainly the commitment of the \n\n[359 \nU.S. 65, 85]\n\u00a0\n company eventually to disburse the accumulated values on a life annuity basis once the pay-in period is over is present throughout this period. But what the investor is participating in during this period, despite its acknowledged \"insurance\" features, is something quite similar to a conventional open-end management investment company, under a periodic investment plan. The investor's cash (less a charge analogous to a loading charge, which is, at least in the early years, very high, but which, it should be said, has to cover annuity premium taxes and some quite conventional mortality risks) goes to buy \"units\" in a portfolio managed by the persons in control of the corporation. His \"units\" fluctuate with the income and capital gain and loss experience of the management of the portfolio. He may cash them in, wholly or partially. The amount of his equity is subjected to a charge, on asset value, of 1.8% per annum. Except for the temporary term insurance and the waiver of premium coverage, the entire nature of the company's obligation to its investor during this period is not in dollars (though of course it will be converted into them, just as a commodity transaction can be), but solely in terms of the value of its portfolio. In this sort of operation, examination by state insurance officials to determine the adequacy of reserves and solvency becomes less and less meaningful. The disclosure policy of the Securities Act of 1933 becomes, by comparison, more and more relevant. And the detailed protections of the 1940 legislation - disclosure of investment policy, regulation of changes of that policy, of capital structure, conflicts of interest, investment advisers - all become relevant in an acute way here. These are the basic protections that Congress intended investors to have when they put their money into the hands of an investment trust; there is no adequate substitute for them in the traditional regulatory controls administered by state insurance departments, \n\n[359 \nU.S. 65, 86]\n\u00a0\n because these controls are not relevant to the specific regulatory problems of an investment trust.\n26\n\u00a0\n\nThe same conclusions follow from a consideration of the next stage of this contract. Before the maturity date, when the schedule of payments in on the contract ceases and the payments out commence, the investor can draw down his \"units\" in cash, and dispense with all \"annuity\" features. Failing this, he is entitled to elect one of several annuity alternatives. These are, in the sample policy, a straight life annuity on the life of the investor, a straight life annuity with 10 years' payments certain, and a joint and survivor annuity on the life of the investor and another. Again, while the duration of the company's obligation to pay is independent of its investment experience, the amount of each payment is not a direct money obligation but a function of the status of the company's portfolio. The amounts of the payments are calculated in this fashion: The dollar value of the accumulated units credited to the investor throughout the years is \n\n[359 \nU.S. 65, 87]\n\u00a0\n ascertained. A standard annuity table (including a 3 1\/2% interest assumption) is used to determine the dollar amount of the first monthly pay-out, based on a capital contribution of the accumulated amount, under the option selected by the investor. The number of \"annuity units\" (which are functions of the fluctuating asset value of the portfolio of the company) that this amount would buy is computed, and this number of annuity units is paid (transmuted into a varying cash payment) to the investor every subsequent month for the duration of the company's commitment under the option selected. Like that of an \"accumulation unit\" during the pay-in period, the value in dollars of an \"annuity unit\" is readjusted monthly to give effect to the investment income of the securities in the company's portfolio for the period, as well as to capital gains and losses, realized and unrealized. Since the first payment (which forms the basis for measurement of the subsequent payments) contains an assumed interest factor, and since the monthly valuation change includes income items - interest and dividends - received in respect of the company's portfolio, to avoid paying double \"interest\" the 3 1\/2% assumed interest factor is wrung out every month by multiplying the preceding month's valuation by 0.9971.\n27\n And the 1.8% annual surcharge on asset value is applied also.\n28\n\u00a0\n\n[359 \nU.S. 65, 88]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe effect of this is that the investor, during the pay-out period, is in almost every way as much a participant in something equivalent to an investment trust as before. His monthly payment is not really a dollar payment, though it is converted into dollars before it is paid to him; it is a payment in terms of a portfolio of securities. It is true that the company has a fixed obligation to continue payments, and that the duration and the amount of the payments are not affected by collective longevity in excess of the company's assumptions; the company's obligation to continue payments is not limited in any way by reference to the number of units owned by all the investors \n\n[359 \nU.S. 65, 89]\n\u00a0\n at the start of their annuity periods. If the lives of the group of investors exceed the longevity assumptions of the table, the proceeds of what might otherwise have been characterized as a very high \"loading charge\" (8% at its lowest application, with 11% the minimum for the first 10 years) and a substantial \"annual management fee\" (1.8% of asset value annually) will have to provide, with the company's other surplus and capital, enough to continue payments. But the individual payment is still a payment measured basically in the same way as one's interest in an investment trust is measured. And in a very real sense the investor is more vitally interested in the investment experience of the company at this period than he ever was in the pay-in period, and in a way more vitally than any holder of an open-end investment company certificate, or share in a publicly traded closed-end company ever is: he has become completely \"locked in.\" He obviously cannot draw down the present value of his \"units\" once the option to receive annuity payments has been exercised; he cannot \"cash in his chips\" that he bought in the faith of the management of the fund; his rights are technically assignable, but practically unmarketable since they depend on his individual life span. The company can radically change investment policies, change advisers, do whatever it pleases (so long as it does not run afoul of the minimal investment regulations of the State), and there is nothing the contract holder can do about it. It is not rational to say that Congress abandoned the very appropriate protections of the Investment Company Act in this investor's case in favor of provisions of state regulation that are quite irrelevant to the basic problems of protecting him.\n\nThe respondents seek to equate this contract with a fixed-dollar \"participating\" annuity sold by a mutual company, or one sold by a stock company on a participating basis. This contention is not persuasive. While \n\n[359 \nU.S. 65, 90]\n\u00a0\n investment experience in a \"participating\" contract can redound to the benefit of the policyholder, the contracts are sold as fixed-dollar obligations. The \"dividends\" are promoted as such. During the pay-in period, they might be thought of as a reduction of premium.\n29\n They may very well represent favorable mortality risk experience, particularly where the company's investments are conservative. And the annuity-paying insurance company's investments are doubtless administered in the light of the fixed obligation of the company. The company is not committed by its literature to perform part of the job of a common-stock investment trust.\n30\n No one has yet tried to follow the academic suggestion of respondent VALIC, and reduce the fixed guarantee of a traditional life annuity to the point of insignificance and make the rest of the return to the contract holder variable, by selling it on a \"participating\" basis.\n31\n The comparison of the premium cost of such a contract to its fixed return might well make it unsalable to the public. Even more unpersuasive is the respondents' argument that even in a traditional annuity the policyholder bears the investment risk in the sense that he stands the risk of the company's insolvency. The prevention of insolvency \n\n[359 \nU.S. 65, 91]\n\u00a0\n and the maintenance of \"sound\" financial condition in terms of fixed-dollar obligations is precisely what traditional state regulation is aimed at. The protection of share interests in a fluctuating, managed fund has received the attention of specific federal legislation. Both are \"investment risks\" in a sense, but they differ vastly in kind and lend themselves to different regulatory schemes.\n\nAccordingly, while these contracts contain insurance features, they contain to a very substantial degree elements of investment contracts as administered by equity investment trusts. They contain these elements in a way different in kind from the way that insurance and annuity policies did when Congress wrote the exemptions for them in the 1933 Act and the 1940 Act. Since Congress was intending a broad coverage in both these remedial Acts and since these contracts present regulatory problems of the very sort that Congress was attempting to solve by them, I conclude that Congress did not intend to exclude contracts like these by reason of the \"insurance\" exemptions.\n\nThird. The respondents contend that a reversal of the judgment will put them out of business. The reason given is that if the Investment Company Act of 1940 applies to them, they are probably categorizable under it as open-end management companies,\n32\n and it is \n\n[359 \nU.S. 65, 92]\n\u00a0\n declared unlawful by 18 of the Act for an open-end company to have outstanding any \"senior security,\" that is, any security senior to any other class of securities. These companies have capital stock, and the contracts in question would be securities senior to the stock.\n33\n If one assumes that this is correct, there is of course the possibility that the SEC might use its broad dispensing powers in this regard, and in any event, the whole point would be of no concern at all if the contracts in question were issued by mutual companies.\n34\n But in the final analysis, it is not decisive of the issues here that a holding that these contracts \n\n[359 \nU.S. 65, 93]\n\u00a0\n are subject to the Federal Acts might require some modification in the business of issuing them. Since these contracts are in fact covered by the Acts, there can be no reason why their issuers should be able to carry on the investment business in a way which Congress has forbidden.\n\nSimilarly, it may be conceded freely that this form of investment contract may be one of great potential benefit to the public. So, of course, may be orthodox open-end investment trusts, and they clearly are regulated by federal law. In short, notions that this form of arrangement is a desirable one and that it might be well to allow it to exist for a while immune from federal regulation are not relevant to the matter for decision. Congress regulates by general statutes. The passage of a federal regulatory statute is a delicate balancing of many national legislative interests and political forces. Congress need not go through the initial travail of re-enacting its general regulatory scheme every time a new form of enterprise is introduced, if that new form falls within the scheme's coverage. If there is deemed wise any adjustment of the regulatory scheme in the light of new developments in the subject matter to which it extends, Congress may make it.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 48 Stat. 74, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 77a-77aa.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 54 Stat. 789, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 80a-1 to 80a-52.\n\nThe Court's opinion makes it clear why the issue is identical under the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 59 Stat. 33, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 1011-1015.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Defined as a \"company which is organized as an insurance company, whose primary and predominant business activity is the writing of insurance or the reinsuring of risks underwritten by insurance companies, and which is subject to supervision by the insurance commissioner or a similar official or agency of a State . . . .\" Investment Company Act 2 (a) (17). The business of the respondents here consists solely of issuing contracts of the nature of those in question here.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Under the Securities Act, it would appear that in the case of the ordinary insurance policy, the exemption would be just confirmatory of the policy's noncoverage under the definition of security. See H. R. Rep. No. 85, 73d Cong., 1st Sess. 15. The status of an ordinary annuity contract might be different. But, in any event, absent the specific insurance exclusion, it would appear that the variable annuity contract would come under the term \"investment contract\" or possibly \"certificate of interest or participation in any profit-sharing agreement\" in the definition of security, 2 (1). On the other hand, even an ordinary insurance company might be an investment company within the meaning of 3 (a) (1) and 3 (a) (3) of the Investment Company Act, were it not for the specific exemption. The Chief Counsel of the SEC's Investment Trust Study testified that the specific exemption was necessary in the light of the definition. See Hearings before Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency on S. 3580, 76th Cong., 3d Sess. 181. A fortiori a company issuing the sort of contracts in question here would be included if there were no question of the insurance exemption.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] No subsequent development in state insurance regulation appears to have occurred which would better adapt the system to regulation of companies performing the functions of investment trusts; but of course, in any event, the issue is the scope of state regulation in 1933 and 1940. The basic patterns do not appear to have changed and present-day regulation (apart from any measures which may have been taken specifically to deal with the contracts in question) can be examined to see the sort of regulation that Congress was deferring to in the Acts.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] \". . . any note, stock, treasury stock, bond, debenture, evidence of indebtedness, certificate of interest or participation in any profit-sharing agreement, collateral-trust certificate, preorganization certificate or subscription, transferable share, investment contract, voting-trust certificate, certificate of deposit for a security, fractional undivided interest in oil, gas, or other mineral rights, or, in general, any interest or instrument commonly known as a `security,' or any certificate of interest or participation in, temporary or interim certificate for, receipt for, guarantee of, or warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing.\" Securities Act 2 (1), 15 U.S.C. 77 (b) (1).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Securities Act 7 and 10 and Schedules A and B.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] A leading text on life insurance outlines the areas of state life insurance regulation as follows: the establishment of a standard of solvency for the setting up of minimum reserves; the organization of domestic companies and the admission of foreign insurers; the rendition of annual statements and the making (frequently on a cooperative basis among the States) of periodic examinations; overseeing the equitable treatment of policyholders by prescribing contract terms and checking misrepresentation, discrimination, rebating and \"twisting\"; licensing and regulating the conduct of agents; and supervision of investments in accord with a statutory permissive list. Huebner and Black, Life Insurance (5th ed. 1958), pp. 518-524.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] See 3 (a) (2). Specific regulatory provisions for this sort of company are found in 28.

See Spellacy v. American Life Ins. Assn., 144 Conn. 346, 355, 131 A. 2d 834, 839. In any event, these contracts are annuities, \"life annuities,\" in the sense that they provide for payments at periodic intervals for a period measured by a human life or lives, with the payments representing both an income element and a liquidation of contributed capital, with no further return of the investor's capital after the annuity period runs. Cf. Heubner and Black, op. cit., supra, at 99-100. Of course, there are annuity contracts which provide payments only for terms of years. See Vance, Insurance (3d ed. 1951), p. 1020. These have no mortality factor, and, it would appear, no insurance element at all. One of the alternative settlement options under one respondent's policies is a \"variable\" form of such an arrangement.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] State statutes make it clear that the writing of traditional annuities is part of the usual business of life insurance companies. See, e. g., Cal. Insurance Code 101; Conn. Gen. Stat., 1949, c. 295, 6144; Smith-Hurd Ill. Ann. Stat., Tit. 73, 616; N. Y. Insurance Law, 46, 190. Cf. Huebner and Black, op. cit., supra, at 92; Mehr and Osler, Modern Life Insurance (rev. ed. 1956), pp. 69-70.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 21\n] The precise percentages are: first year, 44.79%; second, 85.27%; third, 85.82%; fourth, 86.45%; fifth, 87.17%. The pattern for the second through fifth years would appear to reflect the diminishing cost of declining term insurance sold as part of the contract.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 22\n] The cost of such insurance, bought separately, would be about 2% of the first 5-years' pay-ins. Longer terms than the 5-year are available. The contract is sold without term life insurance and without waiver of premium on disability to persons who are deemed \"uninsurable.\" The fixed-dollar term insurance and the disability waiver risks of VALIC are heavily reinsured in orthodox insurance companies.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 23\n] Even before there are contract holders, a \"unit\" is set up in terms of the then value of the company's investment portfolio. While the number of units credited to investors does not accordingly account for the entire value of the \"fund,\" the value of the units fluctuates as the value of the company's investment portfolio fluctuates in the same fashion as if they were shares in an open-end investment fund.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 24\n] The surcharge is accounted for in the same way as that part of the premium gross income that does not go toward the crediting of accumulation units. The analogy is to an annual \"management fee\" in an investment trust. Of course, the surcharge is not in fact paid to anyone as a fee for any specific purpose; but to the extent that it is made, a portion of the company's assets is freed from being charged with the valuation of units credited to investors. To this extent, the company's assets become available for the payment of expenses, for the satisfaction of its obligations in the event the investors as a group outlive their tabular expectancy, and for dividends to common stockholders.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 25\n] A concrete example of a few years' hypothetical experience during the pay-in period may illustrate the workings of these contracts. It is based on the specific contract described in the text.\n\nAssume a unit value of $1 at the start of the contract. The investor's first annual payment of $1,000, less the disability waiver premium and the \"loading charge,\" buys 430 units at the $1 rate.\n\nAssume a favorable year in the company's portfolio's market performance; net capital gains (realized and unrealized) of 15% and \n\n[359 \nU.S. 65, 84]\n\u00a0\n interest and dividends of 3% of original value, all net of income taxes. On the average asset value at month ends during the year, the 1.8% annual charge would come to about 2% of original value. This would make the value of a unit after a year about $1.16.\n\nOf the second annual premium of $1,000, $819 goes toward buying 706 units at the new rate of $1.16. Thus after the second annual premium, the investor has 1,136 units to his credit.\n\nAssume a very favorable second year in the market, with net capital gains of 25% of the year's beginning value (29 cents a unit) and income items of 5% of beginning value (about 6 cents a unit), all net of income taxes. The annual charge of 1.8% will come to about 2.4 cents per unit, and the resulting value at year end will be about $1.49 per unit.\n\nOf the third annual premium of $1,000, $824 goes toward buying 553 units at the new rate of $1.49. Thus after the third annual premium, the investor has 1,689 units to his credit.\n\nAssume a bear market the third year, with a 12% net capital shrinkage in the company's portfolio (about 18 cents a unit) and income at 2% of beginning value (3 cents a unit), all net of income taxes. The 1.8% charge would come to about 2.5 cents a unit. These adjustments would give a year end unit value of about $1.31 a unit.\n\nIf instead of going on with the contract, the investor then \"cashed in his chips,\" he would get $2,212.59 for his 1,689 units, less a $10 surrender charge.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 26\n] The least-subtle example of the absent protections is that regarding investment policy. The state investment lists are minima; within the limits of the lists, the companies have very broad discretion in making investments, see Mehr and Osler, op. cit., supra, at 612, and there appears to be no control at all over their changing their investment policies. The difference in emphasis between the two forms of regulation and the obvious correspondence of the contract in question with an investment trust in this essential regulatory matter hardly needs underscoring.\n\nEven the minimal controls over investment policy furnished by the prescribed lists are administered primarily by one State, the State of incorporation. New York's Insurance Law, 90, applying in terms the local controls, at least \"in substance,\" to foreign companies doing business within the State, appears the exception rather than the rule. See Vance, op. cit., supra, at 43. Other States insist on their own requirements as to part of the assets of a foreign insurance company doing a local business. See Cal. Insurance Code 1153. Some States explicitly make some deference to the State of incorporation. See Smith-Hurd Ill. Ann. Stat., Tit. 73, 723 (e).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 27\n] The reciprocal of 1.000 plus monthly interest at the rate of 3 1\/2% per annum.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 28\n] A concrete hypothetical example of the workings of the contract in the pay-out period may be useful. Assume that the investor described in the text and in footnote 25 did not cash in his contract, but kept it during the entire 30-year pay-in period. Assume that he has accumulated, through premium-payment \"purchases\" at varying prices throughout the years, 14,000 units and that the value of a unit has mounted to $3 over the years. The investor can now take his $42,000 in cash, if he chooses. But let us assume that he is healthy and without dependents, so that he is moved to elect the option of a straight life annuity. This capital contribution of $42,000 by a 65-year-old \n\n[359 \nU.S. 65, 88]\n\u00a0\n male would buy a fixed-dollar annuity of $286 a month. This is in fact what our investor will get the first month. But this first monthly payment will be used to fix the number of annuity units he will receive monthly for the rest of his life.\n\nAssume that the value at this time of an annuity unit is $2. (While the value of an annuity unit tends to move in the same direction as the value of an accumulation unit, it differs from it because every month it is multiplied by 0.9971 to \"wring out\" the assumed interest factor in the annuity table. So over the years, the current values of the two sorts of units will drift apart, even though they move the same way with the fluctuations of the company's portfolio.) At the $2 rate, the first monthly payment is 143 units, and this number of units will be paid the investor monthly for life.\n\nAssume that there is a sharp break in the market during the first month of the pay-out period. (Actually, there is a one-month lag in computation, but for the purposes of demonstration this can be ignored.) Suppose this market break shrinks the capital value of the company's portfolio by 8% (16 cents a unit). Assume income items during the month at 3% per annum (0.5 cents). Then deduct the omnipresent 1.8% annual charge (0.3 cents). This puts the current value at $1.842; the 0.9971 multiplier must be applied to wring out the interest assumption in the annuity table. This gives an adjusted value of $1.8367. The investor is then paid, for his second monthly payment, 143 units at this new rate, or $262.65.\n\nThe recomputation of the unit value takes place monthly, and every month the investor is paid 143 units at the new rate, whatever this may come to in dollars.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 29\n] See Mehr and Osler, op. cit., supra, at 583; cf. Fuller v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 70 Conn. 647, 666, 41 A. 4, 11.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 30\n] In the traditional form of insurance, the appreciation potential of common stocks is said not to be the predominant reason for an insurer's investing in them. While many States allow investment in them in varying degrees, commentators emphasize that the purpose of such investment is primarily diversification of investment; in certain industries, common stock may be the only sort of available investment. Huebner and Black, op. cit., supra, at 505. Of course, the primary investment aim of the traditional insurer is preservation of dollar capital with income. Id., at 507.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 31\n] VALIC's hypothetical is an annuity based on an investment return of 1\/2% per annum and an average mortality at 110 years.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 32\n] According to 5, \"`Open-end company' means a management company [i. e., an investment company other than a unit investment trust or a face-amount certificate company, 4] which is offering for sale or has outstanding any redeemable security of which it is the issuer.\" The redeemability of these contracts during the pay-in period would appear to make their issuer come under this definition. Even if the companies were considered closed-end companies, they argue that other provisions of 18 would pose very difficult problems for them. See 18 (a).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 33\n] The companies say that this is because their contracts are debt obligations. It is quite doubtful whether the contracts can be described as debts; certainly they are not much more of a debt than a redeemable share in an orthodox open-end company is; here the redemption feature is expressed in outright redeemability during the pay-in period and in liquidation on an annuity basis in the pay-out period. But in any event, whether the contracts are debts or not, they have priority over the companies' stock, and the provisions dealing with senior securities would appear to cover them.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 34\n] The most basic purpose of the provision might be viewed by the SEC as the protection, in the case of the traditional open-end company, of the investment certificate holders from the creation of securities senior to their interests (as well as preventing, in the interest of their purchasers, the creation of a class of \"senior\" securities which would be senior only to freely redeemable junior securities). Since it is the senior securities here which are the analogs of open-end investment trust certificates, quite the contrary situation might be thought to be presented. The SEC's dispensing authority in regard to the Investment Company Act is found in 6 (c), which provides: \"The Commission, by rules and regulations upon its own motion, or by order upon application, may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities, or transactions, from any provision or provisions of this title or of any rule or regulation thereunder, if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of this title.\"\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, MR. JUSTICE CLARK and MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER join, dissenting.\n\nThe issue in these cases is whether Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company of America (VALIC) and The Equity Annuity Life Insurance Company (EALIC) are subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Investment Company Act of 1940 with respect to their variable annuity business. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 65, 94]\n\u00a0\n\n\nSection 3 (a) (8) of the Securities Act, 48 Stat. 74, 76, 15 U.S.C. 77c (a) (8), provides that the statute shall not apply to:\n\n \"Any insurance or endowment policy or annuity contract or optional annuity contract, issued by a corporation subject to the supervision of the insurance commissioner, bank commissioner, or any agency or officer performing like functions, of any State or Territory of the United States or the District of Columbia.\"\n\n\n Section 3 (c) (3) of the Investment Company Act, 54 Stat. 789, 798, 15 U.S.C. 80a-3 (c) (3), puts outside the coverage of the Act \"[a]ny . . . insurance company,\" and 2 (a) (17), 54 Stat. 789, 793, 15 U.S.C. 80a-2 (a) (17), defines an insurance company as:\n\n \"a company which is organized as an insurance company,  whose primary and predominant business  activity is the writing of insurance or the reinsuring  of risks underwritten by insurance companies, and  which is subject to supervision by the insurance commissioner  or a similar official or agency of a State;  or any receiver or similar official or any liquidating  agent for such a company, in his capacity as such.\"\n\n\n These two insurance companies are organized under the Life Insurance Act of the District of Columbia, 35 D.C. Code, 1951, 35-301 to 35-803, and are subject to regulation by the Superintendent of Insurance of the District of Columbia, who has approved the annuity policies written by them. At the time of trial VALIC had also qualified to do business in Arkansas, Kentucky, and West Virginia, and its annuity policies had likewise been approved by the insurance departments of those States.\n1\n Both companies in the District of Columbia, \n\n[359 \nU.S. 65, 95]\n\u00a0\n and VALIC in the other States, offer their policies to the public only through insurance agents duly licensed by the local insurance authority.\n\nVariable annuity policies are a recent development in the insurance business designed to meet inflationary trends in the economy by substituting for annuity payments in fixed-dollar amounts payments in fluctuating amounts, measured ultimately by the company's success in investing the premium payments received from annuitants. One of the early pioneers in this field was Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, a New York regulated life insurance organization engaged in selling annuities to college personnel. The Association in 1950 made exhaustive studies into the feasibility and soundness of variable annuities. Two years later, it incorporated College Retirement Equities Fund, a companion company under joint management with Teachers Insurance, which, subject to regulation under the New York Insurance Law, commenced offering such annuity contracts in the teaching profession.\n2\n The first life insurance company to offer such contracts generally appears to have been the Participating Annuity Life Insurance Company, which since 1954 has been selling variable annuity policies under the supervision of the Arkansas insurance authorities. VALIC and EALIC entered the field in 1955 and 1956 respectively.\n\nThe characteristics of a typical variable annuity contract have been adumbrated by the majority. It is sufficient to note here that, as the majority concludes, as the two lower courts found, and as the SEC itself recognizes, it may fairly be said that variable annuity contracts contain both \"insurance\" and \"securities\" features. It is \n\n[359 \nU.S. 65, 96]\n\u00a0\n certainly beyond question that the \"mortality\" aspect of these annuities - that is the assumption by the company of the entire risk of longevity - involves nothing other than classic insurance concepts and procedures, and I do not understand how that feature can be said to be \"not substantial,\" determining as it does, apart from options, the commencement and duration of annuity payments to the policyholder. On the other hand it cannot be denied that the investment policies underlying these annuities, and the stake of the annuitants in their success or failure, place the insurance company in a position closely resembling that of a company issuing certificates in a periodic payment investment plan. Even so, analysis by fragmentization is at best a hazardous business, and in this instance has, in my opinion, led the Court to unsound legal conclusions. It is important to keep in mind that these are not cases where the label \"annuity\" has simply been attached to a securities scheme, or where the offering companies are traveling under false colors, in an effort to avoid federal regulation. The bona fides of this new development in the field of insurance is beyond dispute.\n\nThe Court's holding that these two companies are subject to SEC regulation stems from its preoccupation with a constricted \"color matching\" approach to the construction of the relevant federal statutes which fails to take adequate account of the historic congressional policy of leaving regulation of the business of insurance entirely to the States. It would be carrying coals to Newcastle to re-examine here the history of that policy which was fully canvassed in the several opinions of the Justices in United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Assn., \n322 \nU.S. 533\n, and which was again implicitly recognized by this Court as recently as last Term when, in Federal Trade Comm'n v. National Casualty Co., \n357 \nU.S. 560\n, we declined to give a niggardly construction to the McCarran \n\n[359 \nU.S. 65, 97]\n\u00a0\n Act. Suffice it to say that in consequence of this Court's decision 90 years ago in Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, and the many cases following it,\n3\n there had come to be \"widespread doubt\" prior to the time the Securities and Investment Company Acts were passed \"that the Federal Government could enter the field [of insurance regulation] at all.\" Wilburn Boat Co. v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co., \n348 \nU.S. 310, 318\n; see also Prudential Ins. Co. v. Benjamin, \n328 \nU.S. 408, 414\n.\n\nI can find nothing in the history of the Securities Act of 1933 which savors in the slightest degree of a purpose to depart from or dilute this traditional federal \"hands off\" policy respecting insurance regulation. On the contrary, the exemption of insurance from that Act, which is couched in the broadest terms, reflected not merely adherence to tradition but also compliance with a supposed command of the Constitution. In a study of the proposed Act, the Department of Commerce concluded that the legislation could be bottomed on the federal power over commerce because securities did have the independent general commercial existence and value which the Paul decision had found lacking in insurance policies. See A Study of the Economic and Legal Aspects of the Proposed Federal Securities Act, reprinted in Hearings before Senate Committee on Banking and Currency on S. 875, 73d Cong., 1st Sess. 312, at 330, and in Hearings before House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce on H. R. 4314, 73d Cong., 1st Sess. 87, at 105. This distinction between securities and insurance, mistaken or not, underlay the passage of the final bill. When the proposed act was considered by the Senate and House Committees, it did not contain an express exemption of \n\n[359 \nU.S. 65, 98]\n\u00a0\n insurance. The House Committee explained that the exemption in the final bill ( 3 (a) (8) of the Act):\n\n\"makes clear what is already implied in the act, namely, that insurance policies are not to be regarded as securities subject to the provisions of the act. The insurance policy and like contracts are not regarded in the commercial world as securities offered to the public for investment purposes. The entire tenor of the act would lead, even without this specific exemption, to the exclusion of insurance policies from the provisions of the act, but the specific exemption is included to make misinterpretation impossible.\" H. R. Rep. No. 85, 73d Cong., 1st Sess. 15.\n\n\n That this distinction stemmed from the feared implications of the Paul decision appears from the House debates. See 73d Cong., 1st Sess., 77 Cong. Rec. 2936, 2937, 2938, 2946. Moreover, two days after the Senate began consideration of the proposed act, Senator Robinson introduced a resolution (S. J. Res. 51) calling for a constitutional amendment because, in his view, \"the National Government at present has no authority whatever over insurance companies.\" 73d Cong., 1st Sess., 77 Cong. Rec. 3109.\n\nSimilarly, I can find nothing in the history of the Investment Company Act of 1940 which points in any way to a change in federal policy on this score. Here tradition, perhaps more than constitutional doubt, explains the exemption of insurance companies from the Act. In hearings before the House Committee, Commissioner Healy of the SEC discussed the \"face-amount installment certificates\" issued by certain investment companies and often \"sold on the basis of the comparison with savings bank deposits and insurance policies.\" The major factor appearing to distinguish these investment \n\n[359 \nU.S. 65, 99]\n\u00a0\n companies from insurance companies for purposes of federal control was the strict state regulation present over insurance policies but absent over investment certificates. Hearings before House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce on H. R. 10065, 76th Cong., 3d Sess. 61-62. Likewise, in the Senate debates, preservation of state regulation over insurance companies appears as the crucial factor distinguishing them from investment trusts. 76th Cong., 3d Sess., 86 Cong. Rec. 10070. Stating that \"the bill has nothing to do with the regulation of insurance companies,\" Senator Byrnes went on to say: \"The platforms of both political parties have urged supervision of insurance by the several States, but not regulation by the Federal Government.\" Id., at 10071. See also United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Assn., supra, at 584, 591-592, n. 12 (dissenting opinion).\n\nIn 1944, this Court removed the supposed constitutional basis for exemption of insurance by holding, in United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Assn., supra, that the business of insurance was subject to federal regulation under the commerce power. Congress was quick to respond. It forthwith enacted the McCarran Act, 59 Stat. 33, 15 U.S.C. 1011-1015, which on its face demonstrates the purpose \"broadly to give support to the existing and future state systems for regulating and taxing the business of insurance,\" Prudential Ins. Co. v. Benjamin, supra, at 429, and \"to assure that existing state power to regulate insurance would continue.\" Wilburn Boat Co. v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co., supra, at 319. Thus, rather than encouraging Congress to enter the field of insurance, the South-Eastern decision spurred reiteration of its undeviating policy of abstention.\n\nIn this framework of history the course for us in these cases seems to me plain. We should decline to admit the SEC into this traditionally state regulatory domain. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 65, 100]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdmittedly the variable annuity was not in the picture when the Securities and Investment Company Acts were passed. It is a new development combining both substantial insurance and securities features in an experiment designed to accommodate annuity insurance coverage to contingencies of the present day economic climate.\n4\n This, however, should not be allowed to obscure the fact that Congress intended when it enacted these statutes to leave the future regulation of the business of insurance wholly with the States. This intent, repeatedly expressed in a history of which the Securities and Investment Company Acts were only a part, in my view demands that bona fide experiments in the insurance field, even though a particular development may also have securities aspects, be classed within the federal exemption of insurance, and not within the federal regulation of securities.\n5\n Certainly these statutes breathe no notion of concurrent regulation by the SEC and state insurance authorities. The fact that they do not serves to reinforce the view that the congressional exemption of insurance was but another manifestation of the historic federal policy leaving regulation of the business of insurance exclusively to the States.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nIt is asserted that state regulation, as it existed when the Securities and Investment Company Acts were passed, \n\n[359 \nU.S. 65, 101]\n\u00a0\n was inadequate to protect annuitants against the risks inherent in the variable annuity and that therefore such contracts should be considered within the orbit of SEC regulation. The Court is agreed that we should not \"freeze\" the concept of insurance as it then existed. By the same token we should not proceed on the assumption that the thrust of state regulation is frozen. As the insurance business develops new concepts the States adjust and develop their controls. This is in the tradition of state regulation and federal abstention. If the innovation of federal control is nevertheless to be desired, it is for the Congress, not this Court, to effect.\n\nI would affirm.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Since the trial VALIC has also qualified in Alabama and New Mexico, and EALIC in North Dakota.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] By the end of 1956 the College Retirement Fund had issued such annuities to more than 31,000 individuals, and the value of its annuity units had increased from $10 to $18.51.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The cases are collected in United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Assn., supra, at 544, n. 18.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See Morrissey, Dispute Over the Variable Annuity, 35 Harv. Bus. Rev. 75 (1957).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] It is worth observing that in reporting the proposed Securities Act of 1933 the House Committee stated that insurance policies \"and like contracts\" were to be exempt from federal regulation. See ante, p. 98.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] In contrast, 18 of the Securities Act, 48 Stat. 74, 85, 15 U.S.C. 77r, provides that the Act shall not affect the jurisdiction of state securities commissions, thus recognizing a system of dual regulation where the exemptive provisions are not applicable. The Investment Company Act has a similar provision, 50. 54 Stat. 789, 846, 15 U.S.C. 80a-49. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 65, 102]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","153":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nS. W. SUGAR CO. v.

With him on the brief was Clem H. Sehrt.\n\nSelim B. Lemle argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was Carl G. Stearns.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nOn September 24, 1944, the barge Peter B, carrying a cargo of molasses, sank in 30 feet of water at dockside in Texas City, Texas. Although the barge was eventually raised, the cargo, allegedly valued at some $26,000, was largely or totally lost.\n\nPetitioner, Southwestern Sugar & Molasses Co., charterer of the barge and owner of the cargo, filed a libel against respondent, River Terminals Corporation, a water carrier certificated under Part III of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. 901 et seq., seeking recovery of damages for the loss of cargo and for expenses occasioned in the raising and repair of the barge, which had been towed by respondent from Reserve, Louisiana, to Texas City and there berthed. The District Court first tried the issue of liability, separating the question of damages for subsequent determination, and held that the barge had sunk and the cargo had been lost as a result of respondent's negligence in the navigation or management of the tow and that respondent was liable for all damage to the cargo and for the cost of raising and repairing the barge.\n1\n 153 F. Supp. 923. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 411, 413]\n\u00a0\n\n\nRespondent appealed from the interlocutory decree adjudging liability, 28 U.S.C. 1292 (3), urging that the trial court had erred in holding (1) that petitioner had an interest in the Peter B sufficient to entitle it to maintain a libel for damage thereto, (2) that the sinking of the barge and loss of cargo were due to respondent's negligence, (3) that 3 of the Harter Act\n2\n did not establish respondent's freedom from liability as a matter of law, and (4) that certain provisions in tariffs filed by respondent with the Interstate Commerce Commission, which purported to release respondent from liability for its negligence, and which were assumed by the District Court to have been applicable to the transportation here involved, were invalid as a matter of law and constituted no defense to the libel.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nThe Court of Appeals did not consider any of the first three claims of error, although if sustained they would wholly have disposed of the case. Instead, the court directed its attention to respondent's contention that the exculpatory clause in respondent's tariff, incorporated by \n\n[360 \nU.S. 411, 414]\n\u00a0\n reference in the bill of lading issued in connection with the transportation, must be given effect. The court concluded that because the clause was embodied in a tariff filed with the I. C. C. it could not in the first instance declare it invalid, but was bound to give it effect unless and until the Commission, after appropriate investigation, reached a contrary conclusion.\n4\n Accordingly, it reversed the judgment of the District Court \"in order to afford . . . [petitioner] reasonable opportunity to seek administrative action before the Commission to test the validity of the challenged provision, otherwise to give full effect to the exculpatory clause . . . .\" 253 F.2d 922.\n\nPetitioner sought certiorari, contending that the refusal of the Court of Appeals to strike down the exculpatory clause as a matter of law was contrary to the decision of this Court in Bisso v. Inland Waterways Corporation, \n349 \nU.S. 85\n, where it was held that a clause in a private contract of towage purporting altogether to exculpate the tug from liability for its own negligence was void as against public policy. We granted the writ. \n358 \nU.S. 811\n.\n\nAt the outset, we hold that the Court of Appeals erred in ordering what was in substance a referral of the issue of the validity of the exculpatory clause to the Commission without first passing on the other claims of error tendered by respondent below. As we have noted, those other claims, if accepted, would have required a reversal of the judgment of the District Court and the entry of judgment for respondent. The case had been fully argued before the Court of Appeals, and those claims were plainly ripe for decision. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 411, 415]\n\u00a0\n\n\nUnder these circumstances, we think that sound and expeditious judicial administration should have led the Court of Appeals not to leave these issues undecided while a course was charted requiring the institution and litigation of an altogether separate proceeding before the I. C. C. - a proceeding which might well assume substantial dimensions - to test the sufficiency of only one of respondent's several defenses. If in consequence of findings made by the Commission in such a proceeding it should be determined that the exculpatory clause cannot be given effect, the Court of Appeals would then have to decide the very questions which it can now decide without the necessity for any collateral proceeding. Conversely, a present ruling on those other questions might entirely obviate the necessity for proceedings in the Commission which would further delay the final disposition of this already protracted litigation. We conclude, therefore, that the Court of Appeals should have passed upon those issues as to which the expert assistance of the I. C. C. is concededly not appropriate, before invoking the processes of the Commission.\n\nDespite the fact that disposition of respondent's other claims by the Court of Appeals may ultimately render moot the question of the validity of the exculpatory clause as a defense in the circumstances of this case, we deem it appropriate now to review the holding of that court that the exculpatory clause was not void as a matter of law. Were the Court of Appeals on remand to decide the other questions tendered by respondent adversely to it, it would otherwise then be necessary for petitioner once more to seek review here on this very question. The issue is one of importance in the development of the law maritime, as to which we have large responsibilities, constitutionally conferred; it is squarely presented on the record before us; and the exigencies of this litigation clearly \n\n[360 \nU.S. 411, 416]\n\u00a0\n call for its resolution at this stage. Accordingly, to this question we now turn.\n\nIn Bisso this Court held that a towboat owner might not, as a defense to a suit alleging loss due to negligent towage, rely on a contractual provision which purported to exempt the towboat altogether from liability for negligent injury to its tow. There a barge, while being towed on the Mississippi River by a steam towboat under a private towage contract, was caused by the negligence of those operating the towboat to collide with a bridge pier and sink. The Court reviewed prior cases in the field, and concluded that the conflict of decision found in those cases should be resolved by declaring private contractual provisions of the kind there involved altogether void as contrary to \"public policy.\" The Court relied on \"two main reasons\" for its conclusion, (1) that such a rule was necessary \"to discourage negligence,\" and (2) that the owner of the tow required protection from \"others who have power to drive hard bargains.\" As was pointed out explicitly in a concurring opinion, the Court's decision was perforce reached without consideration of particularized economic and other factors relevant to the organization and operation of the tugboat industry.\n\nPetitioner argues that Bisso is dispositive of this case, on the theory that an inherently illegal condition gains nothing from being filed as part of a tariff with the Commission.\n5\n We think that this reasoning begs the true \n\n[360 \nU.S. 411, 417]\n\u00a0\n question here presented, which is whether considerations of public policy which may be called upon by courts to strike down private contractual arrangements between tug and tow are necessarily applicable to provisions of a tariff filed with, and subject to the pervasive regulatory authority of, an expert administrative body. In Bisso the clause struck down was part of a contract over the terms of which the I. C. C., the body primarily charged by Congress with the regulation of the terms and conditions upon which water carriers subject to its jurisdiction shall offer their services, had no control. In the present case the courts below have assumed, and petitioner does not challenge, the applicability to the transportation which resulted in loss to petitioner of a duly filed tariff containing this exculpatory clause.\n\nIn these circumstances we would be moving too fast were we automatically to extend the rule of Bisso to govern the present case.\n6\n For all we know, it may be that \n\n[360 \nU.S. 411, 418]\n\u00a0\n the rate specified in the relevant tariff is computed on the understanding that the exculpatory clause shall apply to relieve the towboat owner of the expense of insuring itself against liability for damage caused tows by the negligence of its servants, and is a reasonable rate so computed. If that were so, it might be hard to say that public policy demands that the tow should at once have the benefit of a rate so computed and be able to repudiate the correlative obligation of procuring its own insurance with knowledge that the towboat may be required to respond in damages for any injury caused by its negligence despite agreement to the contrary. For so long as the towboat's rates are at all times subject to regulatory control, prospectively and by way of reparation, the possibility of an overreaching whereby the towboat is at once able to exact high rates and deny the liabilities which transportation at such rates might be found fairly to impose upon it can be aborted by the action of the I. C. C. The rule of Bisso, however applicable where the towboat owner has \"the power to drive hard bargains,\" may well call for modification when that power is effectively controlled by a pervasive regulatory scheme.\n7\n\u00a0\n\n[360 \nU.S. 411, 419]\n\u00a0\n\n\nFurther, it may be noted that the clause relied on in this case is by its terms restricted to the situation where shipments are transported in barges furnished by others than the towboat owner. Whatever may be the considerations involved in forbidding a towboat to contract for exemption from liability for negligence in other circumstances, it may be that different considerations apply when the towboat moves barges which are delivered to it loaded, so that it never has an opportunity adequately to inspect them below the waterline, and which, if defective, may create emergency situations where a small degree of negligence can readily lead to very substantial monetary loss.\n8\n If the peculiar hazards involved in towing a barge supplied by the shipper are great, and the methods of guarding against those hazards uncertain, it may be that in an area where Congress has not, expressly or by fair implication, declared for a particular result, the federal courts should creatively exercise their responsibility for the development of the law maritime to \n\n[360 \nU.S. 411, 420]\n\u00a0\n fashion a particularized rule to deal with particularized circumstances.\n9\n\u00a0\n\nWe may assume that the question whether a clause of this kind offends against public policy is one appropriate ultimately for judicial rather than administrative resolution. But that does not mean that the courts must therefore deny themselves the enlightenment which may be had from a consideration of the relevant economic and other facts which the administrative agency charged with regulation of the transaction here involved is peculiarly well equipped to marshal and initially to evaluate. As was said in Far East Conference v. United States, \n342 \nU.S. 570, 574\n-575, this Court has frequently recognized and applied\n\n\". . . a principle, now firmly established, that in cases raising issues of fact not within the conventional experience of judges or cases requiring the exercise of administrative discretion, agencies created by Congress for regulating the subject matter should not be passed over. This is so even though the facts after they have been appraised by specialized competence \n\n[360 \nU.S. 411, 421]\n\u00a0\n serve as a premise for legal consequences to be judicially defined. Uniformity and consistency in the regulation of business entrusted to a particular agency are secured, and the limited functions of review by the judiciary are more rationally exercised, by preliminary resort for ascertaining and interpreting the circumstances underlying legal issues to agencies that are better equipped than courts by specialization, by insight gained through experience, and by more flexible procedure.\"\n\n\n We hold that the Court of Appeals correctly ruled that the exculpatory clause here at issue should not be struck down as a matter of law, and that the parties should be afforded a reasonable opportunity to obtain from the I. C. C., in an appropriate form of proceeding, a determination as to the particular circumstances of the tugboat industry which lend justification to this form of clause, if any there be, or which militate toward a rule wholly invalidating such provisions regardless of the fact that the carrier which seeks to invoke them is subject to prospective and retrospective rate regulation. \"Cases are not decided, nor the law appropriately understood, apart from an informed and particularized insight into the factual circumstances of the controversy under litigation.\" Federal Maritime Board v. Isbrandtsen Co., \n356 \nU.S. 481, 498\n. This principle has particular force when the courts are asked to strike down on grounds of public policy a contractual arrangement on its face consensual.\n\nThe case is remanded to the Court of Appeals with instructions to pass upon the first three assignments of error specified by respondent in its appeal from the judgment of the District Court. Should resolution of those issues not dispose of the case, the Court of Appeals is directed to remand the case to the District Court with instructions to hold it in abeyance while the parties seek \n\n[360 \nU.S. 411, 422]\n\u00a0\n the views of the I. C. C., in any form of proceeding which that body may deem appropriate, as to the circumstances bearing on the validity of respondent's exculpatory clause in the context of this litigation, and for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n    It is so ordered.\n\n\n THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS believe that the rule of law announced in Bisso should not be changed by the Interstate Commerce Commission, and would therefore reverse this judgment.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The District Court found that the sinking of the Peter B was occasioned by the shipping of water through a crack in the starboard shell plate of one of its cargo tanks which had been discovered by petitioner's local manager while the barge was being loaded with molasses under his supervision, and that respondent's employees were negligent in various respects in failing to take proper precautions to avoid the sinking after it should have become evident that the barge was shipping water.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 46 U.S.C. 192: \"If the owner of any vessel transporting merchandise or property to or from any port in the United States of America shall exercise due diligence to make the said vessel in all respects seaworthy and properly manned, equipped, and supplied, neither the vessel, her owner or owners, agent, or charterers, shall become or be held responsible for damage or loss resulting from faults or errors in navigation or in the management of said vessel . . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The pertinent provisions of the tariff provided:\n\n\"When shipments are transported in barges furnished by owners, shippers, consignees or parties other than the Carriers parties to this Tariff, such barges and (or) cargoes will be handled at owner's risk only, whether loss or damage is caused by negligence or otherwise.\n\n.  .  .  .  .\n\n\n\n\"Presentation of a shipment in barge furnished by shipper, consignee or owner for movement on rates named herein shall constitute a guarantee to the Carriers parties to this Tariff that such barge is seaworthy and barge and cargo are in suitable condition for voyage in prospect. . . .\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] In reaching this conclusion the court relied on \"the rule frequently stated by the Supreme Court that `Until changed, tariffs bind both carriers and shippers with the force of law.' Lowden v. Simonds-Shields-Lonsdale Grain Co., \n306 \nU.S. 516, 520\n . . .; Crancer v. Lowden, \n315 \nU.S. 631, 635\n . . . .\" 253 F.2d 922, 925.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Compare Boston & Maine R. Co. v. Piper, \n246 \nU.S. 439, 445\n, where this Court held a limitation of liability clause void although filed as part of a tariff with the I. C. C. by a rail carrier, saying that: \"While this provision was in the bill of lading, the form of which was filed with the Railroad Company's tariffs with the Interstate Commerce Commission, it gains nothing from that fact. The legal conditions and limitations in the carrier's bill of lading duly filed with the Commission are binding until changed by that body [citation] . . . but not so of conditions and limitations which are, as is this \n\n[360 \nU.S. 411, 417]\n\u00a0\n one, illegal, and consequently void.\" The decisive difference between Piper and this case is that there the exculpatory clause was specifically declared illegal by the Interstate Commerce Act itself. See 49 U.S.C. 20 (11).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] It may be noted that the tug-tow relationship has not been assimilated by the law to that between a common carrier and shipper so far as liability is concerned. See, e. g., The Steamer Syracuse, 12 Wall. 167. Thus although at common law a common carrier was liable, without proof of negligence, for all damage to the goods transported by it, unless it affirmatively showed that the damage was occasioned by the shipper, acts of God, the public enemy, public authority, or the inherent vice or nature of the commodity, Secretary of Agriculture v. United States, \n350 \nU.S. 162, 165\n, n. 9, and cases cited, the District Court in the present case held that respondent could not be held liable in the absence of its negligence and petitioner did not assail that determination on appeal.\n\nPart III of the Interstate Commerce Act has made tugboats common carriers for regulatory purposes under certain circumstances. See Cornell Steamboat Co. v. United States, \n321 \nU.S. 634\n. Section \n\n[360 \nU.S. 411, 418]\n\u00a0\n 320 (d) of that Act, 49 U.S.C. 920 (d), explicitly provides, however, that the statute is not to be construed to affect \"liabilities of vessels and their owners for loss or damage . . . .\" The settled commonlaw rule that common carriers may not \"by any form of agreement secure exemption from liability for loss or damage caused by their own negligence,\" Sun Oil Co. v. Dalzell Towing Co., \n287 \nU.S. 291, 294\n; Railroad Co. v. Lockwood, 17 Wall. 357; Liverpool & G. W. Steam Co. v. Phenix Ins. Co., \n129 \nU.S. 397\n, thus has no application here.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Under Part III of the Interstate Commerce Act all \"common carriers by water\" as therein defined (see 49 U.S.C. 902 (d) are required to file with the Commission and keep open to public inspection \"tariffs showing all rates, fares, charges, classifications, rules, regulations, and practices for the transportation . . . of . . . property\" and stating \"any rules or regulations which in anywise \n\n[360 \nU.S. 411, 419]\n\u00a0\n change, affect, or determine any part of the aggregate of such rates, fares, or charges, or the value of the service rendered to the passenger, shipper, or consignee.\" 49 U.S.C. 906 (a). Contract carriers are subject to similar requirements. 49 U.S.C. 906 (e). The Commission may suspend newly filed tariffs while it investigates them, 49 U.S.C. 907 (g), (i), and may at any time initiate an investigation, upon complaint or on its own initiative, into the reasonableness of filed tariffs. 49 U.S.C. 907 (b), (h).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] It is of course open to the I. C. C. to consider any other factors which it may deem relevant to the question of the propriety of exculpatory clauses in regulated towage tariffs, such as the availability to shippers of arrangements whereby use of the tower's barge, or payment of a higher alternative rate, results in an assumption by the tower of liability for its negligence, and the relative practicality and cost of the securing of insurance against the kind of risk here involved by shipper and by tower. We do not intimate any view as to the relative weight of the factors herein mentioned.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Congress has in some instances declared by statute the circumstances under which carriers may contract for release from or limitation of liability, or rules governing the liability or exemption from liability of carriers irrespective of contract. See 46 U.S.C. 181-196, 1300-1315 (water carriers); 49 U.S.C. 20 (11), 319 (rail and motor carriers). Where such statutes apply of course no agreement in derogation of them, even if embodied in a tariff, is valid. See, e. g., Adams Express Co. v. Croninger, \n226 \nU.S. 491\n; Boston & Maine R. Co. v. Piper, supra.\n\nAs we have noted above, respondent claims that 3 of the Harter Act, 46 U.S.C. 192, applies to exempt it from liability in this case irrespective of the effect given its tariff exculpatory clause. Be that as it may, the cited provision is ample demonstration that there is no general congressional policy requiring water carriers to be held liable for damage caused by the negligence of their servants in all cases. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 411, 423]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","154":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSAFEWAY STORES v. OKLAHOMA GROCERS(1959)\nNo. 252\nArgued: May 19, 1959Decided: June 22, 1959\n\n\n\n\n Under the Oklahoma Unfair Sales Act, a State Court enjoined appellant from selling at retail any items of merchandise at prices less than statutory cost, even though some of appellant's competitors were selling below cost at prices appellant either knew or had reason to know were illegal. The Oklahoma Court also refused to enjoin certain of appellant's competitors from giving away trading stamps with goods sold at or near statutory cost, and enjoined appellant from reducing its prices below cost to meet that competition. Held: The Oklahoma Unfair Sales Act, as construed and applied in this case, does not transgress the Equal Protection or Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Pp. 334-342.\n\n 322 P.2d 178, affirmed.\n\nRamsey Clark argued the cause for appellant. With him on the brief were V. P. Crowe, Robert L. Clark and William L. Keller.\n\nSamuel M. Lane argued the cause for appellees. With him on the brief were W. J. Holloway, Sr., M. A. Ned Looney and Robert P. Beshar.\n\nMac Q. Williamson, Attorney General of Oklahoma, filed a brief, as amicus curiae, urging affirmance.\n\nChester Inwald filed a brief for the National Association of Tobacco Distributors, Inc., as amicus curiae, urging affirmance.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis is a suit for an injunction, brought in a state court in Oklahoma by appellee, Oklahoma Retail Grocers Association, against appellant, Safeway Stores, for selling several \n\n[360 \nU.S. 334, 335]\n\u00a0\n specified items of retail grocery merchandise below \"cost\" in violation of the Oklahoma Unfair Sales Act. Okla. Stat. tit. 15, 598.1-598.11 (1951). Section 598.3 of the Act provides:\n\n \"It is hereby declared that any advertising, offer to sell, or sale of any merchandise, either by retailers or wholesalers, at less than cost as defined in this Act with the intent and purpose of inducing the purchase of other merchandise or of unfairly diverting trade from a competitor or otherwise injuring a competitor, impair and prevent fair competition, injure public welfare, are unfair competition and contrary to public policy and the policy of this Act, where the result of such advertising, offer or sale is to tend to deceive any purchaser or prospective purchaser, or to substantially lessen competition, or to unreasonably restrain trade, or to tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce.\"\n\n\n The elements of \"cost\" are enumerated in other sections of the statute. Safeway defended on the ground, inter alia, that its reductions were permitted by 598.7 of the Unfair Sales Act which allows \"any retailer or wholesaler\" to\n\n\". . . advertise, offer to sell, or sell merchandise at a price made in good faith to meet the price of a competitor who is selling the same article or products of comparable quality at cost to him as a wholesaler or retailer.\"\n\n\n Safeway by cross-petition sought to enjoin several named members of appellee Association, including Speed, alleging that they were selling below cost in violation of the Act. The trial court, with some qualification, granted the injunction against Safeway and denied relief against appellees. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Oklahoma affirmed, 322 P.2d 179, and since the constitutionality of \n\n[360 \nU.S. 334, 336]\n\u00a0\n the state statute was challenged under the Fourteenth Amendment, we noted probable jurisdiction, \n358 \nU.S. 807\n, and brought the case here under 28 U.S.C. 1257 (2).\n\nSafeway makes two main claims.\n\n1. Safeway justified cutting prices below cost in some cities by claiming it was to meet the prices of some of its competitors who were also selling below cost. The statute allows a reduction below cost only when it is a good faith meeting of the competition of a seller who is selling at his own cost. The trial court found that Safeway's reductions violated the Act, and that Safeway could not avail itself of the statutory defense of meeting competition since its reductions were not in good faith but were made to meet prices Safeway \"either knew or had reason to know were illegal . . . .\" The court enjoined Safeway from\n\n\". . . selling, at retail, any items of merchandise . . . at prices which are less than cost to the retailer as defined in the Oklahoma `Unfair Sales Act' and in violation of the provisions of said `Unfair Sales Act', except to meet in good faith the prices of competitors who are selling the same articles or products of comparable quality at cost to them as retailers as defined in the Oklahoma `Unfair Sales Act', and except in instances of other exempted sales as provided in Section 598.6 of said Oklahoma `Unfair Sales Act.'\"\n\n\n The injunction, phrased substantially in the terms of the statute, allows Safeway to meet the prices of competitors who are selling \"at cost to them\" if the other requisites of the good faith defense are met. Appellant claims that this injunction deprives it of a constitutional right to compete since it forbids meeting the prices of competitors who are selling below cost. There is no constitutional \n\n[360 \nU.S. 334, 337]\n\u00a0\n right to employ retaliation against action outlawed by a State. Safeway, the Oklahoma court held, had ample means, under the state statute, to enjoin the illegal methods of its competitors. It had no constitutional right to embark on the very kind of destructive price war the Act was designed to prevent.\n\nAppellant also claims that there are situations in which a competitor might reduce his prices below cost without violating the Act, and hence, under the injunction, Safeway would have no remedy whatsoever since it could not retaliate in kind and judicial relief would not be available. The conclusive answer to this claim is that it is not before us for adjudication. The court below found that Safeway was meeting prices it \"knew or had reason to know\" were illegal. It then phrased its injunction in the terms of a statute which has yet to be construed in the abstract circumstances presented by appellant. The Oklahoma Supreme Court carefully noted that it was interpreting the Unfair Sales Act as applied to the particular facts of this case, pointing out that \"until a proper factual case is presented which requires a clear determination and offers a practical situation in which all the conflicting problems and considerations of the area involved are apparent, this court will refrain from theorizing.\" 322 P.2d, at 181. If this is a rule of wise restraint for the courts of Oklahoma in this situation, it clearly bars constitutional adjudication here.\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[360 \nU.S. 334, 338]\n\u00a0\n\n\n2. Appellant's second contention involves its competitors' use of trading stamps. Trading stamps, it hardly needs to be stated, are, generally speaking, coupons given by dealers to retail purchasers on the basis of the dollar value of the items purchased, e. g., one stamp for each ten cents' worth of goods, and are collected by the purchaser until he has enough to redeem for various items of merchandise. Trading stamps have had a checkered career in the United States, but since World War II their popularity has grown until now it is a reasonable estimate that these multi-colored scraps of paper may be found in almost half of America's homes.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nWhen this suit was brought Safeway did not use trading stamps. In the Oklahoma City-Midwest City area several of its competitors did. These stamps were deemed to be worth approximately 2.5 percent of the price of the goods with which they were given. Safeway contended in the Oklahoma courts that giving a trading stamp with goods sold at or near the statutory minimum resulted in an unlawful reduction below \"cost\" to the extent of the value of the trading stamp. To be specific, if an item sold for $1, and that price was statutory cost, the trading stamps given with it would be worth approximately 2.5 \n\n[360 \nU.S. 334, 339]\n\u00a0\n cents and the net price was therefore $.975, or 2.5 cents below cost. Safeway sought to restrain its competitors from selling below cost in this manner and also claimed that it was justified, in order to meet competition, in reducing its prices to the net of its competitors' prices, taking into account the value of trading stamps. The Oklahoma court found that the giving of trading stamps with items sold at or near statutory cost was not a violation of the statute and denied Safeway's request for an injunction. The court also decided that Safeway could not reduce its prices to meet the trading stamp competition. It did, however, provide that Safeway could do what appellees did, it might issue \"trading stamps, cash register receipts, or other evidence of credit issued as a discount for prompt payment of cash . . .,\" as long as the value of the discount did not exceed three percent.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nSafeway contends that such a construction of the Unfair Sales Act violates the Fourteenth Amendment. Appellant claims that even though the State may prohibit sales below \"cost,\" it is barred from allowing a merchant to give trading stamps with goods sold at or near \"cost,\" unless it allows competing merchants to make an equivalent price reduction. For the State to differentiate between the use of trading stamps and price-cutting is, so the argument runs, a constitutionally inadmissible discrimination.\n4\n\u00a0\n\n \"It would be an idle parade of familiar learning to review the multitudinous cases in which the constitutional assurance of the equal protection of the \n\n[360 \nU.S. 334, 340]\n\u00a0\n laws has been applied. The generalities on this subject are not in dispute; their application turns peculiarly on the particular circumstances of a case.\" Goesaert v. Cleary, \n335 \nU.S. 464, 467\n.\n\n\n The Oklahoma court decided that, although price cuts below cost were prohibited by the statute, the use of trading stamps was not a price reduction but constituted a cash discount, i. e., a reduction given to customers for prompt payment of cash. Opposing expert accountants sustained and rejected the validity of such a difference. In matters of this sort we might content ourselves in resting on the clash of expert opinion to show that the Oklahoma decision was not wanting in a foundation that may not unjustifiably have commended itself as a state policy. However, we may note some readily apparent differences between the practices which support the State's differentiation and thereby the power asserted by the State.\n\nTrading stamps are given to cash customers \"across the board,\" namely, the number of stamps varies directly with the total cost of goods purchased. Safeway's price-cutting, however, was selective. This difference is vital in the context of this Act. One of the chief aims of state laws prohibiting sales below cost was to put an end to \"loss-leader\" selling. The selling of selected goods at a loss in order to lure customers into the store is deemed not only a destructive means of competition; it also plays on the gullibility of customers by leading them to expect what generally is not true, namely, that a store which offers such an amazing bargain is full of other such bargains.\n5\n Clearly there is a reasonable basis for a conclusion that selective price cuts tend to perpetuate this abuse whereas the use of trading stamps does not. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 334, 341]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThis difference alone would be enough to require affirmance. It is reinforced by other tenable grounds for distinction. There was a basis in evidence for the view that the use of trading stamps has an entirely different impact on the consuming market than do price cuts. When prices are the same customers tend to go to the store offering trading stamps. But when prices are cut to the extent of the value of the trading stamp the stamps lose their lure and lower prices prove a more potent attraction. On the basis of this not unreasonable belief as to the economics of the highly competitive, low-profit-margin retail-grocery business, Oklahoma could well have concluded that its choice was to provide that all use a cash discount system or none could do so.\n6\n Such a view of the economic aspects of the problem affords an ample basis for the legislative judgment enforced by the court below.\n\nCertainly this Court will not interpose its own economic views or guesses when the State has made its choice.\n\n\"The Fourteenth Amendment enjoins the `equal protection of the laws,' and laws are not abstract propositions. They do not relate to abstract units A, B, and C, but are expressions of policy arising out of specific difficulties, addressed to the attainment of specific ends by the use of specific remedies. The Constitution does not require things which are different in fact or opinion to be treated in law as though they were the same.\" Tigner v. Texas, \n310 \nU.S. 141, 147\n. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 334, 342]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n We are not concerned with the soundness of the distinctions drawn. It is enough that it is open to Oklahoma to believe them to be valid as the basis of a policy for its people.\n7\n\u00a0\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE CLARK took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Oklahoma Supreme Court said:\n\n\"In this connection our attention has been called to the recent case (10-4-57) of State by Clark v. Wolkoff, Minn., 85 N. W. 2d 401, 403, wherein it was held that `(I)f a merchant in good faith sets the price of an article on the basis of a competitor's price, which price he in good faith believes to be a legal price, there is no violation,' which clearly is not the case herein. In the instant case, Safeway obviously and admittedly did not, in good faith, set the price of its articles which were subject to the Unfair Sales Act on the basis of its competitors' prices, which it in good faith believed to be legal prices \n\n[360 \nU.S. 334, 338]\n\u00a0\n under the Unfair Sales Act, but on the contrary it set illegal prices for the sole purpose of meeting prices of its competitors, which it thought to be illegal.\" 322 P.2d, at 181.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The latest chapter in trading stamp history was recounted in The [London] Economist for May 30, 1959, at p. 850:\n\n\"In Colorado a proposal to tax the stamps brought battalions of housewives to the state capital. One of its original sponsors changed his mind when his own mother threatened to campaign against his re-election if he did not alter his stand. The newest twist to the trading stamp story is that they can now be exchanged, in the East, for a theatre seat, even, after July 12th, for one for `My Fair Lady.' This will take, however, the stamps accumulated on nearly $700 worth of purchases - about what it costs to feed a family for five months.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Safeway, in fact, did offer its own cash discount coupons during the course of this litigation.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] This Court in other contexts has upheld, against a challenge based on the Fourteenth Amendment, state tax laws which discriminated against the use of trading stamps. Rast v. Van Deman & Lewis Co., \n240 \nU.S. 342\n; Tanner v. Little, \n240 \nU.S. 369\n; Pitney v. Washington, \n240 \nU.S. 387\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] See the article by Mr. Brandeis, as he then was, in the November 15, 1913 issue of Harper's Weekly, at p. 10.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] This would come about if the dealer using trading stamps were allowed to meet the lowered price, or if, by being required to drop trading stamps, the other dealer were forced to raise prices. It is conceivable that a mathematical formula might be developed to equalize the use of trading stamps and price cuts. But certainly the Constitution does not place such a complex and, at best, uncertain and speculative burden on the States.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Appellant also claims that the Oklahoma law is pre-empted by federal antitrust laws.

JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case is before us for the second time. The present litigation began with a dispute between the petitioning unions and respondents, co-partners in the business of selling lumber and other materials in California. Respondents began an action in the Superior Court for the County of San Diego, asking for an injunction and damages. Upon hearing, the trial court found the following facts. In March of 1953 the unions sought from respondents an agreement to retain in their employ only those workers who were already members of the unions, or who applied for membership within thirty days. Respondents refused, claiming that none of their employees had shown a desire to join a union, and that, in any event, they could not accept such an arrangement until one of the unions had been designated by the employees as a collective bargaining agent. The unions began at once peacefully to picket the respondents' place of business, and to exert pressure on customers and suppliers in order to persuade them to stop dealing with respondents. The sole purpose of these pressures was to compel execution of the proposed contract. The unions contested this finding, claiming that the only purpose of their activities was to educate the workers and persuade them to become members. On the basis of its findings, the court enjoined the unions from picketing and from the use of other pressures to force an agreement, until one of \n\n[359 \nU.S. 236, 238]\n\u00a0\n them had been properly designated as a collective bargaining agent. The court also awarded $1,000 damages for losses found to have been sustained.\n\nAt the time the suit in the state court was started, respondents had begun a representation proceeding before the National Labor Relations Board. The Regional Director declined jurisdiction, presumably because the amount of interstate commerce involved did not meet the Board's monetary standards in taking jurisdiction.\n\nOn appeal, the California Supreme Court sustained the judgment of the Superior Court, 45 Cal. 2d 657, 291 P.2d 1, holding that, since the National Labor Relations Board had declined to exercise its jurisdiction, the California courts had power over the dispute. They further decided that the conduct of the union constituted an unfair labor practice under 8 (b) (2) of the National Labor Relations Act, and hence was not privileged under California law. As the California court itself later pointed out this decision did not specify what law, state or federal, was the basis of the relief granted. Both state and federal law played a part but, \"[a]ny distinction as between those laws was not thoroughly explored.\" Garmon v. San Diego Bldg. Trades Council, 49 Cal. 2d 595, 602, 320 P.2d 473, 477.\n\nWe granted certiorari, \n351 \nU.S. 923\n, and decided the case together with Guss v. Utah Labor Relations Board, \n353 \nU.S. 1\n, and Amalgamated Meat Cutters v. Fairlawn Meats, Inc., \n353 \nU.S. 20\n. In those cases, we held that the refusal of the National Labor Relations Board to assert jurisdiction did not leave with the States power over activities they otherwise would be pre-empted from regulating. Both Guss and Fairlawn involved relief of an equitable nature. In vacating and remanding the judgment of the California court in this case, we pointed out that those cases controlled this one, \"in its major aspects.\" \n353 \nU.S., at 28\n. However, since it was not clear whether the \n\n[359 \nU.S. 236, 239]\n\u00a0\n judgment for damages would be sustained under California law, we remanded to the state court for consideration of that local law issue. The federal question, namely, whether the National Labor Relations Act precluded California from granting an award for damages arising out of the conduct in question, could not be appropriately decided until the antecedent state law question was decided by the state court.\n\nOn remand, the California court, in accordance with our decision in Guss, set aside the injunction, but sustained the award of damages. Garmon v. San Diego Bldg. Trades Council, 49 Cal. 2d 595, 320 P.2d 473 (three judges dissenting). After deciding that California had jurisdiction to award damages for injuries caused by the union's activities, the California court held that those activities constituted a tort based on an unfair labor practice under state law. In so holding the court relied on general tort provisions of the California Civil Code, 1677, 1708, as well as state enactments dealing specifically with labor relations, Calif. Labor Code, 923 (1937); ibid., 1115-1118 (1947).\n\nWe again granted certiorari, \n357 \nU.S. 925\n, to determine whether the California court had jurisdiction to award damages arising out of peaceful union activity which it could not enjoin.\n\nThe issue is a variant of a familiar theme. It began with Allen-Bradley v. Wisconsin Board, \n315 \nU.S. 740\n, was greatly intensified by litigation flowing from the Taft-Hartley Act, and has recurred here in almost a score of cases during the last decade. The comprehensive regulation of industrial relations by Congress, novel federal legislation twenty-five years ago but now an integral part of our economic life, inevitably gave rise to difficult problems of federal-state relations. To be sure, in the abstract these problems came to us as ordinary questions of statutory construction. But they involved a more complicated \n\n[359 \nU.S. 236, 240]\n\u00a0\n and perceptive process than is conveyed by the delusive phrase, \"ascertaining the intent of the legislature.\" Many of these problems probably could not have been, at all events were not, foreseen by the Congress. Others were only dimly perceived and their precise scope only vaguely defined. This Court was called upon to apply a new and complicated legislative scheme, the aims and social policy of which were drawn with broad strokes while the details had to be filled in, to no small extent, by the judicial process. Recently we indicated the task that was thus cast upon this Court in carrying out with fidelity the purposes of Congress, but doing so by giving application to congressional incompletion. What we said in Weber v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., \n348 \nU.S. 468\n, deserves repetition, because the considerations there outlined guide this day's decision:\n\n  \"By the Taft-Hartley Act, Congress did not exhaust  the full sweep of legislative power over industrial  relations given by the Commerce Clause. Congress  formulated a code whereby it outlawed some  aspects of labor activities and left others free for the  operation of economic forces. As to both categories,  the areas that have been pre-empted by federal  authority and thereby withdrawn from state power  are not susceptible of delimitation by fixed metes and  bounds. Obvious conflict, actual or potential, leads  to easy judicial exclusion of state action. Such was  the situation in Garner v. Teamsters Union, supra.  But as the opinion in that case recalled, the Labor  Management Relations Act `leaves much to the  states, though Congress has refrained from telling us  how much.' \n346 \nU.S., at 488\n. This penumbral  area can be rendered progressively clear only by the  course of litigation.\" \n348 \nU.S., at 480\n-481. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 236, 241]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The case before us concerns one of the most teasing and frequently litigated areas of industrial relations, the multitude of activities regulated by 7 and 8 of the National Labor Relations Act. 61 Stat. 140, 29 U.S.C. 157, 158. These broad provisions govern both protected \"concerted activities\" and unfair labor practices. They regulate the vital, economic instruments of the strike and the picket line, and impinge on the clash of the still unsettled claims between employers and labor unions. The extent to which the variegated laws of the several States are displaced by a single, uniform, national rule has been a matter of frequent and recurring concern. As we pointed out the other day, \"the statutory implications concerning what has been taken from the States and what has been left to them are of a Delphic nature, to be translated into concreteness by the process of litigating elucidation.\" International Assn. of Machinists v. Gonzales, \n356 \nU.S. 617, 619\n.\n\nIn the area of regulation with which we are here concerned, the process thus described has contracted initial ambiguity and doubt and established guides for judgment by interested parties and certainly guides for decision. We state these principles in full realization that, in the course of a process of tentative, fragmentary illumination carried on over more than a decade during which the writers of opinions almost inevitably, because unconsciously, focus their primary attention on the facts of particular situations, language may have been used or views implied which do not completely harmonize with the clear pattern which the decisions have evolved. But it may safely be claimed that the basis and purport of a long series of adjudications have \"translated into concreteness\" the consistently applied principles which decide this case.\n\nIn determining the extent to which state regulation must yield to subordinating federal authority, we have \n\n[359 \nU.S. 236, 242]\n\u00a0\n been concerned with delimiting areas of potential conflict; potential conflict of rules of law, of remedy, and of administration. The nature of the judicial process precludes an ad hoc inquiry into the special problems of labor-management relations involved in a particular set of occurrences in order to ascertain the precise nature and degree of federal-state conflict there involved, and more particularly what exact mischief such a conflict would cause. Nor is it our business to attempt this. Such determinations inevitably depend upon judgments on the impact of these particular conflicts on the entire scheme of federal labor policy and administration. Our task is confined to dealing with classes of situations. To the National Labor Relations Board and to Congress must be left those precise and closely limited demarcations that can be adequately fashioned only by legislation and administration. We have necessarily been concerned with the potential conflict of two law-enforcing authorities, with the disharmonies inherent in two systems, one federal the other state, of inconsistent standards of substantive law and differing remedial schemes. But the unifying consideration of our decisions has been regard to the fact that Congress has entrusted administration of the labor policy for the Nation to a centralized administrative agency, armed with its own procedures, and equipped with its specialized knowledge and cumulative experience:\n\n  \"Congress did not merely lay down a substantive  rule of law to be enforced by any tribunal competent  to apply law generally to the parties. It went on to  confide primary interpretation and application of its  rules to a specific and specially constituted tribunal  and prescribed a particular procedure for investigation,  complaint and notice, and hearing and decision,  including judicial relief pending a final administrative  order. Congress evidently considered that  centralized administration of specially designed procedures \n\n[359 \nU.S. 236, 243]\n\u00a0\n  was necessary to obtain uniform application  of its substantive rules and to avoid these diversities  and conflicts likely to result from a variety of local  procedures and attitudes towards labor controversies. . . .  A multiplicity of tribunals and a diversity  of procedures are quite as apt to produce incompatible  or conflicting adjudications as are different rules  of substantive law. . . .\" Garner v. Teamsters  Union, \n346 \nU.S. 485, 490\n-491.\n\n\n Administration is more than a means of regulation; administration is regulation. We have been concerned with conflict in its broadest sense; conflict with a complex and interrelated federal scheme of law, remedy, and administration. Thus, judicial concern has necessarily focused on the nature of the activities which the States have sought to regulate, rather than on the method of regulation adopted. When the exercise of state power over a particular area of activity threatened interference with the clearly indicated policy of industrial relations, it has been judicially necessary to preclude the States from acting.\n1\n However, due regard for the presuppositions of our embracing federal system, including the principle of diffusion of power not as a matter of doctrinaire localism but as a promoter of democracy, has required us not to find withdrawal from the States of power to regulate where the activity regulated was a merely peripheral concern of the Labor Management Relations Act. See International \n\n[359 \nU.S. 236, 244]\n\u00a0\n Assn. of Machinists v. Gonzales, \n356 \nU.S. 617\n. Or where the regulated conduct touched interests so deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility that, in the absence of compelling congressional direction, we could not infer that Congress had deprived the States of the power to act.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nWhen it is clear or may fairly be assumed that the activities which a State purports to regulate are protected by 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, or constitute an unfair labor practice under 8, due regard for the federal enactment requires that state jurisdiction must yield. To leave the States free to regulate conduct so plainly within the central aim of federal regulation involves too great a danger of conflict between power asserted by Congress and requirements imposed by state law. Nor has it mattered whether the States have acted through laws of broad general application rather than laws specifically directed towards the governance of industrial relations.\n3\n Regardless of the mode adopted, to allow the States to control conduct which is the subject of national regulation would create potential frustration of national purposes.\n\nAt times it has not been clear whether the particular activity regulated by the States was governed by 7 or 8 or was, perhaps, outside both these sections. But courts are not primary tribunals to adjudicate such issues. It is essential to the administration of the Act that these determinations be left in the first instance to the National \n\n[359 \nU.S. 236, 245]\n\u00a0\n Labor Relations Board. What is outside the scope of this Court's authority cannot remain within a State's power and state jurisdiction too must yield to the exclusive primary competence of the Board. See, e. g., Garner v. Teamsters Union, \n346 \nU.S. 485\n, especially at 489-491; Weber v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., \n348 \nU.S. 468\n.\n\nThe case before us is such a case. The adjudication in California has throughout been based on the assumption that the behavior of the petitioning unions constituted an unfair labor practice. This conclusion was derived by the California courts from the facts as well as from their view of the Act. It is not for us to decide whether the National Labor Relations Board would have, or should have, decided these questions in the same manner. When an activity is arguably subject to 7 or 8 of the Act, the States as well as the federal courts must defer to the exclusive competence of the National Labor Relations Board if the danger of state interference with national policy is to be averted.\n\nTo require the States to yield to the primary jurisdiction of the National Board does not ensure Board adjudication of the status of a disputed activity. If the Board decides, subject to appropriate federal judicial review, that conduct is protected by 7, or prohibited by 8, then the matter is at an end, and the States are ousted of all jurisdiction. Or, the Board may decide that an activity is neither protected nor prohibited, and thereby raise the question whether such activity may be regulated by the States.\n4\n However, the Board may also fail to determine the status of the disputed conduct by declining to assert jurisdiction, or by refusal of the General Counsel to file \n\n[359 \nU.S. 236, 246]\n\u00a0\n a charge, or by adopting some other disposition which does not define the nature of the activity with unclouded legal significance. This was the basic problem underlying our decision in Guss v. Utah Labor Relations Board, \n353 \nU.S. 1\n. In that case we held that the failure of the National Labor Relations Board to assume jurisdiction did not leave the States free to regulate activities they would otherwise be precluded from regulating. It follows that the failure of the Board to define the legal significance under the Act of a particular activity does not give the States the power to act. In the absence of the Board's clear determination that an activity is neither protected nor prohibited or of compelling precedent applied to essentially undisputed facts, it is not for this Court to decide whether such activities are subject to state jurisdiction. The withdrawal of this narrow area from possible state activity follows from our decisions in Weber and Guss. The governing consideration is that to allow the States to control activities that are potentially subject to federal regulation involves too great a danger of conflict with national labor policy.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nIn the light of these principles the case before us is clear. Since the National Labor Relations Board has not adjudicated the status of the conduct for which the State of California seeks to give a remedy in damages, and since such activity is arguably within the compass of 7 or 8 of the Act, the State's jurisdiction is displaced.\n\nNor is it significant that California asserted its power to give damages rather than to enjoin what the Board may restrain though it could not compensate. Our concern is with delimiting areas of conduct which must be free from state regulation if national policy is to be left unhampered. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 236, 247]\n\u00a0\n Such regulation can be as effectively exerted through an award of damages as through some form of preventive relief. The obligation to pay compensation can be, indeed is designed to be, a potent method of governing conduct and controlling policy. Even the States' salutary effort to redress private wrongs or grant compensation for past harm cannot be exerted to regulate activities that are potentially subject to the exclusive federal regulatory scheme. See Garner v. Teamsters Union, \n346 \nU.S. 485, 492\n-497. It may be that an award of damages in a particular situation will not, in fact, conflict with the active assertion of federal authority. The same may be true of the incidence of a particular state injunction. To sanction either involves a conflict with federal policy in that it involves allowing two law-making sources to govern. In fact, since remedies from an ingredient of any integrated scheme of regulation, to allow the State to grant a remedy here which has been withheld from the National Labor Relations Board only accentuates the danger of conflict.\n\nIt is true that we have allowed the States to grant compensation for the consequences, as defined by the traditional law of torts, of conduct marked by violence and imminent threats to the public order. United Automobile Workers v. Russell, \n356 \nU.S. 634\n; United Construction Workers v. Laburnum Corp., \n347 \nU.S. 656\n. We have also allowed the States to enjoin such conduct. Youngdahl v. Rainfair, \n355 \nU.S. 131\n; Auto Workers v. Wisconsin Board, \n351 \nU.S. 266\n. State jurisdiction has prevailed in these situations because the compelling state interest, in the scheme of our federalism, in the maintenance of domestic peace is not overridden in the absence of clearly expressed congressional direction. We recognize that the opinion in United Construction Workers v. Laburnum Corp., \n347 \nU.S. 656\n, found support in the fact that the state remedy had no federal counterpart. But that decision \n\n[359 \nU.S. 236, 248]\n\u00a0\n was determined, as is demonstrated by the question to which review was restricted, by the \"type of conduct\" involved, i. e., \"intimidation and threats of violence.\"\n6\n In the present case there is no such compelling state interest.\n\nThe judgment below is\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] E. g., Guss v.

Russell, \n356 \nU.S. 634\n; Youngdahl v. Rainfair, \n355 \nU.S. 131\n; Auto Workers v. Wisconsin Board, \n351 \nU.S. 266\n; United Construction Workers v.

Anheuser-Busch, Inc., \n348 \nU.S. 468\n, in which it was pointed out that the state court had relied on a general restraint of trade statute. Cf. Auto Workers v. Wisconsin Board, \n351 \nU.S. 266\n. The case before us involves both tort law of general application and specialized labor relations statutes. See p. 239, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See Auto Workers v. Wisconsin Board, \n336 \nU.S. 245\n. The approach taken in that case, in which the Court undertook for itself to determine the status of the disputed activity, has not been followed in later decisions, and is no longer of general application.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] \"When Congress has taken the particular subject-matter in hand coincidence is as ineffective as opposition . . . .\" Charleston & West, Carolina R. Co. v. Varnville Furniture Co., \n237 \nU.S. 597, 604\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The conduct involved in Laburnum was so characterized in United Automobile Workers v. Russell, \n356 \nU.S. 634, 640\n, in an opinion by Mr. Justice Burton, who also wrote the opinion of the Court in Laburnum. When this very case was before us for the first time we noted that \"Laburnum sustained an award of damages under state tort law for violent conduct. We cannot know that the California court would have interpreted its own state law to allow an award of damages in this situation.\" \n353 \nU.S., at 29\n.\n\nIn Laburnum this Court itself expressly phrased its grant of certiorari to include only the limited question of the State's jurisdiction to award damages \"[i]n view of the type of conduct found by the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia to have been carried out by Petitioners . . .,\" \n346 \nU.S. 936\n, despite the fact that petitioners had urged upon us a question not limited to the particular conduct involved. Petition for certiorari, p. 6.\n\nThroughout, the opinion of the Court makes it clear that the holding in favor of state jurisdiction was limited to a situation involving violence and threats of violence. Thus the findings of the Virginia court as to the flagrant and violent activities of petitioners were set out at length. \n347 \nU.S., at 660\n-662, n. 4. The Court relies on statements by Senator Taft, the Act's sponsor, and from a Senate Report which point out that \"mass picketing,\" \"violence,\" \"threat[s] of violence,\" may be a violation of state law, as well as unfair labor practices under the Act. \n347 \nU.S., at 668\n.\n\nThe Court in Laburnum points out that it would be inconsistent with the provisions of the Act which allow recovery for damages caused by secondary boycotts, not to allow an injured party \"to recover damages caused more directly and flagrantly through such conduct as is before us.\" \n347 \nU.S. 666\n. The Court also placed reliance on a quotation from International Union v. Wisconsin Board, \n336 \nU.S. 245, 253\n, which points out that the \"[p]olicing of . . . conduct . . .,\" which consists of \"actual or threatened violence to persons or destruction of property,\" is left to the States. In its concluding \n\n[359 \nU.S. 236, 249]\n\u00a0\n paragraph the Court again stresses that Virginia has jurisdiction over \"coercion of the type found here . . . .\"\n\nThe damages awarded were extensive, consisting primarily of loss of profits caused by the disruption of respondents' business resulting from the violence. These damages were restricted to the \"damages directly and proximately caused by wrongful conduct chargeable to the defendants . . .\" as defined by the traditional law of torts. United Construction Workers v. Laburnum Corp., 194 Va. 872, 887, 75 S. E. 2d 694, 704. Thus there is nothing in the measure of damages to indicate that state power was exerted to compensate for anything more than the direct consequences of the violent conduct.\n\nAll these factors make it plain that our decision in Laburnum rested on the nature of the activities there involved, and the interest of the State in regulating them. The case has been so interpreted in later decisions of this Court. See Weber v. Anheuser-Busch, \n348 \nU.S. 468, 477\n; and the phrases quoted from Russell, supra. In Russell we again allowed the State to award damages for injuries caused by \"mass picketing and threats of violence . . .,\" \n356 \nU.S., at 638\n. That opinion also continually stresses the violent nature of the conduct and limits its decision to the \"kind of tortious conduct\" there involved. \n356 \nU.S., at 646\n. See also \n356 \nU.S., at 642\n; and \n356 \nU.S., at 640\n, where the Court points out that Alabama could have enjoined the activities of the union. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 236, 249]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE CLARK, MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER and MR. JUSTICE STEWART join, concurring.\n\nI concur in the result upon the narrow ground that the Unions' activities for which the State has awarded damages may fairly be considered protected under the Taft-Hartley Act, and that therefore state action is precluded until the National Labor Relations Board has made a contrary determination respecting such activities. As the Court points out, it makes no difference that the Board has declined to exercise its jurisdiction. See Guss v. Utah Labor Relations Board, \n353 \nU.S. 1\n; Meat Cutters v. Fairlawn Meats, Inc., \n353 \nU.S. 20\n; and our earlier opinion in the present case when it was first before us, \n353 \nU.S. 26\n. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 236, 250]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWere nothing more than this particular case involved, I would be content to rest my concurrence at this point without more. But as today's decision will stand as a landmark in future \"pre-emption\" cases in the labor field, I feel justified in particularizing why I cannot join the Court's opinion.\n\nIf it were clear that the Unions' conduct here was unprotected activity under Taft-Hartley, I think that United Constr. Workers v. Laburnum Constr. Corp., \n347 \nU.S. 656\n, and Automobile Workers v. Russell, \n356 \nU.S. 634\n, would require that the California judgment be sustained, even though such conduct might be deemed to be federally prohibited. In both these cases state tort damage judgments against unions were upheld in respect of conduct which this Court assumed was prohibited activity under the Federal Labor Act. The Court now says, however, that those decisions are not applicable here because they were premised on violence, which the States could also have enjoined, Automobile Workers v. Wisconsin Board, \n351 \nU.S. 266\n, whereas in this case the Unions' acts were peaceful. In this I think the Court mistaken.\n\nThe threshold question in every labor pre-emption case is whether the conduct with respect to which a State has sought to act is, or may fairly be regarded as, federally protected activity. Because conflict is the touchstone of pre-emption, such activity is obviously beyond the reach of all state power. Hill v. Florida, \n325 \nU.S. 538\n; Automobile Workers v. O'Brien, \n339 \nU.S. 454\n; Motor Coach Employees v. Wisconsin Board, \n340 \nU.S. 383\n. That threshold question was squarely faced in the Russell case, where the Court, at page 640, said: \"At the outset, we note that the union's activity in this case clearly was not protected by federal law.\" The same question was, in my view, necessarily faced in Laburnum.\n\nIn both cases it was possible to decide that question without prior reference to the National Labor Relations \n\n[359 \nU.S. 236, 251]\n\u00a0\n Board because the union conduct involved was violent, and as such was of course not protected by the federal Act. Thus in Laburnum, the pre-emption issue was limited to the \"type of conduct\" before the Court. \n347 \nU.S., at 658\n. Similarly in Russell, which was decided on Laburnum principles, the Court stated that the union's activity \"clearly was not protected,\" and immediately went on to say (citing prior \"violence\" cases\n1\n) that \"the strike was conducted in such a manner that it could have been enjoined\" by the State. \n356 \nU.S., at 640\n. In both instances the Court, in reliance on former \"violence\" cases involving injunctions,\n2\n might have gone on to hold, as the Court now in effect says it did, that the state police power was not displaced by the federal Act, and thus disposed of the cases on the ground that state damage awards, like state injunctions, based on violent conduct did not conflict with the federal statute. The Court did not do this, however.\n\nInstead the relevance of violence was manifestly deemed confined to rendering the Laburnum and Russell activities federally unprotected. So rendered, they could then only have been classified as prohibited or \"neither protected nor prohibited.\" If the latter, state jurisdiction was beyond challenge. Automobile Workers v. Wisconsin Board, \n336 \nU.S. 245\n.\n3\n Conversely, if the activities could have been considered prohibited, primary decision by the Board would have been necessary, if state damage awards were inconsistent with federal prohibitions. Garner v. Teamsters Union, \n346 \nU.S. 485\n. To determine the need for initial reference to the Board, the Court assumed that the activities were unfair labor practices prohibited by the \n\n[359 \nU.S. 236, 252]\n\u00a0\n federal Act. Laburnum, supra, at 660-663; Russell, supra, at 641. It then considered the possibility of conflict and held that the state damage remedies were not pre-empted because the federal Act afforded no remedy at all for the past conduct involved in Laburnum, and less than full redress for that involved in Russell. The essence of the Court's holding, which made resort to primary jurisdiction unnecessary, is contained in the following passage from the opinion in Laburnum, supra, at 665 (also quoted in Russell, supra, at 644):\n\n \"To the extent that Congress prescribed preventive procedure against unfair labor practices, that case [Garner v. Teamsters Union, supra,] recognized that the Act excluded conflicting state procedure to the same end. To the extent, however, that Congress has not prescribed procedure for dealing with the consequences of tortious conduct already committed, there is no ground for concluding that existing criminal penalties or liabilities for tortious conduct have been eliminated. The care we took in the Garner case to demonstrate the existing conflict between state and federal administrative remedies in that case was, itself, a recognition that if no conflict had existed, the state procedure would have survived.\"\n\n\n Until today this holding of Laburnum has been recognized by subsequent cases. See Weber v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., \n348 \nU.S. 468, 477\n; Automobile Workers v. Russell, supra, at 640, 641, 644; International Assn. of Machinists v. Gonzales, \n356 \nU.S. 617, 621\n, similarly characterizing Russell; see also the dissenting opinion in Gonzales, especially at 624-626.\n4\n\u00a0\n\n[359 \nU.S. 236, 253]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Court's opinion in this case cuts deeply into the ability of States to furnish an effective remedy under their own laws for the redress of past nonviolent tortious conduct which is not federally protected, but which may be deemed to be, or is, federally prohibited. Henceforth the States must withhold access to their courts until the National Labor Relations Board has determined that such unprotected conduct is not an unfair labor practice, a course which, because of unavoidable Board delays, may render state redress ineffective. And in instances in which the Board declines to exercise its jurisdiction, the States are entirely deprived of power to afford any relief. Moreover, since the reparation powers of the Board, as we observed in Russell, are narrowly circumscribed, those injured by nonviolent conduct will often go remediless even when the Board does accept jurisdiction.\n\nI am, further, at loss to understand, and can find no basis on principle or in past decisions for, the Court's intimation that the States may even be powerless to act when the underlying activities are clearly \"neither protected nor prohibited\" by the federal Act. Surely that suggestion is foreclosed by Automobile Workers v. Wisconsin Board, 336 U.S., supra,\n5\n as well as by the approach taken to federal pre-emption in such cases as Allen-Bradley Local v. Wisconsin Board, supra, Bethlehem Steel Co. v. New York Board, \n330 \nU.S. 767, 773\n, and Algoma Plywood Co. v. Wisconsin Board, \n336 \nU.S. 301\n, not to mention Laburnum and Russell and the primary jurisdiction \n\n[359 \nU.S. 236, 254]\n\u00a0\n doctrine itself.\n6\n Should what the Court now intimates ever come to pass, then indeed state power to redress wrongful acts in the labor field will be reduced to the vanishing point.\n\nIn determining pre-emption in any given labor case, I would adhere to the Laburnum and Russell distinction between damages and injunctions and to the principle that state power is not precluded where the challenged conduct is neither protected nor prohibited under the federal Act. Solely because it is fairly debatable whether the conduct here involved is federally protected, I concur in the result of today's decision.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Youngdahl v. Rainfair, Inc., \n355 \nU.S. 131\n; Automobile Workers v. Wisconsin Board, \n351 \nU.S. 266\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See Allen-Bradley Local v. Wisconsin Board, \n315 \nU.S. 740\n; cases cited at Note 1, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See text at pp. 253-254, infra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The same view is taken of Laburnum and Russell in the amici briefs filed in the present case by the Government and the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, the latter stating that \"[w]e hope to argue in an appropriate case that the Russell decision should be overruled.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The Court may be correct in stating that \"the approach taken in that case, in which the Court undertook for itself to determine the status of the disputed activity, has not been followed in later decisions, and is no longer of general application.\" That, however, has nothing to do with the vitality of the holding that there is no pre-emption when the conduct charged is in fact neither protected nor prohibited. To the contrary, that holding has remained fully intact, and, as already noted, underlay the decisions in Laburnum and Russell.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] If the \"neither protected nor prohibited\" category were one of pre-emption, there would be no point in referring any injunction case initially to the Board since the pre-emption issue would be plain however the challenged activities might be classified federally. The same is true of damage cases under the Court's premise of conflict. State power would thus be confined to activities which were violent or of merely peripheral federal concern, see International Assn. of Machinists v. Gonzales, \n356 \nU.S. 617\n. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 236, 255]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","157":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSCALES v.

Counsel are requested to address themselves to the following questions among others:\n'(1) Is the Membership Clause of the Smith Act, 18 U.S.C.  2385, 18 U.S.C.A.  2385, valid under the Constitution of the United States if it be interpreted to permit a conviction based only on proof that the accused was a member of a society, group or assembly of persons described in the Act knowing the purposes thereof?\n\n'(2) If not, is the Membership Clause constitutionally valid if interpreted as also requiring proof that the membership was accompanied by a specific intent of the accused to accomplish those purposes as speedily as circumstances would permit? Does the Smith Act permissibly bear such an interpretation?\n\n'(3) If the Membership Clause would not be constitutionally valid as interpreted under (1) or (2), would the clause be constitutionally valid if interpreted as requiring as an element of the crime proof that the accused was an 'active' member? Does the Smith Act permissibly bear such an interpretation? If not, and if the clause be valid without such element, does a constitutional application of the Membership Clause depend upon any such requirement, and if so was such a requirement properly applied by the courts in this case? \n\n[360 \nU.S. 924\n, 925]\n\u00a0\n  '(4) Whether the 'clear and present danger' doctrine, as interpreted by counsel, has application to the Membership Clause, either with respect to the accused or with respect to the 'society, group, or assembly of persons' described in the statute. If applicable, whether such doctrine was or can now be, properly applied in this case.\n\n'(5) Is  4(f) of the Internal Security Act, 50 U.S.C.A.  780 \n\n[360 \nU.S. 924\n, 783]\n\u00a0\n, a bar to the present prosecution? Counsel are requested to discuss the relevance of the registration provisions of that Act to this question.'\n\n  Two hours are allotted to each side for oral argument.\n\n\n Mr. Justice CLARK:\n  There are some 13 indictments now pending in the courts awaiting our disposition of this case, and one being held here on petition for certiorari. \n1\n Involved is the validity of the clause in the Smith Act having to do with membership in the Communist Party.\n  The case first came here over three years ago. Certiorari was originally granted on March 26, 1956, \n350 \nU.S. 992\n. After oral argument, the case was restored tothe docket and ordered to be reargued, \n353 \nU.S. 979\n. Prior to reargument, the Solicitor General filed a memorandum suggesting remand for a new trial under our intervening ruling in Jencks v. United States, \n353 \nU.S. 657\n. This was done, \n355 \nU.S. 1\nd 19. After affirmance of a second conviction, we again granted certiorari, \n358 \nU.S. 917\n, and on April 29, 1959, heard oral argument for the second time.\n  The Court poses some questions ostensibly for the guidance of counsel at the third argument. None involves the 'Jencks question,' so there must be no doubt in the Court's mind on that issue. In fact all of the questions posed have been fairly covered by the two arguments already made by capable counsel. All the reargument \n\n[360 \nU.S. 924\n, 926]\n\u00a0\n does is cause inordinate delay. The case is as ready for disposition now as it will ever be, and we should not adjourn until it is handed down.\n  Much has been said of late of the law's delay, and criticism has been heaped on the courts for it. This case affords a likely Exhibit A. It looks as if Scales' case, like Jarndyce v. Jarndyce,2 will go on forever, only for the petitioner to reach his remedy, as did Richard Carstone there, through disposition by the Lord.  \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Noto v.

The events leading to his subpoena, as well as the questions asked him, made it clear that the Committee's investigation touched the area of free speech, press and association; and the record showed that the purposes of the inquiry, as announced by the Chairman of the Committee, were so unclear and conflicting that petitioner did not have a fair opportunity of understanding the basis of the questions or any justification on the Committee's part for seeking the information he refused to give. Held: His conviction violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, since he was not given a fair opportunity, at the peril of contempt, to determine whether he was within his rights in refusing to answer. He cannot be sent to jail for a crime he could not with reasonable certainty know he was committing. Pp. 344-353.\n\n Reversed.\n\nJoseph L. Rauh, Jr. argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief were John Silard and Karl Sorg.\n\nLeslie Hall argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.\n\nOpinion of the Court by MR. JUSTICE BLACK, announced by MR. JUSTICE HARLAN.\n\nDavid H. Scull was convicted of contempt in the Circuit Court of Arlington County, Virginia, for refusing to obey a decision of that court ordering him to answer a number of questions put to him by a Legislative Investigative Committee of the Virginia General Assembly. On \n\n[359 \nU.S. 344, 345]\n\u00a0\n appeal the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals affirmed without opinion. Scull contended at the Committee hearings, in the courts below, and in this Court that the Virginia statute authorizing the investigation, both on its face and as applied, violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. He claimed, among other things, that: (1) The Committee was \"established and given investigative authority, as part of a legislative program of `massive resistance' to the United States Constitution and the Supreme Court's desegregation decisions, in order to harass, vilify, and publicly embarrass members of the NAACP and others who are attempting to secure integrated public schooling in Virginia.\" (2) The questions asked him violated his rights of free speech, assembly and petition by constituting an unjustified restraint upon his associations with others in \"legal and laudable political and humanitarian causes.\" (3) \"The information sought from [him] was neither intended to, nor could reasonably be expected to, assist the Legislature in any proper legislative function.\" (4) Despite his requests, repeated at every stage of the proceedings, the Committee failed to inform him \"in what respect its questions were pertinent to the subject under inquiry . . . .\" We granted certiorari to consider these constitutional challenges to the validity of petitioner's contempt conviction. \n357 \nU.S. 903\n. After careful consideration, we find it unnecessary to pass on any of these constitutional questions except the last one because we think the record discloses an unmistakable cloudiness in the testimony of the Committee Chairman as to what was sought of Scull, as well as why it was sought. Scull was therefore not given a fair opportunity, at the peril of contempt, to determine whether he was within his rights in refusing to answer and consequently his conviction must fall under the procedural requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 344, 346]\n\u00a0\n\n\nScull is a printer and calendar publisher in Annandale, Virginia, where he has been a long-time resident active in religious, civic and welfare groups. Soon after this Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education, \n347 \nU.S. 483\n, holding segregation in the public schools to be unconstitutional, Scull began to advocate compliance with the requirements of the Brown case. In December of 1954, Scull and a group of other citizens met at a church in Alexandria to consider and discuss \"the part which concerned and conscientious citizens can best play in helping to achieve the community adjustments necessary to protect the educational and constitutional rights of all citizens as recently defined and interpreted by the Supreme Court of the United States.\" The group decided to prepare and publish through a \"Citizens Clearing House On Public Education\" information about the Virginia educational program and to report on the progress made by various Parent-Teacher Associations in Northern Virginia in developing programs for \"orderly integration.\"\n\nOne of the newsletters published by the Clearing House was obtained by the Fairfax Citizens' Council, a group which vigorously opposed any desegregation of Virginia schools. The Council republished a large part of the letter in a pamphlet entitled \"The Shocking Truth!\" It called attention to the fact that the newsletter was being \"disseminated through Box 218, Annandale, Va. (David Scull),\" and stated that \"communications with the N. A. A. C. P., Southern Regional Council, Clearing House, B'nai B'rith, Council on Human Relations, American Friends and many other pro-integration groups are funneled through Box 218, Annandale, Va., and membership is encouraged if not actually suggested by the P. T. A. Federation.\"\n\nThe pamphlet came to the attention of Delegate James M. Thomson, Chairman of the Virginia Committee on \n\n[359 \nU.S. 344, 347]\n\u00a0\n Law Reform and Racial Activities, who promptly subpoenaed Scull to appear and testify. This group, commonly called the \"Thomson Committee,\" was established a few months after the Virginia General Assembly adopted a resolution attacking the Brown decision and pledging that the Legislature would take all constitutionally available measures to resist desegregation in the public schools.\n1\n The bill setting up the \"Thomson Committee\" was one of a series relating to segregation passed on the same day. Among these were bills establishing a pupil-assignment plan, providing for the withdrawal of state funds from integrated schools and forbidding barratry, champerty and maintenance.\n2\n While they did not mention the NAACP by name, Chairman Thomson testified below that in the course of the \"legislative battle\" over them he had stated that with \"this set of bills . . . `we can bust that organization . . . wide open.'\"\n\nScull appeared before the Thomson Committee, as ordered. He answered several questions about his publishing business, and then was asked whether he belonged \"to an organization known as The Fairfax County Council on Human Relations.\" He replied that \"on advice of counsel I wish to state that the language of the subpoena delivered to me was so broad and vague . . . that before going further I wish to ask you to tell me the specific subject of your inquiry today, so that I may judge which of your questions are pertinent.\" Chairman Thomson told him that the general subjects under inquiry were \"threefold\": (1) the tax status of racial organizations and of contributions to them; (2) the effect of integration or its threat on the public schools of Virginia and on the State's general welfare; and (3) the violation of certain statutes \n\n[359 \nU.S. 344, 348]\n\u00a0\n against \"champerty, barratry, and maintenance, or the unauthorized practice of the law.\"\n3\n He told Scull, however, that several of these subjects \"primarily do not deal with you.\" Scull then filed a statement of his objections to the questioning and emphasized that he had not been \"properly informed of the subject of inquiry.\" Without clarifying Chairman Thomson's ambiguous statement or specifying which of the \"several\" subjects did not apply to Scull, the Committee proceeded to ask the 31 questions listed in the footnote below.\n4\n\u00a0\n\n[359 \nU.S. 344, 349]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt is difficult to see how some of these questions have any relationship to the subjects the Committee was authorized to investigate, or how Scull could possibly discover any such relationship from the Chairman's statement\n5\n\u00a0\n\n[359 \nU.S. 344, 350]\n\u00a0\n It does seem that several of the questions asked were aimed at connecting Scull with barratry or champerty, but it was never made wholly clear to Scull, either before or after the questioning, that this was one of the subjects under inquiry as far as he was concerned. Nevertheless, Scull was cited to appear before the Circuit Court to show cause why he should not be compelled to answer.\n\nIn the Circuit Court the Chairman sought to explain his ambiguous statements about the scope of the investigation. Far from clarifying the matter, however, his \n\n[359 \nU.S. 344, 351]\n\u00a0\n testimony added to the confusion, since he successively ruled out as inapplicable to Scull each of the subjects which the Legislature had authorized the Committee to investigate. On first being asked which of the three subjects applied to Scull, he testified:\n\n \"For my personal standpoint, I would say that the one dealing with the taxable status does not affect him here, and likewise the one - I have forgotten whether I stated it or not, but I would think that the integration or the threat of integration on public school systems, on the general welfare, would apply.\n\n\n \"Looking at it in retrospect, the other on champerty, barratry, and maintenance would not apply. I don't recall whether I did say or did not say. We did specifically with the third one: Champerty, barratry, and maintenance.\"\n\n\n Later the following colloquy took place:\n\n Counsel for Scull: \"Q. Now, is it also correct that you said several which primarily do not deal with you?\"\n\n\n Chairman Thomson: \"A. If the transcript says it there, I said it.\n\n\n \"Q. Which of those three were you referring to when you said, `Several which primarily do not deal with you'?\n\n\n \"A. I think it is the last mentioned there. [The last mentioned was barratry.]\n\n\n \"Q. Would you just state for the record so that it is clear on the record which ones you were referring to that did not deal with Mr. Scull?\n\n\n \"A. The violation of those statutes dealing with champerty, barratry, and maintenance, and general unauthorized practice of the law.\n\n\n \"Q. Those did not deal with Mr. Scull? \n\n[359 \nU.S. 344, 352]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \"A. No, no; I think in the connection that we are dealing with here, that the ones spoken of first did not apply; only the latter one did apply that I was making.\n\n\n  .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"Q. Now I am confused.\"\n\n\n Subsequently, Chairman Thomson stated that barratry applied to a certain \"section of the testimony\" but did not identify which section. Still later he undertook to specify the section but instead of doing so he made what may have been a general retraction and said, \"The whole statement would be applicable to the entire transcript and the fact that he was advised of each one of them would be applicable to the entire transcript.\"\n\nThe judge who ordered Scull to answer the questions made no clearer statement of their pertinence to the investigation or to basic state interests than had the Committee Chairman. His holding was merely that \"the questions are of a preliminary nature and in developing the inquiry to secure the information which the Committee is after appears to the Court to be perfectly proper line of inquiry.\" He at no time analyzed the individual questions asked, nor explained to Scull what it was that the Committee wanted from him and how the questions put to him related to these desires.\n\nThe events leading to Scull's subpoena, as well as the questions asked him, make it unmistakably clear that the Committee's investigation touched an area of speech. press, and association of vital public importance.\n6\n In NAACP v. Alabama, \n357 \nU.S. 449, 460\n-466, this Court \n\n[359 \nU.S. 344, 353]\n\u00a0\n held that such areas of individual liberty cannot be invaded unless a compelling state interest is clearly shown.\n7\n But we do not reach that question because the record shows that the purposes of the inquiry, as announced by the Chairman, were so unclear, in fact conflicting, that Scull did not have an opportunity of understanding the basis for the questions or any justification on the part of the Committee for seeking the information he refused to give. See Watkins v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 178, 208\n-209, 214-215. To sustain his conviction for contempt under these circumstances would be to send him to jail for a crime he could not with reasonable certainty know he was committing. This Court has often held that fundamental fairness requires that such reasonable certainty exist. See Lanzetta v. New Jersey, \n306 \nU.S. 451, 453\n; Jordan v. De George, \n341 \nU.S. 223, 230\n; Watkins v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 178, 208\n-209, 214-215, 217; Flaxer v. United States, \n358 \nU.S. 147, 151\n. Certainty is all the more essential when vagueness might induce individuals to forego their rights of speech, press, and association for fear of violating an unclear law. Winters v. New York, \n333 \nU.S. 507\n. Such is plainly the case here. The information given to Scull was far too wavering, confused and cloudy to sustain his conviction.\n\nThe case is reversed and remanded to the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Va.

Nothing in the language of the Act authorizing the Committee or in the statement of Chairman Thomson about the subjects under inquiry could lead Scull to think that it was the Committee's duty to investigate Communist or subversive activities.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] See NAACP v. Alabama, \n357 \nU.S. 449, 460\n-466; United States v. Rumely, \n345 \nU.S. 41\n. Among the questions asked were several dealing directly with political activity.

Held: Nevertheless, the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's conclusion that the illness was caused by the accident, and the Court of Appeals erred in reversing a judgment for the seaman. Pp. 107-110.\n\n (a) The lack of medical unanimity as to the respective likelihood of the potential causes of the illness, and the fact that the other potential causes were not conclusively negated by the proofs, did not bar the jury from drawing the inference which it did.

On the brief was George F. Gilleland.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe petitioner brought this suit against the respondent to recover damages sustained by him allegedly as a consequence of a shipboard accident while serving as a crew-member on the respondent's vessel in the Caribbean. As the vessel encountered a heavy sea, petitioner was pitched \n\n[361 \nU.S. 107, 108]\n\u00a0\n into the air and fell back to the deck, where, upon landing, a wave washed him a considerable distance. Shortly after the accident, the petitioner became quite ill and was hospitalized and treated for a serious case of tuberculosis. The respondent's liability for the accident was predicated on fault under the Jones Act, 41 Stat. 1007, 46 U.S.C. 688, and alternatively on breach of the maritime duty to furnish a seaworthy vessel. The petitioner's theory was that the accident activated or aggravated a previously latent tubercular condition.\n1\n The case was submitted to a jury in the District Court, where a verdict was returned for the petitioner, and judgment entered thereon. In the Court of Appeals, the respondent did not argue that the jury could not have with reason found it liable for the accident, but contended solely that the evidence did not justify the jury's conclusion that the accident caused the serious illness that followed it. The Court of Appeals agreed with the respondent's contention and reversed, 256 F.2d 156. We granted certiorari on a petition in which it was asserted that the Court of Appeals had applied an improper standard in reviewing the medical evidence and in examining the judgment rendered on the jury's verdict. \n359 \nU.S. 923\n.\n\nThere was evidence that petitioner (whose medical history was an active one) had been examined several times by his regular physician in the year preceding the accident, as recently as two months before it, with no appearance of tuberculosis being then noted. During the petitioner's acute tuberculosis subsequent to the accident, a specialist re-examined X-ray pictures taken in the years preceding the accident, and concluded that \n\n[361 \nU.S. 107, 109]\n\u00a0\n they did in fact reveal a pulmonary lesion, at first involving a \"small scarred inactive area.\" \"In retrospect,\" the specialist felt that the lesion had been tubercular. In response to a hypothetical question as to the effect of an accident like petitioner's on the aggravation or activation of a pre-existing, dormant tubercular condition, the specialist gave an opinion that \"acute dissemination of the tuberculosis\" might be a consequence of the accident. Another specialist, who had treated petitioner during his hospitalization after the accident, posited the trauma and petitioner's pre-existing diabetic condition as the most likely causes of the aggravation of the tuberculosis, though he was not able to state \"which of the two it is more likely was responsible in this instance.\" Another medical expert, who had not personally examined petitioner, when questioned hypothetically, was of opinion that the accident \"probably aggravated his condition,\" though he would not say definitely: \"We don't ever select one item and say that is the cause of any particular aggravation.\"\n\nThe jury's power to draw the inference that the aggravation of petitioner's tubercular condition, evident so shortly after the accident, was in fact caused by that accident, was not impaired by the failure of any medical witness to testify that it was in fact the cause. Neither can it be impaired by the lack of medical unanimity as to the respective likelihood of the potential causes of the aggravation, or by the fact that other potential causes of the aggravation existed and were not conclusively negated by the proofs. The matter does not turn on the use of a particular form of words by the physicians in giving their testimony. The members of the jury, not the medical witnesses, were sworn to make a legal determination of the question of causation.\n2\n They were entitled \n\n[361 \nU.S. 107, 110]\n\u00a0\n to take all the circumstances, including the medical testimony, into consideration. See Sullivan v. Boston Elevated R. Co., 185 Mass. 602, 71 N. E. 90; Miami Coal Co. v. Luce, 76 Ind. App. 245, 131 N. E. 824.\n3\n Though this case involves a medical issue, it is no exception to the admonition that, \"It is not the function of a court to search the record for conflicting circumstantial evidence in order to take the case away from the jury on a theory that the proof gives equal support to inconsistent and uncertain inferences. The focal point of judicial review is the reasonableness of the particular inference or conclusion drawn by the jury. . . . The very essence of its function is to select from among conflicting inferences and conclusions that which it considers most reasonable. . . . Courts are not free to reweigh the evidence and set aside the jury verdict merely because the jury could have drawn different inferences or conclusions or because judges feel that other results are more reasonable.\" Tennant v. Peoria & Pekin Union R. Co., \n321 \nU.S. 29, 35\n. The proofs here justified with reason the conclusion of the jury that the accident caused the petitioner's serious subsequent illness. See Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., \n352 \nU.S. 500\n.\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE WHITTAKER, finding in the record direct medical testimony expressing the opinion that petitioner's latent tubercular condition actually was activated by the trauma complained of, concurs. \n\n[361 \nU.S. 107, 111]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART, concurring.\n\nCases like this, I am firmly convinced, do not belong in this Court. To review individualized personal injury cases, in which the sole issue is sufficiency of the evidence, seems to me not only to disregard the Court's proper function, but also to deflect the Court's energies from the mass of important and difficult business properly here. All this has been elaborated in extenso by others, and there is no point in repeating or paraphrasing their words. Suffice it to note that I agree with what they have said. See, e. g., Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., \n352 \nU.S. 500, 524\n (dissenting opinion); Dick v. New York Life Ins. Co., \n359 \nU.S. 437, 447\n (dissenting opinion).\n\nYet under our rule, when four members of the Court vote to grant a petition for certiorari, the case is taken. If this rule is not to be frustrated, I can, as presently advised, see no escape from the duty of considering a case brought here on the merits, unless considerations appear which were not apprehended at the time certiorari was granted. In short, on this score I agree with the views expressed by MR. JUSTICE HARLAN in Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., \n352 \nU.S. 500, 559\n (dissenting opinion). See Mr. Chief Justice Stone's concurring opinion in Bailey v. Central Vermont R. Co., \n319 \nU.S. 350\n, at 358.\n\nUpon an independent review of the record in this case, I concur in the result.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN concurs in this opinion.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Maintenance and cure in respect of the illness were also claimed; this was viewed as presenting a causation problem similar to that posed by the claim for indemnity damages.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] For a discussion of the reluctance of medical opinion to assign trauma as the cause of disease, and of the varying medical and legal \n\n[361 \nU.S. 107, 110]\n\u00a0\n concepts of causation, see Small, Gaffing at a Thing Called Cause: Medico-Legal Conflicts in the Concept of Causation, 31 Tex. L. Rev. 630.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The medical testimony in the case last cited moved the court to say: \"Indeed, if it were not for the saving grace of what we call common sense, justice would be defeated in almost every case where opinion evidence is admitted.\" Id., at 249, 131 N. E., at 826.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, dissenting.\n\n\"We do not grant a certiorari to review evidence and discuss specific facts.\" United States v. Johnston, \n268 \nU.S. 220, 227\n. Thus Mr. Justice Holmes, speaking for a unanimous Court thirty-five years ago, summarized the \n\n[361 \nU.S. 107, 112]\n\u00a0\n practice of the Court in abstaining from exercising its certiorari jurisdiction for the purpose of reviewing facts and weighing evidence in relation to them. This practice obviously derived from the Evarts Act of 1891, by which Congress established intermediate courts of appeals to free this Court from reviewing the great mass of federal litigation in order to enable the Nation's ultimate tribunal adequately to discharge its responsibility for the wise adjudication of cases \"involving principles the settlement of which is of importance to the public as distinguished from that of the parties,\" Layne & Bowler Corp. v. Western Well Works, Inc., \n261 \nU.S. 387, 393\n. Since Mr. Chief Justice Taft announced this for the Court in 1923, cases of obvious public importance demanding the Court's attention have increased in number and difficulty. The practice of not taking cases turning solely on the evaluation of evidence has been consistently adhered to, barring an occasional sport like Dick v. New York Life Insurance Co., \n359 \nU.S. 437\n, except in the special class of cases arising under the Federal Employers' Liability Act and its twin, the Jones Act. The fluctuating interest in this special class of cases by the necessary number of Justices for granting certiorari, first on behalf of employers, see Frankfurter and Landis, The Business of the Supreme Court (1928), 207-209, and more recently on behalf of employees, has disregarded the normal practice.\n\n\n The oral argument overwhelmingly confirmed what the petition had already made clear, that this is the kind of case which, in the language of my Brother STEWART, does not \"belong in this Court.\" To entertain the case merely because argument has been had does not lessen the disregard of the Court's practice, formulated in Rule 19. The Court has in scores of cases dismissed the writ of certiorari even after oral argument, when the true basis for a certiorari was lacking. Even in criminal cases \n\n[361 \nU.S. 107, 113]\n\u00a0\n involving sentences of life imprisonment this practice has been followed. See Triplett v. Iowa, \n357 \nU.S. 217\n; Joseph v. Indiana, \n359 \nU.S. 117\n. Again to quote Mr. Chief Justice Taft in Layne & Bowler Corp. v. Western Well Works, Inc., supra, at 393, \"it is very important that we be consistent in not granting the writ of certiorari . . . .\" As a general practice the Court does not review cases involving merely individualized circumstances not unlike the type of factual situations arising in the application of the Federal Employers' Liability Act and the Jones Act. Since this case does not \"belong in this Court,\" to have brought it here was an undue exercise of judicial discretion. Accordingly, I would dismiss the writ as improvidently granted. See my opinion in Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., \n352 \nU.S. 500, 524\n. \n\n[361 \nU.S. 107, 114]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","163":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSERVICE TRANSFER CO. v. VIRGINIA(1959)\nNo. 92\nArgued: February 26, 1959Decided: March 30, 1959\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner, a motor carrier authorized by the Interstate Commerce Commission to transport commodities between Bluefield, W. Va., and various points in Virginia and West Virginia, was fined by Virginia for carrying certain allegedly intrastate shipments without complying with a Virginia statute governing intrastate operations. The shipments in question were from Virginia points to other Virginia points but were routed through petitioner's main terminal in Bluefield, W. Va., in accordance with petitioner's usual practice regarding less-than-truckload shipments. Subsequently, the Interstate Commerce Commission rendered an opinion construing petitioner's certificate as authorizing Virginia-to-Virginia traffic routed through Bluefield, W. Va. Held: The interpretation of petitioner's interstate certificate should have been litigated before the Interstate Commerce Commission under 204 (c) of the Interstate Commerce Act before the State attempted to fine petitioner for allegedly unlawful operations, and the judgment sustaining the fine is reversed. Pp. 172-179.\n\n (a) To sustain the fines here assessed by the State would be tantamount to a partial suspension of petitioner's federally granted certificate contrary to 49 U.S.C. 312.

McIlwaine, III, argued the cause for respondent. On the brief were A. S. Harrison, Jr., Attorney General of Virginia, and Reno S. Harp, III, Assistant Attorney General.\n\nAustin L. Roberts, Jr. and R. Everette Kreeger filed a brief for the National Association of Railroad and Utilities Commissioners, as amicus curiae, urging affirmance.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner, an interstate motor carrier certificated by the Interstate Commerce Commission, but without a permit from Virginia allowing intrastate operations, was fined $5,000 by the State Corporation Commission for carrying 10 shipments of freight alleged to have been of an intrastate character and, therefore, in violation of Chapter 12, Title 56, of the Code of Virginia.\n1\n The shipments in question originated at Virginia points and were destined to Virginia points but were routed through Bluefield, West Virginia, where petitioner maintains its main terminal. They were transported in a vehicle with freight destined to points outside of Virginia. Upon arrival at Bluefield the freight destined to Virginia was removed and consolidated with freight coming to the \n\n[359 \nU.S. 171, 173]\n\u00a0\n terminal from non-Virginia origins. It then moved back into Virginia to its destinations. The Corporation Commission found that the routes thus employed through Bluefield were a subterfuge to evade state law. The Virginia Court of Appeals agreed but directed that the fine be reduced to $3,500 because of a failure of the Commonwealth's case on three of the shipments. 199 Va. 797, 102 S. E. 2d 339. Petitioner pleads that Virginia's interpretation of its operations conflicts with its interstate certificate as well as an interpretation thereof by the Interstate Commerce Commission. It claims that respondent was without power thus to impose criminal sanctions on its certificated interstate operations. We granted certiorari, \n358 \nU.S. 810\n, to test out the conflicting contentions. We agree with the petitioner that under the facts here the interpretation of petitioner's interstate commerce certificate should first be litigated before the Interstate Commerce Commission under the provision of 204 (c) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. 304 (c).\n2\n\u00a0\n\nPetitioner operates its truck lines in parts of Virginia and West Virginia. Its activity is carried on under a certificate of convenience and necessity issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission. The petitioner's present \n\n[359 \nU.S. 171, 174]\n\u00a0\n I. C. C. certificate is a combination of its original 1941 certificate and a second certificate issued in 1943 upon its purchase of the operating rights of another carrier. Neither it nor its predecessor held a certificate from the State Corporation Commission authorizing any intrastate carriage. It is authorized under the relevant parts of its interstate certificate to transport general commodities as a motor common carrier in interstate commerce:\n\n\"Between Bluefield, Va., Bluefield, W. Va., and points and places within five miles of Bluefield, W. Va. \"Between Bluefield, Va., and points and places within five miles of Bluefield, Va., and those within five miles of Bluefield, W. Va., respectively, on the one hand, and, on the other, points and places in that part of Virginia and West Virginia within 75 miles of that territory. Between Bluefield, W. Va., on the one hand, and, on the other, points and places in West Virginia, that part of Virginia west of U.S. Highway 29 and south of U.S. Highway 60 including points and places on the indicated portions of the highways specified, and that part of Virginia north of U.S. Highway 60 which is within 80 miles of Bluefield, W. Va.\"\n\n\n Petitioner's method of operation is uncontradicted in the record. It maintains its headquarters in Bluefield, West Virginia, and terminal points in Virginia at Bristol and Roanoke. Its main activity is the movement of freight of less-than-truckload shipments. In order to gather the shipments and, by combining them, make up a full truck load it operates \"peddler runs\" from its Virginia terminals which serve as pick ups for freight in the vicinity. All of the traffic is directed through the Bluefield, West Virginia, terminal. About three percent of the traffic consists of shipments destined from one Virginia point to another while the remainder is directed \n\n[359 \nU.S. 171, 175]\n\u00a0\n from points within to those outside that State. The freight gathered by the \"peddler runs\" is combined at a terminal and placed in an \"over the road\" tractor trailer unit and carried to Bluefield, West Virginia. There it is broken down and combined with other shipments received from all of the other runs of petitioner. That part destined to points in and around Bluefield is delivered locally through \"peddler runs\" operated from that terminal. The remainder is sorted out for forwarding to the terminal nearest its destination and is \"filed out\" by \"over the road\" operation. Upon arrival at the latter terminal it is delivered by \"peddler runs\" to its local destination.\n\nThe Commonwealth's criminal case is bottomed on shipments the origin and final destination of which are in Virginia. While it stipulated that all of these shipments were routed through Bluefield, West Virginia, and were, therefore, on their face interstate shipments,\n3\n Virginia takes the position that they were clearly intrastate in character because had they been moved over direct routes none would ever have left the Commonwealth. It contends that petitioner's circuitous and unnecessarily long routes were a mere subterfuge to escape intrastate regulation and evade its jurisdiction. Aside from the testimony of highway officers as to the actual shipments, none of which is disputed, the Commonwealth's evidence consisted solely of maps substantiating its position that petitioner's routes were circuitous and often long, sometimes exceeding twice the shortest possible route. However, it offered no direct evidence of bad faith on the part of petitioner in moving its traffic through Bluefield, West Virginia.\n\nOn the other hand, petitioner offered the testimony of its manager and others as to the bona fides of its operation. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 171, 176]\n\u00a0\n It proved that it and its predecessor-operator had been carrying on its business in Virginia in a similar manner for many years and that it enjoyed certificates from the Interstate Commerce Commission authorizing its operations. Petitioner admits that some of its routes are circuitous but claims this is because of its method of gathering less-than-truckload shipments regardless of final destination and routing them through its \"gateway\" terminal at Bluefield where they are assorted according to final destination. It stands uncontradicted that its operation is not only practical, efficient and profitable, but also that the creation of this \"flow of traffic\" is a timesaver to the shipper since there is less time lost waiting for the making up of a full truck load. It also claims a unique service for less-than-truckload shipments of central Virginians who ship commodities to southwest Virginia and Kentucky and who otherwise would suffer long delays on deliveries or would be obliged to ship by special truck at higher rates. While these considerations are not controlling, they throw light on petitioner's claim of bona fides.\n\nIn Castle v. Hayes Freight Lines, \n348 \nU.S. 61, 63\n-64 (1954), we observed that \"Congress in the Motor Carrier Act adopted a comprehensive plan for regulating the carriage of goods by motor truck in interstate commerce.\" We pointed out that 49 U.S.C. 312 provides \"that all certificates, permits or licenses issued by the Commission `shall remain in effect until suspended or terminated as herein provided' . . . . Under these circumstances, it would be odd if a state could take action amounting to a suspension or revocation of an interstate carrier's commission-granted right to operate.\" To uphold the criminal fines here assessed would be tantamount to a partial suspension of petitioner's federally granted certificate. Even though the questioned operations constitute only a minor, i. e., three percent, portion of the petitioner's business, that \n\n[359 \nU.S. 171, 177]\n\u00a0\n portion is nevertheless entitled to the same protection as are the other operations which are conducted under the certificate. In fact, the method of handling is identical and the freight is often transported in the same vehicle. The certificate on its face covers the whole operation. In fact, in 1953, in approving the acquisition of petitioner by another carrier, the I. C. C. expressly approved the very type of operation now being carried on. In its unpublished report, the Commission noted:\n\n\"Under its existing authority, Service Storage may lawfully perform a cross-haul service under a combination of its radial rights by operating, for example, between points in West Virginia within 75 miles of the base area, on the one hand, and, on the other, points in Virginia on and west of U.S. Highway 29 and on the south of U.S. Highway 60, and points in the three Kentucky counties provided such operations under a combination of the various rights are routed through Bluefield as a gateway.\" MC-F-5361, Smith's Transfer Corporation of Staunton, Va. - Control - Service Storage and Transfer Company, Inc., 59 M. C. C. 803 (report not published.)\n\n\n It appears clear that interpretations of federal certificates of this character should be made in the first instance by the authority issuing the certificate and upon whom the Congress has placed the responsibility of action. The Commission has long taken this position. Compare Atlantic Freight Lines, Inc., v. Pennsylvania Public Utility Comm'n, 163 Pa. Super. 215, 60 A. 2d 589, with Atlantic Freight Lines, Inc., - Petition for Declaratory Order, 51 M. C. C. 175. The wisdom of such a practice is highlighted by the facts of this case. Between the close of the hearing, and the announcement of the Virginia Commission's decision, Service petitioned the I. C. C. for a declaratory order interpreting its certificate. The \n\n[359 \nU.S. 171, 178]\n\u00a0\n Commonwealth, although it had notice of the I. C. C. proceeding, elected not to participate. After the Virginia Commission had found petitioner to be operating in intrastate commerce and fined it for such operation, the I. C. C. issued an opinion, 71 M. C. C. 304, in which it construed petitioner's certificate as authorizing Virginia-to-Virginia traffic routed through Bluefield, West Virginia.\n4\n This was but a reaffirmation of its prior interpretation of the certificate. 59 M. C. C. 803, supra. Such conflicts can best be avoided if the interpretation of I. C. C. certificates is left to the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n\nNor is Eichholz v. Public Service Comm'n, \n306 \nU.S. 268\n (1939) to the contrary. There Missouri revoked a carrier's interstate permit because it crossed state lines into Kansas City, Kansas, for the sole purpose of creating an interstate operation. Eichholz, however, had no certificate from the Interstate Commerce Commission, and this Court's opinion was premised on this fact rather than that the interstate operations were merely a subterfuge and hence not bona fide. The words of Chief Justice Hughes there clearly distinguish that case from the present:\n\n\"When the [Missouri] Commission revoked the permit, the Interstate Commerce Commission had not acted upon appellant's application under the Federal \n\n[359 \nU.S. 171, 179]\n\u00a0\n Motor Carrier Act and meanwhile the authority of the state body to take appropriate action under the state law to enforce reasonable regulations of traffic upon the state highways had not been superseded.\" \n306 \nU.S., at 273\n.\n\n\n Eichholz followed naturally from the holding of the Court in Welch Co. v. New Hampshire, \n306 \nU.S. 79\n (1939), that the enactment of the Motor Carrier Act did not, without more, supersede all reasonable state regulation, the latter continuing in effect until the Interstate Commerce Commission acted on the same subject matter. That it has admittedly done here.\n\nFinally, the Commonwealth is not helpless to act. If it believes that petitioner's operation is not bona fide interstate but is merely a subterfuge to escape its jurisdiction, it can avail itself of the remedy Congress has provided in the Act. Section 204 (c), supra, note 2, authorizes the filing of a \"complaint in writing to the Commission by any . . . State board . . . [that] any . . . carrier . . .\" has abused its certificate. See also Castle v. Hayes Freight Lines, supra. Thus the possibility of a multitude of interpretations of the same federal certificate by several States will be avoided and a uniform administration of the Act achieved.\n\nThe judgment is\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Va. Code, 1950, 56-278, provides:\n\n\"No common carrier by motor vehicle or restricted common carrier by motor vehicle not herein exempted shall engage in intrastate operation on any highway within the State without first having obtained from the Commission a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing such operation, and a statement of the State Highway Commission that the law applicable to the proposed route or routes has been complied with as to size, weight, and type of vehicles to be used, and a like statement as to any increase in size, weight, and type of vehicles proposed to be operated by the applicant after such application is granted.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] That section provides:\n\n(c) \"Upon complaint in writing to the Commission by any person, State board, organization, or body politic, or upon its own initiative without complaint, the Commission may investigate whether any motor carrier or broker has failed to comply with any provision of this chapter, or with any requirement established pursuant thereto.

UNITED STATES(1959)\nNo. 88\nArgued: February 26, 1959Decided: March 23, 1959\n\n\n\n\n Under 6331 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, a Director of Internal Revenue issued notices of levy directed to a State and served them on petitioner, the State Auditor, seizing the accrued salaries of certain employees of the State against whom the Commissioner of Internal Revenue had assessed income tax deficiencies. Petitioner refused to honor the levies and issued and delivered to the taxpayers warrants for their accrued salaries. The Federal Government then brought this suit against petitioner under 6332 to recover from him personally the sums he had so paid to the taxpayers in disobedience of the Government's levies. Held:\n\n 1. Sections 6331 and 6332 authorize a levy on the accrued salaries of the employees of a State to collect federal income taxes. Pp. 110-113.\n\n\n 2. Petitioner, as State Auditor, was a person \"obligated with respect to\" the accrued and seized salaries, within the meaning of 6332, and therefore was personally liable for refusing to surrender them to the Government. Pp. 113-114.\n\n\n 252 F.2d 434, affirmed.\n\nFred H. Caplan, Assistant Attorney General of West Virginia, argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief was W. W. Barron, Attorney General of West Virginia.\n\nMelva M. Graney argued the cause for the United States. With her on the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Rice and Joseph Kovner.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed an income tax deficiency against each of three residents of West Virginia and forwarded the assessment lists to the \n\n[359 \nU.S. 108, 109]\n\u00a0\n Director of Internal Revenue at Parkersburg for collection. The deficiencies remaining unpaid for more than 10 days after demand for payment and the taxpayers being then employed by the State of West Virginia, the Director issued notices of levy directed to the State of West Virginia and served them on petitioner, as the State Auditor, seizing the accrued salaries of the taxpayers pursuant to 6331 of the 1954 Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. (Supp. V) 6331.\n1\n Petitioner refused to honor the levies and instead issued and delivered payroll warrants to the taxpayers for their then accrued net salaries aggregating $519.71.\n2\n Thereafter the Government brought this suit in the Federal District Court against petitioner under 6332 of the 1954 Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. (Supp. V) 6332,\n3\n to recover from \n\n[359 \nU.S. 108, 110]\n\u00a0\n him personally the $519.71 that he had so paid to the taxpayers in disobedience to and defeat of the Government's levies. The District Court rendered judgment for the Government and the Court of Appeals affirmed, 252 F.2d 434. Certiorari was sought on the grounds that 6331 does not authorize a levy on the accrued salaries of employees of a State, and that, if it be held that it does, petitioner was not a person \"obligated with respect to\" the accrued and seized salaries, within the meaning of 6332, and, therefore, is not personally liable for refusing to surrender them to the Government. We granted the writ to determine those questions. \n358 \nU.S. 809\n.\n\nNothing in the Constitution requires that the salaries of state employees be treated any differently, for federal tax purposes, than the salaries of others, Helvering v. Gerhardt, \n304 \nU.S. 405\n; Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, \n306 \nU.S. 466\n, and it is quite clear, generally, that accrued salaries are property and rights to property \n\n[359 \nU.S. 108, 111]\n\u00a0\n subject to levy.\n4\n In plain terms, 6331 provides for the collection of assessed and unpaid taxes \"by levy upon all property and rights to property\" belonging to a delinquent taxpayer.\n5\n Pursuant to that statute a regulation was promulgated expressly interpreting and declaring 6331 to authorize levy on the accrued salaries of employees of a State to enforce collection of any federal tax.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nAlthough not disputing these principles, petitioner advances two arguments in support of his claim that the statutes do not authorize a levy on the accrued salaries of employees of a State. First, he contends that a State is not a \"person\" within the meaning of 6332, and, second, he argues that Congress, by specifically authorizing in 6331 a levy \"upon the accrued salary or wages of any officer, employee, or elected official, of the United States, the District of Columbia, or any agency or instrumentality\" thereof, but not similarly specifically authorizing levy upon the accrued salaries or wages of \n\n[359 \nU.S. 108, 112]\n\u00a0\n employees of a State, evinced its intention to exclude the latter from such levies.\n\nThough the definition of \"person\" in 6332 does not mention States or any sovereign or political entity or their officers among those it \"includes\" (Note 3), it is equally clear that it does not exclude them. This is made certain by the provisions of 7701 (b) of the 1954 Internal Revenue Code that \"The terms `includes' and `including' when used in a definition contained in this title shall not be deemed to exclude other things otherwise within the meaning of the term defined.\" 26 U.S.C. (Supp. V) 7701 (b). Whether the term \"person\" when used in a federal statute includes a State cannot be abstractly declared, but depends upon its legislative environment, Ohio v. Helvering, \n292 \nU.S. 360, 370\n; Georgia v. Evans, \n316 \nU.S. 159, 161\n. It is clear that 6332 is stated in all-inclusive terms of general application. \"In interpreting federal revenue measures expressed in terms of general application, this Court has ordinarily found them operative in the case of state activities even though States were not expressly indicated as subjects of tax.\" Wilmette Park Dist. v. Campbell, \n338 \nU.S. 411, 416\n, and cases cited. We think that the subject matter, the context, the legislative history, and the executive interpretation, i. e., the legislative environment, of 6332 make it plain that Congress intended to and did include States within the term \"person\" as used in 6332.\n\nNor is there merit in petitioner's contention that Congress, by specifically providing in 6331 for levy upon the accrued salaries of federal employees, but not mentioning state employees, evinced an intention to exclude the latter from levy. The explanation of that action by Congress appears quite clearly to be that this Court had held in Smith v. Jackson, \n246 \nU.S. 388\n, that a federal disbursing officer might not, in the absence of express congressional authorization, set off an indebtedness of a federal employee \n\n[359 \nU.S. 108, 113]\n\u00a0\n to the Government against the employee's salary, and, pursuant to that opinion, the Comptroller General ruled that an \"administrative official served with [notices of levy] would be without authority to withhold any portion of the current salary of such employee in satisfaction of the notices of levy and distraint.\" 26 Comp. Gen. 907, 912 (1947). It is evident that 6331 was enacted to overcome that difficulty and to subject the salaries of federal employees to the same collection procedures as are available against all other taxpayers, including employees of a State.\n\nAccordingly we hold that 6331 and 6332 authorize levy upon the accrued salaries of state employees for the collection of any federal tax.\n\nThis brings us to petitioner's contention that even if the salaries of state employees are subject to levy, he is not personally liable to the Government for refusing to honor its levies because, contrary to the holding of the courts below, he was not a person \"obligated with respect to\" the salaries covered thereby. Congress did not define the questioned phrase, nor do we feel called upon here to delimit its scope, for we think it includes, at least, a person who has the sole power to control disposition of the fund, and we also think that, under the West Virginia law, petitioner both had and exercised that power. By a West Virginia statute, 1 W. Va. Code, 1955, 1031 (1), he was empowered and obligated to deduct and withhold from the salaries of state employees sums \"to pay taxes as may be required by an act or acts of the congress of the United States of America\"; and, similarly, another West Virginia statute, 2 W. Va. Code, 1955, 3834 (18), authorizes garnishments to be served upon him to sequester the salaries of state employees. He alone has the obligation and power to issue warrants for the payment of salaries, and state employees entitled to payment for services may enforce their rights by mandamus against him. State \n\n[359 \nU.S. 108, 114]\n\u00a0\n ex rel. Board of Governors of West Virginia University v. Sims, 133 W. Va. 239, 55 S. E. 2d 505; State ex rel. Board of Governors of West Virginia University v. Sims, 136 W. Va. 789, 68 S. E. 2d 489; State ex rel. Board of Governors of West Virginia University v. Sims, 140 W. Va. 64, 82 S. E. 2d 321. By and to the extent of these West Virginia laws petitioner was obligated and empowered in respect to the sequestered salaries. These laws empowered him completely to control the disposition of that fund. He exercised that power by refusing to honor the Government's valid levies and to surrender the fund to the Government. Instead he surrendered the fund to the taxpayers. That action by petitioner resulted in defeat of the Government's valid levies.\n\nUpon these principles four judges who are constantly required to pass upon West Virginia laws have held that, under the law of that State, petitioner is a person who was obligated with respect to the salaries covered by the Government's levies. Their conclusion appears to be founded on reason and authority, and under familiar principles will be accepted here. Propper v. Clark, \n337 \nU.S. 472, 486\n-487. Being a person who, under the law of West Virginia, was obligated with respect to the salaries covered by the Government's levies, petitioner is, by 6332 (b), made personally liable to the Government in a sum equal to the amount, not exceeding the delinquent taxes, which he refused to surrender to the Government but surrendered instead to the taxpayers in defeat of the Government's levies. The judgment of the Court of Appeals was therefore correct and must be\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 26 U.S.C.

CALIFORNIA(1959)\nNo. 36\nArgued: October 20, 1959Decided: December 14, 1959\n\n\n\n\n Appellant, proprietor of a bookstore, was convicted of violating a city ordinance which was construed by the state courts as making him absolutely liable criminally for the mere possession in his store of a book later judicially determined to be obscene - even if he had no knowledge as to the contents of the book. Held: As thus construed and applied, the ordinance violates the freedom of the press which is safeguarded by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from invasion by state action. Pp. 148-155.\n\n (a) The free publication and dissemination of books obviously are within the constitutionally protected freedom of the press, and a retail bookseller plays a most significant role in the distribution of books. P. 150.\n\n\n (b) Legal devices and doctrines, in most applications consistent with the Constitution, may not be constitutionally capable of application where such application would have the effect of inhibiting freedom of expression by making persons reluctant to exercise it. Pp. 150-152.\n\n\n (c) Obscene expression is not constitutionally protected; but this ordinance imposes an unconstitutional limitation on the public's access to constitutionally protected matter. For, if the bookseller be criminally liable without knowledge of the contents, he will tend to restrict the books he sells to those he has inspected; and thus a restriction will be imposed by the States upon the distribution of constitutionally protected as well as obscene books. Pp. 152-154.\n\n\n (d) The existence of the State's power to prevent the distribution of obscene matter does not mean that there can be no constitutional barrier to any form of practical exercise of that power. Hence that there may be more difficulty in enforcing a regulation against the distribution of obscene literature if booksellers may not be held to an absolute criminal liability does not require a different result here. Pp. 154-155.\n\n\n 161 Cal. App. 2d Supp. 860, 327 P.2d 636, reversed. \n\n[361 \nU.S. 147, 148]\n\u00a0\n\n\nStanley Fleishman and Sam Rosenwein argued the cause and filed a brief for appellant.\n\nRoger Arnebergh argued the cause for appellee. With him on the brief was Philip E. Grey.\n\nA. L. Wirin and Fred Okrand filed a brief for the American Civil Liberties Union, as amicus curiae, urging reversal.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nAppellant, the proprietor of a bookstore, was convicted in a California Municipal Court under a Los Angeles City ordinance which makes it unlawful \"for any person to have in his possession any obscene or indecent writing. [or] book . . . [i]n any place of business where . . . books . . . are sold or kept for sale.\"\n1\n The offense was defined by the Municipal Court, and by the Appellate \n\n[361 \nU.S. 147, 149]\n\u00a0\n Department of the Superior Court,\n2\n which affirmed the Municipal Court judgment imposing a jail sentence on appellant, as consisting solely of the possession, in the appellant's bookstore, of a certain book found upon judicial investigation to be obscene. The definition included no element of scienter - knowledge by appellant of the contents of the book - and thus the ordinance was construed as imposing a \"strict\" or \"absolute\" criminal liability.\n3\n The appellant made timely objection below that if the ordinance were so construed it would be in conflict with the Constitution of the United States. This contention, together with other contentions based on the Constitution,\n4\n was rejected, and the case comes here on appeal. 28 U.S.C. 1257 (2); \n358 \nU.S. 926\n.\n\nAlmost 30 years ago, Chief Justice Hughes declared for this Court: \"It is no longer open to doubt that the liberty of the press, and of speech, is within the liberty safeguarded by the due process clause of the Fourteenth \n\n[361 \nU.S. 147, 150]\n\u00a0\n Amendment from invasion by state action. It was found impossible to conclude that this essential personal liberty of the citizen was left unprotected by the general guaranty of fundamental rights of person and property. . . .\" Near v. Minnesota, \n283 \nU.S. 697, 707\n. It is too familiar for citation that such has been the doctrine of this Court, in respect of these freedoms, ever since. And it also requires no elaboration that the free publication and dissemination of books and other forms of the printed word furnish very familiar applications of these constitutionally protected freedoms. It is of course no matter that the dissemination takes place under commercial auspices. See Joseph Burstyn, Inc., v. Wilson, \n343 \nU.S. 495\n; Grosjean v. American Press Co., \n297 \nU.S. 233\n. Certainly a retail bookseller plays a most significant role in the process of the distribution of books.\n\nCalifornia here imposed a strict or absolute criminal responsibility on appellant not to have obscene books in his shop. \"The existence of a mens rea is the rule of, rather than the exception to, the principles of Anglo-American criminal jurisprudence.\" Dennis v. United States, \n341 \nU.S. 494, 500\n.\n5\n Still, it is doubtless competent for the States to create strict criminal liabilities by defining criminal offenses without any element of scienter - though even where no freedom-of-expression question is involved, there is precedent in this Court that this power is not without limitations. See Lambert v. California, \n355 \nU.S. 225\n. But the question here is as to the validity of this ordinance's elimination of the scienter requirement - an elimination which may tend to work a substantial restriction on the freedom of speech and of the press. Our decisions furnish examples of legal devices and doctrines, in most applications consistent with the Constitution, \n\n[361 \nU.S. 147, 151]\n\u00a0\n which cannot be applied in settings where they have the collateral effect of inhibiting the freedom of expression, by making the individual the more reluctant to exercise it. The States generally may regulate the allocation of the burden of proof in their courts, and it is a common procedural device to impose on a taxpayer the burden of proving his entitlement to exemptions from taxation, but where we conceived that this device was being applied in a manner tending to cause even a self-imposed restriction of free expression, we struck down its application. Speiser v. Randall, \n357 \nU.S. 513\n. See Near v. Minnesota, supra, at 712-713. It has been stated here that the usual doctrines as to the separability of constitutional and unconstitutional applications of statutes may not apply where their effect is to leave standing a statute patently capable of many unconstitutional applications, threatening those who validly exercise their rights of free expression with the expense and inconvenience of criminal prosecution. Thornhill v. Alabama, \n310 \nU.S. 88, 97\n-98. Cf. Staub v. City of Baxley, \n355 \nU.S. 313\n.\n6\n And this Court has intimated that stricter standards of permissible statutory vagueness may be applied to a statute having a potentially inhibiting effect on speech; a man may the less be required to act at his peril here, because the free dissemination of ideas may be the loser. Winters v. New York, \n333 \nU.S. 507, 509\n-510, 517-518. Very much to the point here, where the question is the elimination of the mental element in an offense, is this Court's holding in Wieman v. Updegraff, \n344 \nU.S. 183\n. There an oath as to past freedom from membership in subversive organizations, exacted by a State as a qualification for public employment, was held to violate the Constitution in that it made no distinction between members who had, and those who had not, known of the organization's character. The \n\n[361 \nU.S. 147, 152]\n\u00a0\n Court said of the elimination of scienter in this context: \"To thus inhibit individual freedom of movement is to stifle the flow of democratic expression and controversy at one of its chief sources.\" Id., at 191.\n\nThese principles guide us to our decision here. We have held that obscene speech and writings are not protected by the constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and the press. Roth v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 476\n.\n7\n The ordinance here in question, to be sure, only imposes criminal sanctions on a bookseller if in fact there is to be found in his shop an obscene book. But our holding in Roth does not recognize any state power to restrict the dissemination of books which are not obscene; and we think this ordinance's strict liability feature would tend seriously to have that effect, by penalizing booksellers, even though they had not the slightest notice of the character of the books they sold. The appellee and the court below analogize this strict liability penal ordinance to familiar forms of penal statutes which dispense with any element of knowledge on the part of the person charged, food and drug legislation being a principal example. We find the analogy instructive in our examination of the question before us. The usual rationale for such statutes is that the public interest in the purity of its food is so great as to warrant the imposition of the highest standard of care on distributors - in fact an absolute standard which will not hear the distributor's plea as to the amount of care he has used. Cf. United States v. Balint, \n258 \nU.S. 250, 252\n-253, 254. His ignorance of the character of the food is irrelevant. There is no specific constitutional inhibition against making the distributors of food the strictest censors of their merchandise, but the constitutional guarantees of the freedom of speech and of the \n\n[361 \nU.S. 147, 153]\n\u00a0\n press stand in the way of imposing a similar requirement on the bookseller. By dispensing with any requirement of knowledge of the contents of the book on the part of the seller, the ordinance tends to impose a severe limitation on the public's access to constitutionally protected matter. For if the bookseller is criminally liable without knowledge of the contents, and the ordinance fulfills its purpose,\n8\n he will tend to restrict the books he sells to those he has inspected; and thus the State will have imposed a restriction upon the distribution of constitutionally protected as well as obscene literature. It has been well observed of a statute construed as dispensing with any requirement of scienter that: \"Every bookseller would be placed under an obligation to make himself aware of the contents of every book in his shop. It would be altogether unreasonable to demand so near an approach to omniscience.\"\n9\n The King v. Ewart, 25 N. Z. L. R. 709. 729 (C. A.). And the bookseller's burden would become the public's burden, for by restricting him the public's access to reading matter would be restricted. If the contents of bookshops and periodical stands were restricted to material of which their proprietors had made an inspection, they might be depleted indeed. The bookseller's \n\n[361 \nU.S. 147, 154]\n\u00a0\n limitation in the amount of reading material with which he could familiarize himself, and his timidity in the face of his absolute criminal liability, thus would tend to restrict the public's access to forms of the printed word which the State could not constitutionally suppress directly. The bookseller's self-censorship, compelled by the State, would be a censorship affecting the whole public, hardly less virulent for being privately administered. Through it, the distribution of all books, both obscene and not obscene, would be impeded.\n\nIt is argued that unless the scienter requirement is dispensed with, regulation of the distribution of obscene material will be ineffective, as booksellers will falsely disclaim knowledge of their books' contents or falsely deny reason to suspect their obscenity. We might observe that it has been some time now since the law viewed itself as impotent to explore the actual state of a man's mind. See Pound, The Role of the Will in Law, 68 Harv. L. Rev. 1. Cf. American Communications Assn. v. Douds, \n339 \nU.S. 382, 411\n. Eyewitness testimony of a bookseller's perusal of a book hardly need be a necessary element in proving his awareness of its contents. The circumstances may warrant the inference that he was aware of what a book contained, despite his denial.\n\nWe need not and most definitely do not pass today on what sort of mental element is requisite to a constitutionally permissible prosecution of a bookseller for carrying an obscene book in stock; whether honest mistake as to whether its contents in fact constituted obscenity need be an excuse; whether there might be circumstances under which the State constitutionally might require that a bookseller investigate further, or might put on him the burden of explaining why he did not, and what such circumstances might be. Doubtless any form of criminal obscenity statute applicable to a bookseller will induce some tendency to self-censorship and have some inhibitory \n\n[361 \nU.S. 147, 155]\n\u00a0\n effect on the dissemination of material not obscene, but we consider today only one which goes to the extent of eliminating all mental elements from the crime.\n\nWe have said: \"The fundamental freedoms of speech and press have contributed greatly to the development and well-being of our free society and are indispensable to its continued growth. Ceaseless vigilance is the watchword to prevent their erosion by Congress or by the States. The door barring federal and state intrusion into this area cannot be left ajar; it must be kept tightly closed and opened only the slightest crack necessary to prevent encroachment upon more important interests.\" Roth v. United States, supra, at 488.\n10\n This ordinance opens that door too far. The existence of the State's power to prevent the distribution of obscene matter does not mean that there can be no constitutional barrier to any form of practical exercise of that power. Cf. Dean Milk Co. v. City of Madison, \n340 \nU.S. 349\n. It is plain to us that the ordinance in question, though aimed at obscene matter, has such a tendency to inhibit constitutionally protected expression that it cannot stand under the Constitution.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The ordinance is 41.01.1 of the Municipal Code of the City of Los Angeles. It provides: \"INDECENT WRITINGS, ETC. - POSSESSION PROHIBITED: \"It shall be unlawful for any person to have in his possession any obscene or indecent writing, book, pamphlet, picture, photograph, drawing, figure, motion picture film, phonograph recording, wire recording or transcription of any kind in any of the following places: \"1. In any school, school-grounds, public park or playground or in any public place, grounds, street or way within 300 yards of any school, park or playground; \"2. In any place of business where ice-cream, soft drinks, candy, food, school supplies, magazines, books, pamphlets, papers, pictures or postcards are sold or kept for sale; \"3. In any toilet or restroom open to the public; \"4. In any poolroom or billiard parlor, or in any place where alcoholic liquor is sold or offered for sale to the public; \"5. In any place where phonograph records, photographs, motion pictures, or transcriptions of any kind are made, used, maintained, sold or exhibited.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] In this sort of proceeding, \"the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had.\" 28 U.S.C. 1257.

The Appellate Department's opinion is at 161 Cal. App. 2d Supp. 860, 327 P.2d 636. The ordinance's elimination of scienter was, in fact, a reason assigned by that court for upholding it as permissible supplementary municipal legislation against the contention that the field was occupied by California Penal Code 311, a state-wide obscenity statute which requires scienter.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] These other contentions, which are made again here, are that evidence of a nature constitutionally required to be allowed to be given for the defense as to the obscene character of a book was not permitted to be introduced; that a constitutionally impermissible standard of obscenity was applied by the trier of the facts; and that the book was not in fact obscene. In the light of our determination as to the constitutional permissibility of a strict liability law under the circumstances presented by this case, we need not pass on these questions. For the purposes of discussion, we shall assume without deciding that the book was correctly adjudged below to be obscene.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] See also Williams, Criminal Law - The General Part, p. 238 et seq.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] See Note, 61 Harv.

California. which dealt with the power of the States in this area.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] The effectiveness of absolute criminal liability laws in promoting caution has been subjected to criticism.

United States, \n342 \nU.S. 246\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Common-law prosecutions for the dissemination of obscene matter strictly adhered to the requirement of scienter. See the discussion in Attorney General v. Simpson, 93 Irish L. T. 33, 37-38 (Dist. Ct.). Cf. Obscene Publications Act, 1959, 7 & 8 Eliz. 2, c. 66, 2 (5); American Law Institute Model Penal Code 207.10 (7) (Tentative Draft No. 6, May 1957), and Comments, pp. 49-51. The general California obscenity statute, Penal Code 311, requires scienter, see note 3, and was of course sustained by us in Roth v. United States, supra. See note 7.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] We emphasized in Roth, at p. 484, that there is a \"limited area\" where such other interests prevail, and we listed representative decisions in note 14 at that page.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, concurring.\n\nThe appellant was sentenced to prison for possessing in his bookstore an \"obscene\" book in violation of a Los Angeles city ordinance.\n1\n I concur in the judgment holding that ordinance unconstitutional, but not for the reasons given in the Court's opinion. \n\n[361 \nU.S. 147, 156]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Court invalidates the ordinance solely because it penalizes a bookseller for mere possession of an \"obscene\" book, even though he is unaware of its obscenity. The grounds on which the Court draws a constitutional distinction between a law that punishes possession of a book with knowledge of its \"obscenity\" and a law that punishes without such knowledge are not persuasive to me. Those grounds are that conviction of a bookseller for possession of an \"obscene\" book when he is unaware of its obscenity \"will tend to restrict the books he sells to those he has inspected,\" and therefore \"may tend to work a substantial restriction on freedom of speech.\" The fact is, of course, that prison sentences for possession of \"obscene\" books will seriously burden freedom of the press whether punishment is imposed with or without knowledge of the obscenity. The Court's opinion correctly points out how little extra burden will be imposed on prosecutors by requiring proof that a bookseller was aware of a book's contents when he possessed it. And if the Constitution's requirement of knowledge is so easily met, the result of this case is that one particular bookseller gains his freedom, but the way is left open for state censorship and punishment of all other booksellers by merely adding a few new words to old censorship laws. Our constitutional safeguards for speech and press therefore gain little. Their victory, if any, is a Pyrrhic one. Cf. Beauharnais v. Illinois, \n343 \nU.S. 250, 267\n, at 275 (dissenting opinion).\n\nThat it is apparently intended to leave the way open for both federal and state governments to abridge speech and press (to the extent this Court approves) is also indicated by the following statements in the Court's opinion: \"`The door barring federal and state intrusion into this area [freedom of speech and press] cannot be left ajar; it must be kept tightly closed and opened only the slightest crack necessary to prevent encroachment upon more important interests.' . . . This ordinance opens that door too far.\" \n\n[361 \nU.S. 147, 157]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThis statement raises a number of questions for me. What are the \"more important\" interests for the protection of which constitutional freedom of speech and press must be given second place? What is the standard by which one can determine when abridgment of speech and press goes \"too far\" and when it is slight enough to be constitutionally allowable? Is this momentous decision to be left to a majority of this Court on a case-by-case basis? What express provision or provisions of the Constitution put freedom of speech and press in this precarious position of subordination and insecurity?\n\nCertainly the First Amendment's language leaves no room for inference that abridgments of speech and press can be made just because they are slight. That Amendment provides, in simple words, that \"Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.\" I read \"no law . . . abridging\" to mean no law abridging. The First Amendment, which is the supreme law of the land, has thus fixed its own value on freedom of speech and press by putting these freedoms wholly \"beyond the reach\" of federal power to abridge.\n2\n No \n\n[361 \nU.S. 147, 158]\n\u00a0\n other provision of the Constitution purports to dilute the scope of these unequivocal commands of the First Amendment. Consequently, I do not believe that any federal agencies, including Congress and this Court, have power \n\n[361 \nU.S. 147, 159]\n\u00a0\n or authority to subordinate speech and press to what they think are \"more important interests.\" The contrary notion is, in my judgment, court-made not Constitution-made.\n\nState intrusion or abridgment of freedom of speech and press raises a different question, since the First Amendment by its terms refers only to laws passed by Congress. But I adhere to our prior decisions holding that the Fourteenth Amendment made the First applicable to the States. See cases collected in the concurring opinion in Speiser v. Randall, \n357 \nU.S. 513, 530\n. It follows that I am for reversing this case because I believe that the Los Angeles ordinance sets up a censorship in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\nIf, as it seems, we are on the way to national censorship, I think it timely to suggest again that there are grave doubts in my mind as to the desirability or constitutionality of this Court's becoming a Supreme Board of Censors - reading books and viewing television performances to determine whether, if permitted, they might adversely affect the morals of the people throughout the many diversified local communities in this vast country.\n3\n\u00a0\n\n[361 \nU.S. 147, 160]\n\u00a0\n It is true that the ordinance here is on its face only applicable to \"obscene or indecent writing.\" It is also true that this particular kind of censorship is considered by many to be \"the obnoxious thing in its mildest and least repulsive form . . . .\" But \"illegitimate and unconstitutional practices get their first footing in that way . . . . It is the duty of courts to be watchful for the constitutional rights of the citizen, and against any stealthy encroachments thereon.\" Boyd v. United States, \n116 \nU.S. 616, 635\n. While it is \"obscenity and indecency\" before us today, the experience of mankind - both ancient and modern - shows that this type of elastic phrase can, and most likely will, be synonymous with the political and maybe with the religious unorthodoxy of tomorrow.\n\nCensorship is the deadly enemy of freedom and progress. The plain language of the Constitution forbids it. I protest against the Judiciary giving it a foothold here.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] As shown by Note 1 of the Court's opinion, the ordinance makes it unlawful to possess at places defined any obscene or indecent writing, book, pamphlet, picture, photograph, drawing, figure, motion picture film, phonograph recording, wire recording or transcription of any kind.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Another concurring opinion has said that it would wrong James Madison and Thomas Jefferson to attribute to them the view that the First Amendment places speech wholly beyond the reach of the Federal Government. Of course, both men made many statements on the subject of freedom of speech and press during their long lives and no one can define their precise views with complete certainty. However, several statements by both Madison and Jefferson indicate that they may have held the view that the concurring opinion terms \"doctrinaire absolutism.\" James Madison, in exploring the sweep of the First Amendment's limitation on the Federal Government when he offered the Bill of Rights to Congress in 1789, is reported as having said, \"[t]he right of freedom of speech is secured; the liberty of the press is expressly declared to be beyond the reach of this Government . . . .\" (Emphasis supplied.) 1 Annals of Cong. 738. For reports of other discussions by Mr. Madison see pp. 424-449, 660, 704-756. Eleven years later he wrote: \"Without tracing farther the evidence on this subject, \n\n[361 \nU.S. 147, 158]\n\u00a0\n it would seem scarcely possible to doubt that no power whatever over the press was supposed to be delegated by the Constitution, as it originally stood, and that the amendment was intended as a positive and absolute reservation of it.\" 6 Madison, Writings (Hunt ed. 1906), 341, 391, and see generally, 385-393, 399. Thomas Jefferson's views of the breadth of the First Amendment's prohibition against abridgment of speech and press by the Federal Government are illustrated by the following statement he made in 1798: \"[The First Amendment] thereby guard[s] in the same sentence, and under the same words, the freedom of religion, of speech, and of the press: insomuch, that whatever violates either, throws down the sanctuary which covers the others, and that libels, falsehood, and defamation, equally with heresy and false religion, are withheld from the cognizance of federal tribunals.\" 8 Jefferson, Writings (Ford ed. 1904), 464-465. For another early discussion of the scope of the First Amendment as a complete bar to all federal abridgment of speech and press see St. George Tucker's comments on the adequacy of state forums and state laws to grant all the protection needed against defamation and libel. 1 Blackstone, Commentaries (Tucker ed. 1803) 299. Of course, neither Jefferson nor Madison faced the problem before the Court in this case, because it was not until the Fourteenth Amendment was passed that any of the prohibitions of the First Amendment were held applicable to the States. At the time Jefferson and Madison lived, before the Fourteenth Amendment was passed, the First Amendment did not prohibit the States from abridging free speech by the enactment of defamation or libel laws. Cf. Barron v. Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243. But the meaning of the First Amendment, as it was understood by two such renowned constitutional architects as Jefferson and Madison, is important in this case because of our prior cases holding that the Fourteenth Amendment applies the First, with all the force it brings to bear against the Federal Government, against the States. See, e. g., West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, \n319 \nU.S. 624, 639\n, and other cases collected in Speiser v. Randall, \n357 \nU.S. 513, 530\n (concurring opinion). But see Beauharnais v. Illinois, \n343 \nU.S. 250, 288\n (Court and dissenting opinions).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Kingsley International Pictures Corp. v. Regents of the University of New York, \n360 \nU.S. 684, 690\n-691 (concurring opinion). The views of a concurring opinion here, if accepted, would make this Court a still more inappropriate \"Board of Censors\" for the whole country. That opinion, conceding that \"[t]here is no external measuring rod of obscenity,\" argues that the Constitution requires the issue of obscenity to be determined on the basis of \"contemporary community standards\" - \"the literary, psychological or moral standards of a community.\" If, as argued in the concurring opinion, it violates the Federal Constitution for a local court to reject the evidence of \"experts\" on contemporary community standards of the vague word \"obscenity,\" it seems odd to say that this Court should have the final word on what those community standards are or should be. I do not believe the words \"liberty\" and \"due process\" in the Fourteenth Amendment give this Court that much power.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, concurring.\n\nThe appellant was convicted of violating the city ordinance of Los Angeles prohibiting possession of obscene books in a bookshop. His conviction was affirmed by the highest court of California to which he could appeal and it is the judgment of that court that we are asked to reverse. Appellant claims three grounds of invalidity under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. He urges the invalidity of the ordinance as an abridgment of the freedom of speech which the guarantee of \"liberty\" of the Fourteenth Amendment safeguards against state action, and this for the reason that California law holds a bookseller criminally liable for possessing an obscene book, wholly apart from any scienter on his part regarding the book's obscenity. The second constitutional infirmity urged by appellant is the exclusion of appropriately offered testimony through duly qualified witnesses regarding the prevailing literary standards \n\n[361 \nU.S. 147, 161]\n\u00a0\n and the literary and moral criteria by which books relevantly comparable to the book in controversy are deemed not obscene. This exclusion deprived the appellant, such is the claim, of important relevant testimony bearing on the issue of obscenity and therefore restricted him in making his defense. The appellant's ultimate contention is that the questioned book is not obscene and that a bookseller's possession of it could not be forbidden.\n\nThe Court does not reach, and neither do I, the issue of obscenity. The Court disposes of the case exclusively by sustaining the appellant's claim that the \"liberty\" protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment precludes a State from making the dissemination of obscene books an offense merely because a book in a bookshop is found to be obscene without some proof of the bookseller's knowledge touching the obscenity of its contents.\n\nThe Court accepts the settled principle of constitutional law that traffic in obscene literature may be outlawed as a crime. But it holds that one cannot be made amenable to such criminal outlawry unless he is chargeable with knowledge of the obscenity. Obviously the Court is not holding that a bookseller must familiarize himself with the contents of every book in his shop. No less obviously, the Court does not hold that a bookseller who insulates himself against knowledge about an offending book is thereby free to maintain an emporium for smut. How much or how little awareness that a book may be found to be obscene suffices to establish scienter, or what kind of evidence may satisfy the how much or the how little, the Court leaves for another day.\n\nI am no friend of deciding a case beyond what the immediate controversy requires, particularly when the limits of constitutional power are at stake. On the other hand, a case before this Court is not just a case. Inevitably its disposition carries implications and gives directions \n\n[361 \nU.S. 147, 162]\n\u00a0\n beyond its particular facts. Were the Court holding that this kind of prosecution for obscenity requires proof of the guilty mind associated with the concept of crimes deemed infamous, that would be that and no further elucidation would be needed. But if the requirement of scienter in obscenity cases plays a role different from the normal role of mens rea in the definition of crime, a different problem confronts the Court. If, as I assume, the requirement of scienter in an obscenity prosecution like the one before us does not mean that the bookseller must have read the book or must substantially know its contents on the one hand, nor on the other that he can exculpate himself by studious avoidance of knowledge about its contents, then, I submit, invalidating an obscenity statute because a State dispenses altogether with the requirement of scienter does require some indication of the scope and quality of scienter that is required. It ought at least to be made clear, and not left for future litigation, that the Court's decision in its practical effect is not intended to nullify the conceded power of the State to prohibit booksellers from trafficking in obscene literature.\n\nOf course there is an important difference in the scope of the power of a State to regulate what feeds the belly and what feeds the brain. The doctrine of United States v. Balint, \n258 \nU.S. 250\n, has its appropriate limits. The rule that scienter is not required in prosecutions for so-called public welfare offenses is a limitation on the general principle that awareness of what one is doing is a prerequisite for the infliction of punishment. See Morissette v. United States, \n342 \nU.S. 246\n. The balance that is struck between this vital principle and the overriding public menace inherent in the trafficking in noxious food and drugs cannot be carried over in balancing the vital role of free speech as against society's interest in dealing with pornography. On the other hand, the constitutional \n\n[361 \nU.S. 147, 163]\n\u00a0\n protection of non-obscene speech cannot absorb the constitutional power of the States to deal with obscenity. It would certainly wrong them to attribute to Jefferson or Madison a doctrinaire absolutism that would bar legal restriction against obscenity as a denial of free speech.\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[361 \nU.S. 147, 164]\n\u00a0\n We have not yet been told that all laws against defamation and against inciting crime by speech, see Fox v. Washington, \n236 \nU.S. 273\n (1915), are unconstitutional as impermissible curbs upon unrestrictable utterance. We know this was not Jefferson's view, any more than it was the view of Holmes and Brandeis, JJ., the originating architects of our prevailing constitutional law protective of freedom of speech.\n\nAccordingly, the proof of scienter that is required to make prosecutions for obscenity constitutional cannot be of a nature to nullify for all practical purposes the power of the State to deal with obscenity. Out of regard for the State's interest, the Court suggests an unguiding, vague standard for establishing \"awareness\" by the bookseller of the contents of a challenged book in contradiction of his disclaimer of knowledge of its contents. A bookseller may, of course, be well aware of the nature of a book and its appeal without having opened its cover, or, in any true sense, having knowledge of the book. As a practical matter therefore the exercise of the constitutional right of a State to regulate obscenity will carry with it some hazard to the dissemination by a bookseller of non-obscene literature. Such difficulties or hazards are inherent in many domains of the law for the simple reason that law cannot avail itself of factors ascertained quantitatively or even wholly impersonally.\n\nThe uncertainties pertaining to the scope of scienter requisite for an obscenity prosecution and the speculative proof that the issue is likely to entail, are considerations that reinforce the right of one charged with obscenity - a right implicit in the very nature of the legal concept of obscenity - to enlighten the judgment of the tribunal, \n\n[361 \nU.S. 147, 165]\n\u00a0\n be it the jury or as in this case the judge, regarding the prevailing literary and moral community standards and to do so through qualified experts. It is immaterial whether the basis of the exclusion of such testimony is irrelevance, or the incompetence of experts to testify to such matters. The two reasons coalesce, for community standards or the psychological or physiological consequences of questioned literature can as a matter of fact hardly be established except through experts. Therefore, to exclude such expert testimony is in effect to exclude as irrelevant evidence that goes to the very essence of the defense and therefore to the constitutional safeguards of due process. The determination of obscenity no doubt rests with judge or jury. Of course the testimony of experts would not displace judge or jury in determining the ultimate question whether the particular book is obscene, any more than the testimony of experts relating to the state of the art in patent suits determines the patentability of a controverted device.\n\nThere is no external measuring rod for obscenity. Neither, on the other hand, is its ascertainment a merely subjective reflection of the taste or moral outlook of individual jurors or individual judges. Since the law through its functionaries is \"applying contemporary community standards\" in determining what constitutes obscenity, Roth v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 476, 489\n, it surely must be deemed rational, and therefore relevant to the issue of obscenity, to allow light to be shed on what those \"contemporary community standards\" are. Their interpretation ought not to depend solely on the necessarily limited, hit-or-miss, subjective view of what they are believed to be by the individual juror or judge. It bears repetition that the determination of obscenity is for juror or judge not on the basis of his personal upbringing or restricted reflection or particular experience of life, but on the basis of \"contemporary community standards.\" Can \n\n[361 \nU.S. 147, 166]\n\u00a0\n it be doubted that there is a great difference in what is to be deemed obscene in 1959 compared with what was deemed obscene in 1859? The difference derives from a shift in community feeling regarding what is to be deemed prurient or not prurient by reason of the effects attributable to this or that particular writing. Changes in the intellectual and moral climate of society, in part doubtless due to the views and findings of specialists, afford shifting foundations for the attribution. What may well have been consonant \"with mid-Victorian morals, does not seem to me to answer to the understanding and morality of the present time.\" United States v. Kennerley, 209 F. 119, 120. This was the view of Judge Learned Hand decades ago reflecting an atmosphere of propriety much closer to mid-Victorian days than is ours. Unless we disbelieve that the literary, psychological or moral standards of a community can be made fruitful and illuminating subjects of inquiry by those who give their life to such inquiries, it was violative of \"due process\" to exclude the constitutionally relevant evidence proffered in this case. The importance of this type of evidence in prosecutions for obscenity has been impressively attested by the recent debates in the House of Commons dealing with the insertion of such a provision in the enactment of the Obscene Publications Act, 1959, 7 & 8 Eliz. 2, Ch. 66\n2\n (see 597 Parliamentary Debates, H. Comm., No. 36 (December \n\n[361 \nU.S. 147, 167]\n\u00a0\n 16, 1958), cols. 1009-1010, 1042-1043; 604 Parliamentary Debates, H. Comm., No. 100 (April 24, 1959), col. 803), as well as by the most considered thinking on this subject in the proposed Model Penal Code of the American Law Institute. See A. L. I. Model Penal Code, Tentative Draft No. 6 (1957), 207.10.\n3\n For the reasons I have indicated, I would make the right to introduce such evidence a requirement of due process in obscenity prosecutions.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The publication of obscene printed matter was clearly established as a common-law offense in England in 1727 by the case of Rex v. Curl, 2 Str. 788, which overruled Reg. v. Read, 1708. 11 Mod. 142, where it had been held that such offenses were exclusively within the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts. See also Rex v. Wilkes, 1770. 4 Burr. 2527. The common-law liability was carried across the Atlantic before the United States was established and appears early in the States. In 1786, in New York, a copyright act specifically stated that \"nothing in this Act shall . . . authorise any Person or Persons to . . . publish any Book . . . that may be profane, treasonable, defamatory, or injurious to Government, Morals or Religion.\" An Act to Promote Literature, Act of April 29, 1786, c. LIV, IV, 1 Laws of New York (Jones and Varick) (1777-1789) 321. In Pennsylvania, in 1815, a prosecution was founded on common-law liability. Commonwealth v. Sharpless, 2 Serg. & Rawle, 91. And in Maryland, when a statute regulating obscene publications was enacted in 1853, it was recited that \"although in the judgment of the Legislature, such advertisements and publications are contra bonos mores, and punishable by the common law, it is desirable that the common law in this regard be re-enacted and enforced; . . .\" Act of May 16, 1853, Md. Laws 1853, c. 183. Moreover, as early as the eleventh year of the reign of Queen Anne (1711-1712), well before the jurisdiction at common law emerged in England, Massachusetts enacted a statute which provided \"[t]hat whosoever shall be convicted of composing, writing, printing or publishing, of any filthy obscene or prophane Song, Pamphlet . . . shall be punished . . . .\" Acts of 1711-1712, c. I, Charter of the Province of the Massachusetts-Bay, p. 172 (1759). It is unclear whether the well-known prosecution in Massachusetts in 1821, Commonwealth v. Holmes, 17 Mass. *336, was founded on this statute or on common-law liability, although in 1945 the Supreme Judicial Court indicated that it regarded this early statute as having been in effect until a successor enactment of 1835, Revised Statutes of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, c. 130, 10 (1836). Commonwealth v. Isenstadt, 318 Mass. 543, 547, 62 N. E. 2d 840, 843, n. 1. See also Grant and Angoff, Massachusetts and Censorship, III, 10 B. U. L. Rev. 147 \n\n[361 \nU.S. 147, 164]\n\u00a0\n (1930). Thereafter the offense was made statutory in other States. See, e. g., Act of March 14, 1848, c. VIII, 7 (1847-1848), Va. Laws 111; Act of May 16, 1853, c. 183 (1853), Laws of Maryland 212; Act of April 28, 1868, c. 430, 7 N. Y. Stat. at Large (1867-1870) 309.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 4 of this Act provides: \"(1) A person shall not be convicted of an offense against . . . this Act . . . if it is proved that publication of the article in question is justified as being for the public good on the ground that it is in the interests of science, literature, art or learning, or of other objects of general concern. \"(2) It is hereby declared that the opinion of experts as to the literary, artistic, scientific or other merits of an article may be admitted in any proceedings under this Act either to establish or to negative the said ground.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Subsection (2) of this draft section provides in part: \". . . In any prosecution for an offense under this section evidence shall be admissible to show: \"(a) the character of the audience for which the material was designed or to which it was directed; \"(b) what the predominant appeal of the material would be for ordinary adults or a special audience, and what effect, if any, it would probably have on behavior of such people; \"(c) artistic, literary, scientific, educational or other merits of the material; \"(d) the degree of public acceptance of the material in this country; \"(e) appeal to prurient interest, or absence thereof, in advertising or other promotion of the material; .  .  .  .  . \"Expert testimony and testimony of the author, creator or publisher relating to factors entering into the determination of the issue of obscenity shall be admissible.\"\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, concurring.\n\nI need not repeat here all I said in my dissent in Roth v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 476, 508\n, to underline my conviction that neither the author nor the distributor of this book can be punished under our Bill of Rights for publishing or distributing it. The notion that obscene publications or utterances were not included in free speech developed in this country much later than the adoption of the First Amendment, as the judicial and legislative \n\n[361 \nU.S. 147, 168]\n\u00a0\n developments in this country show. Our leading authorities on the subject have summarized the matter as follows:\n\n \"In the United States before the Civil War there were few reported decisions involving obscene literature. This of course is no indication that such literature was not in circulation at that time; the persistence of pornography is entirely too strong to warrant such an inference. Nor is it an indication that the people of the time were totally indifferent to the proprieties of the literature they read. In 1851 Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter was bitterly attacked as an immoral book that degraded literature and encouraged social licentiousness. The lack of cases merely means that the problem of obscene literature was not thought to be of sufficient importance to justify arousing the forces of the state to censorship.\" Lockhart and McClure, Literature, The Law of Obscenity, and the Constitution, 38 Minn. L. Rev. 295, 324-325.\n\n\n Neither we nor legislatures have power, as I see it, to weigh the values of speech or utterance against silence. The only grounds for suppressing this book are very narrow. I have read it; and while it is repulsive to me, its publication or distribution can be constitutionally punished only on a showing not attempted here. My view was stated in the Roth case, at 514:\n\n \"Freedom of expression can be suppressed if, and to the extent that, it is so closely brigaded with illegal action as to be an inseparable part of it. Giboney v. Empire Storage Co., \n336 \nU.S. 490, 498\n; Labor Board v. Virginia Power Co., \n314 \nU.S. 469, 477\n-478. As a people, we cannot afford to relax that standard. For the test that suppresses a cheap tract today can suppress a literary gem tomorrow. All it need do is \n\n[361 \nU.S. 147, 169]\n\u00a0\n to incite a lascivious thought or arouse a lustful desire. The list of books that judges or juries can place in that category is endless.\"\n\n\n Yet my view is in the minority; and rather fluid tests of obscenity prevail which require judges to read condemned literature and pass judgment on it. This role of censor in which we find ourselves is not an edifying one. But since by the prevailing school of thought we must perform it, I see no harm, and perhaps some good, in the rule fashioned by the Court which requires a showing of scienter. For it recognizes implicitly that these First Amendment rights, by reason of the strict command in that Amendment - a command that carries over to the States by reason of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment - are preferred rights. What the Court does today may possibly provide some small degree of safeguard to booksellers by making those who patrol bookstalls proceed less highhandedly than has been their custom.\n*\n\u00a0\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] See Chafee, Free Speech in the United States (1941), pp. 536-540; Lockhart and McClure, Literature, The Law of Obscenity, and the Constitution, 38 Minn.

JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\nThe striking down of local legislation is always serious business for this Court. In my opinion in the Roth case. \n354 \nU.S., at 503\n-508, I expressed the view that state power in the obscenity field has a wider scope than federal power. The question whether scienter is a constitutionally required element in a criminal obscenity statute is \n\n[361 \nU.S. 147, 170]\n\u00a0\n intimately related to the constitutional scope of the power to bar material as obscene, for the impact of such a requirement on effective prosecution may be one thing where the scope of the power to proscribe is broad and quite another where the scope is narrow. Proof of scienter may entail no great burden in the case of obviously obscene material; it may, however, become very difficult where the character of the material is more debatable. In my view then, the scienter question involves considerations of a different order depending on whether a state or a federal statute is involved. We have here a state ordinance, and on the meagre data before us I would not reach the question whether the absence of a scienter element renders the ordinance unconstitutional. I must say, however, that the generalities in the Court's opinion striking down the ordinance leave me unconvinced.\n\nFrom the point of view of the free dissemination of constitutionally protected ideas, the Court invalidates the ordinance on the ground that its effect may be to induce booksellers to restrict their offerings of nonobscene literary merchandise through fear of prosecution for unwittingly having on their shelves an obscene publication. From the point of view of the State's interest in protecting its citizens against the dissemination of obscene material, the Court in effect says that proving the state of a man's mind is little more difficult than proving the state of his digestion, but also intimates that a relaxed standard of mens rea would satisfy constitutional requirements. This is for me too rough a balancing of the competing interests at stake. Such a balancing is unavoidably required in this kind of constitutional adjudication, notwithstanding that it arises in the domain of liberty of speech and press. A more critical appraisal of both sides of the constitutional balance, not possible on the meagre material before us, \n\n[361 \nU.S. 147, 171]\n\u00a0\n seems to me required before the ordinance can be struck down on this ground. For, as the concurring opinions of my Brothers BLACK and FRANKFURTER show, the conclusion that this ordinance, but not one embodying some element of scienter, is likely to restrict the dissemination of legitimate literature seems more dialectical than real.\n\nI am also not persuaded that the ordinance in question was unconstitutionally applied in this instance merely because of the state court's refusal to admit expert testimony. I agree with my Brother FRANKFURTER that the trier of an obscenity case must take into account \"contemporary community standards,\" Roth v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 476, 489\n. This means that, regardless of the elements of the offense under state law, the Fourteenth Amendment does not permit a conviction such as was obtained here\n1\n unless the work complained of is found substantially to exceed the limits of candor set by contemporary community standards.\n2\n The community cannot, where liberty of speech and press are at issue, condemn that which it generally tolerates. This being so, it follows that due process - \"using that term in its primary sense of an opportunity to be heard and to defend [a] . . . substantive right,\" Brinkerhoff-Faris Co. v. Hill, \n281 \nU.S. 673, 678\n - requires a State to allow a litigant \n\n[361 \nU.S. 147, 172]\n\u00a0\n in some manner to introduce proof on this score. While a State is not debarred from regarding the trier of fact as the embodiment of community standards, competent to judge a challenged work against those standards,\n3\n it is not privileged to rebuff all efforts to enlighten or persuade the trier.\n\nHowever, I would not hold that any particular kind of evidence must be admitted, specifically, that the Constitution requires that oral opinion testimony by experts be heard. There are other ways in which proof can be made, as this very case demonstrates. Appellant attempted to compare the contents of the work with that of other allegedly similar publications which were openly published, sold and purchased, and which received wide general acceptance. Where there is a variety of means, even though it may be considered that expert testimony is the most convenient and practicable method of proof, I think it is going too far to say that such a method is constitutionally compelled, and that a State may not conclude, for reasons responsive to its traditional doctrines of evidence law, that the issue of community standards may not be the subject of expert testimony. I know of no case where this Court, on constitutional grounds, has required a State to sanction a particular mode of proof.\n\nIn my opinion this conviction is fatally defective in that the trial judge, as I read the record, turned aside every attempt by appellant to introduce evidence bearing on community standards. The exclusionary rulings were not limited to offered expert testimony. This had the effect of depriving appellant of the opportunity to offer any proof on a constitutionally relevant issue. On this ground I would reverse the judgment below, and remand the case for a new trial.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] We are concerned in this instance with an objection to what a book portrays, not to what it teaches. Cf. Kingsley Pictures Corp. v. Regents, \n360 \nU.S. 684\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The most notable expression of this limitation is that of Judge Learned Hand, in United States v. Kennerley, 209 F. 119, 121: \"If there be no abstract definition, . . . should not the word `obscene' be allowed to indicate the present critical point in the compromise between candor and shame at which the community may have arrived here and now?\" See also the exposition of this view in American Law Institute, Model Penal Code (Tentative Draft No. 6), at p. 30.

With him on the brief was Marion Rushton.\n\nLeon Silverman argued the cause for the United States. On the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Anderson, Beatrice Rosenberg and Kirby W. Patterson.\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe petitioner seeks relief under 28 U.S.C. 2255 from his conviction and sentence for violation of the Federal Kidnapping Act, 18 U.S.C. 1201. Briefly, the kidnapping charge grew out of the following facts: Petitioner, a young man of twenty-six, and two seventeen-year-old boys, while in custody under state charges, escaped from a Florida jail on November 12, 1949. They were almost immediately pursued by men and bloodhounds through swampy everglade terrain. On November 14, 1949, they allegedly pre-empted an automobile and seized its owner forcing him to accompany them into the State of Alabama where they released the victim without harming him and subsequently abandoned the car. On November 18, 1949, the defendants were arrested by federal authorities in a hiding place under the floor of a building. Petitioner claimed that he was weak from lack of food and sleep and that his back had been injured in the course of the escape. The defendants were taken promptly before the United States Commissioner where they were charged with transporting a kidnapping victim across state boundaries.\n\nOn the following day, petitioner was interviewed at length by a government agent concerning both the kidnapping offense and his prior record. There was a conflict in the evidence concerning what transpired at this interview. The petitioner testified that he was promised leniency if he would plead guilty and that he was assured \n\n[360 \nU.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n that the juveniles would be given no more than four years' imprisonment if they pleaded guilty. The Government offered evidence to the effect that no promises were made. In any event, on Monday morning, November 21, 1949, petitioner and his codefendants were brought by the government agent to the office of the United States Attorney where a discussion ensued concerning waivers of indictments, counsel, and venue, and pleas of guilty to an information which the United States Attorney proposed to file.\n\nWhile that conference was proceeding, the government agent who had previously interviewed petitioner had a private out-of-court audience and conference with the district judge in his chambers at which, in the absence of the defendants, he discussed the contemplated proceedings with the judge and informed him about the alleged kidnapping offense and other alleged crimes of petitioner. Soon thereafter, and, in the words of the Court of Appeals, \"[a]fter the judge's mind had become thoroughly conditioned by this interview with, and the disclosures made to him by, [the government agent] regarding the defendants,\" there followed in open court \"a stilted and formal colloquy consisting of brief and didactic statements by the judge\" that the defendants could have a lawyer if they wished and could have their cases submitted to a grand jury. 238 F.2d 925, 927, n. 5. The defendants, including petitioner, stated that they did not wish to have an attorney and were willing to waive indictment and be prosecuted under an information to be filed by the prosecutor. The information was immediately filed and the defendants waived counsel and venue.\n1\n They then immediately \n\n[360 \nU.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n pleaded guilty to the information and stated that they wanted to be sentenced promptly before their parents knew of their predicaments. The judge then sentenced petitioner to thirty years in the penitentiary and the two seventeen-year-old accomplices to fifteen years each. No appeals were taken.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nBecause of these precipitous and telescoped proceedings, the case has had a long and troublesome history in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. It has been three times before that court. Soon after the sentence was imposed, petitioner filed his initial application under 2255 to vacate the judgment. The application was denied without a hearing and no appeal was taken. In March 1954 petitioner filed a second, similar application which was likewise denied without a hearing, but on appeal the Court of Appeals determined that petitioner's allegations required a hearing. Smith v. United States, 223 F.2d 750. After the hearing was held, the District Court again dismissed the application. 137 F. Supp. 222. Again the Court of Appeals reversed, this time finding that petitioner had been deprived of due process by the summary manner in which the Government had proceeded \n\n[360 \nU.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n against him.\n3\n Smith v. United States, 238 F.2d 925, 930. First the court remanded the cause \"with directions to grant the motion, to set aside the conviction and sentence, and to proceed further and not inconsistently\" with the opinion. 238 F.2d, at 931. On rehearing, however, the court modified its directions as follows:\n\n \"The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded with directions to set aside the conviction and sentence and to proceed further and not inconsistently herewith, including, if the district judge is of the opinion that the ends of justice require it, permitting the defendant to withdraw his waiver of counsel and his plea of guilty and to stand trial.\" 240 F.2d 347.\n\n\n On the remanded proceedings, the District Court resentenced petitioner, but refused him permission to withdraw his waivers and guilty plea. The Court of Appeals \n\n[360 \nU.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n affirmed this decision, Smith v. United States, 250 F.2d 842 over the dissent of Judge Rives who believed that the court's action in setting aside the conviction on justified due process grounds necessarily required the vacation of the plea of guilty. 250 F.2d 842, 843-844. He also dissented on the ground that kidnapping under 18 U.S.C. 1201 is a capital offense, which, pursuant to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 7 (a), requires prosecution by indictment regardless of a defendant's waiver, and that prosecution by information in the instant proceeding had not conferred on the convicting court jurisdiction to try petitioner's case. We granted certiorari because of the serious due process and statutory questions raised. \n357 \nU.S. 904\n. But in view of our belief that the indictment point is dispositive of the case in petitioner's favor, we find it unnecessary to reach the due process questions presented.\n\nThe precise question at issue, therefore, is whether petitioner's alleged violation of the Kidnapping Act had to be prosecuted by indictment. A number of statutory and constitutional provisions and the information charging petitioner are relevant to this inquiry. The Fifth Amendment provides in part that \"[n]o person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury,\" except in cases not pertinent here. But the command of the Amendment may be waived under certain circumstances,\n4\n and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 7 (a), provide as follows:\n\n \"An offense which may be punished by death shall be prosecuted by indictment. An offense which may be punished by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year or at hard labor shall be prosecuted by \n\n[360 \nU.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n indictment or, if indictment is waived, it may be prosecuted by information. Any other offense may be prosecuted by indictment or by information. An information may be filed without leave of court.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n These enactments become particularly pertinent in view of the language of 18 U.S.C. 1201, the statute under which petitioner was convicted, which provides in part that:\n\n \"(a) Whoever knowingly transports in interstate . . . commerce, any person who has been unlawfully . . . kidnapped . . . shall be punished (1) by death if the kidnapped person has not been liberated unharmed, and if the verdict of the jury shall so recommend, or (2) by imprisonment for any term of years or for life, if the death penalty is not imposed.\"\n\n\n The charging part of the information against petitioner stated that he \"did knowingly transport in interstate commerce . . . a person, to wit, Alan W. Spearman, Jr., who had been unlawfully seized, kidnapped, abducted, and carried away and held for the safe conduct of the three defendants . . . .\" The charge did not state whether Spearman was released harmed or unharmed.\n\nIt has been held by two Courts of Appeals that indictments similar in terms to the charge here were sufficient to support capital punishments despite the absence of allegations that the kidnapping victims were released harmed. United States v. Parrino, 180 F.2d 613; Robinson v. United States, 144 F.2d 392. Cf. United States v. Parker, 103 F.2d 857. Petitioner contends that these holdings dispose of his case because they make clear that the statute creates a single offense of kidnapping which may be punished by death if the prosecution, at trial, shows that the victim was released in a harmed condition. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n The Government claims, however, that whether a specific kidnapping constitutes a capital offense requires examination of the evidence to determine whether the victim was released harmed or unharmed; in other words, that the statute creates two offenses: kidnapping without harm, which is punishable by a term of years, and kidnapping with harm, which is punishable by death. Further, the Government contends that the mere filing of an information by the United States Attorney eliminated the capital element of the crime.\n\nThe Courts of Appeals which have been concerned with the statute have uniformly construed it to create the single offense of transporting a kidnapping victim across state lines. We agree with this construction. Under the statute, that offense is punishable by death if certain proof is introduced at trial. When an accused is charged, as here, with transporting a kidnapping victim across state lines, he is charged and will be tried for an offense which may be punished by death. Although the imposition of that penalty will depend on whether sufficient proof of harm is introduced during the trial, that circumstance does not alter the fact that the offense itself is one which may be punished by death and thus must be prosecuted by indictment. In other words, when the offense as charged is sufficiently broad to justify a capital verdict, the trial must proceed on that basis, even though the evidence later establishes that such a verdict cannot be sustained because the victim was released unharmed. It is neither procedurally correct nor practical to await the conclusion of the evidence to determine whether the accused is being prosecuted for a capital offense. For the trial judge must make informed decisions prior to trial which will depend on whether the offense may be so punished. He must decide, among other things, whether the accused has the right to obtain a list of veniremen and government witnesses, 18 U.S.C. 3432, \n\n[360 \nU.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n whether venue is properly set, 18 U.S.C. 3235, whether the accused has the benefit of twenty rather than ten peremptory challenges, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 24 (b), whether indictment rather than information is necessary, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 7, and who may bail the accused. 18 U.S.C. 3141.\n\nThis Court has, in recent years, upheld many convictions in the face of questions concerning the sufficiency of the charging papers. Convictions are no longer reversed because of minor and technical deficiencies which did not prejudice the accused. E. g., Hagner v. United States, \n285 \nU.S. 427\n; Williams v. United States, \n341 \nU.S. 97\n; United States v. Debrow, \n346 \nU.S. 374\n. This has been a salutary development in the criminal law. But the substantial safeguards to those charged with serious crimes cannot be eradicated under the guise of technical departures from the rules. The use of indictments in all cases warranting serious punishment was the rule at common law. Ex parte Wilson, \n114 \nU.S. 417\n; Mackin v. United States, \n117 \nU.S. 348\n. The Fifth Amendment made the rule mandatory in federal prosecutions in recognition of the fact that the intervention of a grand jury was a substantial safeguard against oppressive and arbitrary proceedings. Ex parte Bain, \n121 \nU.S. 1\n; Hale v. Henkel, \n201 \nU.S. 43\n; Toth v. Quarles, \n350 \nU.S. 11, 16\n. Rule 7 (a) recognizes that this safeguard may be waived, but only in those proceedings which are noncapital. To construe the provisions of the Rule loosely to permit the use of informations where, as here, the charge states a capital offense, would do violence to that Rule and would make vulnerable to summary treatment those accused of one of our most serious crimes. We cannot do this in view of the traditional canon of construction which calls for the strict interpretation of criminal statutes and rules in favor of defendants where substantial rights are involved. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt is urged that this result will fail to protect substantial rights of defendants in other cases. We see no merit in that contention, particularly where the opposite conclusion would deprive defendants of the protection of a grand jury indictment as required by the Constitution and Rule 7 (a). Under our holding, there is no reason to believe that a defendant in a case such as this would be surprised on his trial by any possible trickery of the prosecution. If there is no allegation of harm in the indictment, the discovery proceedings afforded in capital cases and the provisions of Rule 7 (f) authorizing bills of particulars will enable the defendant to acquaint himself with the scope of the trial and the criminal transaction to be proved. It is further suggested that it might be in the interests of the defendant to have the benefit of the speed that can be mustered by the filing of an information instead of an indictment. While justice should be administered with dispatch, the essential ingredient is orderly expedition and not mere speed. It is well to note that in this very case the inordinate speed that was generated through the filing of the information caused many of the difficulties which led the court below to conclude that petitioner had been deprived of due process of law. Moreover, if, contrary to sound judicial administration in our federal system, arrest and incarceration are followed by inordinate delay prior to indictment, a defendant may, under appropriate circumstances, invoke the protection of the Sixth Amendment.\n\nUnder our view of Rule 7 (a), the United States Attorney did not have authority to file an information in this case and the waivers made by petitioner were not binding and did not confer power on the convicting court to hear the case. Cf. Ex parte Wilson, supra. The judgment and conviction are reversed and the case is remanded to the District Court with instructions to dismiss the information.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 18 U.S.C. 3235 provides:\n\n\"The trial of offenses punishable with death shall be had in the county where the offense was committed, where that can be done without great inconvenience.\" \n\n[360 \nU.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 18, provide:\n\n\"Except as otherwise permitted by statute or by these rules, the prosecution shall be had in a district in which the offense was committed, but if the district consists of two or more divisions the trial shall be had in a division in which the offense was committed.\"\n\n\n The offense of which petitioner was accused was committed in Dothan, Alabama, which was within the Southern Division of the District Court. The proceedings against petitioner were held in Montgomery, Alabama, which is located in another county in Alabama in the Northern Division of that court.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] This left petitioner with a substantial sentence still pending in Florida under the charge for which he was in custody when he escaped. In addition, petitioner was apparently still in jeopardy of state prosecution for escaping.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The Court of Appeals stated, at 238 F.2d 930:\n\n\"When it comes to the controlling question, however, which the motion presents, whether under the undisputed facts the defendant was denied due process in the taking of waivers and plea, and the imposition of sentence the matter stands quite differently, and because it is clear that it was not accorded to him, the judgment appealed from must be reversed.\n\n\n\"This is so, because, considering the inordinate speed, the incontinent haste, with which the defendants were brought up for hearing and the trial moved on apace, the fact that the government prosecuting agent and the district judge, before the defendant had made any waivers or pleaded in the cause, conferred privately in chambers with regard to defendants' guilt and the punishment to be imposed therefor, in connection with both what was said and done and what was left unsaid and undone by the judge in taking the waivers and the plea and sentencing the defendant, we are left in no doubt that the movant was not accorded, but was denied, due process, and that the judgment against, and sentence imposed upon him may not stand.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Barkman v. Sanford, 162 F.2d 592; United States v. Gill, 55 F.2d 399. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK, with whom MR. JUSTICE HARLAN and MR. JUSTICE STEWART join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\nJohnny Ray Smith, presently an inmate of Alcatraz, began his career of crime as a juvenile. Soon thereafter he escaped from the Federal Correctional Institution at Tallahassee, Florida. At age 26 he had twice been convicted of violations of the Dyer Act, 18 U.S.C. 2312, was serving 25 years in a Florida prison for armed robbery, and had seriously wounded an officer while fleeing from the scene of the latter crime. He, with two juvenile inmates, escaped the Florida prison, burglarized a house, stole a shotgun, and allegedly kidnaped Alan W. Spearman, Jr., at shotgun point, while the latter was sitting in his company's automobile. They forced Spearman to accompany them in the car across the Florida line into Alabama. There, after the release of Spearman, they abandoned the car and were later arrested in their hiding place under a building. Each admitted guilt and asked for a speedy trial. Smith advised the United States Commissioner, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the prosecutor and the district judge that he did not want a lawyer; he waived indictment and venue, pleaded guilty to an information charging kidnaping and threw himself on the mercy of the court in these words:\n\n\"Well, your Honor, I would like for you to take under consideration that there was no viciousness in connection with this abduction of this boy. We were nice to him and did not harm him any way and we wanted transportation and did not harm him any at all.\"\n\n\n Smith received a 30-year sentence; the juveniles 15 years each. He was sent to Alcatraz and from there has prosecuted a series of motions under 28 U.S.C. 2255, appearing twice to testify in the District Court of Florida. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n The Court of Appeals has considered his case three times and he is now here attacking his sentence on two points. (1) Can a kidnaping charge, where the kidnaped person is released unharmed, be prosecuted by information; and, (2) Is due process violated when the trial judge, before a guilty plea is entered and outside the presence of the accused or his counsel, confers with an FBI agent concerning the facts of the charge and the prior record of the accused? The Court, without reaching the second question, says that kidnaping can be prosecuted only by indictment and that a charge in the general words of the statute is sufficient.\n\nIn attempting to do what it believes to be a great right the Court in reality does a great wrong to the administration of justice. The most serious result is that the Court's procedure allows the United States Attorney to secure an indictment for a capital offense without the grand jury's knowing that he is doing so. This deprives kidnaping defendants of the very protection of the Fifth Amendment that the Court professes to be enforcing. The Court also clouds the meaning of Rule 7 (b) as to waiver of indictment by carving noncapital kidnaping offenses out of its specific permissive terms.\n\nBoth the Fifth Amendment and Rule 7 (a) require capital offenses to be prosecuted by indictment. Kidnaping is not such an offense unless \"the kidnaped person has not been liberated unharmed.\" 18 U.S.C. 1201 (a). It is reasonable to say that before one can be prosecuted for the capital offense he must be charged with it, namely, kidnaping where \"the kidnaped person has not been liberated unharmed.\" To do otherwise does not place him on notice of the offense for which he is to be tried. The Court, however, holds that 1201 (a) creates a \"single offense . . . [which] is punishable by death if certain proof is introduced at trial.\" It reasons that this makes every kidnaping a capital case requiring \n\n[360 \nU.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n grand jury action. But it does not require that the grand jury consider whether \"the kidnaped person has not been liberated unharmed\" and so allege in the indictment. Thus the grand jury is deprived of any knowledge of the element of the offense that makes it capital. Hence a grand jury in complete ignorance of the facts as to harm suffered by the victim at the time of release is required to return an indictment which will support the death penalty if proof of such harm is shown at the trial. This puts the law as to capital cases into the hands of the prosecutor, not the grand jury, where both the Fifth Amendment and Rule 7 (a) have lodged it. Nor does it strengthen the grand jury, to use the words of the Court, as a \"substantial safeguard against oppressive and arbitrary proceedings.\" On the contrary, the Court's reference to discovery proceedings after indictment as a means for acquainting a defendant \"with the scope of the trial and the criminal transaction to be proved\" clearly shows the fallacy of its position. The grand jury should have this information before it returns a capital charge, otherwise, none should exist under the indictment. By this reasoning, the Court deprives the defendant of the safeguard of proper grand jury proceedings as required by the Constitution in capital cases.\n\nMoreover, as the Court says, \"[i]t is neither procedurally correct nor practical to await the conclusion of the evidence to determine whether the accused is being prosecuted for a capital offense.\" Despite this language, the opinion requires just that since it does not compel the indictment to charge \"a capital offense.\" I would require capital kidnaping cases to be prosecuted by indictment charging specifically that the kidnaped person was not liberated unharmed.\n\nTurning to the procedural point under Rule 7 (a) and (b) we should remember it was this Court that adopted these Rules of Criminal Procedure, certified them to the \n\n[360 \nU.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n Congress, which added its sanction, and then promulgated them. They are simple and clear. Rule 7 (a) provides that an offense \"which may\" be punished by death must begin by indictment, while a noncapital offense may be prosecuted by information, if indictment is waived. Rule 7 (b) repeats that an offense \"which may\" receive a sentence for a term of years \"may be\" begun by information \"if the defendant, after he has been advised of the nature of the charge and of his rights, waives in open court prosecution by indictment.\" In filing the information under the Kidnaping Act, the Government forecloses itself from seeking the death penalty. The Fifth Amendment, as well as Rule 7 (a), would prevent it from reneging on this bargain. The only possible sentence would, therefore, be one for a term of years. Moreover, Smith knew this full well, as is shown by his own testimony. Not only had the United States Attorney so advised but the United States Commissioner and the district judge had clearly told Smith of the law in the matter. His request at sentencing points up his understanding thereof. The record also indicates that the requirements of Rule 7 (b) were scrupulously followed.\n\nThe Court, however, superimposes a new rule in kidnaping cases by requiring that they be begun only by indictment. This deprives such defendants not only of the beneficent provisions of Rule 7 (b) but subjects them to greater jeopardy in that the United States Attorney may insist on the death penalty at trial. This leaves open for play all of the evils that flesh is heir to, including the ambitions or disfavor of the prosecutor, the animosity of the victim or his malingerings from the kidnaping as well as other postindictment speculations. In rural districts where the grand jury only meets twice a year it would also place considerable hardship on a \n\n[360 \nU.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n defendant waiting for a grand jury to be empaneled.\n1\n He receives no credit for the time so served and puts the Federal Government to the expense of incarceration in the local jail on a per diem basis. Nor would the calling of a special grand jury solve the problem. It would not only be very expensive to the Government but burdensome to those called to serve, likewise taking the time of the court from other pressing matters, either in its own district or in others that suffer from congested dockets. On the other hand, following Rule 7 (b) would fully protect society. The defendant would be on notice of the charge against him and would receive the full enjoyment of all of his rights.\n2\n And, finally, the prosecutor would not be able, at his whim, to superinduce the death penalty on an otherwise noncapital case. In short, justice would be done.\n\nIt is true that three Courts of Appeals have passed on this statute. However, none of those cases is dispositive of the issue here. In Robinson v. United States, 144 F.2d 392, 396, the indictment alleged that the accused did \"beat, injure, bruise and harm [Mrs. Stoll] . . . and did not liberate her unharmed.\" It is, therefore, entirely inapposite since the indictment specifically alleged a capital offense. United States v. Parker, 103 F.2d 857, in \n\n[360 \nU.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n construing the then 40 of the Judicial Code requiring trial of capital cases to be \"had in the county where the offense was committed, where that can be done without great inconvenience,\" only decided that the application for change of venue was addressed to the sound discretion of the court, which \"was not abused.\" It specifically held that \"[w]hether such averments [that the victim had been released in a harmed condition] were necessary [in the indictment] to support a demand for the imposition of the death penalty we need not decide . . . .\" Id., at 861. The court concluded that \"since the evidence taken at the trial established that he was liberated . . . in a sound and unharmed condition,\" ibid., the case, in any event, was not one in which the death penalty could be imposed. The last case mentioned by the majority is United States v. Parrino, 180 F.2d 613. That case involved the statute of limitations and the issue involved here was not, as the court said, \"relevant to . . . whether the second indictment was found in time.\" Id., at 615. The Government contended that if the case was \"capital\" the indictment might be returned at any time. The court held that there was no information in the record as to the condition of the victim at the time of his release. Although it agreed with the Government \"that it was not necessary to allege that the victim was not released `unharmed' in order that the jury might recommend the death penalty,\" it held that \"the accused has to be adequately advised of it [released harmed], since the jury must pass upon it, [and that] it will be enough if he gets the information in season from any source.\" Ibid. Certainly the case is not dispositive of the issue here. In fact it supports the proposition that \"the accused must be adequately advised . . . in season\" if the Government claims the victim was released \"harmed.\" I say that \"adequately advised in season\" would be certain only if \n\n[360 \nU.S. 1, 17]\n\u00a0\n such an allegation was made in the indictment. Whether from a technical standpoint that makes two offenses of the crime of \"kidnaping\" is, therefore, not material. In my view, it does create two such offenses, (1) where the kidnaped person has not been released unharmed, and (2) where he has been liberated unharmed. In either event we should follow the mandate of the Fifth Amendment and Rule 7 and under our power of supervision over federal courts require in the future such procedural safeguards as are outlined herein.\n\nThis brings me to the second contention. I shall discuss the facts briefly. The \"inordinate speed\" which the Court says was present here was not generated by the Government but by the petitioner himself. The record clearly shows his anxiety to have the case concluded and fails to indicate any objection on his part to the immediate imposition of sentence. The disposition of cases on information and plea in four to five days, as occurred here, is normal in the federal system. I therefore put no credence in this claim. However, the record does indicate that at the instance of an Assistant United States Attorney a Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation called upon the trial judge in his chambers and talked at some length about Smith's background as well as his connection with the kidnaping. This was before Smith had signed any waivers or entered any plea. Neither Smith nor any one representing him was present at the interview. The record shows this contact not to have been covertly made, for at the time of sentence the trial judge in open court told Smith that it had occurred. I do not reach the due process contention, for it appears to me that our duty of supervision over the administration of justice in the federal courts, McNabb v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 332\n (1943), requires reversal because of this interview. In a criminal case, such a private conference \n\n[360 \nU.S. 1, 18]\n\u00a0\n must be deemed presumptively prejudicial where, in violation of Fed. Rules Crim. Proc., 32 (c) (1),\n3\n it was conducted prior to the plea.\n\nFor these reasons I would reverse the judgment with instructions that Smith be allowed to withdraw his guilty plea and stand trial on the information.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Court says that \"a defendant may, under appropriate circumstances, invoke the protection of the Sixth Amendment\" where \"arrest and incarceration are followed by inordinate delay prior to indictment . . . .\" Such has never been the case heretofore where capital cases are held awaiting the statutory meeting of the next grand jury. This strange doctrine can only cause additional confusion in the effective enforcement of the kidnaping statute.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Court in holding that proceeding by information \"would deprive defendants of the protection of a grand jury indictment as required by the Constitution and Rule 7 (a)\" overlooks the fact that neither the Constitution nor that Rule requires kidnaping to be charged by indictment where the victim is released unharmed.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Rule 32 (c) (1), Fed. Rules Crim. Proc., provides:\n\n\"(c) Presentence Investigation\n\n\n\"(1) When Made. The probation service of the court shall make a presentence investigation and report to the court before the imposition of sentence or the granting of probation unless the court otherwise directs. The report shall not be submitted to the court or its contents disclosed to anyone unless the defendant has pleaded guilty or has been found guilty.\" \n\n[360 \nU.S. 1, 19]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","170":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSMITH v.

He was then subjected to persistent and continuous questioning by an assistant prosecutor and numerous police officers for virtually eight hours until he confessed, after he had repeatedly requested, and had been denied, an opportunity to consult his counsel. At his trial in a state court, his confession was admitted in evidence over his objection, and he was convicted and sentenced to death. Held: On the record in this case, petitioner's will was overborne by official pressure, fatigue and sympathy falsely aroused; his confession was not voluntary; and its admission in evidence violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Schechter.\n\nIrving Anolik argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were Daniel V. Sullivan and Walter E. Dillon.\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis is another in the long line of cases presenting the question whether a confession was properly admitted into evidence under the Fourteenth Amendment. As in all such cases, we are forced to resolve a conflict between two fundamental interests of society; its interest in prompt and efficient law enforcement, and its interest in preventing the rights of its individual members from being abridged by unconstitutional methods of law enforcement. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 315, 316]\n\u00a0\n Because of the delicate nature of the constitutional determination which we must make, we cannot escape the responsibility of making our own examination of the record. Norris v. Alabama, \n294 \nU.S. 587\n.\n\nThe State's evidence reveals the following: Petitioner Vincent Joseph Spano is a derivative citizen of this country, having been born in Messina, Italy. He was 25 years old at the time of the shooting in question and had graduated from junior high school. He had a record of regular employment. The shooting took place on January 22, 1957.\n\nOn that day, petitioner was drinking in a bar. The decedent, a former professional boxer weighing almost 200 pounds who had fought in Madison Square Garden, took some of petitioner's money from the bar. Petitioner followed him out of the bar to recover it. A fight ensued, with the decedent knocking petitioner down and then kicking him in the head three or four times. Shock from the force of these blows caused petitioner to vomit. After the bartender applied some ice to his head, petitioner left the bar, walked to his apartment, secured a gun, and walked eight or nine blocks to a candy store where the decedent was frequently to be found. He entered the store in which decedent, three friends of decedent, at least two of whom were ex-convicts, and a boy who was supervising the store were present. He fired five shots, two of which entered the decedent's body, causing his death. The boy was the only eyewitness; the three friends of decedent did not see the person who fired the shot. Petitioner then disappeared for the next week or so.\n\nOn February 1, 1957, the Bronx County Grand Jury returned an indictment for first-degree murder against petitioner. Accordingly, a bench warrant was issued for his arrest, commanding that he be forthwith brought before the court to answer the indictment, or, if the court had adjourned for the term, that he be delivered into the \n\n[360 \nU.S. 315, 317]\n\u00a0\n custody of the Sheriff of Bronx County. See N. Y. Code Crim. Proc. 301.\n\nOn February 3, 1957, petitioner called one Gaspar Bruno, a close friend of 8 or 10 years' standing who had attended school with him. Bruno was a fledgling police officer, having at that time not yet finished attending police academy. According to Bruno's testimony, petitioner told him \"that he took a terrific beating, that the deceased hurt him real bad and he dropped him a couple of times and he was dazed; he didn't know what he was doing and that he went and shot at him.\" Petitioner told Bruno that he intended to get a lawyer and give himself up. Bruno relayed this information to his superiors.\n\nThe following day, February 4, at 7:10 p. m., petitioner, accompanied by counsel, surrendered himself to the authorities in front of the Bronx County Building, where both the office of the Assistant District Attorney who ultimately prosecuted his case and the courtroom in which he was ultimately tried were located. His attorney had cautioned him to answer no questions, and left him in the custody of the officers. He was promptly taken to the office of the Assistant District Attorney and at 7:15 p. m. the questioning began, being conducted by Assistant District Attorney Goldsmith, Lt. Gannon, Detectives Farrell, Lehrer and Motta, and Sgt. Clarke. The record reveals that the questioning was both persistent and continuous. Petitioner, in accordance with his attorney's instructions, steadfastly refused to answer. Detective Motta testified: \"He refused to talk to me.\" \"He just looked up to the ceiling and refused to talk to me.\" Detective Farrell testified:\n\n \"Q. And you started to interrogate him?\n\n\n \"A. That is right.\n\n\n  .   .  .   .  .\n\n\n \"Q. What did he say? \n\n[360 \nU.S. 315, 318]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \"A. He said `you would have to see my attorney. I tell you nothing but my name.\"\n\n\n .   .   .   .  .\n\n\n \"Q. Did you continue to examine him?\n\n\n \"A. Verbally, yes, sir.\"\n\n\n He asked one officer, Detective Ciccone, if he could speak to his attorney, but that request was denied. Detective Ciccone testified that he could not find the attorney's name in the telephone book.\n1\n He was given two sandwiches, coffee and cake at 11 p. m.\n\nAt 12:15 a. m. on the morning of February 5, after five hours of questioning in which it became evident that petitioner was following his attorney's instructions, on the Assistant District Attorney's orders petitioner was transferred to the 46th Squad, Ryer Avenue Police Station. The Assistant District Attorney also went to the police station and to some extent continued to participate in the interrogation. Petitioner arrived at 12:30 and questioning was resumed at 12:40. The character of the questioning is revealed by the testimony of Detective Farrell:\n\n \"Q. Who did you leave him in the room with?\n\n\n \"A. With Detective Lehrer and Sergeant Clarke came in and Mr. Goldsmith came in or Inspector Halk came in. It was back and forth. People just came in, spoke a few words to the defendant or they listened a few minutes and they left.\"\n\n\n But petitioner persisted in his refusal to answer, and again requested permission to see his attorney, this time from Detective Lehrer. His request was again denied.\n\nIt was then that those in charge of the investigation decided that petitioner's close friend, Bruno, could be of \n\n[360 \nU.S. 315, 319]\n\u00a0\n use. He had been called out on the case around 10 or 11 p. m., although he was not connected with the 46th Squad or Precinct in any way. Although, in fact, his job was in no way threatened, Bruno was told to tell petitioner that petitioner's telephone call had gotten him \"in a lot of trouble,\" and that he should seek to extract sympathy from petitioner for Bruno's pregnant wife and three children. Bruno developed this theme with petitioner without success, and petitioner, also without success, again sought to see his attorney, a request which Bruno relayed unavailingly to his superiors. After this first session with petitioner, Bruno was again directed by Lt. Gannon to play on petitioner's sympathies, but again no confession was forthcoming. But the Lieutenant a third time ordered Bruno falsely to importune his friend to confess, but again petitioner clung to his attorney's advice. Inevitably, in the fourth such session directed by the Lieutenant, lasting a full hour, petitioner succumbed to his friend's prevarications and agreed to make a statement. Accordingly, at 3:25 a. m. the Assistant District Attorney, a stenographer, and several other law enforcement officials entered the room where petitioner was being questioned, and took his statement in question and answer form with the Assistant District Attorney asking the questions. The statement was completed at 4:05 a. m.\n\nBut this was not the end. At 4:30 a. m. three detectives took petitioner to Police Headquarters in Manhattan. On the way they attempted to find the bridge from which petitioner said he had thrown the murder weapon. They crossed the Triborough Bridge into Manhattan, arriving at Police Headquarters at 5 a. m., and left Manhattan for the Bronx at 5:40 a. m. via the Willis Avenue Bridge. When petitioner recognized neither bridge as the one from which he had thrown the weapon, they reentered Manhattan via the Third Avenue Bridge, which petitioner stated was the right one, and then returned to \n\n[360 \nU.S. 315, 320]\n\u00a0\n the Bronx well after 6 a. m. During that trip the officers also elicited a statement from petitioner that the deceased was always \"on [his] back,\" \"always pushing\" him and that he was \"not sorry\" he had shot the deceased. All three detectives testified to that statement at the trial.\n\nCourt opened at 10 a. m. that morning, and petitioner was arraigned at 10:15.\n\nAt the trial, the confession was introduced in evidence over appropriate objections. The jury was instructed that it could rely on it only if it was found to be voluntary. The jury returned a guilty verdict and petitioner was sentenced to death. The New York Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction over three dissents, 4 N. Y. 2d 256, 173 N. Y. S. 2d 793, 150 N. E. 2d 226, and we granted certiorari to resolve the serious problem presented under the Fourteenth Amendment. \n358 \nU.S. 919\n.\n\nPetitioner's first contention is that his absolute right to counsel in a capital case, Powell v. Alabama, \n287 \nU.S. 45\n, became operative on the return of an indictment against him, for at that time he was in every sense a defendant in a criminal case, the grand jury having found sufficient cause to believe that he had committed the crime. He argues accordingly that following indictment no confession obtained in the absence of counsel can be used without violating the Fourteenth Amendment. He seeks to distinguish Crooker v. California, \n357 \nU.S. 433\n, and Cicenia v. Lagay, \n357 \nU.S. 504\n, on the ground that in those cases no indictment had been returned. We find it unnecessary to reach that contention, for we find use of the confession obtained here inconsistent with the Fourteenth Amendment under traditional principles.\n\nThe abhorrence of society to the use of involuntary confessions does not turn alone on their inherent untrustworthiness. It also turns on the deep-rooted feeling that the police must obey the law while enforcing the law; that in the end life and liberty can be as much endangered \n\n[360 \nU.S. 315, 321]\n\u00a0\n from illegal methods used to convict those thought to be criminals as from the actual criminals themselves. Accordingly, the actions of police in obtaining confessions have come under scrutiny in a long series of cases.\n2\n Those cases suggest that in recent years law enforcement officials have become increasingly aware of the burden which they share, along with our courts, in protecting fundamental rights of our citizenry, including that portion of our citizenry suspected of crime. The facts of no case recently in this Court have quite approached the brutal beatings in Brown v. Mississippi, \n297 \nU.S. 278\n (1936), or the 36 consecutive hours of questioning present in Ashcraft v. Tennessee, \n322 \nU.S. 143\n (1944). But as law enforcement officers become more responsible, and the methods used to extract confessions more sophisticated, our duty to enforce federal constitutional protections does not cease. It only becomes more difficult because of the more delicate judgments to be made. Our judgment here is that, on all the facts, this conviction cannot stand.\n\nPetitioner was a foreign-born young man of 25 with no past history of law violation or of subjection to official interrogation, at least insofar as the record shows. He \n\n[360 \nU.S. 315, 322]\n\u00a0\n had progressed only one-half year into high school and the record indicates that he had a history of emotional instability.\n3\n He did not make a narrative statement, but was subject to the leading questions of a skillful prosecutor in a question and answer confession. He was subjected to questioning not by a few men, but by many. They included Assistant District Attorney Goldsmith, one Hyland of the District Attorney's Office, Deputy Inspector Halks,\n4\n Lieutenant Gannon, Detective Ciccone, Detective Motta, Detective Lehrer, Detective Marshal, Detective Farrell, Detective Leira,\n5\n Detective Murphy, Detective Murtha, Sergeant Clarke, Patrolman Bruno and Stenographer Baldwin. All played some part, and the effect of such massive official interrogation must have been felt. Petitioner was questioned for virtually eight straight hours before he confessed, with his only respite being a transfer to an arena presumably considered more appropriate by the police for the task at hand. Nor was the questioning conducted during normal business hours, but began in early evening, continued into the night, and did not bear fruition until the not-too-early morning. The drama was not played out, with the final admissions obtained, until almost sunrise. In such circumstances slowly mounting fatigue does, and is calculated to, play its part. The questioners persisted in the face of his repeated refusals to answer on the advice of his \n\n[360 \nU.S. 315, 323]\n\u00a0\n attorney, and they ignored his reasonable requests to contact the local attorney whom he had already retained and who had personally delivered him into the custody of these officers in obedience to the bench warrant.\n\nThe use of Bruno, characterized in this Court by counsel for the State as a \"childhood friend\" of petitioner's, is another factor which deserves mention in the totality of the situation. Bruno's was the one face visible to petitioner in which he could put some trust. There was a bond of friendship between them going back a decade into adolescence. It was with this material that the officers felt that they could overcome petitioner's will. They instructed Bruno falsely to state that petitioner's telephone call had gotten him into trouble, that his job was in jeopardy, and that loss of his job would be disastrous to his three children, his wife and his unborn child. And Bruno played this part of a worried father, harried by his superiors, in not one, but four different acts, the final one lasting an hour. Cf. Leyra v. Denno, \n347 \nU.S. 556\n. Petitioner was apparently unaware of John Gay's famous couplet:\n\n \"An open foe may prove a curse,   But a pretended friend is worse,\"\n\n\n and he yielded to his false friend's entreaties.\n\nWe conclude that petitioner's will was overborne by official pressure, fatigue and sympathy falsely aroused, after considering all the facts in their post-indictment setting.\n6\n Here a grand jury had already found sufficient cause to require petitioner to face trial on a charge of first-degree murder, and the police had an eyewitness to the shooting. The police were not therefore merely trying to solve a crime, or even to absolve a suspect. Compare \n\n[360 \nU.S. 315, 324]\n\u00a0\n Crooker v. California, supra, and Cicenia v. Lagay, supra. They were rather concerned primarily with securing a statement from defendant on which they could convict him. The undeviating intent of the officers to extract a confession from petitioner is therefore patent. When such an intent is shown, this Court has held that the confession obtained must be examined with the most careful scrutiny, and has reversed a conviction on facts less compelling than these. Malinski v. New York, \n324 \nU.S. 401\n. Accordingly, we hold that petitioner's conviction cannot stand under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe State suggests, however, that we are not free to reverse this conviction, since there is sufficient other evidence in the record from which the jury might have found guilt, relying on Stein v. New York, \n346 \nU.S. 156\n. But Payne v. Arkansas, \n356 \nU.S. 560, 568\n, authoritatively establishes that Stein did not hold that a conviction may be sustained on the basis of other evidence if a confession found to be involuntary by this Court was used, even though limiting instructions were given. Stein held only that when a confession is not found by this Court to be involuntary, this Court will not reverse on the ground that the jury might have found it involuntary and might have relied on it. The judgment must be\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] How this could be so when the attorney's name, Tobias Russo, was concededly in the telephone book does not appear. The trial judge sustained objections by the Assistant District Attorney to questions designed to delve into this mystery.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] E. g., Cicenia v. Lagay, \n357 \nU.S. 504\n; Crooker v.

He was described by a private physician in 1951 as \"an extremely nervous tense individual who is emotionally unstable and maladjusted,\" and was found unacceptable for military service in 1951, primarily because of \"Psychiatric disorder.\" He failed the Army's AFQT-1 intelligence test. His mother had been in mental hospitals on three separate occasions.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] His name is sometimes spelled \"Hawks.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Although each is referred to separately in the record, it may be that Detectives Lehrer and Leira are the same person.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Lisenba v. California, \n314 \nU.S. 219\n, is not to the contrary. There, while petitioner had already been arraigned on an incest charge, his later questioning and confession concerned a murder.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN join, concurring.\n\nWhile I join the opinion of the Court, I add what for me is an even more important ground of decision.\n\nWe have often divided on whether state authorities may question a suspect for hours on end when he has no lawyer present and when he has demanded that he have the benefit of legal advice. See Crooker v. California, \n357 \nU.S. 433\n, and cases cited. But here we deal not with a suspect but with a man who has been formally charged \n\n[360 \nU.S. 315, 325]\n\u00a0\n with a crime. The question is whether after the indictment and before the trial the Government can interrogate the accused in secret when he asked for his lawyer and when his request was denied. This is a capital case; and under the rule of Powell v. Alabama, \n287 \nU.S. 45\n, the defendant was entitled to be represented by counsel. This representation by counsel is not restricted to the trial. As stated in Powell v. Alabama, supra, p. 57:\n\n\"during perhaps the most critical period of the proceedings against these defendants, that is to say, from the time of their arraignment until the beginning of their trial, when consultation, thoroughgoing investigation and preparation were vitally important, the defendants did not have the aid of counsel in any real sense, although they were as much entitled to such aid during that period as at the trial itself.\"\n\n\n Depriving a person, formally charged with a crime, of counsel during the period prior to trial may be more damaging than denial of counsel during the trial itself.\n\nWe do not have here mere suspects who are being secretly interrogated by the police as in Crooker v. California, supra, nor witnesses who are being questioned in secret administrative or judicial proceedings as in In re Groban, \n352 \nU.S. 330\n, and Anonymous Nos. 6 & 7 v. Baker, ante, p. 287. This is a case of an accused, who is scheduled to be tried by a judge and jury, being tried in a preliminary way by the police. This is a kangaroo court procedure whereby the police produce the vital evidence in the form of a confession which is useful or necessary to obtain a conviction. They in effect deny him effective representation by counsel. This seems to me to be a flagrant violation of the principle announced in Powell v. Alabama, supra, that the right of counsel extends to the preparation for trial, as well as to the trial itself. As Professor Chafee once said, \"A person accused of crime \n\n[360 \nU.S. 315, 326]\n\u00a0\n needs a lawyer right after his arrest probably more than at any other time.\" Chafee, Documents on Fundamental Human Rights, Pamphlet 2 (1951-1952), p. 541. When he is deprived of that right after indictment and before trial, he may indeed be denied effective representation by counsel at the only stage when legal aid and advice would help him. This secret inquisition by the police when defendant asked for and was denied counsel was as serious an invasion of his constitutional rights as the denial of a continuance in order to employ counsel was held to be in Chandler v. Fretag, \n348 \nU.S. 3, 10\n. What we said in Avery v. Alabama, \n308 \nU.S. 444, 446\n, has relevance here:\n\n\". . . the denial of opportunity for appointed counsel to confer, to consult with the accused and to prepare his defense, could convert the appointment of counsel into a sham and nothing more than a formal compliance with the Constitution's requirement that an accused be given the assistance of counsel.\"\n\n\n I join with Judges Desmond, Fuld, and Van Voorhis of the New York Court of Appeals (4 N. Y. 2d 256, 266, 173 N. Y. S. 2d 793, 801, 150 N. E. 2d 226, 231-232), in asking, what use is a defendant's right to effective counsel at every stage of a criminal case if, while he is held awaiting trial, he can be questioned in the absence of counsel until he confesses? In that event the secret trial in the police precincts effectively supplants the public trial guaranteed by the Bill of Rights.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART, whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN join, concurring.\n\nWhile I concur in the opinion of the Court, it is my view that the absence of counsel when this confession was elicited was alone enough to render it inadmissible under the Fourteenth Amendment. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 315, 327]\n\u00a0\n\n\nLet it be emphasized at the outset that this is not a case where the police were questioning a suspect in the course of investigating an unsolved crime. See Crooker v. California, \n357 \nU.S. 433\n; Cicenia v. Lagay, \n357 \nU.S. 504\n. When the petitioner surrendered to the New York authorities he was under indictment for first degree murder.\n\nUnder our system of justice an indictment is supposed to be followed by an arraignment and a trial. At every stage in those proceedings the accused has an absolute right to a lawyer's help if the case is one in which a death sentence may be imposed. Powell v. Alabama, \n287 \nU.S. 45\n. Indeed the right to the assistance of counsel whom the accused has himself retained is absolute, whatever the offense for which he is on trial. Chandler v. Fretag, \n348 \nU.S. 3\n.\n\nWhat followed the petitioner's surrender in this case was not arraignment in a court of law, but an all-night inquisition in a prosecutor's office, a police station, and an automobile. Throughout the night the petitioner repeatedly asked to be allowed to send for his lawyer, and his requests were repeatedly denied. He finally was induced to make a confession. That confession was used to secure a verdict sending him to the electric chair.\n\nOur Constitution guarantees the assistance of counsel to a man on trial for his life in an orderly courtroom, presided over by a judge, open to the public, and protected by all the procedural safeguards of the law. Surely a Constitution which promises that much can vouchsafe no less to the same man under midnight inquisition in the squad room of a police station. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 315, 328]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","174":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSPEVACK v.

UNITED STATES(1959)\nNo. 504\nArgued: November 3, 1959Decided: November 7, 1959\n\n\n\n\n Under 208 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, the United States sued in a Federal District Court to enjoin the continuation of an industry-wide strike in the steel industry. After considering affidavits filed by the parties and finding that the strike had closed down a substantial part of the Nation's steel-production capacity and that its continuation would \"imperil the national health and safety,\" the District Court enjoined continuation of the strike. The Court of Appeals affirmed. Held: The judgment is sustained. Pp. 40-44.\n\n 1. Once it determined that the statutory conditions of breadth of involvement and peril to the national health or safety existed, the District Court properly enjoined continuation of the strike. Congress did not intend that the issuance of an injunction should depend upon a judicial inquiry into broad issues of national labor policy, the availability of other remedies to the Executive, the effect of an injunction on the collective bargaining process, the conduct of the parties to the labor dispute in their negotiations, or conjecture as to the course of those negotiations in the future. Pp. 40-41.\n\n\n 2. On the record in this case, the judgment below was amply supported on the ground that the strike imperiled the national safety. Pp. 41-42.\n\n\n 3.

P. 43.\n\n\n 4. As here applied, 208 entrusts to the courts only the determination of a \"case or controversy.\" It does not violate the Constitution by entrusting to them any matter capable of only legislative or executive determination.

Feller and Bernard Dunau.\n\nSolicitor General Rankin argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were Attorney General Rogers, Assistant Attorney General Doub, Wayne G. Barnett, Samuel D. Slade, Seymour Farber and Herbert E. Morris.\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\nThe Attorney General sought and obtained in the District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania an injunction against the continuation of an industry-wide strike of workers in the basic steel industry pursuant to 208 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, 61 Stat. 155, 29 U.S.C. 178. We granted certiorari, post, p. 878, to review the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, 271 F.2d 676, affirming the District Court. In pertinent part, 208 provides that if the District Court -\n\n\"finds that . . . [a] threatened or actual strike or lock-out -\n\n\n \"(i) affects an entire industry or a substantial part thereof engaged in trade, commerce, transportation, transmission, or communication among the several States or with foreign nations, or engaged in the production of goods for commerce; and\n\n\n \"(ii) if permitted to occur or to continue, will imperil the national health or safety, it shall have jurisdiction to enjoin any such strike or lock-out, or the continuing thereof, and to make such other orders as may be appropriate.\"\n\n\n The arguments of the parties here and in the lower courts have addressed themselves in considerable part to the propriety of the District Court's exercising its equitable \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 41]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction to enjoin the strike in question once the findings set forth above had been made. These arguments have ranged widely into broad issues of national labor policy, the availability of other remedies to the Executive, the effect of a labor injunction on the collective bargaining process, consideration of the conduct of the parties to the labor dispute in their negotiations, and conjecture as to the course of those negotiations in the future. We do not believe that Congress in passing the statute intended that the issuance of injunctions should depend upon judicial inquiries of this nature. Congress was not concerned with the merits of the parties' positions or the conduct of their negotiations. Its basic purpose seems to have been to see that vital production should be resumed or continued for a time while further efforts were made to settle the dispute. To carry out its purposes, Congress carefully surrounded the injunction proceedings with detailed procedural devices and limitations. The public report of a board of inquiry, the exercise of political and executive responsibility personally by the President in directing the commencement of injunction proceedings, the statutory provisions looking toward an adjustment of the dispute during the injunction's pendency, and the limited duration of the injunction, represent a congressional determination of policy factors involved in the difficult problem of national emergency strikes. This congressional determination of the policy factors is of course binding on the courts.\n\nThe statute imposes upon the courts the duty of finding, upon the evidence adduced, whether a strike or lock-out meets the statutory conditions of breadth of involvement and peril to the national health or safety. We have accordingly reviewed the concurrent findings of the two lower courts. Petitioner here contests the findings that the continuation of the strike would imperil the national health and safety. The parties dispute the meaning of \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 42]\n\u00a0\n the statutory term \"national health\"; the Government insists that the term comprehends the country's general well-being, its economic health; petitioner urges that simply the physical health of the citizenry is meant. We need not resolve this question, for we think the judgment below is amply supported on the ground that the strike imperils the national safety.\n*\n Here we rely upon the evidence of the strike's effect on specific defense projects; we need not pass on the Government's contention that \"national safety\" in this context should be given a broader construction and application. \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 43]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe petitioner suggests that a selective reopening of some of the steel mills would suffice to fulfill specific defense needs. The statute was designed to provide a public remedy in times of emergency; we cannot construe it to require that the United States either formulate a reorganization of the affected industry to satisfy its defense needs without the complete reopening of closed facilities, or demonstrate in court the unfeasibility of such a reorganization. There is no room in the statute for this requirement which the petitioner seeks to impose on the Government.\n\nWe are of opinion that the provision in question as applied here is not violative of the constitutional limitation prohibiting courts from exercising powers of a legislative or executive nature, powers not capable of being conferred upon a court exercising solely \"the judicial power of the United States.\" Keller v. Potomac Elec. Power Co., \n261 \nU.S. 428\n; Federal Radio Comm'n v. General Elec. Co., \n281 \nU.S. 464\n. Petitioner contends that the statute is constitutionally invalid because it does not set up any standard of lawful or unlawful conduct on the part of labor or management. But the statute does recognize certain rights in the public to have unimpeded for a time production in industries vital to the national health or safety. It makes the United States the guardian of these rights in litigation. Cf. United States v. American Bell Tel. Co., \n128 \nU.S. 315, 370\n; Sanitary District of Chicago v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 405\n. The availability of relief, in the common judicial form of an injunction, depends on findings of fact, to be judicially made. Of the matters decided judicially, there is no review by other agencies of the Government. Cf. Gordon v. United States, 2 Wall. 561, \n117 \nU.S. 697\n. We conclude that the statute entrusts the courts only with the determination of a \"case or controversy,\" on which the judicial power can operate, not containing any element \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 44]\n\u00a0\n capable of only legislative or executive determination. We do not find that the termination of the injunction after a specified time, or the machinery established in an attempt to obtain a peaceful settlement of the underlying dispute during the injunction's pendency, detracts from this conclusion.\n\nThe result is that the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, affirming that of the District Court, is affirmed. Our mandate shall issue forthwith.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER and MR. JUSTICE HARLAN: In joining the Court's opinion we note our intention to file in due course an amplification of our views upon the issues involved which could not be prepared within the time limitations imposed by the necessity of a prompt adjudication in this case.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] The evidence in this regard is reflected in the District Court's findings of fact Nos. 15 (a), (b), (c), and (d), as follows: \"(a) Certain items of steel required in top priority military missile programs of the United States are not made by any mill now operating, nor available from any inventory or from imports. Any further delay in resumption of steel production would result in an irretrievable loss of time in the supply of weapons systems essential to the national defense plans of the United States and its allies. \"(b) The planned program of space activities under the direction of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has been delayed by the strike and will be further delayed if it is continued. Specifically, project MERCURY, the nation's manned satellite program, which has the highest national priority, has been delayed by reason of delay in construction of buildings essential to its operation. This program is important to the security of the nation. Other planned space programs will be delayed or threatened with delay by a continuation of the strike. \"(c) Nuclear Submarines and the naval shipbuilding program other than submarines, including new construction, modernization, and conversion, have been affected by reason of the inability to secure boilers, compressors, and other component parts requiring steel. Products of the steel industry are indispensable to the manufacture of such items and delay in their production will irreparably injure national defense and imperil the national safety. \"(d) Exported steel products are vital to the support of United States bases overseas and for the use of NATO allies and similar collective security groups. The steel strike, if permitted to continue, will seriously impair these programs, thus imperiling the national safety.\"\n\nSeparate opinion of MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER and MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring in the opinion of the Court dated November 7, 1959.\n*\n\u00a0\n\nThis action by the United States for an injunction under 208 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (61 Stat. 155, 29 U.S.C. 178) was commenced by the Attorney General at the direction of the President of the United States in the District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania on October 20, 1959. The strike which was the concern of the action arose out of a labor dispute between petitioner, the collective bargaining agent of the workers, and the steel companies, and was nationwide in scope. The strike began on July 15, 1959, fifteen days after the contracts between the steel companies \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 45]\n\u00a0\n and petitioner expired. On October 9, 1959, the President created the Board of Inquiry provided by 206 and 207 of the Act to inquire into the issues involved in the dispute. The President deemed the strike to affect a \"substantial part of . . . an industry,\" and concluded that, if allowed to continue, it would imperil the national \"health and safety.\" On October 19 the Board submitted its report, which concluded: \"[T]he parties have failed to reach an agreement and we see no prospects for an early cessation of the strike. The Board cannot point to any single issue of any consequence whatsoever upon which the parties are in agreement.\" The President filed the report with the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service and made its contents public, in accordance with 206, and ordered the Attorney General to commence this action, reiterating his former pronouncements that the continuance of the strike constituted a threat to the national health and safety.\n\nPursuant to stipulations of the parties, the District Court heard the case on affidavits. On October 21 it granted the injunction. Its order was stayed by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, pending that court's final determination of petitioner's appeal. On October 27 it affirmed the decision of the District Court (one judge dissenting) and granted an additional stay to enable petitioner to seek relief here. On October 28 this Court denied the motion of the United States to modify the stay. On October 30 we granted certiorari, set the argument down for November 2, and extended the stay pending final disposition. In a per curiam opinion on November 7, this Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals, MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS dissenting. We noted our intention to set forth at a later time the grounds for our agreement with the Court's disposition and not delay announcement of the result until such a statement could be prepared. \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 46]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe injunction was challenged on three grounds: (1) the lower courts were not entitled to find that the national emergency, upon which the District Court's jurisdiction is dependent under 208, existed; (2) even if the emergency existed, the District Court failed to exercise the discretion, claimed to be open to it under 208, whether or not to grant the relief sought by the United States; (3) even if the injunction was otherwise unassailable it should have been denied because 208 seeks to charge the District Courts with a duty outside the scope of \"judicial Power\" exercisable under Art. III, 2, of the Constitution.\n\nSection 208 provides that the District Court \"shall have jurisdiction to enjoin\" a \"threatened or actual strike or lock-out\" if the court finds that it \"(i) affects an entire industry or a substantial part thereof engaged in . . . commerce . . . or engaged in the production of goods for commerce; and (ii) if permitted to occur or to continue, will imperil the national health or safety . . . .\" The District Court found, and it was not contested here, that the strike satisfied the first condition in that it affected a substantial portion of the steel industry. Petitioner urged, however, that the lower courts had no basis for concluding that it satisfied the second.\n\nIn its finding of fact No. 15, the District Court described four instances of serious impediment to national defense programs as a result of existing and prospective procurement problems due to the strike. The programs affected included the missile, nuclear submarine and naval shipbuilding, and space programs. Each of these findings had, as the Court of Appeals found, ample support in the affidavits submitted by the United States. According to the affidavit of Thomas S. Gates, Jr., Acting Secretary of Defense, delays in delivery of materials critical to the creation of the Atlas, Titan and Polaris missile systems had become so severe that each additional day of the strike \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 47]\n\u00a0\n would result in an equal delay in project completion; and a \"significant portion of the steel specified in the procurement contracts is of a composition not common to commercial usage nor available from existing civilian inventories by exercise of allocation or eminent domain powers of the Government. . . . [T]hese programs in many cases require special sizes and shapes, many of which can be fabricated only by firms having a long experience in their production and the necessary special facilities therefor. . . .\"\n\nThe affidavit of Hugh L. Dryden, Deputy Administrator of the Aeronautics and Space Administration, stated, in some detail, that space projects, including tracking centers, rocket engine test stands, and other critical facilities, were, at the time of the hearing in the District Court, already subjected to delays of as much as seven weeks, with longer delays anticipated from the continuation of the strike. The affidavit of A. R. Luedecke, the General Manager of the Atomic Energy Commission, stated that minor delays in projects had, at the time of its making, already been experienced in critical programs of the Atomic Energy Commission, and that if the strike should continue into 1960 \"there would be an appreciable effect upon the weapons program.\"\n\nIn view of such demonstrated unavailability of defense materials it is irrelevant that, as petitioner contended and the United States conceded, somewhat in excess of 15% of the steel industry remained unaffected by the stoppage, and that only about 1% of the gross steel product is ordinarily allocated to defense production.\n\nHowever, petitioner also contested the sufficiency of the affidavits on the ground that they did not present the facts giving rise to the asserted emergencies with sufficient particularity to justify the findings made. This objection raises an issue which was essentially for the trier of fact, and the two lower courts found the affidavits sufficient. \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 48]\n\u00a0\n It is not for the judiciary to canvass the competence of officers of cabinet rank, with responsibility only below that of the President for the matters to which they speak under oath, to express the opinions set forth in these affidavits. Findings based directly upon them surely cannot be said to be \"clearly erroneous.\" Fed. Rules Civ. Proc., 52 (a).\n\nMoreover, under 208 the trier of these facts was called upon to make a judgment already twice made by the President of the United States: once when he convened the Board of Inquiry; and once when he directed the Attorney General to commence this action. His reasoned judgment was presumably based upon the facts we have summarized, and it is not for us to set aside findings consistent with them. The President's judgment is not controlling; 208 makes it the court's duty to \"find\" the requisite jurisdictional fact for itself. But in the discharge of its duty a District Court would disregard reason not to give due weight to determinations previously made by the President, who is, after all, the ultimate constitutional executive repository for assuring the safety of the Nation, and upon whose judgment the invocation of the emergency provisions depends.\n\nThe petitioner next asserted that the findings made were insufficient as a matter of law to support the District Court's jurisdiction under 208. Conceding that peril to the national defense is peril to the national safety, it asserted that the peril to the national safety which is made an element of the court's jurisdiction by part (ii) of 208 (a) must result from the substantial character of the effect upon an industry required by part (i), and that if it does not so result a District Court is without power to enjoin the stoppage or any part of it. Alternatively, it urged that the jurisdiction which is conferred by the section is limited to relief against such part of the total stoppage as is found to be the cause in fact of the peril. \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 49]\n\u00a0\n Petitioner claimed that as a matter of fact the procurement embarrassments found by the courts below were the result not of the entire steel stoppage or even of a substantial part of it, but only of the closing of a \"handful\" of the hundreds of plants affected; and that therefore the entire industry-wide strike should not have been enjoined under either construction of 208 which it asserted.\n\nIn the first place, the requisite fact was found against petitioner's contention. The Court of Appeals found that \"[t]he steel industry is too vast and too complicated to be segmented\" so as to alleviate the existing and foreseeable peril to the national defense by the mere reopening of a few plants. It expressly relied upon the affidavit of Dr. Raymond J. Saulnier, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers of the Federal Government, which was before both the lower courts. Dr. Saulnier stated that:\n\n\"Steel is produced through closely interrelated processes that often cannot be separated technically or economically to allow production of items `needed' . . . while omitting items `not needed.' . . . `[I]n order to satisfy defense requirements alone from the standpoint of size, grade, and product, it would be necessary to reactivate 25 to 30 hot rolling mills together with supporting blast furnaces, and Bessemer, electric, open hearth and vacuum-melting furnaces. Additional facilities for pickling, coating, heat treating, cold finishing, shearing, cutting, testing, and the like would also be required. To reopen these plants for the production of steel products to meet only defense requirements would be totally impracticable. The problems of scheduling the limited tonnages involved, plus the cost and technical difficulty of start-ups and shutdowns would appear to be insurmountable.'\" \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 50]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The lower courts had before them, as did this Court, the conflicting affidavit of Robert Nathan, the economist for the Steelworkers. But the trier of fact was not bound to prefer the arguments, however weighty, of petitioner's economist, however estimable, as against the views of the highest officers in the land and their economic advisers regarding the means for securing necessary defense materials.\n\nNor was it a refutation of the finding of the Court of Appeals to suggest, as petitioner did here, that \"needed\" facilities might be opened for all purposes. The problem is self-evidently one of programming months in advance every specialized commodity needed for defense purposes, a project which itself would require months of effort and the delays such effort would entail. Other obvious difficulties are not less formidable. Upon what basis would the plants to be reopened be chosen, assuming the number of plants needed could be determined? According to what standard would the production of particular complexes of plants be regulated? What of problems of cost and overhead, and the cost of and time required for intra-company planning to determine the practicality of partially restricting the operation of giant complexes such as those of the major producers?\n\nNo doubt a District Court is normally charged with the duty of independently shaping the details of a decree when sitting in equity in controversies that involve simple and relatively few factors - factors, that is, far less in number, less complicated and less interrelated than in the case before us. But a court is not qualified to devise schemes for the conduct of an industry so as to assure the securing of necessary defense materials. It is not competent to sit in judgment on the existing distribution of factors in the conduct of an integrated industry to ascertain whether it can be segmented with a view to its reorganization for the supply exclusively, or even primarily, \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 51]\n\u00a0\n of government-needed materials. Nor is it able to readjust or adequately to reweigh the forces of economic competition within the industry or to appraise the relevance of such forces in carrying out a defense program for the Government. Against all such assumptions of competence, the finding of the Court of Appeals was amply supported by the record.\n\nEven without such a finding, however, petitioner's contention would fail. There are controlling reasons for concluding that 208 neither imposes upon the United States, as a condition for securing an injunction, the burden of establishing that the peril shown proceeds from the unavailability of a \"substantial number\" of particular facilities, nor limits the scope of the court's injunctive process to such part of the total stoppage as appears to be the cause in fact of the peril.\n\nFirst, on its face 208 states two separate criteria, both of which must be satisfied before an injunction may issue against a strike, and it states no other relationship between them than that both must proceed from \"such strike.\" No other relationship is suggested by the legislative history of these emergency provisions. There is, accordingly, no foundation for the drastic limitation on their scope which would be imposed if petitioner's contention had been adopted, that a District Court is without jurisdiction unless the abstract quantitatively substantial character of the effect of the stoppage is found to be the cause in fact of the peril.\n\nThe legislative history confirms what the provisions themselves amply reveal, that this portion of the Taft-Hartley Act contains a dual purpose, on the one hand to alleviate, at least temporarily, a threat to the national health or safety; and on the other to promote settlement of the underlying dispute of industry-wide effect. The former purpose is to be accomplished by the injunction, and by whatever additional remedies the President may \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 52]\n\u00a0\n seek and the Congress grant in pursuance of the command of 210 of the Act that the matter be returned to Congress by the President with full report in the event of a failure of settlement within the injunction period. The latter purpose is to be accomplished by the command of 209 that the parties to the dispute \"make every effort to adjust and settle their differences\"; by the secret ballot of employees provided by 209 with reference to the last offer of the companies; and finally by further action by the President and Congress pursuant to 210. To hold, as petitioner alternatively urged, that a District Court may enjoin only that part of the total stoppage which is shown to be the cause in fact of the peril, would at best serve only the purpose of alleviating the peril, while stultifying the provisions designed to effect settlement of the underlying dispute.\n\nSecond, the evidentiary burdens upon the Government which would have resulted from the adoption of either of the constructions urged by petitioner would tend to cripple the designed effectiveness of the Act. It is extremely doubtful whether in strikes of national proportion information would be available to the United States within a reasonable time to enable it to show that particular critical orders were placed with particular facilities no longer available; or whether the United States could, within such time, effect a theoretical reorganization of its procurement program so as to demonstrate to a court that it cannot successfully be conducted without the reopening of particular facilities.\n\nFinally, 208 is not to be construed narrowly, as if it were merely an exception to the policies which led to the restrictions on the use of injunctions in labor disputes embodied in the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 47 Stat. 70 (1932), 29 U.S.C. 101-115. Totally different policies led to the enactment of the national emergency provisions of the 1947 Act. The legislative history of these provisions \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 53]\n\u00a0\n is replete with evidence of the concern of both the proponents and the opponents of the bill to deal effectively with large-scale work stoppages which endanger the public health or safety. To stop or prevent public injury, both management and labor were brought within the scope of the injunctive power, and both were subjected to the command to \"make every effort to adjust and settle their differences . . . .\" 209. The preamble to the Act succinctly states this purpose:\n\n \"Industrial strife which interferes with the normal flow of commerce . . . can be avoided or substantially minimized if employers, employees, and labor organizations each . . . above all recognize under law that neither party has any right in its relations with any other to engage in acts or practices which jeopardize the public health, safety, or interest. . . .\" Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, 1 (b), 61 Stat. 136, 29 U.S.C. 141 (b).\n\n\n The Norris-LaGuardia Act had limited the power of the federal courts to employ injunctions to affect labor disputes. The purpose of that Act was rigorously to define the conditions under which federal courts were empowered to issue injunctions in industrial controversies as between employers and employees, and to devise a safeguarding procedure for the intervention of the federal judiciary in the course of private litigation. It is not without significance that this Act was found not to deprive a federal court of jurisdiction to issue an injunction at the behest of the Government as industrial operator. United States v. United Mine Workers of America, \n330 \nU.S. 258\n. Moreover, as the preamble to the Norris-LaGuardia Act indicated, the formulation of policy of that statute was made in 1932 \"under prevailing economic conditions.\" Congress at different times and for different purposes may gauge the demands of \"prevailing economic \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 54]\n\u00a0\n conditions\" differently or with reference to considerations outside merely \"economic conditions.\" Here Congress has made the appraisal that the interests of both parties must be subordinated to the overriding interest of the Nation. The following observations of Mr. Justice Brandeis are apposite:\n\n \"Because I have come to the conclusion that both the common law of a State and a statute of the United States declare the right of industrial combatants to push their struggle to the limits of the justification of self-interest, I do not wish to be understood as attaching any constitutional or moral sanction to that right. All rights are derived from the purposes of the society in which they exist; above all rights rises duty to the community. The conditions developed in industry may be such that those engaged in it cannot continue their struggle without danger to the community. But it is not for judges to determine whether such conditions exist, nor is it their function to set the limits of permissible contest and to declare the duties which the new situation demands. This is the function of the legislature which, while limiting individual and group rights of aggression and defense, may substitute processes of justice for the more primitive method of trial by combat.\" Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, \n254 \nU.S. 443, 488\n (1921) (dissent).\n\n\n These sections were designed to provide machinery for safeguarding the comprehensive interest of the community, and to promote the national policy of collective bargaining. They must be construed to give full effect to the protections they seek to afford.\n\nPetitioner's final contention with regard to the statutory standard of peril to the national safety appears to have been that the United States must resort to other \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 55]\n\u00a0\n modes of relief than this Act to meet the national peril created by a stoppage in a substantial part of an industry, before such peril can be said to exist or be threatened. In substance petitioner urged: (1) that the United States has powers under the Defense Production Act of 1950, 64 Stat. 798, 50 U.S.C. App. 2061, the exercise of which would, even during the course of these proceedings, have permitted it to alleviate the critical shortages which in fact resulted or threatened to result from the strike; and (2) that the United States failed to reveal to petitioner or to the courts what plants might have been reopened so as to remove the peril to the national defense. In the light of what we have already said, it is apparent that neither of these matters is relevant to the judicial determination required by 208. The remedy available to the United States under these provisions is independent of other powers possessed by it and is not encumbered by any burden upon it to seek to persuade or enable the defendants to effect a piecemeal alteration of their conduct to avoid the court's jurisdiction.\n\nBecause the District Court's finding of peril to the national safety resulting from impediments to the programs for national defense was itself sufficient to satisfy the requirement of 208 (a) (ii), it is not necessary to determine whether perils to defense exhaust the scope of \"safety\" as used in this statute, or to consider its findings with regard to peril to the national health.\n\nHaving decided that the strike was one which created a national emergency within the terms of the statute, the next question is whether, upon that finding alone, the \"eighty-day\" injunction for which the Government prayed should have issued, or whether the District Court was to exercise the conventional discretionary function of equity in balancing conveniences as a preliminary to issuing an injunction. The petitioner argued that under the Act a District Court has \"discretion\" whether to \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 56]\n\u00a0\n issue an \"eighty-day\" injunction, even though a national emergency be found. It argued that the district judge in this case did not consider that he had such \"discretion.\" Alternatively, it argued that if the district judge did exercise \"discretion\" he abused it, for the broad injunctive relief he granted was not justifiable in this case. The contention was that the relief had the effect of hindering rather than promoting a voluntary settlement of the dispute, and of unnecessarily coercing hundreds of thousands of employees, when an injunction of only a small part of the strike, or other non-injunctive remedies, assertedly less drastic, were available, and would have equally well averted the threat to public safety. We do not think it necessary to embark upon the speculative consideration whether the district judge in fact made a discretionary determination, and, if he did, whether that determination was justifiable. We conclude that under the national emergency provisions of the Labor Management Relations Act it is not for judges to exercise conventional \"discretion\" to withhold an \"eighty-day\" injunction upon a balancing of conveniences.\n\n\"Discretionary\" jurisdiction is exercised when a given injunctive remedy is not commanded as a matter of policy by Congress, but is, as a presupposition of judge-made law, left to judicial discretion. Such is not the case under this statute. The purpose of Congress expressed by the scheme of this statute precludes ordinary equitable discretion. In this respect we think the role of the District Courts under this statute is like the role of the Courts of Appeals under provisions for review by them of the orders of various administrative agencies, such as the National Labor Relations Board. 29 U.S.C. 160 (e). This Court has held that if the Board's findings are sustained, the remedy it thought appropriate must be enforced. Labor Board v. Bradford Dyeing Assn., \n310 \nU.S. 318\n. \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 57]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n In the national emergency provisions of the Labor Management Relations Act, Congress has with particularity described the duration of the injunction to be granted and the nature of specific collateral administrative procedures which are to be set in motion upon its issuance. We think the conclusion compelling that Congress has thereby manifested that a District Court is not to indulge its own judgment regarding the wisdom of the relief Congress has designed. Congress expressed its own judgment and did not leave it to a District Court. The statute embodies a legislative determination that the particular relief described is appropriate to the emergency, when one is found to exist. Moreover, it is a primary purpose of the Act to stop the national emergency at least for eighty days, which would be defeated if a court were left with discretion to withhold an injunction and thereby permit continuation of an emergency it has found to exist. The hope is that within the period of the injunction voluntary settlement of the labor dispute will be reached, and to that end the statute compels bargaining between the parties during that time. If no voluntary settlement is concluded within the period of the injunction, the President is to report to Congress so that that body may further draw upon its constitutional legislative powers. How else can these specific directions be viewed but that the procedures provided are, in the view of Congress, the way to meet the emergencies which come within the statute? It is not for a court to negative the direction of Congress because of its own confident prophecy that the \"eighty-day\" injunction and the administrative procedures which follow upon it will not induce voluntary settlement of the dispute, or are too drastic a way of dealing with it.\n\nWe are also persuaded by the fact that, before the statute is invoked, there must be a Presidential determination that the \"eighty-day\" injunction is the promising \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 58]\n\u00a0\n method for dealing with the emergency arising from the labor dispute. Section 206 provides that whenever the President is of the \"opinion\" that a strike or lockout will create a national emergency, he may appoint a board of inquiry, which shall submit to him a report containing the facts relating to the dispute and the positions of the parties to it. Upon receiving this report the President \"may\" direct the Attorney General to petition to enjoin the strike or lockout. It is undoubtedly one of the factors in the President's decision to direct the Attorney General to act that he considers such an injunction the best available course to relieve the emergency. Such a decision by the President to invoke the courts' jurisdiction to enjoin, involving, as it does, elements not susceptible of ordinary judicial proof nor within the general range of judicial experience, is not within the competent scope of the exercise of equitable \"discretion.\" It may be that the assumptions on the basis of which Congress legislated were ill-founded or have been invalidated by experience. It may be that the considerations on the basis of which the President exercised his judgment in invoking the legislation will be found wanting by hindsight. These are not matters within the Court's concern. They are not relevant to the construction of 208 nor to its judicial enforcement. They certainly do not warrant the Judiciary's intrusion into the exercise by Congress and the President of their respective powers and responsibilities.\n\nThe Hecht Co. v. Bowles, \n321 \nU.S. 321\n, heavily relied on, dealt with quite a different situation. There we held that the application of the Administrator of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942 for an injunction of violations of that Act might be refused, in the exercise of the District Court's \"discretion.\" But the scheme of the statute in Hecht v. Bowles was significantly different from that of the statute in this case. The Emergency Price Control Act of 1942 provided that the District \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 59]\n\u00a0\n Court should grant, at the Administrator's application, \"a permanent or temporary injunction, restraining order, or other order.\" This Court emphasized the alternative character of this provision for an \"other order\" as imparting to the District Court discretion to withhold an injunction. \n321 \nU.S., at 328\n. Under the Labor Management Relations Act the District Court is given jurisdiction to enjoin \"and to make such other orders as may be appropriate.\" Congress thus provided a jurisdiction additional to the power to grant an injunction, not alternative to it: an \"other order\" may only supplement an injunction, it may not supplant it. Beyond this difference are the considerations that, under the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, an injunction did not, as it does here, bring into play other carefully prescribed relief designed by Congress to alleviate the cause of the evil which it was the purpose of the statute to correct, nor was the duration of the injunction specifically limited as in this case. There was not, therefore, in Hecht v. Bowles the strong showing we have here that the Congress has resolved the question of the appropriate form of relief for the condition the statute is meant to correct, and the Court there concluded that the Administrator's application for judicial relief was an appeal to the ordinary equity jurisdiction and \"discretion\" of the District Court. In Hecht v. Bowles itself the Court recognized that there might be \"other federal statutes governing administrative agencies which . . . make it mandatory that those agencies take action when certain facts are shown to exist.\" \n321 \nU.S., at 329\n. In essence this describes the situation under the Labor Management Relations Act.\n\nWe come finally to the petitioner's contention that the grant to the District Courts by 208 (a) of the Labor Management Relations Act of jurisdiction to enjoin strikes such as this one is not a grant of \"judicial Power\" within the meaning of Art. III, 2, of the Constitution, \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 60]\n\u00a0\n and was therefore beyond the power of Congress to confer on the District Courts. What proceedings are \"Cases\" and \"Controversies\" and thus within the \"judicial Power\" is to be determined, at the least, by what proceedings were recognized at the time of the Constitution to be traditionally within the power of courts in the English and American judicial systems. Both by what they said and by what they implied, the framers of the Judiciary Article gave merely the outlines of what were to them the familiar operations of the English judicial system and its manifestations on this side of the ocean before the Union. Judicial power could come into play only in matters such as were the traditional concern of the courts at Westminster and only if they arose in ways that to the expert feel of lawyers constituted \"Cases\" or \"Controversies.\"\n\nBeginning at least as early as the sixteenth century the English courts have issued injunctions to abate public nuisances. Bond's Case, Moore 238 (1587); Jacob Hall's Case, 1 Ventris 169, 1 Mod. 76 (1671); The King v. Betterton, 5 Mod. 142 (1696); Baines v. Baker, 3 Atk. 750, 1 Amb. 158 (1752); Mayor of London v. Bolt, 5 Ves. 129 (1799). See also Eden, Injunctions (3d ed. 1852), Vol. II, 259; Blackstone, Commentaries (12th ed. 1795), Vol. IV, 166. This old, settled law was summarized in 1836 by the Lord Chancellor in the statement that \"the Court of Exchequer, as well as this Court, acting as a court of equity, has a well established jurisdiction, upon a proceeding by way of information, to prevent nuisances to public harbours and public roads; and, in short, generally, to prevent public nuisances.\" Attorney-General v. Forbes, 2 M. & C. 123, 133. And two years later this Court recognized that \"it is now settled, that a court of equity may take jurisdiction in cases of public nuisance, by an information filed by the attorney general.\" Georgetown v. Alexandria Canal Co., 12 Pet. 91, 98 (1838). \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 61]\n\u00a0\n See also Payne v. Hook, 7 Wall. 425, 430. Since that time this Court has impressively enforced the judicial power to abate public nuisances at the suit of the Government. In re Debs, \n158 \nU.S. 564\n. The crux of the Debs decision, that the Government may invoke judicial power to abate what is in effect a nuisance detrimental to the public interest, has remained intact. The heart of the case was approvingly cited by Mr. Justice Brandeis for the Court in Jacob Ruppert v. Caffey, \n251 \nU.S. 264, 301\n. The scope of the injunction in the Debs case no doubt gave rise to the much-criticized extensive use of the injunction in ordinary employer-employee controversies. See Frankfurter and Greene, The Labor Injunction, pp. 18 et seq., 62-63, and 190, and for the terms of the decree see p. 253. Congress dealt with this proliferating and mischievous use of the labor injunction first through the Clayton Act and later through the Norris-LaGuardia Act. But even the severest critics of the Debs injunction have recognized that it was not a \"new invention.\" See, id., p. 20. The judicial power to enjoin public nuisance at the instance of the Government has been a commonplace of jurisdiction in American judicial history. See, e. g., Attorney General v. Tudor Ice Co., 104 Mass. 239, 244 (1870); Village of Pine City v. Munch, 42 Minn. 342, 343, 44 N. W. 197 (1890); Board of Health v. Vink, 184 Mich. 688, 151 N. W. 672 (1915).\n\nThe jurisdiction given the District Courts by 208 (a) of the Labor Management Relations Act to enjoin strikes creating a national emergency is a jurisdiction of a kind that has been traditionally exercised over public nuisances. The criterion for judicial action - peril to health or safety - is much like those upon which courts ordinarily have acted. Injunctive relief is traditionally given by equity upon a showing of such peril, and the court, as was traditional, acts at the request of the Executive. There can therefore be no doubt that, being thus akin to jurisdiction \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 62]\n\u00a0\n long historically exercised, the function to be performed by the District Courts under 208 (a) is within the \"judicial Power\" as contemplated by Art. III, 2, and is one which Congress may thus confer upon the courts. It surely does not touch the criteria for determining what is \"judicial Power\" that the injunction to be issued is not a permanent one, and may last no longer than eighty days. Given the power in Congress to vest in the federal courts the function to enjoin absolutely, it does not change the character of the power granted or undermine the professional competence of a court for its exercise that Congress has directed the relief to be tempered.\n\nThese controlling constitutional considerations were sought to be diverted by the petitioner through abstract discussion about the necessity for Congress to define legal rights and duties. The power of Congress to deal with the public interest does not derive from, nor is it limited by, rights and duties as between parties. Congress may impose duties and enforce obligations to the Nation as a whole, as it has so obviously done in the Labor Management Relations Act. Such congressional power is not to be subordinated to a sterile juristic dialectic.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] [REPORTER'S NOTE: This concurring opinion was filed December 7, 1959.]\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting.\n*\n\u00a0\n\nGreat cases, like this one, are so charged with importance and feeling that, as Mr. Justice Holmes once remarked (Northern Securities Co. v. United States, \n193 \nU.S. 197, 400\n-401, dissenting opinion), they are apt to generate bad law. We need, therefore, to stick closely to the letter of the law we enforce in order to keep this controversy from being shaped by the intense interest which \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 63]\n\u00a0\n the public rightfully has in it. The statute, which Congress had authority to pass, speaks in narrow and guarded terms. Section 206 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, 61 Stat. 155, 29 U.S.C. 176, gives the President power to invoke the aid of a board of inquiry whenever he is of the opinion that a strike or lockout will imperil \"the national health or safety.\" The President, in appointing the board of inquiry in this case, stated:\n\n \"The strike has closed 85 percent of the nation's steel mills, shutting off practically all new supplies of steel. Over 500,000 steel workers and about 200,000 workers in related industries, together with their families, have been deprived of their usual means of support. Present steel supplies are low and the resumption of full-scale production will require some weeks. If production is not quickly resumed, severe effects upon the economy will endanger the economic health of the nation.\"\n\n\n It is plain that the President construed the word \"health\" to include the material well-being or public welfare of the Nation. When the Attorney General moved under 208 for an injunction in the District Court based on the opinion of the President and the conclusions of the board of inquiry, the union challenged the conclusion that \"the national health or safety\" was imperiled, as those words are used in the Act. The District Court found otherwise, stating five ways in which the strike would, if permitted to continue, imperil \"the national health and safety\":\n\n \"(a) Certain items of steel required in top priority military missile programs of the United States are not made by any mill now operating, nor available from any inventory or from imports. Any further delay in resumption of steel production would result in an irretrievable loss of time in the supply of \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 64]\n\u00a0\n weapons systems essential to the national defense plans of the United States and its allies.\n\n\n \"(b) The planned program of space activities under the direction of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has been delayed by the strike and will be further delayed if it is continued. Specifically, project MERCURY, the nation's manned satellite program, which has the highest national priority, has been delayed by reason of delay in construction of buildings essential to its operation. This program is important to the security of the nation. Other planned space programs will be delayed or threatened with delay by a continuation of the strike.\n\n\n \"(c) Nuclear Submarines and the naval shipbuilding program other than submarines, including new construction, modernization, and conversion, have been affected by reason of the inability to secure boilers, compressors, and other component parts requiring steel. Products of the steel industry are indispensable to the manufacture of such items and delay in their production will irreparably injure national defense and imperil the national safety.\n\n\n \"(d) Exported steel products are vital to the support of the United States bases overseas and for the use of NATO allies and similar collective security groups. The steel strike, if permitted to continue, will seriously impair these programs, thus imperiling the national safety.\n\n\n \"(e) A continuation of the strike will have the ultimate effect of adversely affecting millions of small business enterprises, almost all of which are directly or indirectly dependent upon steel products and most of which lack the resources to stock large inventories. In addition, it will have the effect of idling millions \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 65]\n\u00a0\n of workers and a large proportion of the facilities in industries dependent upon steel for their continued operation. Manufacturing industries directly dependent on steel mill products account for the employment of approximately 6,000,000 workers and normal annual wages and salaries totalling approximately $34,000,000,000. The products of these industries are valued at over $125,000,000,000. The national health will be imperiled if the strike is permitted to continue.\"\n\n\n Here again it is obvious that \"national health\" was construed to include the economic well-being or general welfare of the country. The Court of Appeals, in sustaining the injunction, was apparently of the same view. This seems to me to be an assumption that is unwarranted. I think that Congress, when it used the words \"national health,\" was safeguarding the heating of homes, the delivery of milk, the protection of hospitals, and the like. The coal industry, closely identified with physical health of people, was the industry paramount in the debates on this measure. The coal industry is indeed cited on the Senate side in illustration of the need for the measure. S. Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 14. There were those in the Senate who wanted to go so far as to outlaw strikes \"in utilities and key Nation-wide industries\" in order to protect the \"public welfare.\" 93 Cong. Rec. A1035. Reference was, indeed, made to strikes in industries \"like coal or steel\" among those to be barred in \"the public interest.\" Ibid. But the Senate did not go that far. The Senate bill reached only situations where there was peril to the \"national health or safety.\"\n1\n The House bill went further and included cases where there was peril to \"the public health, safety, \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 66]\n\u00a0\n or interest.\"\n2\n The Senate view prevailed, its version being adopted by the Conference.\n3\n Some light is thrown on the wide difference between those two standards - if words are to be taken in their usual sense - by the following colloquy on the floor of the House:\n4\n\u00a0\n\n \"Mr. KENNEDY. I believe that this country should certainly be in a position to combat a strike that affects the health and safety of the people. Therefore, I feel that the President must have the power to step in and stop those strikes. I am not in the position of opposing everything in this bill, but there are certain things in the bill that are wrong. I do not see how the President is going to have the power to stop strikes that will affect the health and safety of the people under the procedure listed in section 203. I think he must have that power.\n\n\n \"I agree with you that any bill providing for an injunction should carefully consider the position of the striking union and make sure that their rights are protected. I think that in those cases Federal seizure until the dispute is settled would perhaps equalize the burden in the fairest possible manner.\n\n\n \"Mr. OWENS. Will not the gentleman admit that we have a third word in there? It is `interest.' Could we not better use the word `welfare' instead of `interest,' because the word `welfare' occurs in the Constitution? It is just as broad as the word `interest' and more practical.\n\n\n \"Mr. KENNEDY. The proposal embraces two separate things, health and safety. Because the remedy is drastic these two, in my opinion, are sufficient. I believe we should apply this remedy when \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 67]\n\u00a0\n the strike affects health or safety, but not the welfare and interest, which may mean anything. I would not interfere in an automobile strike because while perhaps that affects national interest, it does not affect health and safety.\n\n\n \"Mr. OWENS. Does not the gentleman agree that `welfare' is the stronger and in line with the President's idea?\n\n\n \"Mr. KENNEDY. No. Both `welfare' and `interest' are too indefinite. They could cover anything. I would not have the law apply except in cases where the strike affected health and safety.\"\n\n\n To read \"welfare\" into \"health\" gives that word such a vast reach that we should do it only under the most compelling necessity. We must be mindful of the history behind this legislation. In re Debs, \n158 \nU.S. 564, 584\n, stands as ominous precedent for the easy use of the injunction in labor disputes. Free-wheeling Attorneys General used compelling public demands to obtain the help of courts in stilling the protests of labor. The revulsion against that practice was deep, and it led ultimately to the enactment of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 47 Stat. 70, 29 U.S.C. 101.\n5\n We deal, of course, with a later Congress and an Act that by 208 (b) sets aside pro \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 68]\n\u00a0\n tanto the earlier Act. What Congress has created Congress can refashion. But we should hesitate to conclude that Congress meant to restore the use of the injunction in labor disputes whenever that broad and all-inclusive concept of the public welfare is impaired. The words used - \"national health or safety\" - are much narrower.\n\nCongress in the same Act knew how to speak when it spoke all-inclusively. The declaration of policy in the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, speaks in broad terms. There is a declaration in 1 (b) that \"neither party has any right in its relations with any other to engage in acts or practices which jeopardize the public health, safety, or interest.\" 61 Stat. 136. The words \"public . . . interest\" cover five titles of a far-reaching regulatory measure. Yet, when Congress came to define the jurisdiction of courts to intervene in strikes or lockouts, it spoke in more restricted terms, confining the judiciary to injunctions where there is impending peril to \"the national health or safety.\" That narrow reading is, indeed, the only one that can be squared with Senator Taft's explanation of the use of an injunction in a strike situation. The strike, he said, must not only affect substantially \"an entire industry,\" it must also \"imperil the national health or safety, a condition which, it is anticipated, will not often occur.\"\n6\n Yet, if \"national \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 69]\n\u00a0\n health\" includes the public welfare, injunctions will issue whenever any important industry is involved - whether it be steel or automobiles or coal or any group of industries where one union makes collective agreements for each of the component unions.\n\nIt is a fact of which we can take judicial notice that steel production in its broadest reach may have a great impact on \"national health.\" Machinery for processing food is needed; hospitals require surgical instruments; refrigeration is dependent on steel; and so on. Whether there are such shortages that imperil the \"national health\" is not shown by this record. But unless these particularized findings are made no case can be made out for founding the injunction on impending peril to the \"national health.\"\n\nNor can this broad injunction be sustained when it is rested solely on \"national safety.\" The heart of the District Court's finding on this phase of the case is in its statement, \"Certain items of steel required in top priority military missile programs of the United States are not made by any mill now operating, nor available from any inventory or from imports.\" Its other findings, already quoted, are also generalized. One cannot find in the record the type or quantity of the steel needed for defense, the name of the plants at which those products are produced, or the number or the names of the plants that will have to be reopened to fill the military need. We do know that for one and a half years ending in mid-1959 the shipments of steel for defense purposes accounted for less than 1% of all the shipments from all the steel mills. If 1,000 men, or 5,000 men, or 10,000 men can produce the critical amount the defense departments need, what authority is there to send 500,000 men back to work?\n\nThere can be no doubt that the steel strike affects a \"substantial\" portion of the industry. Hence the first requirement \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 70]\n\u00a0\n of 208 (a) of the Act is satisfied.\n7\n But we do know that only a fraction of the production of the struck industry goes to defense needs. We do not know, however, what fraction of the industry is necessary to produce that portion.\n8\n Without that knowledge the District Court is incapable of fashioning a decree that will safeguard the national \"safety,\" and still protect the rights of labor. Will a selective reopening of a few mills be adequate to meet defense needs? Which mills are these? Would it be practical to reopen them solely for defense purposes or would they have to be reopened for all civilian purposes as well? This seems to me to be the type of inquiry that is necessary before a decree can be entered that will safeguard the rights of all the parties. Section 208 (a) gives the District Court \"jurisdiction to enjoin\" the strike. There is no command that it shall enjoin 100% of the strikers when only 1% or 5% or 10% of them are engaged in acts that imperil the national \"safety.\" We are dealing here with equity practice which has several hundred years of history behind it. We cannot lightly assume that Congress intended to make the \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 71]\n\u00a0\n federal judiciary a rubber stamp for the President. His findings are entitled to great weight, and I along with my Brethren accept them insofar as national \"safety\" is concerned. But it is the court, not the President, that is entrusted by Article III of the Constitution to shape and fashion the decree. If a federal court is to do it, it must act in its traditional manner, not as a military commander ordering people to work willy-nilly, nor as the President's Administrative Assistant. If the federal court is to be merely an automaton stamping the papers an Attorney General presents, the judicial function rises to no higher level than an IBM machine. Those who grew up with equity and know its great history should never tolerate that mechanical conception.\n\nAn appeal to the equity jurisdiction of the Federal District Court is an appeal to its sound discretion. One historic feature of equity is the molding of decrees to fit the requirements of particular cases. See Brown v. Board of Education, \n349 \nU.S. 294, 300\n. Equity decrees are not like the packaged goods this machine age produces. They are uniform only in that they seek to do equity in a given case.\n9\n We should hesitate long before we \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 72]\n\u00a0\n conclude that Congress intended an injunction to issue against 500,000 workers when the inactivity of only 5,000 or 10,000 of the total imperils the national \"safety.\" That would be too sharp a break with traditional equity practice for us to accept, unless the statutory mandate were clear and unambiguous. In situations no more clouded with doubt than the present one we have refused to read a statutory authority to issue a decree as a command to do it. Hecht Co. v. Bowles, \n321 \nU.S. 321\n. We there said, \"A grant of jurisdiction to issue compliance orders hardly suggests an absolute duty to do so under any and all circumstances.\" Id., at 329. And see Porter v. Warner Co., \n328 \nU.S. 395, 398\n. The concurring opinion seeks to distinguish the Bowles case by laying great stress on the language of the statute there in issue to the effect that remedy by injunction \"or other order\" shall be granted, as distinguished from the use of the words \"and to make such other orders\" in 208 presently involved. In the Bowles case, however, we expressly declined to reach the question whether it was an abuse of discretion for the District Court to deny any relief, which is what it did in that case. Id., at 331. Moreover, the \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 73]\n\u00a0\n language of the statute in the Bowles case stated that an injunction or other order \"shall be granted.\" We have here no such command, since 208 only provides that the District Court \"shall have jurisdiction\" to issue an injunction and other orders, as may be appropriate.\n\nPlainly there is authority in the District Court to protect the national \"safety\" by issuance of an injunction. But there is nothing in this record to sustain the conclusion that it is necessary to send 500,000 men back to work to give the defense department all the steel it needs for the Nation's \"safety.\" If more men are sent back to work than are necessary to fill the defense needs of the country, other objectives are being served than those specified in the statute. What are these other objectives? What right do courts have in serving them? What authority do we have to place the great weight of this injunction on the backs of labor, when the great bulk of those affected by it have nothing to do with production of goods necessary for the Nation's \"safety\" in the military sense of that word? Labor injunctions were long used as cudgels - so broad in scope, so indiscriminate in application as once to be dubbed \"a `scarecrow' device for curbing the economic pressure of the strike.\" See Frankfurter and Greene, The Labor Injunction (1930), pp. 107-108. The crop of evils that grew up during those regimes was different in some respects from those generated by this decree. The problems of vagueness, of uncertainty, of detailed judicial supervision that made police courts out of equity courts are not present here. But the same indiscriminate leveling of those within and those without the law is present. The injunction applies all the force of the Federal Government against men whose work has nothing to do with military defense as well as against those whose inactivity imperils the \"national safety.\" It is not confined to the precise evil at which the present Act is aimed. Like the old labor injunctions that brought discredit to the federal \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 74]\n\u00a0\n judiciary this is a blanket injunction broad and all-inclusive, bringing within its scope men whose work has nothing whatsoever to do with the defense needs of the Nation. Being wide of the statutory standard it has, to use the words of Mr. Justice Brandeis, all the vices of the injunction which is used \"to endow property with active, militant power which would make it dominant over men.\" See Truax v. Corrigan, \n257 \nU.S. 312, 354\n, 368 (dissenting opinion). I cannot believe that Congress intended the federal courts to issue injunctions that bludgeon all workers merely because the labor of a few of them is needed in the interest of \"national safety.\"\n\nLabor goes back to work under the present injunction on terms dictated by the industry, not on terms that have been found to be fair to labor and to industry. The steel industry exploits a tremendous advantage:\n\n \"Our steel mills can produce in nine months all the metal the country can use in a year. That means a three-month strike costs the companies nothing in annual sales, and Uncle Sam picks up the tab for half of their out-of-pocket strike losses in the form of eventual tax adjustments.\n\n\n \"The industry's final insurance against any acute financial pinch is the certainty that the President will have to step in with a national emergency injunction under the Taft-Hartley Act whenever steel stockpiles shrink to the danger level. This takes much of the bite out of the union's assault on the pocketbooks of the steel producers.\"\n10\n\u00a0\n\n\n This is a matter which equity should take into consideration. For a chancellor sits to do equity.\n\nSome years ago this Court struck down as unconstitutional state statutes making arbitration of labor disputes \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 75]\n\u00a0\n mandatory. Wolff Co. v. Industrial Court, \n262 \nU.S. 522\n; Dorchy v. Kansas, \n264 \nU.S. 286\n. Those cases held that compulsory arbitration violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. One can only guess as to what institutions of adjudication we might have in this field today had that experiment been given a chance. The experiment, however, did not survive, and we have had little experience with it.\n11\n Collective bargaining and mediation are today the norm, except for the period of time in which an injunction is in force. By the terms of 209, however, any injunction rendered may not continue longer than 80 days. The Act thus permits an injunction restricted in duration and narrowly confined by the requirements of the \"national health or safety.\" When we uphold this injunction we force men back to work when their inactivity has no relation to \"national health or safety.\" Those whose inactivity produces the peril to \"national health or safety\" which the Act guards against and only those should be covered in the injunction. The rest - who are the vast majority of the 500,000 on strike - should be treated as the employers are treated. They should continue under the regime of collective bargaining and mediation until they settle their differences or until Congress provides different or broader \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 76]\n\u00a0\n remedies. When we assume that all the steelworkers are producing steel for defense when in truth only a fraction of them are, we are fulfilling the dreams of those who sponsored the House bill and failed in their efforts to have Congress legislate so broadly.\n\nThough unlikely, it is possible that, had the District Court given the problem the consideration that it deserves, it could have found that the only way to remove the peril to national safety caused by the strike was to issue the broad, blanket injunction. It may be that it would be found impractical to send only part of the steelworkers back to work. The record in this case, however, is devoid of evidence to sustain that position.\n12\n Furthermore, there is no indication that the District Court ever even considered such a possibility. I am unwilling to take judicial notice that it requires 100% of the workers to produce the steel needed for national defense when 99% of the output is devoted to purposes entirely unconnected with defense projects.\n\nThe trier of fact under our federal judicial system is the District Court - not this Court nor the Court of Appeals. No finding was made by the District Court on the feasibility of a limited reopening of the steel mills and it is not, as the concurring opinion suggests, the province of the Court of Appeals to resolve conflicts in the evidence that was before the District Court.\n\nI would reverse this decree and remand the cause to the District Court for particularized findings\n13\n as to how the \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 77]\n\u00a0\n steel strike imperils the \"national health\" and what plants need to be reopened to produce the small quantity of steel now needed for the national \"safety.\"\n14\n There would also be open for inquiry and findings any questions pertaining to \"national health\" in the narrow sense in which the Act uses those words.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] [REPORTER'S NOTE: This dissenting opinion was filed November 7, 1959, and was revised later in the light of the concurring opinion.

To meet an industry-wide stoppage of some kind which may cause injury to the health or safety of 140,000,000 people, such as a transportation strike, or a coal strike, we have set up special machinery which will enable the Attorney General, on his own initiative, to petition the courts to prevent either a shut-down or a walk-out, until the mediation processes have had time to function.\" 93 Cong.

Union Pacific R. Co. v. Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co., \n163 \nU.S. 564, 601\n.

There is in fact no limit to the variety of equitable remedies which can be applied to the circumstances of a particular case. 1 Pomeroy's Equity Jurisprudence (5th ed.) 109. An equity court may, by trial for a limited term, determine just how much relief is required to meet the situation, and thereby avoid unnecessary hardship to any of the parties. McClintock on Equity (2d ed.) 30; Pomeroy, supra, 115, 116. This principle has been applied by this Court several times, e. g., where an injunction was \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 72]\n\u00a0\n sought against the pollution of a stream, the defendant was permitted to construct settling basins to alleviate the injury to the plaintiff and the injunction was modified to allow experiments toward that end. Arizona Copper Co. v. Gillespie, \n230 \nU.S. 46\n. And when defendants' smelters emitted noxious fumes an injunction was withheld to permit them to devise a practical method of installing purifying devices. Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co., \n237 \nU.S. 474\n. See also Alexander v. Hillman, \n296 \nU.S. 222\n. A more recent instance where an equity decree was fashioned to meet problems far more complicated than those presented here will be found in Nebraska v. Wyoming, \n325 \nU.S. 589, 665\n-672. The problem there was the division of waters among the States where enforcement of strict legal rights would have resulted in uneconomic and inequitable results. The multitude of factors weighed and appraised there makes the difficulties of the present case seem to be largely the product of imagination or prejudice, not realities of modern plant management.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Raskin, To Prove Karl Marx Was Wrong, N. Y. Times Magazine, Oct. 25, 1959, pp. 12, 84.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] It was stated in S. Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 13-14, in reference to the new machinery for settling labor disputes: \"Under the exigencies of war the Nation did utilize what amounted to compulsory arbitration through the instrumentality of the War Labor Board. This system, however, tended to emphasize unduly the role of the Government, and under it employers and labor organizations tended to avoid solving their difficulties by free collective bargaining. It is difficult to see how such a system could be operated indefinitely without compelling the Government to make decisions on economic issues which in normal times should be solved by the free play of economic forces.\" And see Dishman, The Public Interest in Emergency Labor Disputes, 45 Am. Pol. Sci. Rev. 1100 (1951).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] Such an opinion was stated in an affidavit by the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers; but that is conclusional only. There has been no sifting of the facts to determine whether defense needs can be satisfied by practical means short of sending all men back to work.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] The particularized findings necessary are illustrated by those in United States v. Steelworkers, 202 F.2d 132, 134: \"At its Dunkirk plant the company was then engaged in commerce and in the production of goods for commerce, primarily in the `heat \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 77]\n\u00a0\n exchanger, pressure vessel and prefabricated pipe industry'; the threatened strike would not have affected all, or a substantial part, of that industry. A major part of the Dunkirk plant's production was to carry out contracts the company had with the Atomic Energy Commission and certain of its prime contractors to furnish specialized articles which were essential to the completion of the Commission's program for construction of facilities needed to produce atomic bombs for the national defense. These essential articles were heat exchanger shells used in the production of heavy water needed to operate nuclear reactors capable of producing fissionable materials, gas converter assemblies and other critical items all of which could have been obtained elsewhere only after other potential sources had been equipped to produce them. Resort to other sources would, consequently, have involved months of delay and set back correspondingly the construction program of the Commission and the production of fissionable materials and atomic weapons vital to the national defense. The threatened strike would have affected a substantial part of the atomic weapon industry and would have imperiled the national safety.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] The factor of \"safety\" may well involve, for example, the need for replacement of equipment on railroad trains. An affidavit of the Secretary of Commerce states: \"The continuing availability of most of these steel supplies is vital to the nation's health and safety, used as they are for the production of personal necessities, including surgical instruments, heating and refrigeration equipment, and articles used in the preparation and preservation of food. Steel is also essential to transportation, to the production and transmission of light and power, to the provision of sanitation services, and in the construction and mining industries.\" But the Government in oral argument conceded that neither that aspect of \"safety\" nor any other aspect of \"safety\" apart from military defense is presented by this record, since there are no findings showing the extent to which inventories for those other purposes may be in short supply. \n\n[361 \nU.S. 39, 78]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","179":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nT.

JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioners are interstate motor common carriers, certificated by the Interstate Commerce Commission (I. C. C.) under the Motor Carrier Act of 1935.\n1\n Section 217 of that Act, 49 U.S.C. 317, requires such carriers to file their transportation charges as tariffs with the I. C. C. These tariffs remain effective until suspended or changed in accordance with specified procedures, and so long as they are effective carriers are forbidden to charge or collect any rate other than that provided in the applicable tariff.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nThese cases present in common a single question under the Motor Carrier Act: Can a shipper of goods by a certificated motor carrier challenge in post-shipment litigation the reasonableness of the carrier's charges which were made in accordance with the tariff governing the shipment?\n\nIn No. 68, T. I. M. E. transported several shipments of scientific instruments for the United States from Oklahoma to California. One of the shipments, illustrative of all involved in this litigation, originated at Marion, Oklahoma, and was carried over the lines of petitioner and a connecting carrier to Planehaven, California. At the time, the petitioning carrier had on file with the I. C. C. a tariff relating to such shipments which specified a through rate from Marion to Planehaven of $10.74 per hundredweight. Petitioner was also subject to tariffs which provided a rate of $2.56 per hundredweight from Marion to El Paso, Texas, and of $4.35 per hundredweight from El Paso to Planehaven. The through rate thus \n\n[359 \nU.S. 464, 466]\n\u00a0\n exceeded the combination rate by $3.83. T. I. M. E. charged and collected on the basis of the through rate. On postpayment audit by the General Accounting Office under 322 of the Transportation Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 955, 49 U.S.C. 66, that office concluded that the combination rather than the through rate was applicable to this shipment and required T. I. M. E. to refund the difference between the sum collected under the through tariff and that which would have been due under the combination tariffs. This T. I. M. E. did under protest.\n\nThereafter T. I. M. E. brought suit under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. 1346 (a) (2), claiming that the through tariff was applicable to the shipment and that it was thus entitled to recover the difference between the through and combination rates. The Government defended on the ground that the combination rate was applicable, and alternatively contended that if the through tariff were applicable the rate specified therein was unreasonably high insofar as it exceeded the combination rate. It asked that T. I. M. E.'s suit be stayed to permit the Government to bring a proceeding before the I. C. C. to determine the reasonableness of the through rate. The District Court in an unreported opinion held that the through rate was applicable, and that neither it nor the I. C. C. had power to pass upon the Government's contention that such rate was as to the past unreasonable. Accordingly, the District Court entered summary judgment for T. I. M. E.\n\nThe Government appealed, accepting the District Court's determination as to the applicability of the through rate, but contending that the District Court had erred in refusing to refer to the I. C. C. the issue of the reasonableness of that rate as to past shipments. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Government was entitled to an I. C. C. determination upon the question of reasonableness, and that the fact that the Motor \n\n[359 \nU.S. 464, 467]\n\u00a0\n Carrier Act gives the I. C. C. no power to award reparations as to admittedly governing past rates does not prevent that body from passing on the question of past reasonableness when that issue arises in litigation in the courts. 252 F.2d 178.\n\nIn No. 96, petitioner Davidson transported four shipments of goods for the United States from Poughkeepsie, N. Y., to Bellbluff, Va., and billed the United States on the basis of concededly applicable filed tariffs. On post-payment audit the general Accounting Office concluded that a part of these charges was unreasonable and should be refunded to the United States.\n3\n Davidson refunded under protest the sum demanded, which amounted to $18.34, and then brought suit under the Tucker Act to recover the refund. The Government defended on the sole ground that the applicable rate had been unreasonable. The District Court, without opinion, granted Davidson summary judgment, but on the Government's appeal the judgment was reversed, the Court of Appeals holding that the Government could defend on \"unreasonableness\" grounds, and directing a referral to the I. C. C. of the issue as to the reasonableness of the rate in question. 104 U.S. App. D.C. 72, 259 F.2d 802.\n\nWe granted certiorari in both cases because of the suggestion that the result reached by the Courts of Appeals \n\n[359 \nU.S. 464, 468]\n\u00a0\n conflicted with this Court's decision in Montana-Dakota Utilities Co. v. Northwestern Pub. Serv. Co., \n341 \nU.S. 246\n, and in order to settle the questions of statutory interpretation involved.\n4\n\u00a0\n358 \nU.S. 810\n.\n\nThe courts below held that the right of the United States to resist on the ground of unreasonableness the payment of the charges incurred by it was one deriving from the common law and preserved by 216 (j) of the Motor Carrier Act.\n5\n In this Court the Government, although defending this ground of decision, relies primarily on the proposition that the Motor Carrier Act itself creates a judicially enforceable right in a shipper to be free from the exaction of unreasonable charges as to past shipments even though such charges reflect applicable rates duly filed with the I. C. C. The Government concedes that whatever the source of the asserted right may be, the question of the reasonableness of past rates cannot itself be decided in the courts, but takes the position that when such question arises in court litigation it may properly be referred to the I. C. C. for decision, and the results of that adjudication used to determine the respective rights of the litigants.\n\n\nI.\n\n\nThe contention that the Motor Carrier Act itself creates a cause of action or affords a defense with respect to the recovery of unreasonable rates on the provisions of \n\n[359 \nU.S. 464, 469]\n\u00a0\n 216 (b) and (d) of the Act, 49 U.S.C. 316 (b), (d), which provide as to interstate motor carriers:\n\n \"(b) It shall be the duty of every [such] common carrier . . . to establish, observe, and enforce just and reasonable rates, charges, and classifications, and just and reasonable regulations and practices relating thereto . . . .\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"(d) All charges made for any service rendered or to be rendered by any [such] common carrier . . . shall be just and reasonable, and every unjust and unreasonable charge for such service or any part thereof, is prohibited and declared to be unlawful. . . .\"\n\n\n The Government urges that this language imposes a statutory duty on motor carriers not to charge or collect other than \"reasonable\" rates, and asks us to imply a cause of action under the Motor Carrier Act for any shipper injured by violation of that duty. We cannot agree.\n\nAs this Court recognized in Montana-Dakota Utilities Co. v. Northwestern Pub. Serv. Co., \n341 \nU.S. 246, 251\n, language of this sort in a statute which entrusts rate regulation to an administrative agency in itself creates only a \"criterion for administrative application in determining a lawful rate\" rather than a \"justiciable legal right.\" In Montana-Dakota it was held that the Federal Power Act, which like the Motor Carrier Act expressly declares unreasonable rates to be \"unlawful,\"\n6\n does not create a cause of action for the recovery of allegedly unreasonable past \n\n[359 \nU.S. 464, 470]\n\u00a0\n rates. In the absence of any indication that Congress intended that despite the absence of any reparations power in the Federal Power Commission the federal courts should entertain suits for reparation of unreasonable rates, and refer to the Commission the controlling issue of past unreasonableness, the Court declined to permit the Commission to accomplish indirectly through such a proceeding that which Congress did not allow it to accomplish directly.\n\nIt is true that under Parts I and III of the Interstate Commerce Act, relating respectively to rail and water carriers, a shipper may litigate as to the reasonableness of past charges even if those charges were based on the applicable and effective filed rates. The structure and history of Part II (the Motor Carrier Act), however, lead to the conclusion that here, as in the Federal Power Act, Congress did not intend to give shippers a statutory cause of action for the recovery of allegedly unreasonable past rates, or to enable them to assert \"unreasonableness\" as a defense in carrier suits to recover applicable tariff rates.\n\nThe very provisions of Part I, and their counterparts in Part III, which give a right of action to shippers against carriers for damages incurred by carrier violations of the Act and provide the mechanics for the enforcement of that right are conspicuously absent in the Motor Carrier Act. Thus, whereas 8 of Part I\n7\n provides that \"any common carrier subject to the provisions of this chapter [who] shall do . . . any act . . . in this chapter . . . declared to be unlawful . . . shall be liable to the person or persons injured thereby for the full amount of the damages sustained . . .,\" Part II has no comparable provision. Again, whereas 9 of Part I\n8\n gives an injured shipper the right to sue in the I. C. C. or in the Federal District Court, \n\n[359 \nU.S. 464, 471]\n\u00a0\n Part II contains no comparable provision. In addition, 13 (1) and 16 of Part I\n9\n give a shipper claiming reparation the right to proceed in the Commission and to enforce his reparation award in the courts, and Part II contains no comparable provisions.\n\nTo hold that the Motor Carrier Act nevertheless gives shippers a right of reparation with respect to allegedly unreasonable past filed tariff rates would require a complete disregard of these significant omissions in Part II of the very provisions which establish and implement a similar right as against rail carriers in Part I. We find it impossible to impute to Congress an intention to give such a right to shippers under the Motor Carrier Act when the very sections which established that right in Part I were wholly omitted in the Motor Carrier Act.\n\nFurther, the I. C. C. itself has consistently recognized that nothing in Part II creates a statutory liability on the part of the carrier for past allegedly unreasonable filed rates. In the hearings which preceded the passage of legislation in 1949 adding to the Motor Carrier Act a statute of limitations on suits to recover amounts paid to carriers in excess of applicable filed rates, proposals were also made to amend the statute by adding to it provisions similar to those already found in 8, 9, 13, and 16 of Part I. The Commission noted that the proposal \"would add to the Interstate Commerce Act a number of new sections which would make common carriers by motor vehicle . . . liable for the payment of damages to persons injured by them through violations of the act. At present this liability exists only in respect of carriers subject to parts I and III . . . .\"\n10\n The suggested changes were not adopted. And in 1957 the Commission again \n\n[359 \nU.S. 464, 472]\n\u00a0\n recommended amendment of the Motor Carrier Act to provide a remedy for violation of the statute to persons injured thereby,\n11\n and once more the measure failed of adoption.\n\nIn light of the statute and its history, it is plain that if a shipper has a \"justiciable legal right\" to recover or resist past motor carrier charges alleged to have been unreasonable, it is necessary to look beyond the Motor Carrier Act for the source of that right.\n\n\nII.\n\n\nThe Government urges that even if the Motor Carrier Act does not grant the right which is claimed here, the Act must at least be read to preserve a pre-existing common-law right of that kind. It relies on 216 (j) of the statute, 49 U.S.C. 316 (j), as showing a congressional intention to confirm such a right in its statement that nothing in 216 \"shall be held to extinguish any remedy or right of action not inconsistent herewith.\" The contention is that the common law recognized the right of a shipper by common carrier to recover exorbitant rates paid under protest,\n12\n and that although the doctrine of primary jurisdiction requires that the issue of whether rates which are retrospectively challenged were in fact \"unreasonable\" be determined by the I. C. C., the common-law right may be vindicated in a suit in the courts through referral of the issue of \"unreasonableness\" to the Commission. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 464, 473]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe saving clause of 216 (j) must be read in light of the judicial decisions interpreting Part I of the Interstate Commerce Act before 1935, for the course of those decisions illuminates the significance of the striking differences which Congress saw fit to make between the provisions of Part I and those of the Motor Carrier Act. The landmark case is Texas & Pacific R. Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., \n204 \nU.S. 426\n. There a shipper sued in a state court to recover the difference between an allegedly unreasonable charge exacted from it by a rail carrier pursuant to tariffs filed by the carrier with the I. C. C. and what was claimed would have been a just and reasonable charge. One of the issues before this Court was whether any common-law right to recover an exorbitant common carrier freight charge paid under protest survived the passage of the Interstate Commerce Act. The Court held, despite the existence in Part I of a saving clause much broader in scope than that here involved,\n13\n that because under the statutory scheme only the I. C. C. could decide in the first instance whether any filed rate was \"unreasonable\" either as to the past or future, any common-law right was necessarily extinguished as \"absolutely inconsistent\" with recognition of the Commission's primary jurisdiction. It is important to note that this conclusion did not rest upon the fact that under Part I the I. C. C. had reparations authority with respect to unreasonable charges paid by shippers, but instead was evidently dictated by the broader conclusion that the crucial question of reasonableness could not be decided by the courts.\n\nSince the Government concedes that under Part II, as under Part I, the issue of the unreasonableness of rates \n\n[359 \nU.S. 464, 474]\n\u00a0\n cannot be adjudicated in the courts, it would seem to follow that the common-law right which the Government urges as surviving under 216 (j) cannot in fact survive, since that clause preserves only \"any remedy or right of action not inconsistent\" with the statutory scheme. The Government urges, however, that there is nothing actually inconsistent with the Commission's primary jurisdiction in recognizing the survival of a common-law right, because the demands of primary jurisdiction can be satisfied by referral of the question of the reasonableness of the assailed rate to the I. C. C., and that although the Commission concededly has no independent authority to entertain and adjudicate a claim for reparations, it nevertheless should be permitted in effect to exercise such an authority as an adjunct to a judicial proceeding.\n\nThe question is, of course, one of statutory intent. We do not think that Congress, which we cannot assume was unaware of the holding of the Abilene case that a common-law right of action to recover unreasonable common carrier charges is incompatible with a statutory scheme in which the courts have no authority to adjudicate the primary question in issue, intended by the saving clause of 216 (j) to sanction a procedure such as that here proposed. It would be anomalous to hold that Congress intended that the sole effect of the omission of reparations provisions in the Motor Carrier Act would be to require the shipper in effect to bring two lawsuits instead of one, with the parties required to file their complaint and answer in a court of competent jurisdiction and then immediately proceed to the I. C. C. to litigate what would ordinarily be the sole controverted issue in the suit. No convincing reason has been suggested to us why Congress would have wished to omit a direct reparations procedure, as it has concededly here done, and yet leave open to the shipper the circuitous route contended for. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 464, 475]\n\u00a0\n\n\nTo permit a utilization of the procedure here sought by the Government would be to engage in the very \"improvisation\" against which this Court cautioned in Montana-Dakota, supra, in order to permit the I. C. C. to accomplish indirectly what Congress has not chosen to give it the authority to accomplish directly. In the absence of the clearest indication that Congress intended that the Motor Carrier Act should preserve rights which could be vindicated only by such an improvisation, we must decline to consider a defense which \"involves only issues which a federal court cannot decide and can only refer to a body which also would have no independent jurisdiction to decide . . . .\"\n14\n Montana-Dakota, supra, at p. 255. The Government's reliance upon United States v. Western Pacific R. Co., \n352 \nU.S. 59\n, is misplaced, for in that case, involving Part I of the Interstate Commerce Act, the authority of the I. C. C. to determine the reasonableness of past filed rates in aid of court litigation was undoubted. The case decided no more than that referral to the I. C. C. of the issue of \"unreasonableness\" involved in the shipper's defense to the carrier's timely Tucker Act suit was not foreclosed by the fact that affirmative reparations relief before the Commission would have been barred by limitations. It has no bearing on the question whether \n\n[359 \nU.S. 464, 476]\n\u00a0\n a judicial remedy in respect of allegedly unreasonable past rates survived the passage of the Motor Carrier Act.\n\nIt is pointed out that the I. C. C. has long claimed the authority to make findings as to the reasonableness of past motor carrier rates embodied in tariffs duly filed with the Commission. It is true that in a series of cases beginning with Barrows Porcelain Enamel Co. v. Cushman Motor Delivery Co., 11 M. C. C. 365, decided in 1939, divisions of the Commission, and eventually the Commission itself, Bell Potato Chip Co. v. Aberdeen Truck Line, 43 M. C. C. 337, announced that the I. C. C. possessed such authority. But in these cases the anterior question now before us, whether a shipper has a right, derived from outside the statute, to put the question of the reasonableness of past rates in issue in judicial proceedings, was given only cursory consideration or else wholly ignored.\n15\n The cases devoted themselves to searching out authorization in the Act for I. C. C. participation, by adjudication as to past unreasonableness, in the vindication of whatever reparation rights might exist.\n16\n The \n\n[359 \nU.S. 464, 477]\n\u00a0\n Government is able to point to only two cases in addition to the present ones, in the 24 years since passage of the Motor Carrier Act, in which courts have appeared to assume that the issue of reasonableness of past motor carrier rates was litigable,\n17\n and in neither of these cases was the question given other than the most cursory attention. Under these circumstances the issue before us cannot fairly be said to be foreclosed by long-standing interpretation and understanding.\n\nWe are told that Congress has long been aware that the Commission was of the view that a common-law action for recovery of unreasonable rates paid to a motor carrier, with referral to the Commission of the issue of unreasonableness, would lie, and that its failure to legislate in derogation of this view implies an approval and acceptance of it. But it appears that each time the Commission's views in this regard were communicated to committees of Congress, it was in connection with a request by the Commission for legislation which would have given to shippers a cause of action under the statute and granted to the Commission the authority to award reparations, and each time that request was rejected.\n18\n\u00a0\n\n[359 \nU.S. 464, 478]\n\u00a0\n Had Congress been asked legislatively to overrule the doctrines enunciated in Bell Potato Chip, supra, and declined to do so, that fact would no doubt have been entitled to some weight in our interpretation of the Act. But we do not think that from the failure of Congress to grant a new authority any reliable inference can permissibly be drawn to the effect that any authority previously claimed was recognized and confirmed.\n\nFinally, it is contended that denial of a remedy to the shipper who has paid unreasonable rates is to sanction \n\n[359 \nU.S. 464, 479]\n\u00a0\n injustice.\n19\n The fact that during the 24-year history of the Motor Carrier Act shippers have sought to secure adjudications in the I. C. C. as to the reasonableness of past rates on only a handful of occasions, despite the Commission's invitation to shippers to pursue that course in the line of cases culminating in Bell Potato Chip, supra, strongly suggests that few occasions have arisen where the application of filed rates has aggrieved shippers by motor carrier.\n20\n Furthermore, this contention overlooks the fact that Congress has in the Motor Carrier Act apparently sought to strike a balance between the interests of the shipper and those of the carrier, and that the statute cut significantly into pre-existing rights of the carrier to set his own rates and put them into immediate effect, at least so long as they were within the \"zone of reasonableness.\" Under the Act a trucker can raise its rates only on 30 days' prior notice, and the I. C. C. may, on its own initiative or on complaint, suspend the effectiveness of the \n\n[359 \nU.S. 464, 480]\n\u00a0\n proposed rate for an additional seven months while its reasonableness is scrutinized.\n21\n Even if the new rate is eventually determined to be reasonable, the carrier concededly has no avenue whereby to collect the increment of that rate over the previous one for the notice or suspension period. Thus although under the statutory scheme it is possible that a shipper will for a time be forced to pay a rate which he has challenged and which is eventually determined to be unreasonable as to the future, as when the suspension period expires before the I. C. C. has acted on the challenge, it is ordinarily the carrier, rather than the shipper, which is made to suffer by any period of administrative \"lag.\"\n22\n\u00a0\n\nFor the foregoing reasons the judgment of the Court of Appeals in each of these cases must fall.\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Interstate Commerce Act, Part II, 49 Stat. 543, as amended, 49 U.S.C. 301 et seq.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See Motor Carrier Act 216 (e), (g), 217 (b), (c), 49 U.S.C. 316 (e), (g), 317 (b), (c).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] This part of the charges was that represented by a \"New York State Surcharge,\" included by Davidson in its rate to recoup the cost of a New York ton-mile truck tax. The tariff including the surcharge had been filed to become effective October 8, 1951. The I. C. C. had suspended the tariff for the maximum period permitted by the Act, but since the inquiry as to its reasonableness was not completed within the suspension period it went into effect on May 8, 1952, and was in effect at the time of shipment. The I. C. C. subsequently found the surcharge to be unreasonable and ordered its excision from Davidson's rates, 62 M. C. C. 117. This order was purely prospective and did not affect the shipments involved here.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] In our view of these cases it becomes unnecessary to consider Davidson's alternative contention that in any event the General Accounting Office had no right under 322 of the Transportation Act of 1940 to deduct from the carrier's charges the amount claimed by the United States to have been unreasonable.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Section 216 (j), 49 U.S.C. 316 (j), provides that \"Nothing in this section shall be held to extinguish any remedy or right of action not inconsistent herewith.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Section 205 (a) of the Power Act, 49 Stat. 851, 16 U.S.C. 824d (a), provides that \"All rates and charges . . . and all rules and regulations affecting or pertaining to such rates or charges shall be just and reasonable, and any such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is hereby declared to be unlawful.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] 49 U.S.C. 8.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] 49 U.S.C. 9.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] 49 U.S.C. 13 (1), 16.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Hearings before Senate Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce on S. 1194, 80th Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 1, 5, 11-12.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] See Hearings before Senate Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce on S. 378, 85th Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 3, 12.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] Such a right was assumed by this Court to have existed at common law in Texas & Pacific R.

It would be surprising, given the policy of uniformity reflected in this provision, for Congress not to have also added a statute of limitations provision applicable to suits on account of unreasonable rates, had a cause of action with respect to such rates been deemed to exist. Compare 49 U.S.C. 16 (3) (b), providing a limitations provision for complaints for the recovery of damages \"not based on overcharges\" from rail carriers.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] See, e. g., United States v. Davidson Transfer & Storage Co., Inc., 302 I. C. C. 87, 90-91, involving the same parties as those now before us in No. 96. Barrows, relied on heavily in the dissenting opinion because it was decided by a Division of the I. C. C. of which Commissioner Eastman, previously Federal Coordinator of Transportation and a principal architect of the Motor Carrier Act, was a member, does not even suggest that a common-law action to recover unreasonable rates might be maintainable.

It relied also on the provisions of the statute which impose on the carrier the duty of maintaining reasonable and nondiscriminatory rates. 49 U.S.C. 316 (b), (d).

We do not so read the legislative history relied upon. On the contrary, Commissioner Eastman, testifying before the Senate Committee, appeared to distinguish between the availability of a judicial remedy in respect of inapplicable tariff rates and the unavailability of such a remedy in respect of rates claimed to be \"unreasonable\" though embodied in a filed tariff. The Commissioner said:\n\n\"So far as reparation is concerned, there is no reason why these \n\n[359 \nU.S. 464, 478]\n\u00a0\n provisions should not be applied to motor carriers as well as to railroads. They were omitted from the Motor Carrier Act only because of the desire to lighten the burdens of the motor carriers in the early stages of regulation, in the absence of any strong indication of public need. Motor carriers have practically no traffic which is noncompetitive, and there is little danger that they will exact exorbitant charges. Since the Motor Carrier Act became effective in 1935, the Commission has not once had occasion to condemn motor-carrier rates as unreasonably high. I don't think we have had any complaints to that effect. It follows that there is nothing to indicate that shippers need provisions to enable the Commission to award reparation for damages suffered because of unreasonable charges.\n\n\n\"The occasion for reparation from motor carriers would chiefly arise, therefore, in the event of overcharges above published tariff rates. Shippers can recover such overcharges in court as the law now stands.\" (Emphasis added.) Hearings before Senate Interstate Commerce Committee on S. 1310, S. 2016, S. 1869, and S. 2009, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 791-792.\n\n\n See also Hearings at p. 132, where Senator Reed asked a truckers' representative opposing the addition of reparations provisions to the Motor Carrier Act \"[I]f a shipper by railroad, which is one from of common carrier, now has a remedy at law in the way of damages which he may have suffered through a collection of an unreasonable rate, and if we are trying to make uniform regulations, why should a common carrier by truck be exempted from the right or remedy of the shipper against an unreasonable charge any more than any other form of common carrier?\" The reparations provision was subsequently stricken from the bill.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] But see Jaffe, Primary Jurisdiction Reconsidered, 102 U. of Pa. L. Rev. 577, 589, commenting on Bell Potato Chip, supra: \"It is, to be sure, doubtful that reparations in such a case serve a useful function. Rates are under continuous scrutiny. Administrative condemnation implies new circumstances or new understanding rather than serious past injustice. And, as Mr. Justice Jackson observes in the Montana-Dakota case, the overcharge has usually been passed along by the one who paid it to some undiscoverable and unreimbursable consumer.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] It was recognized at the time of passage of the Motor Carrier Act that competitive conditions in the trucking industry were such that the possibility of unreasonably high rates presented no problem. Commissioner Eastman, who had conducted an inquiry into the motor carrier industry, stated during the hearings preceding passage of the Act that \"I do not recall that there were any complaints based upon excessive charges.\" Hearings before a Subcommittee of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce on H. R. 5262, 6016, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 32. See also his 1939 statement before the Interstate Commerce Committee of the Senate, quoted at note 18, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 21\n] See Motor Carrier Act, 217 (c), 216 (g), 49 U.S.C. 317 (c), 316 (g).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 22\n] Counsel for the Government stated on oral argument that the situation presented in No. 96, where the suspension period expired before the adjudication of the reasonableness of the challenged rate had been completed, arises very infrequently, since the suspension period is ordinarily ample to permit such adjudication.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and MR. JUSTICE CLARK join, dissenting.\n\nThere can be no serious doubt that at common law a cause of action existed against carriers who charged unreasonable rates. See Texas & P. R. Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., \n204 \nU.S. 426, 436\n; Arizona Grocery Co. v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co., \n284 \nU.S. 370, 383\n.\n1\n Nor \n\n[359 \nU.S. 464, 481]\n\u00a0\n can it be questioned that the Motor Carrier Act confirmed the common-law policy against unreasonable rates and in fact expressly made such rates illegal.\n2\n It is also clear that the Act attempted to preserve all pre-existing remedies which did not directly conflict with its aims.\n3\n Nevertheless the Court today holds that the statute abolished the common-law remedy by implication and left shippers helpless against carriers who have charged unreasonable and therefore illegal rates. To accomplish this result the Court relies essentially on two prior decisions of this Court; Montana-Dakota Utilities Co. v. Northwestern Pub. Serv. Co., \n341 \nU.S. 246\n, which I believe has virtually nothing to do with the issue, and Texas & P. R. Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., \n204 \nU.S. 426\n, which, I think, supports a holding opposite to that which the Court makes today. Moreover, in reaching its conclusion, the Court overturns a long-standing and consistent I. C. C. interpretation of the Motor Carrier Act - an interpretation which was based in large part on the Abilene case, which was first formulated by men who helped draft the Act, and which has been generally accepted by shippers, carriers, and Congress alike. I am unable to understand why the Court strains so hard to reach so bad a result.\n\nThe Motor Carrier Act, though largely patterned after the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 regulating railroads, \n\n[359 \nU.S. 464, 482]\n\u00a0\n had no counterpart of 8, 9, 13 and 16 of that Act.\n4\n These sections provided two remedies either of which a shipper could pursue to recover damages suffered as a result of unlawful carrier rates or practices. One remedy was by complaint to the Commission the other by suit brought in an appropriate District Court of the United States. Both these remedies authorized imposition of reasonable attorneys' fees on a carrier should a claim reach the court and be decided in the shipper's favor. See Meeker v. Lehigh Valley R. Co., \n236 \nU.S. 412, 432\n-433.\n\nIn Texas & P. R. Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., \n204 \nU.S. 426\n, this Court considered the effect of these reparation sections on common-law actions by shippers for damages caused by rates alleged to be unlawful because unreasonable. The Court implied that the state court in which the shipper had sued had no jurisdiction since the congressional remedies in the reparation sections were complete and exclusive in themselves and supplanted the pre-existing common-law right of shippers to sue for damages caused by unreasonable rates, this right being deemed inconsistent with the statutory remedies; and held that the power to determine the reasonableness of rates was primarily and exclusively vested by the Act in the Commission. It did not hold, as the Court now assumes, that the existence of primary jurisdiction alone destroyed all court remedies. Accordingly, since the Abilene case, when the question of unreasonableness has arisen in court proceedings courts have often refused to dismiss the cause but have stayed the action pending I. C. C. determination of that issue. See e. g., Mitchell Coal & Coke Co. v. Pennsylvania R. Co., \n230 \nU.S. 247\n; General Am. Tank Car Corp. v. El Dorado Terminal Co., \n308 \nU.S. 422, 432\n-433; United States v. Western P. R. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 464, 483]\n\u00a0\n Co., \n352 \nU.S. 59, 62\n-70.\n5\n The Court today seems to decide instead that primary jurisdiction is inconsistent with court remedies of any kind, and that the mere omission of reparations provisions in the Motor Carrier Act showed a congressional purpose to deprive shippers of the common-law right to obtain damages resulting from unreasonable rates. It reaches this conclusion although to do so leaves shippers with no remedy at all however unreasonable and unlawful a past rate may have been, and although there is not a word in the Act, and nothing to which we have been directed in its history, that shows any congressional purpose to take away the pre-existing remedy.\n\nOn the contrary, since passage of the Motor Carrier Act in 1935, a steady line of decisions by the I. C. C. has interpreted that Act as leaving shippers the right to sue in the courts for damages resulting from unlawful rates. This action lay only where the rates had not previously been held reasonable by the Commission, cf. Arizona Grocery Co. v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co., \n284 \nU.S. 370, 387\n-388, and consisted of two parts, (1) a suit by a shipper in a court, (2) a determination by the Commission that the rates sued on had, in fact, been unreasonable or otherwise unlawful when charged. The first case of this kind, Barrows Porcelain Enam. Co. v. Cushman Motor Deliv. Co., 11 M. C. C. 365, was submitted to the Commission in April 1938, and handed down in February 1939. It was decided by Division 5 which was specially charged \n\n[359 \nU.S. 464, 484]\n\u00a0\n with the administration of the Motor Carrier Act and was concurred in by Commissioner Eastman who had by then served on the Commission or as Coordinator of the Transportation System of the country for 17 years. He had drafted the 1935 Act and probably knew more about what it meant than anybody on this Court then or now.\n6\n Admitting that the Commission could not itself award reparations, Division 5 held, in Barrows, that it did have authority to pass on the reasonableness of past rates since unreasonable rates were unlawful under the Act. Significantly Division 5 stated, \"This conclusion is, we believe, supported by the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court in Texas & P. Ry. Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., \n204 \nU.S. 426\n.\" 11 M. C. C., at 367. Barrows was reaffirmed in early 1940 with Commissioner Eastman again on the panel.\n7\n\u00a0\n\n[359 \nU.S. 464, 485]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn September 1940, after very extensive hearings, the Interstate Commerce Act was amended and broadened in many respects.\n8\n At the same time, water carriers were brought under Commission regulation. To achieve uniformity between the different parts of the Act, efforts were made to subject motor carriers to reparation proceedings before the Commission.\n9\n The representative of the motor carriers strenuously objected. The hearings before the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce show that the objections were directed against subjection of motor carriers to Commission reparations not to common-law actions in the courts. Commission actions, it was stated, might result in the taxing of attorneys' fees in addition to damages and might thereby encourage \"claim chasers.\"\n10\n The Committee members and the witnesses before Congress all appeared to recognize that suits could be filed in court. Thus the Chairman of the Committee stated \"He has that right now. It does not add anything, as a matter of fact, to the rights of the shipper . . . . [I]f \n\n[359 \nU.S. 464, 486]\n\u00a0\n you were afraid that the railroad might go and stir up a claim against [the truckers], they can do that now.\"\n11\n And the representative of the truckers answered \"We are not fearful of that, but we are fearful of practices occurring where [the truckers] will be constantly harassed.\" To which a member of the Committee added \"The objection is that under the existing law you have to go to the court to get relief and under the proposed law the Interstate Commerce Commission could give you relief?\"\n12\n Commissioner Eastman also appeared before the Committee, two months after the Barrows opinion came down, and stated\n\n\"[M]otor carrier tariffs have been, by and large, very imperfect products, and while the situation is improving continually, much room for improvement remains.\n\n\n \"Where tariffs are poorly worded and imperfectly constructed, experienced traffic experts can often raise troublesome questions as to the applicability of the rates charged, and there are those who make this their business, obtaining their compensation from such reparation awards as they are successful in securing.\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"In the early stages of their regulation and tariff development, it was thought that the motor carriers might well be spared the burden of defending such claims before the Commission.\"\n13\n\u00a0\n\n\n Accordingly the Committee Report on the 1940 Act stated that the paragraph of the bill which would have \n\n[359 \nU.S. 464, 487]\n\u00a0\n subjected the motor carriers to reparation claims before the Commission was changed\n\n\"because of motor carrier objections to awards of reparation by the Commission. Shippers have the right to recover in court any damages resulting from violations of the law by motor carriers or carriers by water.\" S. Rep. No. 433, 76th Cong., 1st Sess. 18. (Emphasis supplied.)\n14\n\u00a0\n\n\n It seems clear, therefore, that when the 1940 Motor Carrier Act was adopted, at least the Senate Committee was fully informed of an existing interpretation of the 1935 Act under which shippers could sue for damages on the basis of unreasonable rates.\n\nAfter the passage of the 1940 Act, Divisions of the Commission continued to construe the Motor Carrier law to allow determinations of the reasonableness of past rates. In 1942, for example, the Commission did this in a case involving the same question presented by the Government in T. I. M. E., No. 68 - the reasonableness of a joint through rate which exceeds the aggregate of intermediate rates between the same points. The Commission held that on the facts presented the rates \"were unreasonable . . . to the extent that they exceeded the corresponding aggregate . . . .\" Kingan & Co. v. Olson Trans. Co., 32 M. C. C. 10, 12. Finally in Bell Potato Chip Co. v. Aberdeen Truck Line, 43 M. C. C. 337, the whole Commission reviewed the question to provide a \"precedent for future guidance\" and emphatically approved the Barrows line of cases. It established safeguards against frivolous or moot complaints but \n\n[359 \nU.S. 464, 488]\n\u00a0\n reaffirmed the existence of court remedies for unreasonable rates and the need for Commission determinations of the fact of unreasonableness before the courts could award damages.\n\nBoth the Bell case and the Barrows case have been cited to Congressional Committees time and again. In 1947 and 1948 extended hearings were held before Senate and House Committees on bills to establish uniform statutes of limitations for court actions arising out of violations of the Commerce Act and to subject motor carriers and freight forwarders to Commission reparations.\n15\n Members of the I. C. C. in written statements, briefs and testimony, stressed to the Committees considering the bills both the existence of the court remedies described in the Bell case and the fact that few common-law actions were in fact undertaken because of the expense involved in a split procedure.\n16\n Witnesses for an against the bills accepted the rule of the Bell case.\n17\n Thus the representative of the freight forwarders, whose status under the Act is the same as that of motor carriers, referring to the Bell case said \"It is the law today,\" and then added \"If the Commission finds that the rates have been unreasonable in the past, damages may be obtained under the law as it stands today.\"\n18\n He opposed the proposed change because he felt that it would make it easier for shippers to obtain reparations where no damages \n\n[359 \nU.S. 464, 489]\n\u00a0\n were actually suffered.\n19\n When the bills were reported by the Committees the provisions for reparations before the Commission were excluded. The report of the House Committee explained that reparations before the Commission were not available under the law as it stood. After stating that the bills originally had included reparation provisions before the Commission similar to those applied to rail carriers and that these had been dropped, the report incorporated a letter from the I. C. C. explaining the existence of the court remedy and pointing out the weaknesses of this remedy. The Committee then stated that legislation making additional reparations provisions applicable to motor carriers and freight forwarders was not at that time deemed desirable. It concluded that the other provisions, including a uniform statute of limitations in cases arising from the charging of tariffs different from those on file, should be enacted.\n20\n While Congress did not enact these measures before adjournment,\n21\n they were passed in the following Congress after Committee Reports which referred to the hearings of the prior two years.\n22\n\u00a0\n\nOnce more, as late as 1957, after this Court's decision in Montana-Dakota Utilities Co. v. Northwestern Pub. Serv. Co., \n341 \nU.S. 246\n, the I. C. C. sought to have reparations before the Commission established. Again hearings were held; in these the Chairman of the I. C. C., the Under Secretary of Commerce, a representative of the freight forwarders and others unequivocally testified that a remedy \n\n[359 \nU.S. 464, 490]\n\u00a0\n for unreasonable past rates was available through the courts.\n23\n This testimony by the representative of the freight forwarders caused the presiding member of the Subcommittee to ask \"What does this bill propose that is different from what we now have? That is what I am trying to determine.\" To which the representative, opposing Commission reparations, replied: \"It just adds some cumbersome machinery that we think will cause litigation.\"\n24\n\u00a0\n\nThis Court has frequently had occasion to say that interpretations of statutes by agencies charged with their administration are entitled to very great weight.\n25\n Moreover, the legislative history of bills attempting to grant the I. C. C. power to award reparations goes far, in view of the arguments made against them, toward approving the original interpretation of the Motor Carrier Act made by Division 5 of the I. C. C. and Commissioner Eastman. Recently, the Commission has reaffirmed its interpretation which has stood for more than 20 years.\n26\n Against reaffirmance a dissent was written based on the belief that this Court's holding in Montana-Dakota Utilities Co. v. Northwestern Pub. Serv. Co., \n341 \nU.S. 246\n, required a new interpretation. The Court seems to stress the same contention here. Quite apart from the fact that the question actually up for decision in Montana-Dakota was whether the Federal Power Act created a federal cause of action and not whether it \n\n[359 \nU.S. 464, 491]\n\u00a0\n destroyed common-law rights, I believe that there are important differences between the Power Act and the Motor Carrier Act which make the Montana-Dakota case wholly inapplicable here.\n\nAdmittedly Montana-Dakota and the statute it interpreted have some similarities to these cases and this statute. But unlike the Carrier Act the provisions of the Power Act under consideration in Montana-Dakota regulated wholesale rates, that is rates charged purchasers for resale, not rates charged retail customers.\n27\n The purpose of that Act was, nevertheless, to benefit consumers by holding down wholesale prices. Wholesalers whose purchase price was reduced prospectively could pass the reduction on to their customers, the consumers. In Montana-Dakota the Court indicated that the consumers would not be helped by ex post facto determinations of unreasonableness resulting in a refund to wholesalers. \n341 \nU.S., at 254\n. The facts of the case lent themselves to such a finding. Damages were asked for a back period of many years; consumers had long since paid their rates on the basis of the unreasonable prices charged the wholesalers; and there was no reason to believe that any consumers who benefited from whatever lower prices the refund might allow would be the same ones who had paid the excessive rates. The Federal Power Commission, in an amicus brief, stressed these facts and argued that any refund would likely be a windfall providing an unjust enrichment to the wholesaler. Citing this brief the Court accepted the F. P. C. argument, \n341 \nU.S., at 254\n, n. 11, over a vigorous dissent which indicated that perhaps ways of refunding the excess to consumers might be found. \n341 \nU.S., at 265\n, 266. No similar problem exists under the Motor Carrier Act. The relevant sections were in large \n\n[359 \nU.S. 464, 492]\n\u00a0\n measure designed to protect shippers,\n28\n and in fact the shippers are, in many instances, the ultimate parties on whom the burden falls. Both these cases are, of course, such instances. And even when the shippers are not necessarily the ultimate parties, the economics of the industry is such that windfalls to them are unlikely.\n\nSimilarly, other reasons which induced this Court's holding in Montana-Dakota are inapplicable here. In refusing to include in the Power Act provisions authorizing wholesalers to seek reparations before the Federal Power Commission, the Senate Committee which reported the bill said, \"They are appropriate sections for a State utility law, but the committee does not consider them applicable to one governing merely wholesale transactions.\"\n29\n This report, unlike any in the Motor Carrier Act, is easily understood when read in the light of evidence presented to the Committee considering the Power Act. The reparation provisions of that Act were opposed by the National Association of Railroad and Utilities Commissioners, whose General Solicitor told the Committee:\n\n \"That is an entirely proper provision in a railroad statute. When a man goes to the railroad station with a load of goods to ship somewhere he has to ship at the rate that is fixed in the tariff. He must make the shipment then; and he ought to be able to come thereafter to the Commission and show that he was required to pay an unreasonable rate, if it was unreasonable, and to ask for a determination of a reasonable rate and get reparation that is due him for any overpayment. That is perfectly proper. But this bill relates only to service between the wholesale generating \n\n[359 \nU.S. 464, 493]\n\u00a0\n or producing company and the distributing utility. We question whether the public interest will be served by giving any company the right to go ahead receiving service at the established rate for 2 years, and then to bring a complaint before the Federal Commission that the rate has been unreasonable.\"\n30\n\u00a0\n\n\n The testimony was emphasized, as shown above, in the briefs in Montana-Dakota.\n31\n Doubtless this history led the minority as well as the majority in that case to the view that \"Congress did not intend either court or Commission to have the power to award reparations on the ground that a properly filed rate or charge has in fact been unreasonably high or low.\" \n341 \nU.S., at 258\n. Since the history of the Motor Carrier Act points in the opposite direction there is no reason to apply the Montana-Dakota case to the Motor Carrier Act.\n\nMoreover, if motor carrier shippers are deprived of court actions to recover for unreasonable rates, they are placed in a much worse position than wholesale power purchasers. 16 U.S.C. 824d (e) authorizes the Power Commission to suspend rates for five months and, if a hearing on those rates is not concluded by that time, to order the power company to keep an accurate account of the amount and source of all money received. Should the rates be found unreasonable, the Commission can order the excess refunded with interest. The Motor Carrier Act, on the other hand, while authorizing suspension of rates, has no provision for refunds if hearings are not completed when the suspension expires. 216 (g), 49 U.S.C. 316 (g). Had there been such a provision in \n\n[359 \nU.S. 464, 494]\n\u00a0\n the Carrier Act the Government would have been fully protected from the rates charged in the Davidson case, No. 96.\n\nThe Power Act and the Motor Carrier Act are quite different in language, scope, purpose and meaning. The Court in Montana-Dakota carefully limited its holding to the Power Act, e. g., \n341 \nU.S., at 254\n. The arguments advanced in that context for the conclusive effect of power rates once filed are wholly inapplicable to rates under the Motor Carrier Act. In these Motor Carrier cases we have 20 years of Commission interpretation, in part by men who helped write the Act and who administered it from the time it first went into effect, to help us in deciding the question. Congress passed the 1940 revision of the Motor Carrier Act, apparently with full knowledge of the Commission rulings which indicated that shippers could challenge, in the courts, carrier-fixed rates so long as these rates had not been expressly held reasonable by the Commission. Cf. Arizona Grocery Co. v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co., \n284 \nU.S. 370\n. The changes made in 1949, and those not made in 1957, again indicate a reliance on the Commission's interpretation. I believe that interpretation should govern here, and therefore would affirm the judgments of the Courts of Appeals in both these cases.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"The exaction of unreasonable rates by a public carrier was forbidden by the common law. . . . The public policy which underlay this rule could . . . be vindicated . . . in an action brought by him who paid the excessive charge, to recover damages thus sustained.\" \n284 \nU.S., at 383\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 49 Stat. 543, as amended, 49 U.S.C. 301-327. Section 216 (d) of the Act, as amended, 49 U.S.C. 316 (d), reads in part: \"All charges made for any service rendered or to be rendered by any common carrier by motor vehicle engaged in interstate or foreign commerce in the transportation of passengers or property . . . shall be just and reasonable, and every unjust and unreasonable charge for such service or any part thereof, is prohibited and declared to be unlawful.\" See also 216 (b), 49 U.S.C. 316 (b).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Section 216 (j), 49 U.S.C. 316 (j) states \"Nothing in this section shall be held to extinguish any remedy or right of action not inconsistent herewith.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See 24 Stat. 382-384, as amended, 49 U.S.C. 8, 9, 13, 16.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Conversely many instances have been cited of shippers seeking only a determination of the reasonableness of a past practice from the I. C. C. and reserving their rights to obtain damages later in the courts. See generally the discussion of this problem in United States v. Interstate Commerce Comm'n, \n337 \nU.S. 426, 464\n-466 (dissenting opinion). See also United States v. Interstate Commerce Comm'n, \n337 \nU.S. 426\n (opinion of the Court).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] See Hearings, Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce on S. 1310, S. 2016, S. 1869, S. 2009, 76th Cong., 1st Sess. 756-757, 762, 785.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Dixie Mercerizing Co. v. ET & WNC Motor Transp. Co., 21 M. C. C. 491. The Court suggests that this line of cases gave only cursory treatment to the question of whether a court remedy existed. But in Bell Potato Chip Co. v. Aberdeen Truck Line, 43 M. C. C. 337, 341-343, the I. C. C. stated in part:\n\n\"To hold that a motor carrier which has violated any of these prescribed duties is immune to civil liability to one injured thereby while rail and water carriers similarly offending must respond in damages would be not only at variance with the fundamental rule of ubi jus ibi remedium but would also disregard the provisions of sections 216 (j), 217 (b), and 22, which preserve all common-law and statutory remedies. The statute, by declaring unlawful and prohibiting unreasonable and discriminatory rates, has superseded the common-law right but has not abrogated remedies heretofore recognized. See Texas & P. Ry. Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., \n204 \nU.S. 426\n; Mitchell Coal & Coke Co. v. Pennsylvania R. Co., \n230 \nU.S. 247, 258\n. . . .\n\n\n\"How, then, is a shipper who has been injured by the exaction of an unlawful motor-carrier rate to obtain redress against an unwilling carrier?

UNITED STATES(1959)\nNo. 110\nArgued: February 24, 1959Decided: March 23, 1959\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner seeks naturalization under 1 of the Act of June 30, 1953, which provides for the naturalization of aliens who served at least 90 days in the Armed Forces between June 24, 1950, and July 1, 1955, \"(1) having been lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence, or (2) having been lawfully admitted to the United States, and having been physically present within the United States for a single period of at least one year at the time of entering the Armed Forces.\" Having been lawfully in the United States for a short period in 1951 on a seaman's 29-day pass, petitioner entered unlawfully on January 27, 1952, and remained through his induction into the Army on May 4, 1953, in which he served until his honorable discharge on May 3, 1955. Held: He was not entitled to naturalization, because the statute, properly construed, requires that the entry into the United States which leads to the alien's physical presence for the period preceding his induction into the Army be a lawful entry. Pp. 102-107.\n\n 254 F.2d 4, affirmed.\n\nWilliam B. Mahoney argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner.\n\nJohn F. Davis argued the cause for the United States. On the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Anderson, Beatrice Rosenberg and J. F. Bishop.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner, a native and citizen of China, seeks naturalization pursuant to the provisions of an Act of Congress, passed in 1953, designed to facilitate the naturalization of aliens who served in our armed forces during the general \n\n[359 \nU.S. 102, 103]\n\u00a0\n period of the Korean hostilities.\n1\n The statute provides for the naturalization of aliens serving at least 90 days in the armed forces after June 24, 1950, and not later than July 1, 1955:\n\n\"(1) having been lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence, or (2) having been lawfully admitted to the United States, and having been physically present within the United States for a single period of at least one year at the time of entering the Armed Forces . . . .\"\n\n\n Petitioner first entered the United States on August 24, 1951, at Honolulu on a seaman's 29-day pass, and departed from the country with his ship. On January 27, 1952, petitioner again entered the United States at Newport News, where the vessel on which he was employed was then touching. The exact circumstances of this entry are disputed, but it is conceded on all sides that it was unlawful. Petitioner did not depart with his ship, but remained within the United States. He was apprehended in June 1952 and deportation proceedings were commenced against him; but the proceedings were halted when it became known that on May 4, 1953, he had been inducted into the Army. He served honorably until his discharge on May 3, 1955, and on December 22, 1955, instituted the present proceedings based on the statute to which we have referred.\n2\n The District Court granted his petition for naturalization, but the Court of Appeals reversed. 254 F.2d 4. We granted certiorari. \n358 \nU.S. 811\n.\n\nCongress has shown varying degrees of liberality in granting special naturalization rights to aliens serving in our armed forces at various times. For example, the \n\n[359 \nU.S. 102, 104]\n\u00a0\n Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 allows such rights to those having served honorably in World War I or during the period September 1, 1939, to December 31, 1946, if at the time of their induction or enlistment they simply were physically present in the United States or certain named outlying territories.\n3\n On the other hand, that Act's general provision allowing aliens with three years' armed service at any time to be naturalized free of certain residence requirements\n4\n provides no exemption from the requirement that they have been \"lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence.\"\n5\n We must examine the extent to which Congress has made these rights available here, in this statute aimed at service during the Korean hostilities. Petitioner contends that, under clause (2), one year's presence in the United States at the time of induction entitles him to them if at any time theretofore he had been lawfully admitted to the country. He relies on his lawful admittance and brief stay in the country at Honolulu in 1951 as providing this. The Government contends that the lawful admittance must have been the means whereby the alien commenced his year's presence in the country, and that accordingly the lawful Honolulu entry is irrelevant. We are in agreement with the Government's view of the statute.\n\nWhile perhaps a verbal construction of the statute can be made as not implying any connection between the required lawful admittance and the required year's presence, we think the only fair and natural construction of the words is that one is implied. As distinguished from its policy toward World War I and II service, Congress was not prepared to allow special naturalization \n\n[359 \nU.S. 102, 105]\n\u00a0\n rights to aliens serving at the time of Korea simply if they entered the service while physically, for any length of time and lawfully or unlawfully, within the United States. Nor was it prepared to make one year's residence alone the condition; it also imposed the requirement of lawful admittance. It would not be a meaningful requirement to attribute to Congress if it could have been satisfied by a lawful entry, followed by departure, before and unconnected with the commencement of the year's presence. We believe that Congress must have been referring to the last entry before the year's presence - the entry into the country which provided the occasion for that presence. Cf. Bonetti v. Rogers, \n356 \nU.S. 691\n. Under this construction, clause (2) of the statute requires a \"single period\" of residence commencing with a lawful admission and continuing for a year thereafter. It does not demand that the alien's continuing status in the country be lawful, but it does make that requirement of the entry which gives rise to his presence.\n\nSuch legislative history as is relevant to the meaning of the statute bears out this construction. The Act was passed in the First Session of the Eighty-third Congress, and when the bill that became the Act was first brought to the House floor after Committee consideration during that Session,\n6\n the member reporting it stated that it was identical with the law that existed during \"the war\" (presumably World War II)\n7\n with the exception that \n\n[359 \nU.S. 102, 106]\n\u00a0\n it applied only to aliens who were \"legally and lawfully in the United States.\" 99 Cong. Rec. 2639. This must be read in the context of the House Committee Report's statement that \"lawful admission\" was a prerequisite to the bill's benefits, and its explanation that it had rejected a proposal of the Justice Department that would have required the presence of the alien at the time of entrance into the armed services also be lawful. The Committee had felt that the alien should not be saddled with \"the technicalities involved in connection with the continuance of such [lawful] status at the time of entering the Armed Forces.\" H. R. Rep. No. 223, 83d Cong., 1st Sess., p. 4. The House bill required only lawful admission and physical presence at the time of entering the service;\n8\n later the Senate inserted the one year's presence requirement,\n9\n but we do not perceive any change in the distinction we have set forth above. To us, this indicates that Congress desired that the alien's presence in the country be the consequence of a lawful admission, even though the continuance of his stay be beyond the terms on which he was admitted. It is true that the present statute does not in terms state the nexus between admission and the required period of residence as positively as did a 1932 alien veterans' statute which petitioner urges on us for comparison, and which required that the alien have \"resided continuously within the United States \n\n[359 \nU.S. 102, 107]\n\u00a0\n for at least two years, in pursuance of a legal admission for permanent residence.\"\n10\n 1, Act of May 25, 1932, c. 203, 47 Stat. 165. But, as we have explained, Congress did not wish this Act to imply a requirement that the continuance of the alien's presence here be lawful, and such language might have done so. We find the language it in fact used was apt to draw the lines we have indicated above.\n\nOf course, we must be receptive to the purpose implicit in legislation of this sort, to express the gratitude of the country toward aliens who render service in its armed forces in its defense. But that does not warrant our rationalizing to an ambiguity where fairly considered none exists, or extending the generosity of the legislation past the limits to which Congress was willing to go. The service petitioner has rendered this country might inspire legislative relief in his behalf; but here we take the statute as it stands, and under it the judgment of the Court of Appeals was correct.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR.

After this Court had granted certiorari to review a judgment sustaining that action, his security clearance was restored and the Solicitor General assured this Court that petitioner now stands in precisely the same position as all others who have been granted clearance, that the evidence in petitioner's file will not be used against him in the future, and that the findings against petitioner have been expunged. Held: The cause is moot; and the judgment of the District Court is vacated and the cause is remanded to that Court with instructions to dismiss the complaint as moot.

McElroy, ante, p. 474, decided today, and concerns an industrial worker who was denied clearance to classified defense information \n\n[360 \nU.S. 709, 710]\n\u00a0\n and consequently discharged from his employment as a lathe operator and tool and die maker at a plant which manufactured aircraft for the Government.\n\nPrior to 1956, petitioner had a Confidential clearance. In that year, he was denied Secret clearance and his Confidential clearance was suspended. He demanded and was accorded a hearing similar to the one afforded petitioner in Greene v. McElroy, supra. The Hearing Board concluded that petitioner's access to classified defense information was \"not clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\" Later, he was afforded another hearing with similar results. Petitioner then filed an action asking for a declaration that he was entitled to a hearing at which he could confront the informants whose statements were used against him, a declaration that the denial of clearance violated his rights under the Fifth Amendment, and an injunction restraining respondents from enforcing the decision denying clearance. Respondents prevailed on a motion for summary judgment and, on December 15, 1958, we granted certiorari to the Court of Appeals before argument was had in that court because of the pendency here of Greene v. McElroy, supra. \n358 \nU.S. 918\n.\n\nOn December 31, 1958, the Department of Defense notified all interested parties, including petitioner, his counsel, and his ex-employer, that the Secretary of Defense had determined \"that the granting of clearance to Mr. Charles Allen Taylor for access to Secret defense information is in the national interest.\" On January 9, 1959, respondents filed a suggestion of mootness. We postponed consideration of that question to the hearing of the case on the merits. \n359 \nU.S. 901\n.\n\nAt the oral argument in this case, the Solicitor General made the following representations:\n\n1. The Secretary of Defense in determining that petitioner was eligible for clearance to obtain access to \n\n[360 \nU.S. 709, 711]\n\u00a0\n information classified \"Secret\" did not intend by his reference to \"the national interest\" to differentiate between petitioner's status and that of other employees whose eligibility for clearance has been found to be \"clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\"\n*\n\u00a0\n\n2. The findings of the various Hearing Boards which passed on petitioner's fitness for clearance have been expunged from all records and no longer have any vitality or effect.\n\n3. Petitioner was afforded clearance on December 31, 1958, after having been denied clearance for over two years, because of a change in applicable Department of Defense regulations.\n\n4. Pursuant to existing Department of Defense procedures, the evidence in petitioner's file will not be used again as a basis for revoking petitioner's clearance.\n\n5. Petitioner is eligible under applicable regulations for compensation for wages lost during the time he was unemployed due to the clearance revocation and denial.\n\nIn view of the fact that petitioner has received clearance, the ultimate relief which he demanded, and in view of the representations of the Solicitor General to the effect that petitioner stands in precisely the same position as all others who have been granted clearance, that the evidence in petitioner's file will not be used against him in the future, and that the findings against petitioner have been expunged, this case is moot.\n\nThe judgment of the District Court is vacated and the case is remanded to that court with instructions to dismiss the complaint as moot.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] The respondents have filed a letter in this Court from the General Counsel of the Department of Defense which makes an identical representation. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 709, 712]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","183":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTEAMSTERS UNION v. OLIVER(1959)\nNo. 49\nArgued: Decided: January 19, 1959\n\n\n\n\n A collective bargaining agreement between a group of local labor unions and a group of interstate motor carriers prescribed a wage scale for truck drivers and, in order to prevent evasion thereof, provided that drivers who own and drive their own vehicles should be paid, in addition to the prescribed wage, not less than a prescribed minimum rental for the use of their vehicles. A suit was brought in a state court to enjoin certain carriers and a local union from carrying out the minimum rental provision on the ground that it violated a state antitrust law. Held: Since that provision was part of an agreement resulting from the exercise of collective bargaining rights under the National Labor Relations Act, the state court was precluded from applying the state antitrust law to prohibit the parties from carrying out its terms. Pp. 284-297.\n\n (1) In the light of its history and its purpose to protect the negotiated wage scale against evasion through payment to owner-drivers of rentals insufficient to cover their operating costs, the minimum rental provision was within the scope of collective bargaining required of the parties under 7 and 8 of the National Labor Relations Act. Pp. 292-295.\n\n\n (2) The state antitrust law may not be applied to prevent the contracting parties from carrying out their agreement upon a subject matter as to which federal law directs them to bargain.

Transportation Co., Inc., et al., respondents. With him on the brief was E. W. Brouse.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nAs the result of multiemployer, multistate collective bargaining with the Central States Drivers Council, comprising local unions of truck drivers affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers, a collective bargaining agreement, the \"Central States Area Over-the-Road Motor Freight Agreement,\" effective February 1, 1955, and expiring January 31, 1961, was entered into by the locals and motor carriers in interstate commerce who operate under the authority of the Interstate Commerce Commission\n1\n in 12 midwestern States, including Ohio.\n2\n Article XXXII of this collective bargaining agreement\n3\n prescribes terms and conditions which regulate the minimum rental and certain other terms of lease when a \n\n[358 \nU.S. 283, 285]\n\u00a0\n motor vehicle is leased to a carrier by an owner who drives his vehicle in the carrier's service.\n4\n The Ohio courts enjoined the petitioner, Ohio's Teamsters Local 24 and its president, and the respondent carriers, A. C. E. Transportation Company, Inc., and Interstate Truck Service, Inc., Ohio employers, from giving effect to the provisions of Article XXXII. The Ohio courts held that the Article violates the Ohio antitrust law, known as the Valentine Act.\n5\n The question is whether the fact that the Article \n\n[358 \nU.S. 283, 286]\n\u00a0\n was contained in an agreement which was the fruit of the exercise of collective bargaining rights under the National Labor Relations Act\n6\n precluded the Ohio courts from applying the Ohio antitrust law to prohibit the parties from carrying out the terms of the Article they had agreed upon in bargaining. No claim is made that Article XXXII violates any provision of federal law.\n\nThe Article is in express terms made applicable only to a lessor-driver when he himself drives his vehicle in the \n\n[358 \nU.S. 283, 287]\n\u00a0\n business of the lessee-carrier. 1. The Article, at least in words, constitutes the lessor-driver an employee of the carrier at such times: \"The employer [the carrier] expressly reserves the right to control the manner, means and details of, and by which, the owner-operator performs his services, as well as the ends to be accomplished.\" 4. His wages, hours and working conditions are then to be those applied to the carrier's drivers of carrier-owned vehicles, and he has \"seniority as a driver only.\" 2. He must operate his vehicle at such times \"exclusively in . . . [the carrier's] service and for no other interests.\" 1. The carrier \"agrees to pay . . . social security tax, compensation insurance, public liability and property damage insurance, bridge tolls\" and various other fees imposed on motor freight transportation, except \"that the owner-driver shall pay license fees in the state in which title is registered.\" 10. The lessor-driver must be compensated by \"separate checks . . . for driver's wages and equipment rental.\" 6. The wage payment must be in the amount of \"the full wage rate and supplementary allowances\" payable to carrier drivers similarly circumstanced who drive carrier-owned vehicles. 12 (a). The equipment rental payment must be in an amount not less than \"the minimum rates\" specified by the Article which \"result from the joint determination of the parties that such rates represent only the actual cost of operating such [leased] equipment. The parties have not attempted to negotiate a profit for the owner-driver.\" 12 (b). All leases by union members who drive their vehicles for carriers in effect on the operative date of the collective bargaining agreement are to \"be dissolved or modified within thirty (30) days\" to conform to the terms and conditions of the Article. 15. The parties declare that \"the intent of this clause [the Article] . . . is to assure the payment of the Union scale of wages . . . and to prohibit [a carrier from] the making \n\n[358 \nU.S. 283, 288]\n\u00a0\n and carrying out of any plan, scheme or device to circumvent or defeat the payment of wage scales provided in this Agreement. . . [and] to prevent the continuation of or formation of combinations or corporations or so-called lease of fleet arrangements whereby the driver [of his own vehicle] is required to and does periodically pay losses sustained by the corporation or fleet arrangement, or is required to accept less than the actual cost of the running of his equipment, thus, in fact, reducing his scale of pay.\" 16.\n\nThe respondent, Revel Oliver, a member of the union, is the owner of motor equipment\n7\n which, at the time the collective bargaining agreement was negotiated, was subject to written lease agreements with the carrier respondents, A. C. E. Transportation Company, Inc., and Interstate Truck Service, Inc. The terms and conditions of the leases, particularly in regard to rental compensation, differ substantially from those provided in Article XXXII.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nOliver brought this action on January 20, 1955, in the Court of Common Pleas, Summit County, Ohio, for an injunction restraining the petitioners and the respondent carriers from carrying out the terms of Article XXXII. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 283, 289]\n\u00a0\n He obtained a temporary restraining order upon sworn allegations. At the trial the respondent carriers joined with Oliver in making the attack on the Article. The petitioners defended on the ground that the State could not lawfully exercise power to apply its antitrust law to cause a forfeiture of the product of the exercise of federally sanctioned collective bargaining rights. The union justified the Article as necessary to prevent undermining of the negotiated drivers' wage scale said to result from a practice of carriers of leasing a vehicle from an owner-driver at a rental which returned to the owner-driver less than his actual costs of operation, so that the driver's wage received by him, although nominally the negotiated wage, was actually a wage reduced by the excess of his operating expenses over the rental he received. The Court of Common Pleas held in an unreported opinion that the National Labor Relations Act could not \"be reasonably construed to permit this remote and indirect approach to the subject of wages,\" and that Article XXXII was in violation of the State's antitrust law because \"there are restrictions and restraints imposed upon articles [the leased vehicles] that are widely used in trade and commerce. . . . [and] preclude an owner of property from reasonable freedom of action in dealing with it.\" On the petitioners' appeal to Ohio's Ninth Judicial District Court of Appeals that court heard the case de novo and affirmed the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, adopting its opinion. The Court of Appeals entered a permanent injunction perpetually restraining the petitioners and the respondent carriers (1) \"from entering into any agreements . . . or carrying out the . . . requirements . . . of any such agreement, which will require the alteration\" of Revel Oliver's \"existing lease or leasing agreement\"; (2) \"from entering into any . . . agreement or stipulation in the future, or \n\n[358 \nU.S. 283, 290]\n\u00a0\n the negotiation therefor, the . . . tendency of which is to . . . determine in any manner the rate to be charged for the use of\" Revel Oliver's equipment; (3) \"from giving force and effect to Section 32 [sic] of the Contract . . . or any modification . . . thereof, the . . . tendency of which shall attempt to fix the rates\" for the use of Revel Oliver's equipment.\n9\n Petitioners' appeal \n\n[358 \nU.S. 283, 291]\n\u00a0\n to the Ohio Supreme Court was dismissed for want of a debatable constitutional question. 167 Ohio St. 299, 147 N. E. 2d 856. We granted certiorari to consider the important question raised of the interaction of state and federal power arising from the petitioners' claim that the Ohio regulation abridges rights protected by federal statute. \n356 \nU.S. 966\n.\n\nArticle XXXII did not originate with the 1955 agreement. The carriers and the union have disputed since 1938 the terms of a carrier's hire of a lessor's driving services with his leased vehicle. The usual lease is by the owner of a single vehicle who hires out his services as driver with his vehicle. A carrier's representative who has participated in all contract negotiations since those leading to the 1938 agreement testified to the history. According to him, the nub of the union's position over the two decades has been that the carriers abuse the leasing practice, particularly by paying inadequate rentals for the use of leased vehicles, with the result \"that part of the men's wages for driving was being used for the upkeep of their vehicles . . . . They [the union] claimed that the leased people were breaking down the rate structure . . . .\" The union's demands for contract provisions to safeguard against the alleged abuse were designed also to \"secure a living wage [for the lessor] plus an adequate rental for his equipment.\" A minimum rental clause first appeared in the 1938 agreement which also contained provisions comparable to 8, 10 and 14 of present Article XXXII. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 283, 292]\n\u00a0\n In 1939, after the union claimed that \"there was a lot of people that was transferring their title into other people's name to avoid the conditions of the contract,\" 3 was added to provide that \"certificate and title to the equipment must be in the name of the actual owner.\" When the dispute brought the parties to the verge of a strike in 1941, the note to 1 and 13, 15, 16, 17 and 18 came into the agreement. But by 1946 the controversy reached a pitch where the union demanded agreement from the carriers to abolish the leasing practice: \"The unions were going to refuse the addition of any individual owners, and the unions also desired to make certain restrictions on the use of owner-operators, again claiming that the . . . company operators were taking advantage of certain provisions of the contract.\" This demand was compromised by the addition of 19 restricting leasing to carriers \"who will agree to submit all grievances pertaining to owner-operators to joint Employer-Union grievance committees in each respective state\"; the section \"represented the compromise between the union position that it should abolish all owner-operators and the companies' contention there should be no limitation.\"\n\nFirst. The Ohio courts rejected the petitioners' contention that the evidence conclusively established that Article XXXII dealt with subject matter within the scope of \"collective bargaining\" in which federal law gave petitioners the right to engage. The state courts rested their judgments principally on the minimum rental regulations of 12 of the Article. The principal discussion occurs in the opinion of the Court of Common Pleas. These regulations were held to constitute the Article a price-fixing arrangement violating the Ohio antitrust law in that they evidenced \"concerted action of the Union combining with a non-labor third party in a formal contract. . . . [the] effect [of which] is to oppress and \n\n[358 \nU.S. 283, 293]\n\u00a0\n destroy competition. . . . [and] preclude an owner of property from reasonable freedom of action in dealing with it.\"\n\nIt seems to us that in considering whether the Article deals with a subject matter within the scope of collective bargaining as defined by federal law the Ohio courts did not give proper significance to the Article's narrowly restricted application to the times when the owner drives his leased vehicle for the carrier, and to the adverse effects upon the negotiated wage scale which might result when the rental for the use of the leased vehicle was unregulated at these times. Since no claim was presented to the Ohio courts that the petitioners sought to apply these regulations to Revel Oliver's arrangements with the respondent carriers except on the very infrequent and irregular occasions when Oliver drove one of his vehicles for a carrier, we take it that the Ohio courts' opinions and judgments relate only to the validity of the Article as applied at such times. This would necessarily be the case as the text of the Article, and that text as illumined by its history, conclusively establish that the regulations in no wise apply to the terms of lease of a vehicle when driven by a driver not the owner of the vehicle; the wages, hours and working conditions to be observed by contracting employers of non-owner drivers are governed by the general provisions in that regard found in other articles of the collective bargaining agreement.\n\nIn the light of the Article's history and purpose, we cannot agree with the Court of Common Pleas that its regulations constitute a \"remote and indirect approach to the subject of wages,\" outside the range of matters on which the federal law requires the parties to bargain. The text of the Article and its unchallenged history show that its objective is to protect the negotiated wage scale against the possible undermining through diminution of \n\n[358 \nU.S. 283, 294]\n\u00a0\n the owner's wages for driving which might result from a rental which did not cover his operating costs. This is thus but an instance, as this Court said of a somewhat similar union demand in another case, in which a union seeks to protect lawful employee interests against what is believed, rightly or wrongly, to be \"a scheme or device utilized for the purpose of escaping the payment of union wages and the assumption of working conditions commensurate with those imposed under union standards.\" Milk Wagon Drivers' Union v. Lake Valley Farm Products, Inc., \n311 \nU.S. 91, 98\n-99. Looked at in this light, as on the evidence it must be, to determine its relevance to the collective bargaining rights under the Federal Act, the point of the Article is obviously not price fixing but wages. The regulations embody not the \"remote and indirect approach to the subject of wages\" perceived by the Court of Common Pleas but a direct frontal attack upon a problem thought to threaten the maintenance of the basic wage structure established by the collective bargaining contract. The inadequacy of a rental which means that the owner makes up his excess costs from his driver's wages not only clearly bears a close relation to labor's efforts to improve working conditions but is in fact of vital concern to the carrier's employed drivers; an inadequate rental might mean the progressive curtailment of jobs through withdrawal of more and more carrier-owned vehicles from service. Cf. Bakery Drivers Local v. Wohl, \n315 \nU.S. 769, 771\n. It is not necessary to attempt to set precise outside limits to the subject matter properly included within the scope of mandatory collective bargaining, cf. Labor Board v. Borg-Warner Corp., \n356 \nU.S. 342\n, to hold, as we do, that the obligation under 8 (d) on the carriers and their employees to bargain collectively \"with respect to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment\" and to embody their understanding in \"a \n\n[358 \nU.S. 283, 295]\n\u00a0\n written contract incorporating any agreement reached,\" found an expression in the subject matter of Article XXXII. See Timken Roller Bearing Co., 70 N. L. R. B. 500, 518, reversed on other grounds, 161 F.2d 949. And certainly bargaining on this subject through their representatives was a right of the employees protected by 7 of the Act.\n\nSecond. We must decide whether Ohio's antitrust law may be applied to prevent the contracting parties from carrying out their agreement upon a subject matter as to which federal law directs them to bargain. Little extended discussion is necessary to show that Ohio law cannot be so applied. We need not concern ourselves today with a contractual provision dealing with a subject matter that the parties were under no obligation to discuss; the carriers as employers were under a duty to bargain collectively with the union as to the subject matter of the Article, as we have shown. The goal of federal labor policy, as expressed in the Wagner and Taft-Hartley Acts, is the promotion of collective bargaining; to encourage the employer and the representative of the employees to establish, through collective negotiation, their own charter for the ordering of industrial relations, and thereby to minimize industrial strife. See Labor Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., \n301 \nU.S. 1, 45\n; Labor Board v. American National Ins. Co., \n343 \nU.S. 395, 401\n-402. Within the area in which collective bargaining was required, Congress was not concerned with the substantive terms upon which the parties agreed. Cf. Terminal Railroad Assn. v. Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, \n318 \nU.S. 1, 6\n. The purposes of the Acts are served by bringing the parties together and establishing conditions under which they are to work out their agreement themselves. To allow the application of the Ohio antitrust law here would wholly defeat the full realization of the congressional \n\n[358 \nU.S. 283, 296]\n\u00a0\n purpose. The application would frustrate the parties' solution of a problem which Congress has required them to negotiate in good faith toward solving, and in the solution of which it imposed no limitations relevant here. Federal law here created the duty upon the parties to bargain collectively; Congress has provided for a system of federal law applicable to the agreement the parties made in response to that duty, Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills, \n353 \nU.S. 448\n; and federal law sets some outside limits (not contended to be exceeded here) on what their agreement may provide, see Allen Bradley Co. v. Local Union, \n325 \nU.S. 797\n; cf. United States v. Employing Plasterers Assn., \n347 \nU.S. 186, 190\n. We believe that there is no room in this scheme for the application here of this state policy limiting the solutions that the parties' agreement can provide to the problems of wages and working conditions. Cf. California v. Taylor, \n353 \nU.S. 553, 566\n-567. Since the federal law operates here, in an area where its authority is paramount, to leave the parties free, the inconsistent application of state law is necessarily outside the power of the State. Hill v. Florida, \n325 \nU.S. 538, 542\n-544. Cf. International Union v. O'Brien, \n339 \nU.S. 454, 457\n; Amalgamated Assn. v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Board, \n340 \nU.S. 383\n; Plankinton Packing Co. v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Board, \n338 \nU.S. 953\n. The solution worked out by the parties was not one of a sort which Congress has indicated may be left to prohibition by the several States. Cf. Algoma Plywood & Veneer Co. v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Board, \n336 \nU.S. 301, 307\n-312.\n10\n Of course; the paramount force of the federal \n\n[358 \nU.S. 283, 297]\n\u00a0\n law remains even though it is expressed in the details of a contract federal law empowers the parties to make, rather than in terms in an enactment of Congress. See Railway Employes' Dept. v. Hanson, \n351 \nU.S. 225, 232\n. Clearly it is immaterial that the conflict is between federal labor law and the application of what the State characterizes as an antitrust law. \". . . Congress has sufficiently expressed its purpose to . . . exclude state prohibition, even though that with which the federal law is concerned as a matter of labor relations be related by the State to the more inclusive area of restraint of trade.\" Weber v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., \n348 \nU.S. 468, 481\n. We have not here a case of a collective bargaining agreement in conflict with a local health or safety regulation; the conflict here is between the federally sanctioned agreement and state policy which seeks specifically to adjust relationships in the world of commerce. If there is to be this sort of limitation on the arrangements that unions and employers may make with regard to these subjects, pursuant to the collective bargaining provisions of the Wagner and Taft-Hartley Acts, it is for Congress, not the States, to provide it.\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\n THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER and MR. JUSTICE STEWART took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER, believing that respondent Oliver, while driving his own tractor in the performance of his independent contract with the respondent carriers, \n\n[358 \nU.S. 283, 298]\n\u00a0\n was not an employee of those carriers, but was an independent contractor, United States v. Silk, \n331 \nU.S. 704\n, and that, as such, he was expressly excluded from the coverage of the National Labor Relations Act by 61 Stat. 137, 29 U.S.C. 152 (3), would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Judicial District of Ohio.\n\n   APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT.\n\n\n Article XXXII of the Central States Area Over-the-Road  Motor Freight Agreement.\n\n    Owner-Operators.\n\n\n Section 1. Owner-operators (See Note), other than certificated or permitted carriers, shall not be covered by this Agreement unless affiliated by lease with a certificated or permitted carrier which is required to operate in full compliance with all the provisions of this Agreement and holding proper ICC and state certificates and permits. Such owner-operators shall operate exclusively in such service and for no other interests.\n\n(NOTE: Whenever \"owner-operator\" is used in this article, it means owner-driver only, and nothing in this article shall apply to any equipment leased except where owner is also employed as a driver.)\n\nSection 2. This type of operator's compensation for wages and working conditions shall be in full accordance with all the provisions of this Agreement. The owner-operator shall have seniority as a driver only.\n\nSection 3. Certificate and title to the equipment must be in the name of the actual owner.\n\nSection 4. In all cases, hired or leased equipment shall be operated by an employee of the certificated or permitted carrier. The employer expressly reserves the right \n\n[358 \nU.S. 283, 299]\n\u00a0\n to control the manner, means and details of, and by which, the owner-operator performs his services, as well as the ends to be accomplished.\n\nSection 5. Certificated or permitted carriers shall use their own available equipment, together with all leased equipment under minimum thirty-day bona fide lease arrangements, on a rotating board, before hiring any extra equipment.\n\nSection 6. Separate checks shall be issued by the certificated or permitted carriers for driver's wages and equipment rental. At no time shall the equipment check be for less than actual miles operated. Separate checks for drivers shall not be deducted from the minimum truck rental revenue. The driver shall turn in time direct to the certificated or permitted carrier. All monies due the owner-operator may be held no longer than two weeks, except where the lease of equipment agreement is terminated and in such cases all monies due the operator may be held no longer than thirty (30) days from the date of the termination of the operation of the equipment.\n\nSection 7. Payment for equipment service shall be handled by the issuance of a check for the full mileage operated, tonnage or percentage, less any agreed advances. A statement of any charges by the certificated or permitted carrier shall be issued at the same time, but shall not be deducted in advance.\n\nSection 8. The owner-operator shall have complete freedom to purchase gasoline, oil, grease, tires, tubes, etc., including repair work, at any place where efficient service and satisfactory products can be obtained at the most favorable prices.\n\nSection 9. There shall be no deduction pertaining to equipment operation for any reason whatsoever.\n\nSection 10. The Employer or certificated or permitted carrier hereby agrees to pay road or mile tax, social security \n\n[358 \nU.S. 283, 300]\n\u00a0\n tax, compensation insurance, public liability and property damage insurance, bridge tolls, fees for certificates, permits and travel orders, fines and penalties for inadequate certificates, license fees, weight tax and wheel tax, and for loss of driving time due to waiting at state lines, and also cargo insurance. It is expressly understood that the owner-driver shall pay the license fees in the state in which title is registered.\n\nAll tolls, no matter how computed, must be paid by the Employer regardless of any agreement to the contrary.\n\nAll taxes or additional charges imposed by law relating to actual truck operation and use of highways, no matter how computed or named, shall be paid by the Carrier, excepting only vehicle licensing as such, in the state where title is registered.\n\nSection 11. There shall be no interest or handling charge on earned money advanced prior to the regular pay day.\n\nSection 12. (a) All certificated or permitted carriers hiring or leasing equipment owned and driven by the owner-driver shall file a true copy of the lease agreement covering the owner-driven equipment with the Joint State Committees. The terms of the lease shall cover only the equipment owned and driven by the owner-driver and shall be in complete accord with the minimum rates and conditions provided herein, plus the full wage rate and supplementary allowances for drivers as embodied elsewhere in this Agreement.\n\n(b) The minimum rate for leased equipment owned and driven by the owner-driver shall be:\n\n       Per Mile\n\n\n Single axle, tractor only ................ 9 1\/2\n\nTandem axle, tractor only ................  10\n\nSingle axle, trailer only ................ 3\n\nTandem axle, trailer only ................ 4 \n\n[358 \nU.S. 283, 301]\n\u00a0\n\n\n 75% of the above rates to apply for deadheading, if and when ordered, provided, however, that the 75% rate will apply only on first empty dispatch away from the home terminal; thereafter the full equipment rental rate to apply until driver is redispatched from home terminal; the above rates to be based on 23,000-pound load limit. On load limits over 23,000 pounds, there shall be one-half (1\/2) cent additional per mile for each 1,000 pounds or fraction thereof in excess of 23,000 pounds. There shall be a minimum guarantee of 24,000 pounds for leased equipment owned and driven by the owner-driver. Nothing herein shall apply to leased equipment not owned by a driver.\n\nThe minimum rates set forth above result from the joint determination of the parties that such rates represent only the actual cost of operating such equipment. The parties have not attempted to negotiate a profit for the owner-driver.\n\nSection 13. Driver-owner mileage scale does not include use of equipment for pickup or delivery at point of origin terminal or at point of destination terminal, but shall be subject to negotiations between the Local Union and Company. Failure to agree shall be submitted to the grievance procedure.\n\nSection 14. There shall be no reductions where the present basis of payment is higher than the minimums established herein for this type of operation. Where owner-operator is paid on a percentage or tonnage basis and the operating company reduces its tariff, the percentage or tonnage basis of payment shall be automatically adjusted so that the owner-operator suffers no reduction in equipment rental or wages, or both.\n\nSection 15. It is further understood and agreed that any arrangements which have heretofore been entered into between members of this Union, either among themselves or with the Employer or with the aid of the Employer, \n\n[358 \nU.S. 283, 302]\n\u00a0\n applicable to owner-driver equipment contrary to the terms hereof, shall be dissolved or modified within thirty (30) days after the signing of this Agreement so that such arrangements shall apply only to equipment of the owner-driver while being driven by such owner-driver. In the event that the parties cannot agree on a method of dissolution or modification of such arrangement to make the same conform to this Agreement, the question of dissolution or modification shall be submitted to arbitration, each party to select one member of the arbitration board, and the two so selected to choose a third member of said board. If the two cannot agree upon the third within five (5) days, he shall be appointed by the Joint State Committee. The decision of said board to be final and binding.\n\nSection 16. It is further agreed that the intent of this clause and this entire Agreement is to assure the payment of the Union scale of wages as provided in this Agreement and to prohibit the making and carrying out of any plan, scheme or device to circumvent or defeat the payment of wage scales provided in this Agreement. This clause is intended to prevent the continuation of or formation of combinations or corporations or so-called lease of fleet arrangements whereby the driver is required to and does periodically pay losses sustained by the corporation or fleet arrangement, or is required to accept less than the actual cost of the running of his equipment, thus, in fact, reducing his scale of pay.\n\nSection 17. It is further agreed that if the Employer or certificated or permitted carrier requires that the \"driver-owner-operator\" sell his equipment to the Employer or certificated or permitted carrier, directly or indirectly, the \"driver-owner-operator\" shall be paid the fair true value of such equipment. Copies of the instruments of sale shall be filed with the Union and unless objected to within ten (10) days shall be deemed satisfactory. If any \n\n[358 \nU.S. 283, 303]\n\u00a0\n question is raised by the Union as to such value, the same shall be submitted to arbitration, as above set forth, for determination. The decision of the arbitration board shall be final and binding.\n\nSection 18. It is further agreed that the Employer or certificated or permitted carrier will not devise or put into operation any scheme, whether herein enumerated or not, to defeat the terms of this Agreement, wherein the provisions as to compensation for services on and for use of equipment owned by owner-driver shall be lessened, nor shall any owner-driver lease be cancelled for the purpose of depriving Union employees of employment, and any such complaint that should arise pertaining to such cancellation of lease or violation under this section shall be subject to ARTICLE X.\n\nSection 19. (a) The use of individual owner-operators shall be permitted by all certificated or permitted carriers who will agree to submit all grievances pertaining to owner-operators to joint Employer-Union grievance committees in each respective state. It is understood and agreed that all such grievances will be promptly heard and decided with the specific purpose in mind of\n\n(1) protecting provisions of the Union contract;\n\n(2) prohibiting any and all violations directly or indirectly of contract provisions relating to the proper use of individual owners;\n\n(3) prohibiting any attempts by any certificated or permitted carrier in changing his operation which will affect the rights of drivers under the terms of the contract, and generally the certificated or permitted carriers agree to assume responsibility in policing and doing everything within their power to eliminate all alleged abuses in the use of owner-drivers which resulted in the insertion of Section 19 (Article XXXIII) in the original 1945-47 Over-the-Road contract; \n\n[358 \nU.S. 283, 304]\n\u00a0\n\n\n(4) owner-driver operations to be terminal to terminal, except where no local employees to make such deliveries or otherwise agreed to in this contract;\n\n(5) the certificated or permitted carriers agree that they will, with a joint meeting of the Unions, set up uniform rules and practices under which all such cases will be heard;\n\n(6) it shall be considered a violation of the contract should any operator deduct from rental of equipment the increases provided for by the 1955 Amendments or put into effect any means of evasion to circumvent actual payment of increases agreed upon effective for the period starting February 1, 1955, and ending January 31, 1961.\n\n(b) No owner-operator shall be permitted to drive or hold seniority where he owns three or more pieces of leased equipment. This provision shall not apply to present owner-operators having three or more pieces of equipment under lease agreement, but such owner-operator shall not be permitted to put additional equipment in service so long as he engages in work covered by this Agreement or holds seniority. Where owner-operator drives, he can hold seniority where he works sixty (60) per cent or more of time.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Certificates of convenience and necessity are issued to common carriers pursuant to 206-208 of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 Stat. 551, 552, as amended, 49 U.S.C. 306-308; permits are issued to contract carriers pursuant to 209, 49 Stat. 552, as amended, 49 U.S.C. 309.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The agreement covers between 3,000 and 3,500 employers and between 45,000 and 50,000 truck drivers. Those covered in Ohio consist of approximately 500 employers and 6,000 drivers. Upwards of 90% of the Ohio drivers drive equipment owned by carriers who operate under I. C. C. certificates or permits. The rest of the covered drivers own their own equipment, usually one vehicle, but since they are not holders of I. C. C. certificates or permits, they lease their equipment to, and drive it for, certificated or permitted carriers.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] For the text of Article XXXII, see Appendix, post. p. 298.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] For details of I.

The libel was in rem against the ship, then in the port of Houston on another voyage, and in personam against its owner, an Italian corporation. After requiring a bond to secure whatever judgment might finally be rendered, the District Court declined jurisdiction on the ground that the parties had agreed by a provision in the bill of lading that controversies regarding cargo damage should be settled only in the courts of Genoa, Italy. The Court of Appeals reversed, finding the provision in the bill of lading inapplicable to libels in rem and declining to enforce its terms as to the libel in personam. Held:\n\n 1. The bill of lading provision cannot be construed to include libels in rem and accordingly the libel in rem was properly maintainable. Pp. 182-183.\n\n\n 2.

JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe respondent, Carbon Black Export, Inc., a Delaware corporation, brought a libel in admiralty in the District Court for the Southern District of Texas for damage sustained to a shipment of carbon black during an ocean voyage from Houston and New Orleans to various Italian ports. The libel was one in rem against the vessel in question, the S. S. Monrosa, then in the port of Houston on another voyage, and in personam against the Monrosa's owner, Navigazione Alta Italia, an Italian corporation. The latter filed an appearance in response to the libel in personam, and, as owner of the vessel, filed a claim to it, and prayed to defend the libel in rem. In respect to the libel in rem, a stipulation to abide the decree, in the penal sum of $100,000, was filed by the claimant and the National Surety Company, its surety, and approved by the present respondent. Navigazione Alta Italia then moved that the District Court decline jurisdiction over the cause, on the grounds that the parties had agreed, by a provision in the bills of lading covering the shipment, that controversies in regard to cargo damage should be settled only in the courts of Genoa, Italy. The District Court granted the motion, subject to the filing of a bond by Navigazione Alta Italia in the sum of $100,000 to respond to whatever judgment might finally be rendered on the cause of action in question. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed. It found the provision in the bill of lading in terms inapplicable to suits in rem, and it declined to enforce its terms to require a dismissal of the libel in personam. 254 F.2d 297. We granted certiorari, \n358 \nU.S. 809\n, because of an indicated conflict in principle between the Fifth Circuit's views as to enforceability of such provisions and those taken by the Second Circuit, primarily in William H. Muller & Co. v. Swedish American Line Ltd., 224 F.2d 806. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 180, 182]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe do not believe that this case affords us an appropriate instance to pass upon the extent to which effect can be given to such stipulations in ocean bills of lading not to resort to the courts of this country. The provision in this case was one of many printed provisions in a form bill of lading prepared by the carrier and presented by it for use in shipments on its vessel. It reads:\n\n \"27. - ALSO, that no legal proceedings may be brought against the Captain or Shipowners or their Agents in respect to any loss of or damage to any goods herein specified except in Genoa, it being understood and agreed that every other Tribunal in the place or places where the goods were shipped or landed is incompetent, not withstanding that the ship may be legally represented there.\"\n\n\n We find ourselves in agreement with the views of the Court of Appeals below that this clause should not be read as limiting the maintenance of an action in rem, cf. The Maggie Hammond, 9 Wall. 435, 449-450, against the vessel to enforce a maritime lien for proper carriage. The initial words are particularly appropriate to a restriction of the clause to in personam actions, and the rest of the language is intelligible on this premise.\n*\n In accordance \n\n[359 \nU.S. 180, 183]\n\u00a0\n with the familiar rule in such circumstances, we will not stretch the language when the party drafting such a form contract has not included a provision it easily might have. The Caledonia, \n157 \nU.S. 124, 137\n; The Majestic, \n166 \nU.S. 375, 386\n; Compania de Navigacion La Flecha v. Brauer, \n168 \nU.S. 104, 118\n. Considerations involved in construing exemptions from carriers' liability provided by Acts of Congress are, we think, quite different. See Consumers Import Co. v. Kabushiki Kaisha Kawasaki Zosenjo, \n320 \nU.S. 249\n. It is a form contract, not a statute, that we construe here.\n\nAccordingly, after oral argument, we have concluded that the Court of Appeals was correct in holding that the libel in rem was properly maintainable. Both parties approved a secured stipulation to release the vessel from seizure under the libel, in an amount substantially the same as the recovery demanded by the libellant. This same amount the District Court denominated as proper security against a recovery elsewhere. We need not conjure up doubts in this regard that the parties never expressed. While the parties were entitled to have the judgments of the courts below as to whether the libel in personam was also maintainable, we do not believe it a proper exercise of our discretionary jurisdiction to pass on that aspect of the case, which alone presents the question which led us to grant certiorari. It appears that in any event the respondent will be able to try its claim in the District Court.\n\nIn the light of these circumstances, which \"were not . . . fully apprehended at the time certiorari was granted,\" Ferguson v. Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., \n352 \nU.S. 521, 559\n (separate opinion), the writ of certiorari will be dismissed as improvidently granted. Rice v. Sioux City Memorial Park Cemetery, Inc., \n349 \nU.S. 70, 75\n; Goins v. United States, \n306 \nU.S. 622\n; Moor v. Texas & New Orleans R. Co., \n297 \nU.S. 101\n; Southern Power Co. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 180, 184]\n\u00a0\n v. North Carolina Public Service Co., \n263 \nU.S. 508\n. Cf. Hammerstein v.

District of Columbia, \n243 \nU.S. 1\n. Examination of a case on the merits, on oral argument, may bring into \"proper focus\" a consideration which, though present in the record at the time of granting the writ, only later indicates that the grant was improvident. See Rice v. Sioux City Memorial Park Cemetery, Inc., supra, at 73. While this Court decides questions of public importance, it decides them in the context of meaningful litigation. Its function in resolving conflicts among the Courts of Appeals is judicial, not simply administrative or managerial. Resolution here of the extent to which these bill of lading provisions may be given effect by our courts can await a day when the issue is posed less abstractly.\n\n   Writ of certiorari dismissed.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] We note that in another place the bill of lading makes specific recognition of suits both in rem and in personam. Clause 35 provides:\n\n\"35 - In any event the Carrier and the ship shall be discharged from all liability in respect of loss or damage unless suit is brought within one year after the delivery of the goods or the date when the goods should have been delivered. Suit shall not be deemed brought until jurisdiction shall have been obtained over the Carrier and\/or the ship by service of process or by an agreement to appear.\"\n\n\n While the first sentence is verbatim from 3 (6) of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 49 Stat. 1209, 46 U.S.C. 1303 (6), the language nevertheless reinforces the fact that if both categories of suit were to be included under Clause 27, apt words to accomplish this were readily available, and were in fact used in another clause of the bill.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER, and MR. JUSTICE STEWART join, dissenting.\n\nI cannot agree with the Court's view that Clause 27 of the bill of lading, fixing Genoa, Italy, as the forum for legal proceedings in respect of loss or damage to the goods shipped, applies only to actions in personam, and not to actions in rem. The Court's reading of the clause imputes to the parties the drawing of a distinction the purpose of which is impossible to grasp. As this Court said in Consumers Import Co. v. Kabushiki Kaisha Kawasaki Zosenjo, \n320 \nU.S. 249, 253\n, in referring to an earlier case, \"The Court said that `To say that an owner is not liable. but that his vessel is liable, seems to us like talking in riddles.' The riddle after more than half a century \n\n[359 \nU.S. 180, 185]\n\u00a0\n repeated to us in different context does not appear to us to have improved with age.\"\n\nApart from this, however, I see no justification for our not reaching the question of the validity of Clause 27 with respect to in personam actions, an issue which still remains in the case even on the Court's view that the clause does not embrace in rem proceedings. That question, of course, presents no constitutional issue which we should strive to avoid, but is only one of ordinary commercial admiralty law. It is the only question which led us to take this case for review. And the issue has been fully briefed and argued by the parties. To be sure, it is possible that this question is not of great importance to the litigants if the in rem action can in any case go forward in Texas. But the very fact that respondent chose to institute and continue actions both in personam and in rem shows that it was not content to rely solely on the vessel's surety, and cautions against our now gratuitously treating the in personam action as purely academic. Moreover, review by certiorari, as Chief Justice Hughes once put it, is \"in the interest of the law, its appropriate exposition and enforcement, not in the mere interest of the litigants.\"\n*\n\u00a0\n\nFurthermore, I do not think this can be called a case where the circumstances presently confronting us \"were not manifest or fully apprehended at the time certiorari was granted.\" See Ferguson v. Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., \n352 \nU.S. 521, 559\n (separate opinion). The question of the construction of the clause, and that of its validity, were both fully discussed by the parties in their certiorari papers. Indeed, it was apparent on the surface of things that we might find ourselves in the very position we now are, since the Court of Appeals had itself found Clause 27 inapplicable to in rem proceedings and had then gone on \n\n[359 \nU.S. 180, 186]\n\u00a0\n to consider the validity of the clause as related to in personam actions.\n\nAvoidance of decision now on a question which is obviously bound to recur seems to me to be both unsatisfactory and unsound judicial administration. The course which the Court has taken serves only to leave the lower federal courts in confusion and uncertainty and to make it necessary for us to mortgage our future and constantly mounting calendars with a question which we could and should decide today. As the Court has not spoken on that question it would be inappropriate for me to express my own view upon it.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] S. Rep.

His widow and administratrix brought suit in admiralty against the ship and its owners to recover damages for his death, alleging unseaworthiness of the vessel and negligent failure to provide the decedent with a reasonably safe place to work. The District Court dismissed the suit; but the Court of Appeals set aside that judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings. Held:\n\n 1. Since the decedent was not a seaman and his death did not occur on the high seas, there is no applicable federal statute, and the right of recovery depended entirely on the New Jersey Wrongful Death Act, which may be applied by a court of admiralty. Pp. 590-591.\n\n\n 2.

In the circumstances of this case, this Court will not disturb the conclusion reached by a majority of the Court of Appeals, sitting en banc, that a claim for unseaworthiness is encompassed by the New Jersey Wrongful Death Act as a matter of state law, notwithstanding the fact that the New Jersey courts have not passed on the question. Pp. 595-596.\n\n\n 5. Decedent was within the class protected by the warranty of seaworthiness as developed by federal maritime law. Pope & Talbot, Inc., v. Hawn, \n346 \nU.S. 406\n.

Jones entered an appearance for the El Dorado Oil Works, respondent.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nOn the evening of December 5, 1952, the motor vessel Tungus docked at Bayonne, New Jersey, with a cargo of coconut oil in its deep tanks. El Dorado Oil Works had been engaged by the consignee to handle the discharge of this cargo, and for the next several hours the work of pumping the oil ashore was carried on by El Dorado employees, using a pump and hoses furnished by their employer. Two officers and two crew members of the Tungus remained aboard, the latter specifically assigned to assist in the discharge operations. Shortly after midnight the pump became defective, resulting in the spillage of a large quantity of oil over the adjacent deck area. The pump was stopped and the oil cleaned from its immediate vicinity. Efforts to restore the pump to normal operation were unsuccessful, and Carl Skovgaard, an El Dorado maintenance foreman, was therefore summoned from his home to assist in the repair work. After arriving on board he walked through an area from which the oil had not been removed, and in attempting to step from the hatch beams to the top of the partly uncovered port deep tank, he slipped and fell to his death in eight feet of hot coconut oil.\n\nHis widow and administratrix, the respondent here, commenced this suit in admiralty against the ship and its owners to recover damages for his death, alleging unseaworthiness \n\n[358 \nU.S. 588, 590]\n\u00a0\n of the vessel and a negligent failure to provide the decedent with a reasonably safe place to work.\n1\n The District Court dismissed the libel, holding that a wrongful death action for unseaworthiness would not lie, and that the petitioners owned no duty of exercising ordinary care to provide the decedent a safe place to work. 141 F. Supp. 653. The Court of Appeals set aside this decree and remanded the case for further proceedings, a divided en banc court deciding that the New Jersey Wrongful Death Act embraces a claim for unseaworthiness, and also that the District Court had erred with respect to the scope of the petitioners' duty to exercise reasonable care for the decedent's safety. 252 F.2d 14. The court did not decide \"what defenses, if any, might be available,\" leaving that question for the District Court to determine. Certiorari was granted primarily to consider the relationship of maritime and local law in cases of this kind. \n357 \nU.S. 903\n.\n\nWe begin as did the Court of Appeals with the established principle of maritime law that in the absence of a statute there is no action for wrongful death. The Harrisburg, \n119 \nU.S. 199\n. Although Congress has enacted legislation, notably the Jones Act\n2\n and the Death on the High Seas Act,\n3\n providing for wrongful death actions in a limited number of situations,\n4\n no federal \n\n[358 \nU.S. 588, 591]\n\u00a0\n statute is applicable to the present case; Skovgaard was not a seaman,\n5\n and his death occurred upon the territorial waters of New Jersey.\n6\n The respondent's rights in this suit depended entirely, therefore, upon the New Jersey wrongful death statute, and the long-settled doctrine that \"where death . . . results from a maritime tort committed on navigable waters within a State whose statutes give a right of action on account of death by wrongful act, the admiralty courts will entertain a libel in personam for the damages sustained by those to whom such right is given.\" Western Fuel Co. v. Garcia, \n257 \nU.S. 233, 242\n.\n\nThe primary issue in this case, therefore, as the Court of Appeals unanimously saw it, was whether the New Jersey statute giving a right of action where death is caused \"by a wrongful act, neglect or default\" is broad enough to encompass an action for death caused by the unseaworthiness of a vessel.\n7\n It was upon this issue - construction of the state statute - that the court divided.\n\nThe respondent asks us to uphold the interpretation which the majority in the Court of Appeals has put upon the New Jersey statute. Failing that, a much broader alternative argument is advanced - that a court in a case \n\n[358 \nU.S. 588, 592]\n\u00a0\n such as this may disregard completely the conditions which the State has put upon the right it has created, and may apply instead the full corpus of the maritime law, free of any qualifications imposed by the State. If death occurs upon navigable waters within a State, the argument runs, the law should seize only upon the blunt fact that there is some kind of state statute providing some kind of a right of action for death caused by some kind of tortious conduct. That, it is said, is enough to fill the \"void\" in the maritime law, which then becomes applicable in all its facets, without further inquiry as to what it is that the State has actually enacted.\n\nThis broad argument must be rejected. The decisions of this Court long ago established that when admiralty adopts a State's right of action for wrongful death, it must enforce the right as an integrated whole, with whatever conditions and limitations the creating State has attached. That is what was decided in The Harrisburg, where the Court's language was unmistakable: \". . . [I]f the admiralty adopts the statute as a rule of right to be administered within its own jurisdiction, it must take the right subject to the limitations which have been made a part of its existence. . . . The liability and the remedy are created by the same statutes, and the limitations of the remedy are, therefore, to be treated as limitations of the right.\" \n119 \nU.S. 199\n, at 214. That is the doctrine which has been reiterated by the Court through the years.\n8\n See The Hamilton, \n207 \nU.S. 398\n; La Bourgogne, \n\n[358 \nU.S. 588, 593]\n\u00a0\n \n210 \nU.S. 95\n; Western Fuel Co. v. Garcia, \n257 \nU.S. 233\n; Levinson v. Deupree, \n345 \nU.S. 648\n; cf. Just v. Chambers, \n312 \nU.S. 383\n.\n\n\"[A]dmiralty courts, when invoked to protect rights rooted in state law, endeavor to determine the issues in accordance with the substantive law of the State.\" Garrett v. Moore-McCormack Co., \n317 \nU.S. 239, 245\n. The policy expressed by a State Legislature in enacting a wrongful death statute is not merely that death shall give rise to a right of recovery, nor even that tortious conduct resulting in death shall be actionable, but that damages shall be recoverable when conduct of a particular kind results in death. It is incumbent upon a court enforcing that policy to enforce it all; it may not pick or choose.\n\n\n It is manifest, moreover, that acceptance of the respondent's argument would defeat the intent of Congress to preserve state sovereignty over deaths caused by maritime torts within the State's territorial waters. The legislative history of the Death on the High Seas Act discloses a clear congressional purpose to leave \"unimpaired the rights under State statutes as to deaths on waters within the territorial jurisdiction of the States.\" S. Rep. No. 216, 66th Cong., 1st Sess. 3; H. R. Rep. No. 674, 66th Cong., 2d Sess. 3. The record of the debate in the House of Representatives preceding passage of the bill reflects deep concern that the power of the States to create actions for wrongful death in no way be affected by enactment of the federal law. 59 Cong. Rec. 4482-4486. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 588, 594]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThere is no merit to the contention that application of state law to determine rights arising from death in state territorial waters is destructive of the uniformity of federal maritime law. Even Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, which fathered the \"uniformity\" concept, recognized that uniformity is not offended by \"the right given to recover in death cases.\" \n244 \nU.S. 205\n, at 216. It would be an anomaly to hold that a State may create a right of action for death, but that it may not determine the circumstances under which that right exists. The power of a State to create such a right includes of necessity the power to determine when recovery shall be permitted and when it shall not. Cf. Caldarola v. Eckert, \n332 \nU.S. 155\n.\n\nWe hold, therefore, that the Court of Appeals was correct in viewing the basic question before it as one of interpretation of the law of New Jersey. It is within that frame of reference that we consider the issues presented.\n\nThe negligence claim needs little discussion. Obviously the New Jersey wrongful death statute embraces a claim for death negligently caused. The majority in the Court of Appeals pointed out that the officers and crew of the Tungus remained in over-all control of the vessel, and that they were well aware of the existence of the oil spill and of the danger created by it for approximately an hour before Skovgaard arrived on board. Upon these facts it was concluded that the law imposed upon the petitioners a duty of exercising ordinary care to provide Skovgaard with a reasonably safe place to carry on his work of repairing the pump. In reaching this conclusion the court distinguished the New Jersey Supreme Court's decision in Broecker v. Armstrong Cork Co., 128 N. J. L. 3, 24 A. 2d 194. We find no reason to question the disposition of this branch of the case. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 588, 595]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs to the other issues, a majority of the Court of Appeals concluded that a claim for unseaworthiness is encompassed by the New Jersey Wrongful Death Act as a matter of state law.\n9\n The three dissenting members of the court reached the opposite conclusion. Apparently because the trial court had made no finding as to the decedent's contributory negligence or assumption of risk, the Court of Appeals refrained from deciding what effect state law would give to such findings, leaving that question to be decided if it arose on retrial.\n\nIn a case such as this it is incumbent upon the admiralty to enforce the New Jersey statute just \"as it would one originating in any foreign jurisdiction.\" Levinson v. Deupree, \n345 \nU.S. 648, 652\n. Yet the fact is that the New Jersey courts have simply not spoken upon the question of whether in a case such as this maritime law or common law is applicable under the State's Wrongful Death Act. In sum, there is no way of knowing whether New Jersey would impose uniform legal standards throughout its jurisdiction, or would apply in this case rules different from those that would govern if, instead of meeting his death aboard the Tungus, Skovgaard had been killed on the adjacent dock. An effort to resolve that question here, no less than the effort of the Court of Appeals, could be nothing but a prediction, a prediction that might tomorrow be proved wrong by the courts of New Jersey, which alone have power to render an authoritative interpretation. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 588, 596]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn view of these considerations, it might plausibly be argued that the judgment should be vacated, and the case remanded to the District Court to be held until the parties can secure from the courts of New Jersey a decision upon the controlling and seriously doubtful question of state law. Under traditional principles of equitable abstention this Court has often followed such a course for the limited and obviously wise purpose of avoiding unnecessary resolution of constitutional issues.

Magnolia Petroleum Co., \n309 \nU.S. 478\n.\n\nBefore deciding to dispose of a case like the present one in that way, however, important and competing jurisdictional considerations would have to be thoroughly evaluated. See Propper v. Clark, \n337 \nU.S. 472, 486\n-489; Meredith v. Winter Haven, \n320 \nU.S. 228\n. This case has not presented the occasion for full exploration of these jurisdictional questions.\n10\n The Court of Appeals, en banc, has given careful consideration to the meaning of the state statute. We cannot say that its conclusion is clearly wrong. Therefore, despite the inherent uncertainties involved, we will not disturb that court's interpretation of the New Jersey law. Such a course is consistent with the practice that has been followed in the past. Estate of Spiegel v. Commissioner, \n335 \nU.S. 701, 707\n-708; Ragan v.

This subsidiary determination is clearly correct. The decedent's status is practically indistinguishable from that of the plaintiff in Pope & Talbot, Inc., v. Hawn, \n346 \nU.S. 406\n, the only difference being that the cargo here was oil instead of grain, and was being unloaded instead of loaded.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Indeed, such a disposition has not even been suggested by counsel. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 588, 597]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, concurring in the opinion of the Court.\n*\n\u00a0\n\nDeeming the proper determination of the substantive issues of admiralty law of such controlling importance, I abstain from stating my strong conviction, heretofore expressed, that in situations like the present the construction of state law should not, as a matter of the wise administration of law, be made independently by the lower federal courts, but its authoritative construction should be sought, under readily available state procedure, from the state court, while the case is held in the federal court. See my opinions in Sutton v. Leib, \n342 \nU.S. 402, 412\n-414 (concurring opinion), and Propper v. Clark, \n337 \nU.S. 472, 493\n-497 (dissenting opinion), in connection with Railroad Comm'n v.

Winter Haven, \n320 \nU.S. 228\n, a different consideration may become relevant. \"For purposes of diversity jurisdiction a federal court is, `in effect, only another court of the State.'\" Angel v. Bullington, \n330 \nU.S. 183, 187\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] [NOTE: This opinion applies also to No. 56, United New York and New Jersey Sandy Hook Pilots Assn. v. Halecki, post, p. 613.]\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE BLACK, and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\nIt should be clear from the Court's statement of facts that the respondent's decedent, Skovgaard, was at the time of the accident aboard the Tungus in order to assist in repairing the pump used in discharging its cargo of oil - in unloading the vessel. While he was not a member of the crew, but rather an employee of an independent \n\n[358 \nU.S. 588, 598]\n\u00a0\n contractor, he was unquestionably one to whom the vessel owed the duty of seaworthiness. Pope & Talbot, Inc., v. Hawn, \n346 \nU.S. 406, 412\n-413. This means that there was, as it is often put, a \"warranty,\" or more precisely stated, an obligation, a duty owed to certain persons, that the vessel and its equipment, appurtenances and crew met a certain standard. For any breach of that duty, any failure to meet that standard, on the part of the vessel, which gave rise to injury to a person to whom that duty was owed, the vessel and its owner were bound to respond in damages. If that duty was in breach here, and Skovgaard's fall, occasioned thereby, had injured him short of death, there would be no doubt that federal law would afford him a remedy for the injury, and that free of any defense imposed by the law of the State in whose territorial waters the accident took place.\n1\n Pope & Talbot, Inc., v. Hawn, supra, at 409-410. But Skovgaard's injuries were almost immediately fatal, and, as is evident from the record, the principal, if not the sole, claim for damages arising out of the alleged breach of the duty of seaworthiness must be for the damages caused by his death. It was decided in The Harrisburg, \n119 \nU.S. 199\n, that the federal maritime law did not afford a remedy for the death of a human being, even where the death arose out of a tortious breach of maritime duty.\n\nIn the light of this holding, the Court addresses itself to the problem whether the New Jersey Wrongful Death Act can be utilized to furnish a remedy for the breach of the federally defined duty owed to Skovgaard. In reaching its solution of this problem, I fear that it has posed the wrong question. The Court takes the view that it is \n\n[358 \nU.S. 588, 599]\n\u00a0\n a question of state law whether the respondent can utilize the New Jersey Act to supply a remedy for the breach of the duty of seaworthiness charged here. It accepts the answer of the Court of Appeals to this question. The problem to the Court is one of construction of the State Act to determine whether it \"incorporates\" the maritime standard. This is also the view taken by the lower courts of what the basic question in this case is. I think it is wrong, and I shall state my reasons why.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nFirst. I have developed that Skovgaard was entitled to the duty of seaworthiness at the time of the accident, and that there would be no concern at all with state law in this regard if he had been injured short of death. But the holding of The Harrisburg, supra, denies the existence of a federally created remedy for wrongful death arising out of maritime torts. Though this holding was far from being at one with the results that had been reached in the lower admiralty courts prior to it, and was based largely on an application of the harsh common-law principle, then rather lately evolved,\n2\n that in the absence of an appropriate statute there was no civil remedy for wrongful death, the holding has become part and parcel of our maritime jurisprudence. But its harshness was averted by the practice in admiralty of drawing on the state wrongful death statutes to furnish remedies for fatal maritime torts. To an extent this practice antedated The Harrisburg, as the cases cited in that opinion illustrate. See, e. g., The Garland, 5 F. 924. It was continued thereafter, and even extended to torts committed on the high seas, beyond the territorial waters of any State. The \n\n[358 \nU.S. 588, 600]\n\u00a0\n Hamilton, \n207 \nU.S. 398\n. And after the passage by the Congress of the Death on the High Seas Act in 1920, 41 Stat. 537, 46 U.S.C. 761 et seq., which established a federal remedy for cases of wrongful death occurring more than a marine league from shore, state acts continued to be used by the admiralty, pursuant to the terms of the Act, in the case of wrongs occurring in territorial waters.\n\nThough the individual statutes vary in terminology and to an extent in concept, all the States have wrongful death acts - acts which provide remedies to a decedent's estate, or to certain specified beneficiaries, for the harm done on account of the tortious killing of the decedent. While the course of development of the common law has brought it about that this remedy has always been embodied in a statutory enactment, the existence of such a remedy is now a basic premise of the law of torts administered throughout the country. And with the Death on the High Seas Act and the state statutes, the federal admiralty law has available a remedy to fashion for the fatal breach of a maritime duty anywhere within its jurisdiction.\n\nSecond. Can such a remedy, based on a state statute, be afforded for breach of the duty, imposed by federal law, to maintain a vessel in seaworthy condition? I think it can. The question is viewed by the Court today and by the courts below as one of interpretation of the statute of a particular State; the Court of Appeals divided over what intent should be ascribed to the New Jersey Legislature in enacting that State's Wrongful Death Act. The process of divining the \"intent\" of the various state legislatures in such circumstances is not a completely fruitful one, as the Court's opinion makes abundantly clear, and, as I have intimated, I do not believe it is part of the real question the Court should be asking here. The Court has simply failed to grasp the important distinction \n\n[358 \nU.S. 588, 601]\n\u00a0\n here between duties and remedies; between the law governing the details of human behavior and the law governing the specific application of judicial sanctions for breach of duty. It is vital to an understanding of this case to recall that the duty claimed to have been broken here was one grounded in federal law. It would be a strained statement of the effect of The Harrisburg to say that there was no duty imposed by the maritime law not to kill persons through breach of the duty of seaworthiness. The libel alleged a condition constituting a breach of a federally defined duty and set forth a cause of action under federal law, and this nonetheless because the breach of the federal duty had resulted in death rather than in nonfatal injury. It is the federal maritime law that looks to the state law of remedies here, not the state law that incorporates a federal standard of care. This Court plainly declared in Pope & Talbot, Inc., v. Hawn, supra, at 409, that even when the injured party seeks to enforce \"a state created remedy\" for the breach of the federally defined duty owing to him, \"federal maritime law would be controlling.\" The Court today does not refer to this recent expression, clearly of the greatest relevance here. Given a federal legal system where the remedy for wrongful death is as universal as in ours, I think it unwarrantedly destructive of the uniformity of the federal maritime law, cf. Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, \n244 \nU.S. 205\n,\n3\n to make the applicability of a remedy for the breach \n\n[358 \nU.S. 588, 602]\n\u00a0\n of a federally defined duty resulting in death dependent on a frankly supposititious determination of the intent of the various state legislatures, generally acting at a time long before a clear concept of the scope of the federal duty had emerged. And of course this determination will almost invariably be made by the federal courts.\n\nThe Court's solution not only creates potential differences in the availability of a remedy for breach of the federally created duty where the victim dies as opposed to cases where he is injured short of death; those differences may exist in varying degrees as to maritime torts occurring in the territorial waters of various States. I cannot think that any such variation is appropriate or necessary in the enforcement of the cause of action for unseaworthiness. The federal duty need not be subject to this potential diversity of remedies. Cf. Carlisle Packing Co. v. Sandanger, \n259 \nU.S. 255\n; Garrett v. Moore-McCormack Co., \n317 \nU.S. 239\n.\n4\n The existence of a remedy for wrongful death has become almost a postulate of our legal system, though the remedy was generally provided by legislation rather than by the decisional law. It \n\n[358 \nU.S. 588, 603]\n\u00a0\n is against this background that the federal law must look for an appropriate remedy to enforce its duties in a complete and rational way. Cf. Cox v. Roth, \n348 \nU.S. 207, 210\n. Any state statute which generally provides remedies for tortious death can and should be drawn upon by the maritime law in enforcing the federal cause of action. Cf. Just v. Chambers, \n312 \nU.S. 383, 389\n.\n\nIt is true that for state-law purposes these statutes are frequently spoken of as creating a \"new cause of action.\" See Turon v. J. & L. Construction Co., 8 N. J. 543, 556, 86 A. 2d 192, 198; Ake v. Birnbaum, 156 Fla. 735, 751, 25 So.2d 213, 215-216;\n5\n cf. Seward v. The Vera Cruz, 10 A.C. 59, 67. And so they do, in the sense that they give remedies where frequently none existed before, in favor of classes of persons potentially different from the distributees of a decedent's estate, and in the large to an extent designed to furnish redress for the death. And it is further true that not every tort duty imposed by a particular State's law may be afforded a remedy by them. But insofar as these acts have as their purpose the effecting of a general and rough equivalency between the duties for breach of which a remedy lies in the case of injuries causing death and those short of it, they can be proper subjects for the flexibility of the federal maritime law in fashioning a remedy for breach of the duty of seaworthiness. The content of the concept of \n\n[358 \nU.S. 588, 604]\n\u00a0\n \"cause of action\" is a variable and uncertain one, and there is little point in analyzing the various senses in which it has been used in connection with the state statutes. In a real sense the state acts are remedial, and as such they can be used by the admiralty. Used in this way for remedial purposes, they would not interfere with the uniform character of the general maritime law, cf. Chelentis v. Luckenbach S. S. Co., \n247 \nU.S. 372, 384\n, but rather would be an effective method of promoting it.\n\nOf course there is no objection to using state remedial incidents to supplement and enforce duties arising under federal law. The federal courts of their own initiative have used state statutes for remedial purposes when federal duties were concerned. State statutes of limitation applicable to analogous types of claims have been utilized to define the limitations of federal rights of action for which no federal statute of limitations have been provided. Campbell v. Haverhill, \n155 \nU.S. 610\n; Cope v. Anderson, \n331 \nU.S. 461\n; cf. Holmberg v. Armbrecht, \n327 \nU.S. 392, 395\n; Hamilton Foundry & Machine Co. v. International Molders Union, 193 F.2d 209, 215. This remedial incident, tied up with the felt necessity of having some statutory definition, is drawn upon not because of any intent of the state legislatures to make their statute applicable to federal claims, but because it could be rationally utilized through analogy by courts charged with the enforcement of federal rights and duties and the construction of a proper pattern of remedies to that end. It is on such a basis that the federal maritime law here, in my view, can make use of the New Jersey statute to enforce those duties that are grounded in federal law.\n\nI am supported in this conclusion by two carefully reasoned opinions of the New York Court of Appeals. Kuhn v. City of New York, 274 N. Y. 118, 8 N. E. 2d 300; Riley v. Agwilines, Inc., 296 N. Y. 402, 73 N. E. 2d 718. Both \n\n[358 \nU.S. 588, 605]\n\u00a0\n cases considered actions brought in the state courts under the Saving Clause, 28 U.S.C. 1333 (1), to redress maritime torts which resulted in death. The actions were based upon the maritime theories of negligence and unseaworthiness. The New York Court of Appeals held that the State's Wrongful Death Statute afforded only an appropriate remedy for breaches of duties which were to be recognized as essentially federal in their source and uniform in their application: \"[W]e must look to the decisions of the Federal courts to define the liabilities of shipowners for maritime torts, leaving out of consideration decisions of our own courts or statutes of the State which conflict with the rules of liability established in the Federal courts.\" Riley v. Agwilines, Inc., 296 N. Y. 402, 405-406, 73 N. E. 2d 718, 719. The court clearly viewed the issue of the duties alleged to have been in breach to be not a matter of interpretation of the New York Wrongful Death Statute but to be a question upon which the federal maritime law was compelling.\n6\n Cf. O'Leary v. United States Lines Co., 215 F.2d 708, 711.\n\nThird. I find no reason to reach a contrary result in the authorities relied upon by the Court, or urged by the petitioner. It is true that there is language in The Harrisburg, \n119 \nU.S. 199, 214\n, describing the state Wrongful Death Act enforced by the admiralty as creating both a liability and a remedy. But the legal source of the duty sought to be enforced there was not claimed or recognized to be rooted in federal law. The case was decided long before the cause of action for unseaworthiness reached its present mature state, recognized as being federal in its origin and incidents. Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, \n\n[358 \nU.S. 588, 606]\n\u00a0\n \n328 \nU.S. 85\n; Pope & Talbot, Inc., v. Hawn, supra; Alaska S. S. Co. v. Petterson, \n347 \nU.S. 396\n. And The Harrisburg, on this point, together with Western Fuel Co. v. Garcia, \n257 \nU.S. 233\n, on which there is also reliance, actually held that in an admiralty action using the state Wrongful Death Act the state statute of limitations applicable to actions under the state law using the state act would be utilized. This was a solution to one aspect of the limitations problem in maritime personal tort actions, see McAllister v. Magnolia Petroleum Co., \n357 \nU.S. 221, 224\n, 228-229. The most readily available limitations period for an action making use of a state Wrongful Death Act was the period stated therein, and the Court relied on it rather than the admiralty rule of laches. In Levinson v. Deupree, \n345 \nU.S. 648\n, the Court was not concerned with a situation in which the duty alleged to have been broken was as clearly federal as is that in the instant case, and it was apparently assumed that the right to be enforced was grounded in state law. The action was not a seaman's or harbor worker's action at all, but rather arose out of a collision between two motorboats on the Ohio River, fatal to a girl riding in one of them. And of course the holding of the Court there is of no assistance to the majority, since a state-law procedural incident, alleged to be binding since the admiralty was making use of the state act, was in fact rejected. Lindgren v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 38\n, which held that a seaman's representative could not sue for unseaworthiness under a state Wrongful Death Act, does not govern this point at all. The opinion dealt primarily with the effect of the Jones Act's wrongful death provision in removing the seaman's right to invoke the remedies of state Death Acts for the identical gravamen of negligence. And, although the libel did not allege unseaworthiness, the Court briefly observed that the Jones Act's death provision would be construed \n\n[358 \nU.S. 588, 607]\n\u00a0\n equally as foreclosing a state statute's use on that count. The case provides no rule here, since its holding was premised on the Jones Act, and to Skovgaard's injury and death the Jones Act is not applicable.\n7\n Finally, there is not presented here any question of the extent to which a State is required to supply a forum for the enforcement of the duties here involved. Cf. Caldarola v. Eckert, \n332 \nU.S. 155, 158\n;\n8\n but cf. Testa v. Katt, \n330 \nU.S. 386\n.\n\nThe Court's reasoning that the Death on the High Seas Act is somehow dispositive of the question presented today appears to me to continue its confusion between the rights and duties of the parties and the remedial pattern to be followed in enforcing them. No one is contending that the state statutes are to be given no operation in this area; they are an important remedial incident of the right that respondent seeks to assert here. Of course Congress in the Death on the High Seas Act was interested in preserving their availability. There is, however, no suggestion in the Act or its legislative history that \n\n[358 \nU.S. 588, 608]\n\u00a0\n Congress intended that the substantive law of the States be the only law applicable in death cases in territorial waters, or that in fact it be applicable at all in particular proceedings. The effect of Congress' action was to leave the state statutes available as remedial measures in territorial water death cases. It offers no guide for any conclusion as to what substantive law is to apply under the state acts in situations where federally created rights and duties would have prevailed had the injury not been fatal. The only concrete examples of what the Congress was interested in saving to the States given on the floor of the House were the jurisdiction of the state courts, which was dwelt on at length, 59 Cong. Rec. 4484-4485, and the maintenance of the state scheme of beneficiaries, ibid., which is not challenged here. It is odd to draw restrictive inferences from a statute whose purpose was to extend recovery for wrongful death. The legislative history does not reveal the utmost precision in thought regarding the role of state law here, but certainly there is no clear basis in it from which to infer that the Court's anomalous result is a necessary one.\n\nClearly, then, neither the decided cases nor legislative materials foreclose the question of the approach to state Wrongful Death Acts that should be taken by the federal admiralty law in fashioning remedies for breach of the federally defined duty with which we are here concerned. And as I have indicated, the vital principles of the admiralty law as defined by this Court in the past point to the result I have indicated. A proper uniformity on essential matters of maritime cognizance, see Just v. Chambers, \n312 \nU.S. 383, 389\n, cannot be reached by making the availability of this remedy dependent upon exegesis of the statute of each State. It is enough for me that the State provide such a remedy in a general way; the remedy is now a universal feature of the common-law system in this \n\n[358 \nU.S. 588, 609]\n\u00a0\n country, and in its essential features offers a sufficient basis for the operation of the general maritime law. While there is ground for local variation on nonessential matters, on the essentials the admiralty may look to uniform features in these statutes rather than to the diverse. The Court's anomalous result that different systems of law govern in determining the tortious character of conduct, depending on whether it kills or merely injures its victim, is a conscious choice of a nonuniform solution on an essential matter, and as such contrary to one of the basic principles of admiralty law.\n\nIt might be contended that the contours of the various state remedies are so diverse in the varying lists of statutory beneficiaries they provide that the area becomes one in which uniformity cannot in any event be attained, and accordingly it could be said to be inappropriate to seek uniformity even in the content of the duty to be enforced. I cannot find such a contention persuasive. The distribution of funds accruing to a decedent's representatives by reason of his death is a matter, in our federal system, peculiarly within the competence of the States. Certainly it is not a matter more destructive of the uniform character of the maritime law than were the state statutes of limitations enforced in Western Fuel Co. v. Garcia, supra. And it is no more disturbing to the maritime law whether the state distributional scheme is one provided generally by its law or one peculiar to its Wrongful Death Statute.\n9\n\u00a0\n\n[358 \nU.S. 588, 610]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nPetitioner contends that, on the respondent's negligence claim, the Court of Appeals improperly applied federal law to the determination of the question whether a duty to furnish a reasonably safe place to work was owed the decedent by the respondent vessel and its owner. On this aspect of the case, the Court of Appeals, citing both New Jersey and federal cases, indicated that such a duty existed and that it would have been tortious for the respondent negligently to have failed to provide a safe place. It remanded the case to the District Court for findings on the issue of negligence and on any defenses on that issue that might be available to the petitioner. Petitioner contends here that New Jersey law applies to the question whether such a duty was owed, alleging that the New Jersey precedents are contrary to the result reached by the court below. Although it believes that the Court of Appeals properly applied New Jersey law, the Court accepts the contention that state law applies here. In view of what I have said above, I cannot agree. In Pope & Talbot, Inc., v. Hawn, supra, at 409, it was made clear that the duty imposed by the theory of negligence to act in accordance with a standard of reasonable care, when coupled with the duty to maintain a seaworthy ship, owed to a person in Skovgaard's status, was a federally created duty. Cf. The Max Morris, \n137 \nU.S. 1, 14\n-15. The factual circumstances involving proof of negligence and of unseaworthiness, where both are claimed, are generally intertwined. Pope & Talbot, Inc., v. Hawn, supra, at 416 \n\n[358 \nU.S. 588, 611]\n\u00a0\n (concurring opinion); McAllister v. Magnolia Petroleum Co., \n357 \nU.S. 221, 224\n-225. Cf. Baltimore S. S. Co. v. Phillips, \n274 \nU.S. 316\n. My view is that it is plain that in enforcing the related duty imposed by the obligation not negligently to inflict harm the federal courts must look to state Wrongful Death Acts in the same light as I have indicated it is appropriate to look at them in enforcing the duty to maintain a seaworthy vessel. The basis for the holding that New Jersey law applies is the Court's acceptance of a distinction in primary legal duties in respect to maritime accidents causing fatal as opposed to nonfatal injuries. As I have developed above, I cannot view any such distinction as tenable. Since the Court of Appeals' holding on the negligence issue was correct as a matter of federal law, its judgment should be affirmed on this point, except to the extent that it directed the District Court to determine what defenses were available as a matter of New Jersey law.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nAdmiralty law is primarily judge-made law. The federal courts have a most extensive responsibility of fashioning rules of substantive law in maritime cases. See Wilburn Boat Co. v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co., \n348 \nU.S. 310, 314\n; cf. The John G. Stevens, \n170 \nU.S. 113, 126\n-127. This responsibility places on this Court the duty of assuring that the product of the effort be coherent and rational. Admiralty law is an area where flexibility and creativity have been demonstrated in accomplishing this. Today the Court announces the strange principle that the substantive rules of law governing human conduct in regard to maritime torts vary in their origin depending on whether the conduct gives rise to a fatal or a nonfatal injury. I have demonstrated that it does so under no compulsion of binding precedent here or of \n\n[358 \nU.S. 588, 612]\n\u00a0\n Act of Congress. Its anomalous result is purely of its own making. Certainly the responsibility incumbent upon this Court in this area demands more by way of fulfillment than the Court has furnished today.\n10\n\u00a0\n\nFor the reasons I have stated, I concur in the judgment affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeals, except to the extent I have just indicated.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Clearly so where the action was pursued in admiralty. In other forums, and in some circumstances, there might arguably be some room for the application of such defensive features of state remedial law as statutes of limitations. See McAllister v. Magnolia Petroleum Co., \n357 \nU.S. 221, 224\n, n. 5.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The principle was finally settled for the federal courts sitting at law, under the regime of Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1, by Insurance Co. v. Brame, \n95 \nU.S. 754\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The Court's citation of Jensen as lending some support to its position is not well taken. The language quoted, \n244 \nU.S., at 216\n, says no more than that the state statutes are allowed to perform a function in this area, which everyone concedes is correct. I fear, too, that in its somewhat deprecatory reference to the Jensen case, the Court may be ignoring the basically sound and enduring principle of that decision, the necessity that the federal maritime law exhibit independence of the varying rules of state law. Of course, there is \n\n[358 \nU.S. 588, 602]\n\u00a0\n more warranted criticism of Jensen for the unfortunate practical results it created in its own specific area of application. Cf. Gilmore and Black, The Law of Admiralty, 1-17.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The Court's quotation from Garrett, \"[A]dmiralty courts, when invoked to protect rights rooted in state law, endeavor to determine the issues in accordance with the substantive law of the State,\" made in support of its conclusion, is a patent begging of the question at issue here. The issue is what system of law gives rise to the rights and duties here involved. No one would doubt that the federal law gives rise to the substantive standards by which the conduct of the parties here involved would have been judged if Skovgaard's injuries had not been fatal. The question is whether his rights, and those of his representatives in respect to the conduct that injured and killed him, remain rooted in federal law here, where the suit is for damages for his death. The Court's confusion of rights and duties with remedies is apparent again here.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The Ake case, like others, suggests that there may possibly be two \"rights\" infringed by a tort causing death - one of the injured party and the other of his beneficiaries. But this is not an analytically helpful way of viewing the situation. The measure of the duty of conduct owed the injured party is typically the limit of the substantive liability of the tortfeasor and of the \"right\" enjoyed by the beneficiaries. It is clear that what is meant by the \"right\" of the beneficiaries is a special and distinct remedial incident attributable to a single breach of duty.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Judge Learned Hand's opinion in Guerrini v. United States, 167 F.2d 352, 354, took the view that the New York cases were decided as compelled by the federal law, as is amply evident from the opinions themselves.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The Hamilton, \n207 \nU.S. 398\n, cited by the Court, only holds that a state-created death remedy could be applied to a collision on the high seas. It appears from the opinion that Mr. Justice Holmes considered the general federal maritime law relevant to a determination of liability under it. Id., at 406-407. And in La Bourgogne, \n210 \nU.S. 95\n, where recovery made use of the French death remedy, liability was found as a matter of substantive law where France would not have found it. Finally, The Corsair, \n145 \nU.S. 335\n, held that the Louisiana Death Act did not create a maritime lien. It was not there considered whether the breach of a federally defined duty could have created such a lien, even though the breach resulted in death, and in fact the source of the duty being enforced through the Louisiana Act was not discussed.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] The New York Court of Appeals did not consider its own decision in Caldarola, 295 N. Y. 463, 168 N. E. 2d 444, aff'd, \n332 \nU.S. 155\n, as preclusive of its decision less than a year later in Riley v. Agwilines, Inc., 296 N. Y. 402, 73 N. E. 2d 718. See pp. 604-605, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Despite Judge Learned Hand's initial suggestion in Puleo v. H. E. Moss & Co., 159 F.2d 842, 845, quickly retracted in Guerrini v. United States, 167 F.2d 352, 355, the Conservation Act, 45 Stat. 54, 16 U.S.C. 457, is not relevant to the problem here. That Act makes applicable state death acts (as well as state personal injury law generally) to torts \"within a national park or other place subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.\" The state territorial \n\n[358 \nU.S. 588, 610]\n\u00a0\n waters, while within the cognizance of the federal maritime law, are also subject to the jurisdiction of the States, Toomer v. Witsell, \n334 \nU.S. 385, 393\n, and hence one need go no further than its terms to find the Act inapposite.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] I might likewise say that even if the source of substantive law here be considered as state law, it hardly would comport with the responsibility of the federal courts for them to send the parties to an admiralty action before them to the state courts to obtain an adjudication of the legal issues involved. Though the Court does not make such a disposition here, certain inclinations in this direction are discernible in its opinion. The words of Chief Justice Stone in Meredith v. Winter Haven, \n320 \nU.S. 228\n, might furnish the lesson here; we must recollect that jurisdiction creates the duty of decision, and that, like the diversity, the admiralty jurisdiction \"was not conferred for the benefit of the federal courts or to serve their convenience.\" Id., at 234. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 588, 613]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","188":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTRI-CITY BROADCASTING CO. v.

JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe sole issue involved here is whether contributions by an employer to a union welfare fund which are required by a collective bargaining agreement are entitled, in bankruptcy, to priority as being \"wages . . . due to workmen\" under 64 (a) (2) of the Bankruptcy Act, as \n\n[359 \nU.S. 29, 30]\n\u00a0\n amended.\n1\n Both the trial court, 154 F. Supp. 141, and the Court of Appeals, 254 F.2d 475, held that such contributions enjoyed priority. This resulted in a conflict with the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Local 140 Security Fund v. Hack, 242 F.2d 375, in view of which we granted certiorari. \n358 \nU.S. 811\n.\n\nThe facts are undisputed. Embassy Restaurant, Inc., was bound in collective bargaining agreements with Local Unions 111 and 301. The agreements related to hours, wages and other conditions of employment. Under these agreements Embassy was obligated to contribute to the trustees of the welfare funds of Locals 111 and 301 $8 per month per full-time employee. The welfare plans were organized to maintain \"life insurance, weekly sick benefits, hospital and surgical benefits\" and other advantages for members of the locals. Trustees administered each plan under a formal trust agreement and were authorized to formulate and establish the conditions of eligibility for benefits, control all the funds received, collect all contributions, and in their \"sole discretion\" to handle all legal proceedings incident thereto. Title to all of the funds, property and income was placed in the trustees exclusively and no employee or anyone claiming under him had any right whatsoever in the plan or any part thereof. In the \n\n[359 \nU.S. 29, 31]\n\u00a0\n bankruptcy proceeding the trustees filed proofs of a claim for unpaid contributions due by Embassy, and asserted a second priority for all amounts that had accrued during the three months immediately preceding the bankruptcy. This priority was disallowed by the Referee but, on review, it was granted by both the trial court and the Court of Appeals. We have concluded that such contributions are not entitled to such priority in payment.\n\nAt the outset we point out that \"The broad purpose of the Bankruptcy Act is to bring about an equitable distribution of the bankrupt's estate. . . .\" Kothe v. R. C. Taylor Trust, \n280 \nU.S. 224, 227\n, and that \"if one claimant is to be preferred over others, the purpose should be clear from the statute.\" Nathanson v. Labor Board, \n344 \nU.S. 25, 29\n.\n2\n Moreover, if the contributions are placed in the wage priority class, they will likewise be rendered nondischargeable under 17 of the Act,\n3\n resulting in their remaining outstanding debts of the bankrupt if the assets of the estate are insufficient to discharge them for three months prior to the bankruptcy.\n\nThe trustees attempt to bring contributions within this preferred class by claiming them to be \"wages . . . due to workmen.\" This class of claims has been given a preferred position in the Bankruptcy Act for over 100 years,\n4\n long before welfare funds played any part in labor negotiations. True, the Congress has amended the Act, but such amendments have been few and guarded ones, such as raising the ceiling on the amount permitted,\n5\n shifting \n\n[359 \nU.S. 29, 32]\n\u00a0\n the relative priorities\n6\n and enlarging the class to salesmen, clerks, etc.\n7\n If it had wished to include contributions, Congress could easily have included them at any of these times. On the contrary, however, the purpose of Congress has constantly been to enable employees displaced by bankruptcy to secure, with some promptness, the money directly due to them in back wages, and thus to alleviate in some degree the hardship that unemployment usually brings to workers and their families. Evidence of this purpose is found in a 1934 amendment to the Bankruptcy Act.\n8\n In that year, Congress amended 63 to allow workmen's compensation claims as provable debts. In awarding them priority, however, Congress relegated these claims to a seventh priority in contrast to the then fourth priority of wages.\n9\n Only four years later, Congress abolished the priority status of these compensation claims, though it continued them as provable debts under 63, 11 U.S.C. 103 (a) (6). It is therefore evident that not all types of obligations due employees from their employers are regarded by Congress as being within the concept of wages, even though having some relation to employment. Moreover, such action indicated the care Congress has exercised in regard to the protection it has granted \"wages . . . due to workmen.\"\n\nLet us examine the nature of these contributions. They are flat sums of $8 per month for each workman. The amount is without relation to his hours, wages or productivity. It is due the trustees, not the workman, and the latter has no legal interest in it whatsoever. A workman cannot even compel payment by a defaulting employer. Moreover it does not appear that the parties to the collective \n\n[359 \nU.S. 29, 33]\n\u00a0\n agreement considered these welfare payments as wages. The contract here refers to them as \"contributions.\" Finally, Embassy's obligation is to contribute sums to the trustees, not to its workmen; it is enforceable only by the trustees who enjoy not only the sole title, but the exclusive management of the funds.\n\nIt is contended, however, that since \"unions bargain for these contributions as though they were wages\" and industry likewise considers them \"as an integral part of the wage package,\" they must in law be considered \"wages.\" This approach overlooks the fact that we deal with a statute, not business practice. Nor do we believe that holdings that various fringe benefits are wages under the N. L. R. A.\n10\n or the Social Security Act\n11\n are apposite. We construe the priority section of the Bankruptcy Act, not those statutes. It specifically fixes the relative priority of claims of classes of creditors. Here that class is \"wages . . . due to workmen.\"\n\nThe contributions here are not \"due to workmen,\" nor have they the customary attributes of wages. Thus, they cannot be treated as being within the clear, unequivocal language of \"wages. . . due to workmen\" unless it is clear that they satisfy the purpose for which Congress established the priority. That purpose was to provide the workman a \"protective cushion\" against the economic displacement caused by his employer's bankruptcy.\n12\n These payments, owed as they are to the trustee rather than to the workman, offer no support to the workman in periods of financial distress. Furthermore, if the claims of the trustees are to be treated on a par with wages, in a case where the employer's assets are insufficient to pay \n\n[359 \nU.S. 29, 34]\n\u00a0\n all in the second priority, the workman will have to share with the welfare plan, thus reducing his own recovery.\n\nRespondents argue that precedent allows the priority to be asserted by one other than the workman himself. We are cited to Shropshire, Woodliff & Co. v. Bush, \n204 \nU.S. 186\n, and United States v. Carter, \n353 \nU.S. 210\n. In Shropshire, wages due a workman had been assigned by him, and the assignee was seeking the wage priority enjoyed by his assignor. In allowing the claim to have priority, the Court said:\n\n \"When one has incurred a debt for wages due to workmen,  . . . that debt . . . is entitled to priority . . . .\n\n\n  .  .  .   .  .\n\n\n \"The character of the debts was fixed when they were  incurred, and could not be changed by assignment,\"  \n204 \nU.S., at 189\n,\n\n\n and also, that \"The priority is attached to the debt and not to the person of the creditor . . . .\" Ibid. Application of these principles to the facts here helps respondents not at all; the obligation to make contributions, when incurred, was to the trustees, not to the workmen. The debt was never owed the workmen. Furthermore, assignability of wage claims as in Shropshire, may benefit the bankrupt's employees, who are thus enabled to obtain their money sooner than they might by waiting out the bankruptcy procedure.\n\nNor does the Carter case, supra, support the granting of a priority to these contributions. There we dealt with the Miller Act,\n13\n which granted to every person furnishing labor or material the right to sue on the contractor's payment bond \"for the sum or sums justly due him.\" The contractor defaulted and the trustees of a welfare fund similar to that involved here sued on the bond for recovery \n\n[359 \nU.S. 29, 35]\n\u00a0\n of contributions \"justly due.\" Our opinion did not hold that contributions were part of \"wages . . . due to workmen.\" In fact we pointed out that the trust agreement provided that the contributions \"shall not constitute or be deemed to be wages.\" The basis of the opinion was that the Miller Act \"does not limit recovery on the statutory bond to `wages,'\" id., at 217. The Act having the broad protective purposes of securing all claims that are \"justly due\" we held that the trustees might recover. In short, though the contributions were not wages, they were \"justly due\" as a claim within \"the purposes of the Miller Act.\" Under the Bankruptcy Act, however, not all claims \"justly due\" have priority. They must be within a class, such as \"wages . . . due to workmen.\" The claims here are not. If this class is to be so enlarged, it must be done by the Congress.\n\nThe judgment is\n\n       Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 30 Stat. 563, 64, as amended, 11 U.S.C.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS concur, dissenting.\n\nI believe payments made by employers to union welfare funds are \"wages . . . due to workmen . . .,\" under the Bankruptcy Act's priority section.\n1\n The history of the section is one of continuous congressional expansion. Priority for the \"full amount of the wages due\" on account of \"any labor as an operative in the service of any bankrupt\" \n\n[359 \nU.S. 29, 36]\n\u00a0\n was first granted in the 1841 Bankruptcy Act; it was limited to $25.\n2\n The Bankruptcy Acts of 1867 and 1898 increased the sum available to each claimant and broadened the coverage of the priority beyond \"operatives\" or \"workmen\" to \"workmen, clerks or servants.\"\n3\n In 1906 Congress brought still more workers into the protected category by defining the group as \"workmen, clerks, travelling or city salesmen, or servants.\"\n4\n The priority was once again increased, now to $600, in 1926.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nThe Chandler Act passed in 1938 raised the workers' priority to second behind expenses of administration and ahead of federal and local taxes. At the same time its scope was further broadened to cover \"workmen, servants, clerks, or travelling or city salesmen on a salary or commission basis, whole or part-time, whether or not selling exclusively for the bankrupt.\"\n6\n Finally, in 1956, Congress took occasion to guard against narrow interpretation of the class of workers covered by adding to the priority section of the Chandler Act the words \"and for the purposes of this clause, the term `travelling or city salesmen' shall include all such salesmen, whether or not they are independent contractors selling the products or services of the bankrupt on a commission basis, with or without a drawing account or formal contract.\"\n7\n\u00a0\n\nThis last change in the priority section was the sole subject of a very short Act passed by Congress. Like most of the earlier changes, it was enacted after court decisions barring some workers from the protected class or indicating \n\n[359 \nU.S. 29, 37]\n\u00a0\n that others might be barred.\n8\n We should, I think, be warned by the foregoing history of the wage priority section against niggardly interpretations of the language used in that section.\n\nThe Court argues, however, that payments to welfare funds are neither \"wages\" nor \"due to workmen.\" It is hard for me to see how they could not be \"wages.\" The payments are certainly not gifts. As was stated less than a year ago by a Senate Committee, which had made an extended study of plans such as those here involved, \"regardless of the form they take, the employers' share of the costs of these plans or the benefits the employers provide are a form of compensation.\"\n9\n Courts have long held that compensation for services rendered is a valid definition of \"wages\" both in the priority section of the Bankruptcy Act and in other contexts.\n10\n This is certainly in accord with the customary meaning of the word. It appears, moreover, that unions and employees consider such payments as the equivalent of wages and \n\n[359 \nU.S. 29, 38]\n\u00a0\n that they have been treated as wages in other statutes.\n11\n In fact, where such treatment has seemed undesirable, Congress has expressly excluded them from the category.\n12\n Of course, a word need not mean the same thing in different statutes, but the meaning attributed in one Act is far from irrelevant to the interpretation of another.\n\nIt cannot be argued that a sum paid by an employer for a worker's services loses its status as wages merely because it is used to purchase insurance benefits.\n13\n For the Bankruptcy Act has as yet authorized no investigation of how a worker spends his money to determine if he is entitled to a priority for it. And in all events insurance payments would not seem to be the type of expenditure which Congress would discourage.\n\nIt is also hard for me to imagine how the fact that the moneys are paid to parties other than the workmen is in any way connected with the question of whether the payments are wages, whatever its relevance might be to whether the sums are \"due to workmen.\" This is especially true in the light of Shropshire, Woodliff & Co. v. Bush, \n204 \nU.S. 186\n, which held that moneys due an assignee of the worker were entitled to priority as wages. The Government admits that if a formal assignment had been made here, wage status might be granted. It does not explain, however, how the lack of a formal assignment can change payments from \"wages\" to some \n\n[359 \nU.S. 29, 39]\n\u00a0\n thing else or make granting a priority less in line with congressional policy.\n14\n\u00a0\n\nThe question of whether the payments are \"due to workmen\" is on its face somewhat more difficult. But to my way of thinking, the correct answer has been made easy by prior cases in this Court. In the Shropshire case, the Court said, \"The priority is attached to the debt and not to the person of the creditor; to the claim and not to the claimant. The act does not enumerate classes of creditors and confer upon them the privilege of priority in payment, but, on the other hand, enumerates classes of debts as `the debts to have priority.'\" \n204 \nU.S., at 189\n. It then held that an assignee of a worker had priority since the debt was wages due to workmen.\n\nEven if it could be meaningfully argued that in Shropshire the money was at one time due to workmen, and therefore remained so after assignment, while here it never was due to them, we are, I think, precluded from that position unless we depart from the reasoning of United States v. Carter, \n353 \nU.S. 210\n. That case construed 2 (a) of the Miller Act, 49 Stat. 794, 40 U.S.C. 270b (a), which provides that \"Every person who has furnished labor . . . and who has not been paid in full . . . shall have the right to sue on [a] payment bond . . . for the sum or sums justly due him.\" The Court held that, for the purposes of the Miller Act, payments to welfare funds are, \"as much `justly due' to the employees who have earned them as are the wages payable directly to them in cash.\" \n353 \nU.S., at 220\n. In fact, the Court stated that trustees of the welfare fund have an even better right to sue than most assignees since \n\n[359 \nU.S. 29, 40]\n\u00a0\n the trustees, unlike the usual assignee, sue for the benefit of the workers. Ibid. I cannot see why the Bankruptcy Act should be construed differently from the Miller Act on the question of whether welfare fund contributions are due to workmen. This is especially true since the policies of the relevant provisions of the two Acts are quite similar.\n\nFinally it seems to me undesirable to make a distinction in this area between payments on assignment and payments in trust. At best it would let the carrying out of congressional policy depend on the skill with which unions prepare legal documents, and on the various state laws covering the validity of wage assignments. At worst it would give priorities to assignees of the workmen, usually creditors, while denying them to insurance funds for their benefit. Unless we are prepared to repudiate what we said in the Carter and Shropshire cases, I think 64 (a) (2) of the Bankruptcy Act means that the sums which Embassy contracted to pay to these employees for their labor by making payments to welfare funds are wages due to workers. If the provision granting priority to wages is to be narrowed, it should be done by Congress - not by this Court.\n\nI would affirm.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 64, 30 Stat. 563, as amended, 11 U.S.C. 104.

CO. v. PRICE(1959)\nNo. 414\nArgued: March 31, 1959Decided: June 29, 1959\n\n\n\n\n Claiming that respondent had been discharged by petitioner railroad in violation of a collective bargaining agreement, his union, acting on his behalf and with his consent, submitted the grievance to the National Railroad Adjustment Board, which found that his dismissal was justified. Thereafter, respondent sued the railroad in a Federal District Court to recover damages for wrongful dismissal. Held: Respondent's submission of his grievances as to the validity of his dismissal to the Board precludes him from seeking damages for that dismissal in a common-law action. Pp. 602-617.\n\n (a) The Board's decision was not based solely on the ground that the railroad had followed the proper procedure in discharging respondent but also included a determination that he was discharged for good cause. Pp. 606-607.\n\n\n (b) The clear language of 3 First (m) of the Railway Labor Act, the scheme of the Act, and its legislative history compel the conclusion that an award by the Board, holding that an employee was properly discharged, precludes him from relitigating the same issue in a common-law damage suit. Pp. 608-614.\n\n\n (c) Although an enforcement proceeding against a non-complying carrier under 3 First (p) affords a defeated carrier some opportunity to relitigate issues decided by the Board, Congress did not provide a similar opportunity for a defeated employee. Pp. 614-617.\n\n\n 255 F.2d 663, reversed and cause remanded.\n\nJames A. Wilcox argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief were E. C. Renwick, Malcolm Davis, Calvin M. Cory and W. R. Rouse.\n\nSamuel S. Lionel argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 601, 602]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis is a diversity common-law action brought by the respondent, a former employee of petitioner railroad, in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada to recover damages from the railroad for allegedly wrongfully discharging him in violation of the collective bargaining agreement between it and the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen. The validity of the discharge was previously challenged upon the same grounds before the National Railroad Adjustment Board, First Division, in a proceeding brought by the Brotherhood on respondent's behalf under 3 First (i) of the Railway Labor Act,\n1\n seeking the respondent's reinstatement with back pay. The Board rendered an award in favor of the petitioner. The question for decision here is whether the respondent may pursue a common-law remedy for damages for his allegedly wrongful dismissal after having chosen to pursue the statutory remedy which resulted in a determination by the National Adjustment Board that his dismissal was justified.\n\nThe respondent was employed by petitioner as a swing brakeman (an extra brakeman who is not a regularly assigned member of a train crew) and was a member of \n\n[360 \nU.S. 601, 603]\n\u00a0\n the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen. The collective bargaining agreement between the Brotherhood and the petitioner contained two provisions involved in the dispute over his discharge. One provision, Article 32 (b), provided that: \"Swing brakemen will not be tied up nor released at points where sleeping and eating accommodations are not available.\" The other provision, Article 33 (a), provided that: \"When a trainman is suspended for an alleged fault, no punishment will be fixed without a thorough investigation, at which the accused may have a trainman of his choice present.\"\n\nOn July 12, 1949, the respondent was called to \"dead-head\" on Train No. 37 from Las Vegas, Nevada, to Nipton, California, at which point he was to detrain and await assignment to another train travelling to Las Vegas. Train No. 37 arrived at Nipton at 10:30 p. m., and the train dispatcher assigned respondent to train No. X 1622E, which was due to arrive at Nipton around 4 a. m., en route to Las Vegas. The respondent complained that there were no facilities available in Nipton for eating or sleeping and told the dispatcher he would go back to Las Vegas and return after getting something to eat. The dispatcher refused to release him and ordered him to wait the arrival of train X 1622E. The respondent disobeyed this instruction and deadheaded back to Las Vegas on a train which left Nipton at 11:10 p. m.\n\nThe railroad suspended the respondent on the morning of July 13. On July 16 he received a notice to appear at 10 a. m. on July 17 before an Assistant Superintendent of the railroad for an investigation. At the respondent's request the investigation was postponed to the morning of July 18, at which time the respondent requested a further postponement until his representative, the Brotherhood's Local Chairman, could be present. A postponement was again granted, until 2:30 p. m. of the 18th, but \n\n[360 \nU.S. 601, 604]\n\u00a0\n the respondent's Local Chairman apparently was still not available at that time. When respondent failed to appear for the 2:30 hearing, the Assistant Superintendent proceeded with the investigation in his absence. The testimony of railroad witnesses was taken stenographically and transcribed; no evidence was received in respondent's behalf. On July 24 the railroad notified the respondent that he was discharged.\n\nThe Brotherhood processed respondent's grievance through the required management levels, and when settlement could not be reached, nor agreement arrived at for a joint submission to the National Railroad Adjustment Board, the Brotherhood, in January 1951, filed an ex parte submission with the Board's First Division.\n2\n Hearing was waived by the parties and the submission was considered on the papers filed by them. The Adjustment Board, on June 25, 1952, rendered its award \"Claim denied,\" with supporting findings.\n3\n\u00a0\n\n[360 \nU.S. 601, 605]\n\u00a0\n\n\nSome three years after the filing of the award, the respondent, on June 6, 1955, brought the instant suit. His complaint alleges a cause of action predicated on the same grounds of allegedly wrongful dismissal in violation of the collective bargaining agreement which had been urged on the Adjustment Board, namely, (1) that he \"was dismissed without cause\" and (2) that he was dismissed without a \"thorough investigation\" because not \"afforded an opportunity to have a trainman of his choice present at the investigation held\" nor \"afforded a reasonable opportunity to prepare his defense,\" \"to present his defense,\" \"to have witnesses present\" or \"to participate in his own defense.\" After filing an answer, the railroad moved for summary judgment on affidavits and other papers on file upon the ground that \"any judicially enforceable cause of action arising from the termination of the employment relationship . . . is now barred by the adjudication and determination of the validity of such termination by the National Railroad Adjustment Board under the terms and conditions of said collective bargaining agreement, and pursuant to and in conformance with the Railway Labor Act . . . .\" The District Court, without opinion, granted the motion and entered summary judgment in favor of the petitioner. The respondent appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, assigning as the single point on the appeal that the District Court \"erred in holding that the award of the National Railroad Adjustment Board entitled . . . [the railroad] to Summary Judgment.\" The Court of Appeals, one judge dissenting, reversed, 255 F.2d 663. Although the Court of Appeals held that the District Court would \n\n[360 \nU.S. 601, 606]\n\u00a0\n be \"without jurisdiction to entertain the action if the Board award represents a determination on the merits,\" id., at 666, the court concluded that while the question whether the railroad was entitled to discharge the respondent \"was one of the two questions which Price submitted for Board determination,\" \"the Board made no determination on the merits\" but determined only that in \"the manner in which the investigation was conducted by the carrier . . . none of Price's rights in that regard was abridged,\" and held that the District Court therefore had jurisdiction to entertain the action. Id., at 666-667. We granted certiorari to decide the important question raised by the case of the interpretation of the Railway Labor Act. \n358 \nU.S. 892\n.\n\nWe do not agree with the Court of Appeals' holding that the Board's award was based solely on its decision that Article 33 (a) was not violated by the railroad because respondent's dismissal followed a \"thorough investigation.\" Rather we think the award also reflects the Board's determination that respondent was discharged for good cause. Thus we agree with Judge Healy, dissenting in the Court of Appeals, that on the face of the customarily brief findings of the Board\n4\n it appears \"plain that \n\n[360 \nU.S. 601, 607]\n\u00a0\n the Board was of opinion, and in substance held, that the asserted violation by the Company of Article 32, even if true, would not serve to justify an employee's violation of direct operating instructions and his abandonment of his post.\" 255 F.2d, at 667-668. Since the discharge could be set aside by the Board if either ground of the submission was sustained, the unqualified denial of the claim necessarily implied, we think, that the Board decided both grounds submitted adversely to the respondent. Even if the procedure followed by the railroad constituted a proper investigation, the Board's outright denial of the claim is explicable only on the ground that the Board also held that Article 32 (b) did not justify the respondent in disobeying the dispatcher's instruction to remain at Nipton. We conclude that both issues were decided by the Board against the respondent,\n5\n and therefore reach the question whether the respondent, despite the adverse determination of the Adjustment Board, could pursue the common-law remedy for damages in the District Court.\n6\n\u00a0\n\n[360 \nU.S. 601, 608]\n\u00a0\n\n\nCongress has said in 3 First (m) of the Railway Labor Act\n7\n that the Adjustment Board's \"awards shall be final and binding upon both parties to the dispute, except insofar as they shall contain a money award.\" Respondent does not argue that a \"money award\" is anything other than an award directing the payment of money. Indeed, it would distort the English language to interpret that term as including a refusal to award a money payment. Thus, the plain language of 3 First (m), on its face, imports that Congress intended that the Board's disposition of a grievance should preclude a subsequent court action by the losing party. Furthermore, we have said of the Railway Labor Act that \"the specification of one remedy normally excludes another.\" Switchmen's Union v. National Mediation Board, \n320 \nU.S. 297, 301\n. Thus, our duty to give effect to the congressional purpose compels us to hold that the instant common-law action is precluded unless the overall scheme established by the Railway Labor Act and the legislative history clearly indicate a congressional intention contrary to that which the plain meaning of the words imports. Our understanding of the statutory scheme and the legislative history, however, reinforces what the statutory language already makes clear, namely, that Congress barred the employee's subsequent resort to the common-law \n\n[360 \nU.S. 601, 609]\n\u00a0\n remedy after an adverse determination of his grievance by the Adjustment Board.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nThe purpose of the Railway Labor Act was to provide a framework for peaceful settlement of labor disputes between carriers and their employees to \"insure to the public continuity and efficiency of interstate transportation service, and to protect the public from the injuries and losses consequent upon any impairment or interruption of interstate commerce through failures of managers and employees to settle peaceably their controversies.\" H. R. Rep. No. 328, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 1. Congress did not, however, in the original 1926 Act, create the National Railroad Adjustment Board or make the use of such an agency compulsory upon the parties; rather the Act contemplated that settlement of disputes would be achieved through \"machinery for amicable adjustment of labor disputes agreed upon by the parties . . . .\" S. Rep. No. 606, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 4. Congress, therefore, provided that adjustment boards should be \"created by agreement between any carrier or group of carriers, or the carriers as a whole, or its or their employees.\" 3 First of the Railway Labor Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 578. These adjustment boards, intended for use in settling what are termed minor disputes in the railroad industry, primarily grievances arising from the application of collective bargaining agreements to particular situations, see Railroad \n\n[360 \nU.S. 601, 610]\n\u00a0\n Trainmen v. Chicago River & I. R. Co., \n353 \nU.S. 30\n were thus to be established by voluntary agreement. Congress, even in 1926 however, recognized that the boards would not be useful in bringing about industrial peace unless their decisions were binding on the parties. Thus the 1926 Act required that agreements creating adjustment boards must stipulate \"that decisions of adjustment boards shall be final and binding on both parties to the dispute; and it shall be the duty of both to abide by such decisions . . . .\" 3 First (e) of the Railway Labor Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 579.\n\nBut the 1926 Act provided no sanctions to force the carriers and their employees to make agreements establishing adjustment boards and many railroads refused to participate on such boards or so limited their participation that the boards were ineffectual.\n9\n Moreover, the boards which were created were composed of equal numbers of management and labor representatives and deadlocks over particular cases became commonplace. Since no procedure for breaking such deadlocks was provided, many disputes remained unsettled. As reported to Congress in 1934 by Mr. Eastman, Federal Coordinator of Transportation: \"Another difficulty with the present law [the 1926 Act], even where an adjustment board has been established, is that, although its decisions are final and binding upon both parties, there can be no certainty that there will be a decision.\" Hearings before Senate Committee \n\n[360 \nU.S. 601, 611]\n\u00a0\n on Interstate Commerce on S. 3266, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 17. Strike threats became frequent in an atmosphere of mutual recriminations which presented the danger of creating the very strife which the statute had been designed to avoid. Mr. Eastman reported to the House Rules Committee: \"[G]rievances on a number of roads have in the past few years accumulated to such an extent that the only remedy the men could see was to threaten a strike and thus secure appointment by the President of a fact finding board which could go into the whole situation. That has happened on several occasions. Some of these grievances have accumulated up into the hundreds on the various roads and when the situation finally became intolerable the men would threaten a strike . . . .\" Hearings before the House Rules Committee, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 25; see also p. 14; see also Hearings before the Senate Interstate Commerce Committee, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 17; and see Elgin, J. & E. R. Co. v. Burley, \n325 \nU.S. 711, 725\n-726.\n\nThe railroad labor organizations were particularly dissatisfied. They urged that effective adjustment of grievances could be attained only by amendments to the 1926 Act that would establish a National Adjustment Board in which both carriers and employees would be required to participate, that would permit an employee to compel a carrier to submit a grievance to the Board, that would provide for a neutral person to break deadlocks occurring when the labor and management representatives divided equally, and, finally, that would make awards binding on the parties and enforceable in the courts, when favorable to the employees.\n10\n These views prevailed in the Congress \n\n[360 \nU.S. 601, 612]\n\u00a0\n and resulted in the 1934 amendments which drastically changed the scheme of the Act. Act of June 21, 1934, 48 Stat. 1185.\n11\n The National Railroad Adjustment Board was created and the carriers were required to participate through representatives selected by them, 3 First (a) through (g). The Board is composed of four divisions each having jurisdiction over different employees and whose proceedings are independent of one another, 3 First (h). Disputes between an employee or group of employees and a carrier or carriers growing out of grievances or out of the interpretation or application of agreements must be handle in the usual manner up to and including the chief operating officers of the carrier designated to handle such disputes, but failing adjustment the disputes may be referred by the parties or by either party to the appropriate division, 3 First (i). Upon failure of a division to agree upon an award because of a deadlock or inability to secure a majority vote of the division members, the division must appoint a neutral referee to sit with the division as a member thereof and make an award, 3 First (l). Awards are final and binding except insofar as they contain a money award; in case of dispute involving an interpretation of the award either party may request the division to interpret the award in the light of the dispute, 3 First (m). In case of an award favorable to the petitioner, the division shall make an order, directed to the carrier, to make the award effective \n\n[360 \nU.S. 601, 613]\n\u00a0\n and if the payment of money is required to pay such sum to the employee, 3 First (o). If the carrier does not comply with an order, enforcement may be sought by a suit in a District Court of the United States as provided in 3 First (p).\n\nThe labor spokesman for the proposal made it crystal clear that an essential feature of the proposal was that Board awards on grievances submitted by or on behalf of employees were to be final and binding upon the affected employees. The employees were willing to give up their remedies outside of the statute provided that a workable and binding statutory scheme was established to settle grievances. Mr. George Harrison, President of the Brotherhood of Railroad Clerks, stated: \"Grievances come about because the men file them themselves. Railroads don't institute grievances. Grievances are instituted against railroad officers' actions, and we are willing to take our chances with this national board because we believe, out of our experience, that the national board is the best and most efficient method of getting a determination of these many controversies . . . .\" Hearings before the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce on S. 3266, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 33. \"[W]e are now ready to concede that we can risk having our grievances go to a board and get them determined . . . [but] if we are going to get a hodgepodge arrangement by law, rather than what is suggested by this bill, then we don't want to give up that right, because we only give up the right because we feel that we will get a measure of justice by this machinery that we suggest here.\" Id., at 35. Mr. Eastman echoed this thought: \"decisions of the adjustment board . . . are made final and binding by the terms of this act, and as I understand it, the labor organizations, none of them, are objecting to that provision. They have their day in court and they have their members on the adjustment board, and if an agreement cannot be reached between the parties \n\n[360 \nU.S. 601, 614]\n\u00a0\n representing both sides on the adjustment board, a neutral man steps in and renders the decision, and they will be required to accept that decision when made . . . .\" Hearings before House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce on H. R. 7650, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 59. See also id., at 58-65.\n\nThus the employees considered that their interests would be best served by a workable statutory scheme providing for the final settlement of grievances by a tribunal composed of people experienced in the railroad industry. The employees' representatives made it clear that, if such a statutory scheme were provided, the employees would accept the awards as to disputes processed through the scheme as final settlements of those disputes which were not to be raised again.\n\nDespite the conclusion compelled by the over-all scheme of the Railway Labor Act and its legislative history, it is suggested that because an enforcement proceeding against a noncomplying carrier under 3 First (p) affords the defeated carrier some opportunity to relitigate the issues decided by the Adjustment Board,\n12\n unfairness results if \n\n[360 \nU.S. 601, 615]\n\u00a0\n 3 First (m) is construed so as to deny the employee the right to maintain this common-law action. We are referred to the emphasis upon the consideration of avoiding unfairness expressed in United States v. Interstate Commerce Comm'n, \n337 \nU.S. 426\n, which held that a denial by the Interstate Commerce Commission of a claim of a shipper for money reparations is reviewable in the federal courts, pointing out that a Commission award favorable to a shipper was not final and binding upon the railroad. But that holding rested upon an interpretation of 28 U.S.C. (1946 ed.) 41 (28) providing that \"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction . . . Of cases brought to enjoin, set aside, annul, or suspend in whole or in part any order of the Interstate Commerce Commission.\" (Italics supplied.) In contrast, 3 First (m) here involved commands that the Adjustment Board's \"awards shall be final and binding upon both parties to the dispute, except insofar as they shall contain a money award.\" The Adjustment Board's award in controversy denied respondent's claim for reinstatement and back pay, which, we have said, was not a \"money award.\" Although the provisions for enforcement of money awards in the Railway Labor Act, 3 First (o) and (p), establish procedures similar to those under 49 U.S.C. 16 (1) and (2) for enforcement of reparations orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission, 3 First (m) with which we are here concerned has no counterpart in the Interstate Commerce Act. The disparity in judicial review of Adjustment Board orders, if it can be said to be unfair at all, was explicitly created \n\n[360 \nU.S. 601, 616]\n\u00a0\n by Congress, and it is for Congress to say whether it ought be removed.\n\nPlainly the statutory scheme as revised by the 1934 amendments was designed for effective and final decision of grievances which arise daily, principally as matters of the administration and application of the provisions of collective bargaining agreements. This grist of labor relations is such that the statutory scheme cannot realistically be squared with the contention that Congress did not purpose to foreclose litigation in the courts over grievances submitted to and disposed of by the Board, past the action under 3 First (p) authorized against the noncomplying carrier, see Washington Terminal Co. v. Boswell, 75 U.S. App. D.C. 1, 124 F.2d 235, aff'd by an equally divided Court, \n319 \nU.S. 732\n, or the review sought of an award claimed to result from a denial of due process of law, see Ellerd v. Southern Pacific R. Co., 241 F.2d 541; Barnett v. Pennsylvania-Reading Seashore Lines, 245 F.2d 579, 582. So far as appears, all of the Courts of Appeals\n13\n and District Courts\n14\n which have \n\n[360 \nU.S. 601, 617]\n\u00a0\n dealt with this problem have reached the conclusion we reach here. To say that the discharged employee may litigate the validity of his discharge in a common-law action for damages after failing to sustain his grievance before the Board is to say that Congress planned that the Board should function only to render advisory opinions, and intended the Act's entire scheme for the settlement of grievances to be regarded \"as wholly conciliatory in character, involving no element of legal effectiveness, with the consequence that the parties are entirely free to accept or ignore the Board's decision . . . [a contention] inconsistent with the Act's terms, purposes and legislative history.\" Elgin, J. & E. R. Co. v. Burley, \n325 \nU.S. 711, 720\n-721.\n\nWe therefore hold that the respondent's submission to the Board of his grievances as to the validity of his discharge precludes him from seeking damages in the instant common-law action.\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to affirm the judgment of the District Court.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 3 First (i) of the Railway Labor Act, 48 Stat. 1191, 45 U.S.C. 153 First (i), provides:\n\n\"The disputes between an employee or group of employees and a carrier or carriers growing out of grievances or out of the interpretation or application of agreements concerning rates of pay, rules, or working conditions, including cases pending and unadjusted on June 21, 1934, shall be handled in the usual manner up to and including the chief operating officer of the carrier designated to handle such disputes; but, failing to reach an adjustment in this manner, the disputes may be referred by petition of the parties or by either party to the appropriate division of the Adjustment Board with a full statement of the facts and all supporting data bearing upon the disputes.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] It is conceded that respondent authorized the Brotherhood to bring his claim before the Adjustment Board. Compare Elgin, J. & E. R. Co. v. Burley, \n325 \nU.S. 711\n, aff'd on rehearing, \n327 \nU.S. 661\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The pertinent excerpts from the findings are the following:\n\n\"If the carrier is to have efficient operations on its railroad, employees must be relied on to obey operating instructions and orders. Claimant was found to have wilfully disobeyed his orders. This was insubordination and merited discipline.\n\n\n\"The employee . . . seeks complete vindication on the grounds that he was denied the investigation provided by the rules of agreement. Thus, the only question for review is whether there was substantial compliance with the investigation rule.\n\n\n\"Basically, the complaint is that the hearing was held when the claimant was not present.\n\n   .  .  .   .\n\n\n\n\". . . The right of the employee to be heard before being disciplined is a personal right which he can waive by action, inaction, or failure to act in good faith. . . .\n\n\n\". . . his position here would have been strengthened had he personally appeared at all stages of the proceeding to labor as best \n\n[360 \nU.S. 601, 605]\n\u00a0\n he could to preserve his record and to get his story to us first hand. All that the transcript reflects does claimant no credit, but leaves us with the feeling that the things of which he now complains were planned by him that way.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Garrison, The National Railroad Adjustment Board: A Unique Administrative Agency, 46 Yale L. J. 567, 584, describes the awards of the First Division of the National Adjustment Board as follows:\n\n\"It will be noted that, except for the purely jurisdictional recitals, the findings consist of a single sentence (`The evidence indicates that the movements made did not constitute switching under Article I-R') which constitutes the nub of the whole decision. Rarely does this central finding consist of more than a sentence or two. To a lay reader the sentence quoted above is meaningless. In order that it may be more intelligible the findings in their printed form are preceded by the employees' statement of facts taken from their submission, and a statement of their position (likewise extracted from the submission), followed by the management's statement of facts \n\n[360 \nU.S. 601, 607]\n\u00a0\n and a statement of its position derived similarly from its submission. From these rival statements it is not easy to determine what the controversy is about, but it is not easy to determine from the laconic findings the real basis upon which the decision was reached.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] In an interpretation announced on November 26, 1958, sought by the railroad under 3 First (m) of the Railway Labor Act, the Board declared that its award reflected its conclusion that the railroad was justified in discharging respondent. This interpretation was not before the Court of Appeals in this case, and we refer to it only as further substantiation of our conclusion based on the record in the case.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Since respondent, instead of bringing his claim in court as was his right under Moore v. Illinois Central R. Co., \n312 \nU.S. 630\n, chose to pursue that claim before the Adjustment Board, he does not even argue that a holding that the Railway Labor Act precludes a relitigation of that claim in the courts would deprive him of any constitutional right to a jury trial.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] 48 Stat. 1191-1192, 45 U.S.C. 153 First (m). That section provides:\n\n\"The awards of the several divisions of the Adjustment Board shall be stated in writing. A copy of the awards shall be furnished to the respective parties to the controversy, and the awards shall be final and binding upon both parties to the dispute, except insofar as they shall contain a money award. In case a dispute arises involving an interpretation of the award the division of the Board upon request of either party shall interpret the award in the light of the dispute.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Despite the clear import of the statutory language and the legislative history the respondent argues that this Court's holding in Moore v. Illinois R. Co., \n312 \nU.S. 630\n, requires us to hold that the instant suit is not precluded. However, the holding in Moore was simply that a common-law remedy for damages might be pursued by a discharged employee who did not resort to the statutory remedy before the Board to challenge the validity of his dismissal. A different question arises here where the employee obtained a determination from the Board, and, having lost, is seeking to relitigate in the courts the same issue as to the validity of his discharge.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] See Hearings before the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce on S. 3266, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 15. The Chairman of the United States Board of Mediation described 3 First of the 1926 Act as follows: \"The provision in the present 1926. act for adjustment boards is in practice about as near a fool provision as anything could possibly be. I mean this - that on the face of it they shall, by agreement, do so and so. Well, you can do pretty nearly anything by agreement, but how can you get them to agree?\" Hearings before the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce on S. 3266, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 137.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Provision for judicial enforcement of awards against employees was thought to be unnecessary since grievances are usually asserted by employees challenging some action by the carrier, and if the grievance is not sustained by the Board, the award simply denies the claim and requires no affirmative action by the employee. If an \n\n[360 \nU.S. 601, 612]\n\u00a0\n unfavorable award results in a strike the carrier may obtain injunctive relief. Railroad Trainmen v. Chicago River & I. R.

D. Mo.).\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE BLACK concur, dissenting.\n\nThe basic question in this case is the one reserved in Elgin, J. & E. R. Co. v. Burley, \n325 \nU.S. 711, 719\n, 720. It is whether an award that denies a claim for money damages comes within the exception of 3 First (m) of the Railway Labor Act which provides that \"the awards shall be final and binding upon both parties to the dispute, except insofar as they shall contain a money award.\"\n\nIt was pointed out in the dissent in that case (\n325 \nU.S., at 760\n-761) that the provision for finality of these awards \n\n[360 \nU.S. 601, 618]\n\u00a0\n was close in origin to the reparation orders under the Interstate Commerce Act.\n\n\"Since both Acts came out of the same Congressional Committees one finds, naturally enough, that the provisions for enforcement and review of the Adjustment Board's awards were based on those for reparation orders by the Interstate Commerce Commission. Compare Railway Labor Act, 3, First (p) with Interstate Commerce Act, as amended by 5 of the Hepburn Act, 34 Stat. 584, 590, 49 U.S.C. 16 (1), (2). If a carrier fails to comply with a reparation order, as is true of non-compliance with an Adjustment Board award, the complainant may sue in court for enforcement; the Commission's order and findings and evidence then become prima facie evidence of the facts stated. But a denial of a money claim by the Interstate Commerce Commission bars the door to redress in the courts. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Brady, \n288 \nU.S. 448\n; I. C. C. v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 385, 388\n; Terminal Warehouse v. Pennsylvania R. Co., \n297 \nU.S. 500, 507\n.\"\n\n\n Since the decision in the Burley case the situation described in the dissenting opinion has changed. Subsequently, United States v. Interstate Commerce Comm'n, \n337 \nU.S. 426\n, was decided; and it held, contrary to earlier precedents cited in the dissent in the Burley case, that orders in reparations cases which denied the claims of shippers were reviewable in the federal courts. It pointed out that the \"negative order\" doctrine, which we abandoned in Rochester Tel. Corp. v. United States, \n307 \nU.S. 125\n, had greatly influenced those prior decisions.\n\nWe refused to follow that discarded doctrine there; and it should find no place here. An award of no damages is, as I see it, as much a \"money award\" as an award of 6 cents. The words \"money award\" are descriptive of the \n\n[360 \nU.S. 601, 619]\n\u00a0\n nature of the claim, setting that class apart from other suits which involve, for example, a declaration of seniority rights.\n\nTolerance of judicial review has been more and more the rule as against the claim of administrative finality.\n1\n See Shields v. Utah Idaho R. Co., \n305 \nU.S. 177, 183\n; Stark v. Wickard, \n321 \nU.S. 288, 309\n-310; Harmon v. Brucker, \n355 \nU.S. 579, 581\n-582; Leedom v. Kyne, \n358 \nU.S. 184, 190\n. The weight of the Administrative Procedure Act, 60 Stat. 243, 5 U.S.C. 1009, is on the side of judicial review, the finality of administrative action being sanctioned only where it is clear from the statutory scheme that judicial review is precluded.\n\nRespondent argues that it would be grossly unfair to construe 3 First (m) so as to deny judicial review to a defeated employee but not to a defeated railroad. That would indeed be the result if an employee asserting a money claim cannot get court review if he loses, while the employer can obtain it if the employee wins. It is difficult for me to believe that Congress designed and approved such a lopsided, preferential system. No rhyme or reason is apparent for such discrimination. The attempt throughout was to equalize the advantages of the contending parties, not to prefer the employer who had long been dominant. Washington Terminal Co. v. Boswell, 75 U.S. App. D.C. 1, 6-7, 124 F.2d 235, 240-241. Some have said that an award denying payment cannot be a \"money award\" in the intendment of the Act. Berryman v. Pullman Co., 48 F. Supp. 542. But that is a narrow reading, not in keeping with the harmony of the Act. I would read 3 First (m) so as not to preclude judicial \n\n[360 \nU.S. 601, 620]\n\u00a0\n review in any suit for \"money awards\" no matter which party wins.\n\nIt is true that the Act does not provide the method of review in a case of this kind. Section 3 First (p) only covers the case where an award has been granted an employee and the carrier \"does not comply.\" In that case the order of the Board \"shall be prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated.\" 3 First (p). But this action is properly maintainable if the District Court otherwise has jurisdiction. No question of election of remedies is involved because of the express provision in the Act that the award of the Board is not final. Since there is no provision in the Act that specifies what judicial review may be obtained, there are preserved whatever judicial remedies are available. One of those is a suit for damages for wrongful discharge. In three separate decisions we have said that actions for wrongful discharge can be maintained in the courts by the employee. Moore v. Illinois Central R. Co., \n312 \nU.S. 630\n; Slocum v. Delaware, L. & W. R. Co., \n339 \nU.S. 239, 244\n; Transcontinental Air v. Koppal, \n345 \nU.S. 653, 661\n. We stated in the Slocum case that \"A common-law or statutory action for wrongful discharge differs from any remedy which the Board has power to provide . . . .\" The Board has power to reinstate the discharged employee and award back pay; and that was the relief which this employee sought before the Board. But the common-law action for wrongful discharge may include other items of damages as well. Here the employee claimed not only lost earnings but future earnings, seniority rights, retirement rights, hospitalization rights, and transportation rights. Whether Nevada law that governs this contract would grant as much is not now important. The point is that the measure of the recovery in a suit for damages is not necessarily the same and may in fact be greater, including an \n\n[360 \nU.S. 601, 621]\n\u00a0\n award of attorney fees.\n2\n It is difficult to believe that this cause of action triable before a jury is lost, wiped out, or abolished merely because the employee loses out when he pursues the lesser or more restrictive remedy before the Board. If there is to be equality between employer and employee in the assertion of rights and the assumption of duties under the Act, the employee cannot be held to have merely one chance if he proceeds before the Board, while the employer has a remedy first before the Board and, if he loses there, another one before the court.\n\nIn my view the Court's contrary reading of 3 raises questions of constitutional magnitude. For if an employee is to be denied any review of the Board's decision when the railroad prevails, while the latter can obtain judicial review with a jury trial before complying with a Board order, there would appear to be an unjustifiable discrimination in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. It is not the usual practice in this country to permit one party to a lawsuit two chances to prevail, while the other has only one, nor to permit one party but not the other to get a jury determination of his case. See Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Day, ante, p. 554 (dissent).\n\nThe result is that I would remand the case to the District Court for trial.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Cases like Switchmen's Union v. Mediation Board, \n320 \nU.S. 297\n, and General Committee v. M-K-T R. Co., \n320 \nU.S. 323\n, are no true exception, for those cases involved mediation, not adjudication - mediation being \"the antithesis of justiciability.\" \n320 \nU.S., at 337\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See, e. g., Wis.

Though such special equipment was used and the usual precautions were taken, one of these employees died of carbon tetrachloride poisoning. His administratrix brought this action for damages against the owners of the pilot boat in a federal district court, basing jurisdiction on diversity of citizenship. Under instructions that either unseaworthiness of the vessel or negligence would render the defendants liable and that contributory negligence on the part of the decedent would serve only to mitigate damages, a jury returned a general verdict for the administratrix, and judgment was entered thereon.

Slade, Leavenworth Colby and Seymour Farber filed a brief for the United States, as amicus curiae, urging reversal.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe administratrix of the estate of Walter J. Halecki brought this action against the owners of the pilot boat New Jersey to recover damages for Halecki's death, allegedly caused by inhalation of carbon tetrachloride fumes while working aboard that vessel. The action, based upon the New Jersey Wrongful Death Act, N. J. Stat. Ann. 2A:31-1, was brought in the federal court by reason of diversity of citizenship. Under instructions that either unseaworthiness of the vessel or negligence would render the defendants liable and that contributory negligence on the part of the decedent would serve only to mitigate damages, a jury returned a verdict for the administratrix, upon which judgment was entered. The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the New Jersey Wrongful Death Act incorporates liability for unseaworthiness, as developed by federal law, and adopts the admiralty rule of comparative negligence when death occurs as a \n\n[358 \nU.S. 613, 615]\n\u00a0\n result of tortious conduct upon the navigable waters of that State. 251 F.2d 708.\n\nFor the reasons stated in The Tungus v. Skovgaard, decided today, ante, p. 588, we hold that the Court of Appeals was correct in viewing its basic task as one of interpreting the law of New Jersey. For reasons also stated in Tungus, we accept in this case the Court of Appeals' determination of the effect which New Jersey law would accord to the decedent's contributory negligence. But even if the Wrongful Death Act of New Jersey be interpreted as importing the federal maritime law of unseaworthiness, the court was in error in holding that the circumstances of this case were such as to impose liability under that doctrine.\n\nThe essential facts are not in dispute. In September of 1951 the vessel was brought to Jersey City, New Jersey, for its annual overhaul at the shipyard of Rodermond Industries, Inc. One of the jobs to be done was the dismantling and overhaul of the ship's generators, requiring, among other things, that they be sprayed with carbon tetrachloride. Since Rodermond Industries was not equipped to do electrical work, this job was subcontracted to K. & S. Electrical Company, Halecki's employer.\n\nThe generators were in the ship's engine room, and both Halecki and his foreman, Donald Doidge, were aware of the necessity of taking special precautions in undertaking the job of spraying them with tetrachloride, a toxic compound.\n1\n They arranged to do the work on Saturday, \n\n[358 \nU.S. 613, 616]\n\u00a0\n a day chosen because, as Doidge testified, \"[W]e know it has to be done when there is nobody else on board ship.\"\n\nHalecki and Doidge came aboard on the appointed day, equipped with gas masks. They found only a watchman, to whom they gave instructions not to permit anyone to enter the engine room. Before starting the job they rigged an air hose underneath the generators to blow the fumes away from the man spraying. A high-compression blower was placed so that it would exhaust foul air through one of the two open doorways. These pieces of equipment belonged to Rodermond Industries and had been brought aboard by Doidge and Halecki the previous day. Together with the engine room's regular ventilating system, the air hoses and blower were operated by electrical power supplied from the dock. Halecki did most of the spraying, working for 10- or 15-minute periods with intervening rests of equal length. The ventilating equipment was in operation, and Halecki wore a gas mask during the entire period that he worked. He became sick the next day and died two weeks later of carbon tetrachloride poisoning.\n\nThe eventful development of the doctrine of unseaworthiness in this Court is familiar history. Although of dubious ancestry,\n2\n the doctrine was born with The Osceola\n3\n and emerged full-blown 40 years later in Mahnich v. Southern S. S. Co.\n4\n as an absolute and nondelegable duty which the owner of a vessel owes to the members of the crew who man her. The justification for this rigid standard was clearly stated in the Court's opinion in Mahnich:\n\n\"He [the seaman] is subject to the rigorous discipline of the sea, and all the conditions of his service \n\n[358 \nU.S. 613, 617]\n\u00a0\n constrain him to accept, without critical examination and without protest, working conditions and appliances as commanded by his superior officers.\" \n321 \nU.S. 96\n, at 103.\n\n\n With the nature of the duty thus defined, it remained for two other decisions of the Court to amplify its scope. Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki and Pope & Talbot v. Hawn\n5\n made clear that the shipowner could not escape liability for unseaworthiness by delegating to others work traditionally done by members of the crew. Whether their calling be labeled \"stevedore,\" \"carpenter,\" or something else, those who did the \"type of work\" traditionally done by seamen, and were thus related to the ship in the same way as seamen \"who had been or who were about to go on a voyage,\" were entitled to a seaworthy ship. See \n346 \nU.S., at 413\n.\n\nNeither these decisions nor the policy that underlies them can justify extension of liability for unseaworthiness to the decedent in the present case. The work that he did was in no way \"the type of work\" traditionally done by the ship's crew. It was work that could not even be performed upon a ship ready for sea, but only when the ship was \"dead\" with its generators dismantled. Moreover, it was the work of a specialist, requiring special skill and special equipment - portable blowers, air hoses, gas masks, and tanks of carbon tetrachloride, all brought aboard the vessel for this special purpose, and none connected with a ship's seagoing operations.\n6\n Indeed, the work was so specialized that the repair yard engaged to overhaul the vessel was not itself equipped to perform it, \n\n[358 \nU.S. 613, 618]\n\u00a0\n but had to enlist the services of a subcontractor. A measure of how foreign was the decedent's work to that ordinarily performed by the ship's crew is that it could be performed only at a time when all the members of the crew were off the ship.\n\nIt avails nothing to say that the decedent was an \"electrician,\" and that many modern ships carry electricians in their crew. Pope & Talbot v. Hawn explicitly teaches that such labels in this domain are meaningless. See \n346 \nU.S., at 413\n. It is scarcely more helpful to indulge in the euphemism that the decedent was \"cleaning\" part of the ship, and to say that it is a traditional duty of seamen to keep their ship clean. The basic fact is, in the apt words of Judge Lumbard's dissenting opinion in the Court of Appeals, that the decedent \"was not doing what any crew member had ever done on this ship or anywhere else in the world so far as we are informed.\" 251 F.2d 708, at 715. To extend liability for unseaworthiness to the decedent here would distort the law of Mahnich, of Hawn and of Sieracki beyond recognition. We therefore hold that it was error to instruct the jury that the shipowner could be held liable in this case even if they should find that the shipowner had exercised reasonable care.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nAs to the claim based upon negligence, for which the New Jersey Wrongful Death Act clearly gives a right of action,\n8\n we agree with the Court of Appeals that \"the evidence created an issue that could be decided only by a verdict.\" The defendants owed a duty of exercising reasonable \n\n[358 \nU.S. 613, 619]\n\u00a0\n care for the safety of the decedent. They were charged with knowledge that carbon tetrachloride was to be used in the confined spaces of the engine room. It was for the triers of fact to determine whether the defendants were responsibly negligent in permitting or authorizing the method or manner of its use.\n\nIt follows from what has been said that a new trial will be required, for there is no way to know that the invalid claim of unseaworthiness was not the sole basis for the verdict.\n\n    Vacated and remanded.\n\n\n [For concurring opinion of MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, see ante, p. 597.]\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Carbon tetrachloride, a somewhat volatile compound five times heavier than air, is toxic to humans if present in the atmosphere in concentrations of more than 100 parts to 1,000,000. It therefore is essential when working with this chemical to provide adequate ventilation, a task that is complicated because the density of the compound may result in a high concentration of the fumes in the lower portions of an enclosed area.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See Gilmore and Black, The Law of Admiralty, p. 316.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] \n189 \nU.S. 158, 175\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] \n321 \nU.S. 96\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] \n328 \nU.S. 85\n and \n346 \nU.S. 406\n.

J. Stat. Ann. 2A: 31-1; see The Tungus v. Skovgaard, ante, p. 588.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE BLACK, and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS join, dissenting.\n\nOn September 29, 1951, the pilot boat New Jersey was standing at a pier in the Jersey City repair yard of a marine overhaul and repair firm for its annual overhaul. The overhaul job was scheduled to take three weeks, and the 29th was the Saturday after the first week of work. Crew members participated in maintenance work on the vessel during this period, on a five-day-work-week basis. Cleaning the vessel's generators was the work scheduled for the 29th, and since the cleaning work was to be done with carbon tetrachloride, known to have toxic properties, a Saturday was chosen for the job to minimize the number of persons aboard the vessel. Walter Halecki, respondent's decedent, was an employee of an electrical firm doing the cleaning job as a subcontractor to the general overhaul contractor; he and another employee of the subcontractor came aboard and spent the day spraying the generators in the ship's engine room. Halecki did most of the work in the engine room. The men wore gas masks \n\n[358 \nU.S. 613, 620]\n\u00a0\n and from time to time rest periods above decks were observed. At the end of the day, Halecki complained of an odd taste in his mouth, and he was thereafter admitted to a hospital where he died of carbon tetrachloride poisoning.\n\nHis widow commenced this action against the vessel's owners in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York, predicating jurisdiction on diversity of citizenship. The complaint alleged unseaworthiness of the vessel in that harmful concentrations of carbon tetrachloride were allowed to stand in the engine room, unremoved either by the vessel's ordinary ventilation system or by auxiliary equipment brought aboard the vessel by the workmen for the purpose. It further alleged negligence in the failure to use reasonable care in furnishing the decedent, as a business invitee, a safe place to work. The New Jersey Wrongful Death Act was pleaded by the plaintiff to support these claims. The case went to the jury on both grounds, and a general verdict was returned for the plaintiff; judgment thereon was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.\n\nThe Court today reverses, holding that the verdict, which must of course be supportable on each aspect in which the case was left to the jury, cannot be supported on the grounds of unseaworthiness. The Court, following its decision in The Tungus v. Skovgaard, ante, p. 588, holds that the basic source of law in this case, since it is a wrongful death case, is the law of New Jersey. My separate opinion in that case sets forth the basis on which I think that that holding is erroneous. The Court in the present case holds, apparently as a matter of federal law, that the vessel did not owe any duty of seaworthiness to the respondent's decedent. Paradox may be found in this after the Court's characterization of the governing law as state law, and there well may be confusion as to the precise role that federal law is to play in these maritime death \n\n[358 \nU.S. 613, 621]\n\u00a0\n actions as a result of the Court's holding.\n1\n But in any event, since I view the unseaworthiness question as a matter of federal law, as apparently the Court does here, I shall set forth briefly the grounds on which I think it has clearly erred in the light of the decisions in Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, \n328 \nU.S. 85\n; Pope & Talbot, Inc., v. Hawn, \n346 \nU.S. 406\n, and Alaska S. S. Co. v. Petterson, \n347 \nU.S. 396\n, none of which the Court today purports to overrule.\n\nIn Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, the question was whether the duty of maintaining a seaworthy vessel extended to persons who performed the ship's service aboard the vessel but who were not employed directly by the shipowner. The Court concluded that this duty was \"not confined to seamen who perform the ship's service under immediate hire to the owner, but extends to those who render it with his consent or by his arrangement.\" \n328 \nU.S., at 95\n. The Court declared that the \"liability arises as an incident, not merely of the seaman's contract, but of performing the ship's service with the owner's consent.\" Id., at 97. The Court quoted with specific approval the language of the court below in that case: \"when a man is performing a function essential to maritime service on board a ship the fortuitous circumstances \n\n[358 \nU.S. 613, 622]\n\u00a0\n of his employment by the shipowner or a stevedoring contractor should not determine the measure of his rights.\" Ibid. The Court stressed that the division of labor due to increased specialization did not operate to diminish the scope of the duty of maintaining a seaworthy vessel. The shipowner, it was said, \"is at liberty to conduct his business by securing the advantages of specialization in labor and skill brought about by modern divisions of labor. He is not at liberty by doing this to discard his traditional responsibilities.\" Id., at 100.\n\nIn Pope & Talbot, Inc., v. Hawn, the Sieracki doctrine was reaffirmed and applied in another fact situation, and it was pointed out that the protection of a shipboard worker by the duty of seaworthiness was not based on the title of the position he occupied in the doing of the shipboard work but \"on the type of work he did and its relationship to the ship and to the historic doctrine of seaworthiness.\" \n346 \nU.S., at 413\n.\n\nToday the Court holds that not all workers engaged in doing \"ship's service\" aboard a vessel are entitled to the warranty. It essays distinctions as to whether the ship's power is functioning at the time of the accident, whether the ship is ready for an immediate voyage.\n2\n It stresses \n\n[358 \nU.S. 613, 623]\n\u00a0\n that the work done by Halecki was specialized work on a modern vessel, of a sort which is now habitually contracted out. But it takes only a casual reference to the principles of the Sieracki decision to be reminded that the fact that a worker is doing specialized work on a modern vessel under a contract is no reason for exempting him from the scope of the seaworthiness duty's \"humanitarian policy,\" \n328 \nU.S., at 95\n; it is rather one of the very bases on which the Sieracki doctrine was bottomed. The Court refers to the extensive specialized equipment the contractor was required to bring aboard, but in Petterson this was, over dissent, rejected as a basis for distinction of Sieracki, \n347 \nU.S. 396, 400\n. Nor would one think that the fact that the work being done posed dangers to a degree which made it desirable that the crew members not be present aboard the vessel militated against the existence of the seaworthiness duty. The duty was held in Sieracki to extend to others than members of the crew precisely to avoid the consequence that the shipowner would escape his responsibilities by contracting out dangerous work.\n\nThe Court declines to find that Halecki was engaged in ship's service of a sort that would entitle him to the warranty because the precise sort of work he was doing is one which is habitually contracted out. It rejects clear categorical analogies between Halecki's work and that historically done by crew members, with the observation that the work Halecki was doing was different because the vessel was modern, had complicated equipment, and required specialized treatment efficiently to perform the work on it. Thus the whole point of the Sieracki decision is turned around, and today's shipowner escapes his absolute duty because his vessel is modern and outfitted with complicated and dangerous equipment, and because a pattern of contracting out a sort of work on it has become established. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 613, 624]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Court gives no reason based in policy for its inversion of the Sieracki principle. I fear also that it gives no workable guide to the lower courts in this actively litigated field of federal law. They may now have the impression that some degree of specialization in the tasks performed by the injured shipboard worker disqualifies him from the scope of the shipowner's duty, but, further than that, there is left uncertain the extent to which the decisions of the lower courts based on the Sieracki and Hawn cases are now under a cloud.\n3\n And so confusion is left to breed further litigation in an already heavily litigated area of the law.\n\nI would adhere to the principles of Sieracki and Hawn and affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Further paradox may be found in the Court's acceptance, without independent examination, of the view of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit as to the defenses available under the New Jersey Wrongful Death Act as applicable to the negligence claim here. The Court of Appeals held contributory negligence unavailable as an absolute defense. The usual reasons given for deferring to the Courts of Appeals on state law questions may not be entirely applicable to a circuit not embracing the State in question. In the Tungus case, ante, p. 588, the Court today affirms a judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (which includes New Jersey) leaving open this identical issue for the District Court. It would appear clear, in the light of the Court's disposition of this case, what the answer on this issue must be in the Tungus case.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] A brief filed as amicus curiae by the United States urges that the doctrine of seaworthiness imports only a warranty of seaworthiness for a voyage, and that since the ship was not about to engage in a voyage, the duty was owed to no one at the time of the accident. This theory, like the Court's would result in an unwarranted restriction of the Sieracki doctrine, particularly since there were crew members working aboard ship on a regular work week basis during the period in question who would be denied the doctrine's protection under the Government's theory. The Government's argument is based primarily on Desper v. Starved Rock Ferry Co., \n342 \nU.S. 187\n, where there was no issue of unseaworthiness and the vessels had been hauled up on land for the winter. In Rogers v. United States Lines, \n347 \nU.S. 984\n, the duty of seaworthiness was held to be present in regard to a vessel which had completed a voyage and which was not shown to be about to embark on a new voyage.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Cases in which holdings of the lower courts have interpreted this Court's decisions in the Sieracki and Hawn cases as extending the duty of seaworthiness to independent contractors' employees substantially similarly circumstanced to Halecki include Torres v. The Kastor, 227 F.2d 664 (C. A. 2d Cir.) (cleaning vessel of pitch to make it suitable for future voyages); Read v. United States, 201 F.2d 758 (C. A. 3d Cir.) (reconversion of Liberty Ship into troop carrier; worker engaged in converting deep tanks); Crawford v. Pope & Talbot, Inc., 206 F.2d 784 (C. A. 3d Cir.)

The lease contained a preamble stating that it was considered essential to retain the field in a stand-by status for use \"in connection with Naval Aviation activities\" and a substantive provision that \"this lease will at all times be revocable at will by the Government\" upon giving certain notice. Subsequently, the Army desired to use the land for an aerial defense missile site, and the Secretaries of the Army and Navy jointly served notice of revocation on the lessee. The lessee declined to leave the land, claiming that the lease could be revoked only when the land was needed for \"Naval Aviation activities.\" In order to obtain possession as soon as possible, the Government sued to condemn whatever possessory interest the lessee might be adjudicated to have; but the Government maintained that it had validly revoked the lease. Held:\n\n 1. The Government's right to revoke the lease was not restricted to occasions when it desired to use the land for aviation purposes, and the revocation was valid and effective.

On the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, \n\n[360 \nU.S. 328, 329]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Morton, Roger P. Marquis and S. Billingsley Hill.\n\nLeonard R. Hartenfeld argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was J. Herzl Segal.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe basic question presented in this case is whether the United States can have adjudicated under one complaint (1) the claim by a third person of a valuable possessory interest in government property and (2) condemnation and value of that interest, if any. In 1947 the United States leased an airfield to respondent Illinois Aircraft Services & Sales Co. The preamble to the lease stated that because of the strategic value of the field the Government considered it essential to retain it \"in a stand-by status for post-war use in connection with Naval Aviation activities . . . .\"\n1\n One paragraph of the lease provided:\n\n \"It is understood and agreed that this lease will at all times be revocable at will by the Government upon presentation of notice of cancellation to the Lessee, in writing, sixty (60) days prior to such termination, . . . in event of a national emergency and a decision by the Secretary of the Navy that such revocation is essential.\" \n\n[360 \nU.S. 328, 330]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n In 1954 the Army wanted to use the property for an aerial defense missile (NIKE) site. Timely notice of revocation was delivered to respondent under the signatures of the Secretaries of the Army and Navy, stating that a national emergency declared by the President in 1950 was still in effect and that both Secretaries deemed revocation of the lease essential. Respondent declined to leave the land, claiming that the Government had gone beyond the authority granted by the lease in attempting to revoke it for use by the Army rather than in connection with Naval Aviation activities mentioned in the preamble to the lease.\n\nIn order to obtain possession and use of the land as soon as possible - and without waiting to try out the validity of the prior revocation in a separate action or actions - the Government filed a complaint to condemn whatever possessory interest respondent might be adjudicated to have. Although the Government's complaint alleged that it had revoked the lease and, in effect, that respondent had no compensable interest in the property taken, the District Court ruled that by suing for condemnation the United States had \"elected\" to abandon its prior revocation. On this basis the court found that respondent had a compensable interest and let a jury determine its value. Under instructions that the lease was revocable only if needed for \"aviation purposes\" and that a NIKE site was not such a purpose, the jury returned a $25,000 verdict for respondents. On appeal the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed this verdict by a divided court. 258 F.2d 17. It held (1) that the doctrine of \"election of remedies\" applied and barred consideration of the revocation whether state or federal law governed and (2) that the lease could only be validly revoked under its terms if the Government planned to use the land for \"aviation purposes.\" To review the \n\n[360 \nU.S. 328, 331]\n\u00a0\n severe restrictions the court's holding places on the ability of the United States to get, quickly, land it may need for government purposes, we granted certiorari. \n358 \nU.S. 945\n.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nWe cannot agree that the lease permitted revocation only if the Government wanted the land for \"aviation purposes.\" It is true that the preamble to the agreement states that the airfield was leased, rather than sold, because it was needed in stand-by status for naval aviation activities. It is also true that immediately following the preamble there is a statement, common in many contracts, that \"Now Therefore, in consideration of the foregoing, and of the covenants hereinafter mentioned, the Government\" leases the airport. There is no indication, however, either in the lease itself or as far as we have been shown in the history of the agreement, that this preamble and the formal legal statement immediately following it meant to limit the express and unequivocal clause of the lease allowing revocation at the will of the Secretary of the Navy in the event of a national emergency. Instead the preamble can be easily understood, in view of the Surplus Property Act of 1944, which required all surplus property to be disposed of, as a mere statement of why the property was not considered surplus.\n3\n In addition the statute which authorized the airport lease provided that such leases shall be revocable \"at any time, unless the Secretary shall determine that the omission of such provision from the lease will promote the national defense or will be in the public interest. In \n\n[360 \nU.S. 328, 332]\n\u00a0\n any event each such lease shall be revocable by the Secretary . . . during a national emergency declared by the President.\"\n4\n Under the circumstances, we cannot and will not assume that an explicit revocation clause in the lease means any less than it seems to mean. We therefore hold that the revocation was valid and effective.\n\nIt follows necessarily from this that application of the doctrine of \"election of remedies\" would put the Government in an impossible situation. For under the doctrine, the Government must choose either to abandon its power to revoke the lease or to give up its right to immediate possession under condemnation law, a right which is not here questioned. We see no reason either in justice or authority why such a Hobson's choice should be imposed and why the Government should be forced to pay for property which it rightfully owns merely because it attempted to avoid delays which the applicable laws seek to prevent. Such a strict rule against combining different causes of action would certainly be out of harmony with modern legislation and rules designed to make trials as efficient, expeditious and inexpensive as fairness will permit.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nRespondents argue, however, that election of remedies is part of the law of Illinois and that Illinois law applies here. We cannot agree with this view. Condemnation involves essential governmental functions. See Kohl v. United States, \n91 \nU.S. 367\n. We have often held that where essential interests of the Federal Government \n\n[360 \nU.S. 328, 333]\n\u00a0\n are concerned, federal law rules unless Congress chooses to make state laws applicable.\n6\n It is apparent that no such choice has been made here.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The preamble reads:\n\n\"Whereas, because of its strategic value, it is considered essential that the said airfield and the facilities thereon, comprising the said United States Naval Outlying Airfield, be retained in a stand-by status for post-war use in connection with Naval Aviation activities; and\n\n\n .   .   .   .  .\n\n\"Whereas, the use of the airfield and facilities by the Lessee . . . will in no wise be detrimental to the present activities of the Navy Department, but is on the contrary deemed to be in the best interest of the Government.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The decision of the court below is also in apparent conflict with United States v.

See United States v. Miller, \n317 \nU.S. 369, 379\n-380 (citing 25 Stat. 94); Kanakanui v. United States, 244 F. 923; Nebraska v.

JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe Elkins Act, 32 Stat. 847, as amended, 49 U.S.C. 41, 43, and the Interstate Commerce Act, 24 Stat. 380, as amended, 49 U.S.C. 6 (7), make it unlawful for a common carrier to grant rebates to individual shippers by any device whatsoever, or to discriminate in favor of any shipper directly or indirectly. In 1941 the United States brought a complaint against appellees and several other major oil companies and their common carrier pipeline subsidiaries claiming that the pipelines were granting illegal transportation rebates to their shipper-owners under the guise of paying dividends. Although the Government charged that no dividends at all could lawfully be granted in the same year in which a shipper-owner sent products over a pipeline, the suit was settled in late 1941 by a consent decree containing a provision which allowed a shipper-owner to receive a dividend equal to \"its share of 7 percentum (7%) of the valuation\" of the common carrier pipeline's property. Any dividend \n\n[360 \nU.S. 19, 21]\n\u00a0\n in excess of this figure, however, was forbidden.\n1\n That provision of the decree is before us for interpretation today.\n\nFrom 1941 to 1957 appellees computed allowable dividends by taking 7% of the valuation of pipeline property and then giving each owner a proportion of this sum equal to the percentage of stock it owned. In 1957, however, the Government brought this suit against appellees claiming that the pipelines were giving, and the shipper-owners were receiving, dividends in excess of those allowed by the decree. The Government did not contest the valuation figures used, but argued, despite the language of the decree, that only a part of 7% of the valuation could actually be made available as dividends to stockholders. The total allowable \"dividends,\" it claimed, would have to be shared between stockholders and creditors. The stockholder's (shipper-owner's) \"share\" of the carrier valuation, so the argument ran, was to be the proportion which stock-investment in the carrier bore to the carrier's total invested capital (including debt owed to third persons). Seven percent stockholder-dividends could only be computed out of this \"share\" of the sum, and could then be distributed to each shipper-owner in proportion to its individual stock interest. Only in this way, the Government contended, could the consent decree's aim of preventing disguised rebates be accomplished. For only in this way would dividends be limited to a \"fair\" sum: 7% of the current value of what each owner had invested in its subsidiary. The trial court rejected the Government's interpretation, and the United States brought a direct appeal under 32 Stat. 823, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 29, 49 U.S.C. 45. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 19, 22]\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn consideration of the language and the history of this decree we agree with the trial court. If the decree had meant to limit dividends to 7% of the current value of a parent company's actual investment in a subsidiary, as the Government claims, one can hardly think of less appropriate language in which to couch the restriction. Admittedly, by reading the word \"share\" to refer to a proportion of total capitalization rather than to the percentage of stock owned by a parent company, the language can be made to support the United States' contention.\n2\n But that is surely a strained construction, and cannot be reconciled with the consistent reading given to the decree, by both the United States and appellees, from the date it was entered until 1957 - about 16 years.\n\nIn 1942, less than a year after the decree was issued, the United States consented to a supplemental order affecting one of the pipeline companies. This order approved a plan of recapitalization for the pipeline which would at least have been highly suspect under the reading the Government today gives the decree. Significantly the supplemental order, which was agreed to by the official who had represented the Government in drafting the original decree, expressly stated that the plan did not violate that judgment.\n\nThere are also other indications that the Government's interpretation of the decree did not, originally, differ from \n\n[360 \nU.S. 19, 23]\n\u00a0\n the one appellees urge today. For example, the 1941 decree required annual reports from each pipeline showing total earnings available to owners or stockholders and actual dividends paid. For 16 years the reports made by the pipelines indicated that the dividends were not computed on the basis of 7% of the current value of the owners' investment but on the total valuation of the carriers' properties. For that 16 years the Government accepted this interpretation without challenge. Yet today it renounces this long-standing acquiescence and claims that the decree imposed limits it had not previously sought to enforce.\n\nThe Government contends that the interpretation it now offers would more nearly effectuate \"the basic purpose of the Elkins and Interstate Commerce Acts that carriers are to treat all shippers alike.\" This may be true. But it does not warrant our substantially changing the terms of a decree to which the parties consented without any adjudication of the issues.\n3\n And we agree with the District Court that accepting the Government's present interpretation would do just that. Cf. Hughes v. United States, \n342 \nU.S. 353\n.\n\nWe do not decide the case on any question of laches or estoppel, nor do we comment on any possible modifications of the decree which might appropriately be made under Clause X of the judgment, which continues the jurisdiction of the District Court. We merely hold that where the language of a consent decree in its normal meaning supports an interpretation; where that interpretation has been adhered to over many years by all the parties, including those government officials who drew \n\n[360 \nU.S. 19, 24]\n\u00a0\n up and administered the decree from the start;\n4\n and where the trial court concludes that this interpretation is in fact the one the parties intended, we will not reject it simply because another reading might seem more consistent with the Government's reasons for entering into the agreement in the first place. Accordingly, the judgment below is\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE DOUGLAS dissents.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK and MR. JUSTICE HARLAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This consent decree is discussed in detail in Hearings, Antitrust Subcommittee of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 85th Cong., 1st Sess., Part I.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Assuming a carrier has an I.

On the Government's new interpretation instead, each shipper-owner's \"share\" would be one-tenth ($1,000,000\/$10,000,000) of 7% of $10,000,000 or $70,000, this being 7% of each one's actual investment of $1,000,000 in the company.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The consent decree reads: \"[A]ll parties hereto [have] severally consented to the entry of this final judgment herein without trial or adjudication of any issue of fact or law herein and without admission by any party in respect of any such issue and in final settlement of all claims herein in issue. . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Cf.

CO.(1959)\nNo. 285\nArgued: February 25, 1959Decided: April 27, 1959\n\n\n\n\n1. \nUnder the Suits in Admiralty Act, as amended, 46 U.S.C. 741 et seq., respondent filed a libel against the United States in a Federal District Court, alleging that the United States owed respondent $116,511.44 for cargo transported on one of respondent's ships; that respondent had presented a bill for that amount; and that the United States had failed and refused to pay $115,203.76 which was due and payable. The United States filed an answer admitting that respondent had submitted a claim for $116,511.44; denying that the United States had not paid $115,203.76; and further alleging that this sum had been \"paid\" by application against an indebtedness of respondent to the United States for additional charter hire. Respondent excepted on the ground that the defensive matter pleaded did not arise \"out of the same contract, cause of action or transaction for which the libel was filed,\" and moved that the excepted matter be stricken and that respondent be awarded \"judgment on the pleadings.\" This motion was granted and respondent was awarded a decree pro confesso. Held: This portion of the judgment is sustained.

Held: Insofar \n\n[359 \nU.S. 314, 315]\n\u00a0\n as this judgment awarded compound interest from the date of the decree until the date of satisfaction, it was improper and is reversed.

With him on the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Doub, Samuel D. Slade, Leavenworth Colby and Seymour Farber.\n\nClement C. Rinehart argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was Walter P. Hickey.\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe principal question presented in this case is whether in an action under the Suits in Admiralty Act, 41 Stat. 525, as amended, 46 U.S.C. 741 et seq., the United States may defend by pleading against the libelant a claim arising out of an unrelated transaction.\n\nIn 1953, the S. S. Steelworker, a ship belonging to the respondent, Isthmian Steamship Company (\"Isthmian\"), carried certain cargo for the United States. Isthmian submitted a bill of $116,511.44 for this service. The United States paid $1,307.68 but withheld the remaining $115,203.76. This sum was said to have been applied to an alleged indebtedness of Isthmian to the United States which was claimed to have arisen in 1946, when the United States, acting through the War Shipping Administration, chartered out to Isthmian eight vessels on a bare boat basis. Some disagreement arose over the amount of charter hire due and the United States asserted that Isthmian owed $115,203.76 for additional charter hire for the period from May 1, 1946, to July 31, 1948. The S. S. Steelworker was not one of the boats involved in the 1946 transaction. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 314, 316]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIsthmian filed a libel in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that the United States owed Isthmian $116,511.44 for cargo transported on the S. S. Steelworker; that Isthmian had presented a bill for that amount; and that the United States had failed and refused to pay $115,203.76 which was due and payable.\n1\n Isthmian made no reference whatsoever to the parties' dispute over additional charter hire for the 1946-1948 period.\n\nThe United States filed an answer admitting that Isthmian had submitted a claim for $116,511.44; denying that the United States had not paid $115,203.76; and further alleging that this sum had been \"paid\" by application against an indebtedness of Isthmian to the United States for additional charter hire. Shortly before this answer was filed, the United States filed a cross-libel against Isthmian seeking recovery of the additional charter hire of $115,203.76. After filing the answer, the United States moved to consolidate its cross-libel with the original libel on the ground that the additional charter-hire claim was dispositive of both libels.\n\nIsthmian excepted to the answer of the United States on the ground that the defensive matter pleaded therein did not arise \"out of the same contract, cause of action or transaction for which the libel was filed.\" Isthmian moved that the excepted matter be stricken and asked \"judgment on the pleadings.\" \n\n[359 \nU.S. 314, 317]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe District Court held that the answer setting forth the withholding and application of the $115,203.76 did not set forth a defense of payment but rather was a claim of setoff arising from a separate transaction.\n2\n The District Court then held that setoffs arising from distinct transactions could not be asserted in admiralty and sustained Isthmian's exceptions. Since there was no longer any common issue, consolidation of the libel and cross-libel was denied and Isthmian was awarded a decree pro confesso. 134 F. Supp. 854. The Government's cross-libel is still pending.\n\nThe District Court's final decree awarded interest at 4% per annum on $115,203.76 from the date of the filing of the libel to the day of decree. The District Court further ordered that interest at 4% should run from the date of the decree until it was paid. This second 4% was to be computed on a sum which included the basic recovery, the costs awarded and the interest which had run from the date of the libel to the date of the decree.\n\nOn appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed. 255 F.2d 816. The Court of Appeals relied on the authority of a case decided at the same time as the instant case, Grace Line, Inc., v. United States, 255 F.2d 810, wherein it was held that withholding and applying did not constitute \"payment,\" but, rather, setoff. Since the withholding and applying in the instant case did not arise out of the same transaction on which the libel was based, the Court of Appeals held it was not cognizable in admiralty. The award of interest was also upheld. We granted certiorari principally to consider the question posed at the outset of this opinion. \n358 \nU.S. 813\n. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 314, 318]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Government presses a threshold argument which, if accepted, would obviate the need to reach the question posed at the outset of this opinion. While admitting the correctness of Isthmian's bill, the Government claims that the bill has been \"paid\" and argues that the true nature of the dispute between the parties concerns charter hire despite the fact that Isthmian's libel does not mention the charter-hire dispute. We agree with the courts below that the Government's defense is not properly one of payment.\n\nThe Government relies upon the Act of March 3, 1817, 3 Stat. 366, which now appears in similar form as Section 305 of the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 24, 31 U.S.C. 71. This section provides that the General Accounting Office shall settle and adjust all claims and demands by or against the Government. This is said to mean that when the General Accounting Office administratively sets one claim off against another that is the same as payment. But recognizing the Government's long-standing power to set off is far different from finding that the Government's setoff is \"payment\" which enables the Government to plead in admiralty foreign and unrelated transactions. See United States v. Munsey Trust Co., \n332 \nU.S. 234, 239\n; McKnight v. United States, 13 Ct. Cl. 292, 306, affirmed, \n98 \nU.S. 179\n; Climatic Rainwear Co. v. United States, 115 Ct. Cl. 520, 88 F. Supp. 415, 418. In other situations, the claim of withholding and applying has traditionally been treated as setoff. Virginia-Carolina Chemical Co. v. Kirven, \n215 \nU.S. 252, 257\n-258; Merchants Heat & Light Co. v. Clow & Sons, \n204 \nU.S. 286, 289\n-290 (a recoupment case); Scammon v. Kimball, \n92 \nU.S. 362, 367\n; United States v. Eckford, 6 Wall. 484. See also 3 Williston, Contracts (rev. ed. 1936), 887E. In this context, \"payment\" connotes tender by the debtor with the intention to satisfy the debt \n\n[359 \nU.S. 314, 319]\n\u00a0\n coupled with its acceptance as satisfaction by the creditor. See Luckenbach v. McCahan Sugar Co., \n248 \nU.S. 139, 149\n; Bronson v. Rodes, 7 Wall. 229, 250; Sheehy v. Mandeville, 6 Cranch 253, 264; United States v. J. A. J. Const. Co., 137 F.2d 584, 586.\n\nTo consider withholding and applying the equivalent of \"payment\" would have strange consequences. In Grace Line, Inc., v. United States, supra, for example, the Government had a claim against the carrier which had become time-barred. The carrier performed some unrelated services for the United States and then brought suit to collect. The Government claimed that it had \"paid\" by withholding the money and applying it to the time-barred claim. Thus, the Government attempted to use its unique concept of \"payment\" to revive a totally unrelated time-barred claim.\n\nWe can understand the Government's desire to litigate all of its disputes with Isthmian in one lawsuit, but that is no warrant for abandoning the traditional meaning of the defense of payment.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nWe therefore reach the question posed at the outset. Section 3 of the Suits in Admiralty Act, 46 U.S.C. 743, provides that suits against the United States under \n\n[359 \nU.S. 314, 320]\n\u00a0\n the Act shall \"proceed and shall be heard and determined according to the principles of law and to the rules of practice obtaining in like cases between private parties.\" With this express command before us, we must ascertain whether admiralty practice permits private parties to defend by setting up claims arising out of separate and unrelated transactions between the parties.\n\nTraditionally, admiralty has narrowly circumscribed the filing of unrelated cross-libels and defenses. The first American case considering this problem appears to be Willard v. Dorr, 29 Fed. Cas. No. 17,680 (1823), in which Justice Story sitting as Circuit Justice refused to permit the attempted setoff. Since that early holding various reasons have been offered for refusal to entertain unrelated defenses: protection of the seaman's wage claims;\n4\n preservation of relatively simple proceedings not affecting third-party rights;\n5\n and the recognition that allowing cross-libels might deprive litigants of jury trials to which they would otherwise be entitled if the cross-libel were pressed in an independent proceeding.\n6\n But for whatever reason, the doctrine gained general acceptance.\n7\n\u00a0\n\n[359 \nU.S. 314, 321]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThis consistent pattern of the cases in admiralty on this point was reflected in the promulgation of Rule 54 of the Admiralty Rules by this Court at December Term, 1868, 7 Wall. v:\n\n \"Whenever a cross-libel is filed upon any counter claim arising out of the same cause of action for which the original libel was filed, the respondents in the cross-libel shall give security in the usual amount and form, to respond in damages as claimed in said cross-libel, unless the court on cause shown, shall otherwise direct; and all proceedings upon the original libel shall be stayed until such security shall be given.\"\n\n\n That rule has remained in the Admiralty Rules\n8\n ever since with only slight change and now appears as Rule 50 in the following form which still reflects the underlying settled state of the law:\n\n \"Whenever a cross-libel is filed upon any counter-claim arising out of the same contract or cause of action for which the original libel was filed, and the respondent or claimant in the original suit shall have given security to respond in damages, the respondent in the cross-libel shall give security in the usual amount and form to respond in damages to the claims \n\n[359 \nU.S. 314, 322]\n\u00a0\n set forth in said cross-libel, unless the court for cause shown, shall otherwise direct; and all proceedings on the original libel shall be stayed until such security be given unless the court otherwise directs.\"\n9\n\u00a0\n\n\n But the Government urges the Court in this particular case to apply the more flexible procedure utilized in civil cases in federal courts.\n10\n The Government contends that none of the reasons for limited cross-libels suggested above has any application to the particular facts of this case and that, moreover, the rule has become an anachronism and is out of line with the practice in specific courts\n11\n\u00a0\n\n[359 \nU.S. 314, 323]\n\u00a0\n and with the general rules of practice for federal courts.\n12\n But it should be observed that where the procedure has been changed in this regard it has been the result of legislation or rulemaking and not the decisional process.\n13\n\u00a0\n\nThe law on this point in admiralty has been settled beyond doubt in the lower courts for many years and an Admiralty Rule of this Court recognizes this case law. We think that if the law is to change it should be by rulemaking or legislation and not by decision.\n\nWhether the setoff and cross-libel procedure now operative in admiralty is anachronistic, is not a matter best considered by this Court in a litigation without the benefits which normally accompany intelligent rulemaking - including hearings and opportunities to submit data. In addition to this Court's responsibility for rulemaking, the Judicial Conference of the United States\n14\n has been given certain responsibilities in this area by the Act of July 11, 1958, 72 Stat. 356:\n\n \"The Conference shall also carry on a continuous study of the operation and effect of the general rules of practice and procedure now or hereafter in use as prescribed by the Supreme Court for the other courts of the United States pursuant to law. Such changes in and additions to those rules as the Conference may deem desirable to promote simplicity in procedure, fairness in administration, the just determination of litigation, and the elimination of unjustifiable expense and delay shall be recommended \n\n[359 \nU.S. 314, 324]\n\u00a0\n by the Conference from time to time to the Supreme Court for its consideration and adoption, modification or rejection, in accordance with law.\n\n\n The result in this case does not cause irreparable loss to the United States nor indeed require any expenditure of government funds prior to the complete disposition of all claims. The Government is authorized to withhold payment of Isthmian's judgment in this case to the extent the Government has claims outstanding against Isthmian.\n15\n The only requirement is that the Government press the libel now pending in the District Court. In other situations where no suit is pending, the United States may have to commence a separate suit rather than set up an unrelated defense in the original suit. This may be an inconvenience to the United States but it must be remembered that Congress has expressly declared that when sued under the Suits in Admiralty Act the United States is to have its procedural rights determined and governed in the same manner as private parties.\n\nThe Government also complains that the District Court improperly awarded compound interest. This resulted from the decree's direction that interest be computed at \n\n[359 \nU.S. 314, 325]\n\u00a0\n 4% from the filing of the libel until the entry of the decree, and that interest run at 4% from decree until satisfaction with this latter interest to be computed upon the entire decree including the interest up to decree.\n\nSection 3 of the Suits in Admiralty Act, 46 U.S.C. 743, provides:\n\n \"A decree against the United States . . . may include costs of suit, and when the decree is for a money judgment, interest at the rate of 4 per centum per annum until satisfied, or at any higher rate which shall be stipulated in any contract upon which such decree shall be based. Interest shall run as ordered by the court. . . .\"\n\n\n Congress' demonstrated concern with the problem of interest under the Suits in Admiralty Act indicates that it intended to cover these awards affirmatively and not have them controlled by the general command that the suit \"shall proceed and shall be heard and determined according to the principles of law\" applicable to private parties. Section 3 provides for but one award of interest in the decree and that award is limited to 4% until satisfaction. We find nothing in the rather ambiguous statute authorizing the accumulation of interest up to the decree and then a second independent award of interest which operates upon the first interest. Compound interest is not presumed to run against the United States. See Cherokee Nation v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 476, 490\n.\n\nThe judgment is affirmed as to entry of the decree pro confesso. The award of compound interest was improper and the judgment is reversed and remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n    It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Isthmian first attempted to recover the unpaid portion of the freight bill by a suit in the Court of Claims. The United States moved to dismiss that suit because Isthmian's claim was said to have been maritime in nature, thus giving the District Courts exclusive jurisdiction under the Suits in Admiralty Act, 46 U.S.C. 741 et seq. The Court of Claims dismissed Isthmian's suit. Isthmian Steamship Co. v. United States, 131 Ct. Cl. 472, 130 F.

None of the cases cited was brought under the Suits in Admiralty Act. The first two suits invoked the Tucker Act, now 28 U.S.C. 1346, while Wabash was brought in the Court of Claims. The controlling statutes contain express authority for entertaining unrelated setoffs. See n. 11, infra.

With him on the brief were Edward W. Mullinix, Josephine H. Klein and Lawrence J. McKay.\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nAppellees, Radio Corporation of America and National Broadcasting Company, are defendants in this civil antitrust action brought by the Government under 4 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 4. After holding a preliminary hearing on three of appellees' affirmative defenses to that action, the federal district judge dismissed the complaint. 158 F. Supp. 333. The Government appealed directly to this Court under the Expediting Act, 15 U.S.C. 29. The principal question presented is whether approval by the Federal Communications Commission of appellees' agreement to exchange their Cleveland television station for one in Philadelphia bars this independent action by the Government which attacks the exchange as being in furtherance of a conspiracy to violate the federal antitrust laws.\n\nThe Government's complaint generally alleged the following facts. In 1954, National Broadcasting Company (NBC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Radio Corporation of America (RCA), owned five very high frequency (VHF) television stations. The stations were located in the following market areas: New York, which is the country's largest market; Chicago, second; Los Angeles, third; Cleveland, tenth; and Washington D.C., eleventh. According to the Government's allegations, in March 1954, NBC and RCA originated a continuing conspiracy \n\n[358 \nU.S. 334, 336]\n\u00a0\n to acquire stations in five of the eight largest market areas in the country. Since Philadelphia is the country's fourth largest market area, acquisition of a Philadelphia station in exchange for appellees' Cleveland or Washington station would achieve one goal of the conspiracy.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nOne Philadelphia station, WPTZ, was owned by Westinghouse Broadcasting Company. This station and a Westinghouse-owned station in Boston were affiliated with the NBC network. In addition, Westinghouse desired NBC affiliation for a station to be acquired in Pittsburgh. In order to force Westinghouse to exchange its Philadelphia station for NBC's Cleveland station, it is alleged that NBC threatened Westinghouse with loss of the network affiliation of its Boston and Philadelphia stations, and threatened to withhold affiliation from its Pittsburgh station to be acquired. NBC also threatened to withhold network affiliation from any new VHF or UHF (ultra high frequency) stations which Westinghouse might acquire. By thus using its leverage as a network, NBC is alleged to have forced Westinghouse to agree to the exchange contract under consideration. Under the terms of that contract NBC was to acquire the Philadelphia station, while Westinghouse was to acquire NBC's Cleveland station plus three million dollars.\n\nThe Government asked that the conspiracy be declared violative of 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 1, that the appellees be divested of such assets as the District Court deemed appropriate, that \"such other and additional relief as may be proper\" be awarded, and that the Government recover costs of the suit.\n\nAppellees' affirmative defenses arose out of the fact that the exchange had been approved by the Federal Communications \n\n[358 \nU.S. 334, 337]\n\u00a0\n Commission.\n2\n FCC approval was required under 310 (b) of the Communications Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 1086, as amended, 66 Stat. 716, 47 U.S.C. 310 (b). Under that Section, appellees filed applications setting forth the terms of the transaction and the reasons for requesting the exchange. The Commission instituted proceedings to determine whether the exchange met the statutory requirements of 310, that the \"public interest, convenience, and necessity\" would be served. They were not adversary proceedings. After extensive investigation of the transaction, the Commission was still not satisfied that the exchange would meet the statutory standards, and, over three dissents, issued letters seeking additional information on various subjects, including antitrust problems, under 309 (b) of the Act. After receiving answers to the letters, the Commission, without holding a hearing, on December 21, 1955, granted the application to exchange stations.\n3\n\u00a0\n\n[358 \nU.S. 334, 338]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt was stipulated below that in passing upon the application, the Commission had all the information before it which has now been made the basis of the Government's complaint. It further appears that during the FCC proceedings the Justice Department was informed as to the evidence in the FCC's possession. It was further stipulated, and we assume, that the FCC decided all issues relative to the antitrust laws that were before it, and that the Justice Department had the right to request a hearing under 309 (b), to file a protest under 309 (c), to seek a rehearing under 405, and to seek judicial review of the decision under 402 (b). See Far East Conference v. United States, \n342 \nU.S. 570, 576\n; U.S. ex rel. Chapman v. Federal Power Comm'n, \n345 \nU.S. 153, 155\n, 156. The Department of Justice took none of these actions. Accordingly, on January 22, 1956, after the period in which the Department could have sought review had expired. NBC and Westinghouse consummated the exchange transaction according to their contract. The Department did not file the present complaint until December 4, 1956, over ten months later.\n\nAgainst this background, appellees assert that the FCC had authority to pass on the antitrust questions presented, and, in any case, that the regulatory scheme of the Communications Act has so displaced that of the Sherman Act that the FCC had primary jurisdiction to license the exchange transaction, with the result that any attack for antitrust reasons on the exchange transaction must have been by direct review of the license grant. Relying on this premise, they then contend that the only method available to the Government for redressing its antitrust grievances was to intervene in the FCC proceedings; that since it did not, the antitrust issues were determined adversely to it when the exchange was approved, so that it is barred by principles of collateral estoppel and res \n\n[358 \nU.S. 334, 339]\n\u00a0\n judicata; and that in any case the long delay between approval of the exchange and filing of this suit bars the suit because of laches.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nWhether these contentions are to prevail depends substantially upon the extent to which Congress authorized the FCC to pass on antitrust questions, and this in turn requires examination of the relevant legislative history. Two sections of the Communications Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 1064, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 151 et seq., deal specifically with antitrust considerations, Sections 311 and 313:\n\n  \"SEC. 311. The Commission is hereby directed to  refuse a station license and\/or the permit hereinafter  required for the construction of a station to any person  (or to any person directly or indirectly controlled  by such person) whose license has been revoked by a  court under section 313.\n\n\n .  .  .   .  .\n\n\n  \"SEC. 313. All laws of the United States relating  to unlawful restraints and monopolies and to combinations,  contracts, or agreements in restraint of  trade are hereby declared to be applicable to the  manufacture and sale of and to trade in radio apparatus  and devices entering into or affecting interstate  or foreign commerce and to interstate or foreign radio  communications. Whenever in any suit, action, or  proceeding, civil or criminal, brought under the provisions  of any of said laws or in any proceedings  brought to enforce or to review findings and orders  of the Federal Trade Commission or other governmental  agency in respect of any matters as to which  said Commission or other governmental agency is by  law authorized to act, any licensee shall be found \n\n[358 \nU.S. 334, 340]\n\u00a0\n  guilty of the violation of the provisions of such laws  or any of them, the court, in addition to the penalties  imposed by said laws, may adjudge, order, and\/or  decree that the license of such licensee shall, as of the  date the decree or judgment becomes finally effective  or as of such other date as the said decree shall fix,  be revoked and that all rights under such license  shall thereupon cease: Provided, however, That such  licensee shall have the same right of appeal or review  as is provided by law in respect of other decrees and  judgments of said court.\"\n\n\n These provisions were taken from the Radio Act of 1927.\n4\n They appear to have originated in a bill drafted by Congressman White of Maine, H. R. 5589, 69th Cong., 1st Sess. What is now 311 appeared as the third paragraph of 2 (C)\n5\n of that bill, while what is now 313 appeared as 2 (G).\n6\n In the hearings on the bill before \n\n[358 \nU.S. 334, 341]\n\u00a0\n the House Committee, Congressman Reid of Illinois asked Judge Davis, Department of Commerce representative, whether the Secretary of Commerce\n7\n had any discretion to refuse a license under 2 (C) (now 311) to a party which the Secretary believed to be violating the antitrust laws. The following colloquy ensued:\n8\n\u00a0\n\n Judge DAVIS. \"He has no discretion under this act.\"\n\n\n Congressman REID. \"They have to be found guilty first; is that the idea?\"\n\n\n Congressman WHITE. \"Yes. In other words, I tried to get away from placing upon the secretary the determination of a judicial question of that character. That involves, of course, a determination as to the facts; it requires a knowledge of the law and it requires an application of the law to the facts, and then it requires the exercise of judicial powers, if you leave that in his discretion, and I tried to lift it away from the secretary.\" \n\n[358 \nU.S. 334, 342]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Later on, the question arose as to what grounds were available to the Secretary to revoke licenses under 2 (F) (now 312). After Congressman White mentioned one statutory ground, Congressman Reid observed:\n9\n\u00a0\n\n \"Yes; but you do not include unlawful combinations and monopolies and contracts or agreements in restraint of trade. That is not covered.\"\n\n\n Congressman WHITE. \"No; not in that section.\"\n\n\n Congressman DAVIS of Tennessee. \"Those are covered in `G' [now 313].\"\n\n\n Congressman WHITE. \"That is a judicial question and we have left it to the courts to pass on that.\"\n\n\n This failure to include a provision permitting refusal of a license for antitrust violations in the absence of a judicial determination caused Congressman Davis to insert a lengthy Minority Report on H. R. 9108, which was old H. R. 5589 reintroduced by Congressman White.\n10\n Consequently, when the bill (then numbered H. R. 9971) reached the floor of the House, Congressman Davis attempted to insert a number of amendments which would have strengthened the antitrust aspects of the bill. See 67 Cong. Rec. 5484, 5485. All were defeated, including an amendment to 2 (C) (now 311) which would have required refusal of a license to any company \"found by any Federal court or the commission to have been unlawfully monopolizing\" radio communication. (Emphasis supplied.) See 67 Cong. Rec. 5501-5504, 5555.\n\nThus, in the Senate consideration of a version of the bill, when asked whether there was \"anything in the bill providing in case the applicant for a permit is found to be acting in violation of the Sherman antitrust law or controls a monopoly that the commission may pass upon \n\n[358 \nU.S. 334, 343]\n\u00a0\n the question,\" Senator Dill of Washington, who was in charge of the bill in the Senate, replied:\n11\n\u00a0\n\n \"The bill provides that in case anybody has been convicted under the Sherman antitrust law or any other law relating to monopoly he shall be denied a license; but the bill does not attempt to make the commission the judge as to whether or not certain conditions constitute a monopoly; it rather leaves that to the court.\"\n\n\n Congress adjourned before any action could be taken on the bill at that session. At the next session, a Conference Committee reported out the version of the bills which became the Radio Act of 1927, with now 311 being 13 of the Act and now 313 being 15 of the Act, despite the vigorous but unsuccessful opposition of Congressman Davis in the House, see, e. g., 68 Cong. Rec. 2577, and Senator Pittman of Nevada in the Senate. See, e. g., 68 Cong. Rec. 3032, 3034.\n\nOnly one change was made in those two Sections when they were incorporated into the Communications Act. Section 311 was modified merely to authorize rather than to require the revocation of a license by the Commission after a court had found a radio broadcaster in violation of the antitrust laws, but had not ordered its license revoked, 48 Stat. 1086. In all other respects 13 and 15 of the Radio Act were identical with, and had the same purpose as, 311 and 313 of the Communications Act.\n12\n\u00a0\n\nWhile this history compels the conclusion that the FCC was not intended to have any authority to pass on antitrust violations as such, it is equally clear that courts retained jurisdiction to pass on alleged antitrust violations \n\n[358 \nU.S. 334, 344]\n\u00a0\n irrespective of Commission action. Thus 311, as originally enacted in 1934, 48 Stat. 1086, read as follows:\n\n  \"The Commission is hereby directed to refuse a  station license and\/or the permit hereinafter required  for the construction of a station to any person (or to  any person directly or indirectly controlled by such  person) whose license has been revoked by a court  under section 313, and is hereby authorized to refuse  such station license and\/or permit to any other person  (or to any person directly or indirectly controlled  by such person) which has been finally adjudged  guilty by a Federal court of unlawfully monopolizing  or attempting unlawfully to monopolize, radio communication,  directly or indirectly, through the control  of the manufacture or sale of radio apparatus,  through exclusive traffic arrangements, or by any  other means, or to have been using unfair methods  of competition. The granting of a license shall not  estop the United States or any person aggrieved from  proceeding against such person for violating the law  against unfair methods of competition or for a violation  of the law against unlawful restraints and  monopolies and\/or combinations, contracts, or agreements  in restraint of trade, or from instituting proceedings  for the dissolution of such corporation.\"  (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n Appellees attempt to avoid the force of the italicized sentence in two ways. First, they point to its repeal in the 1952 amendments to the Act, 66 Stat. 716. That repeal was occasioned by objections from the industry that it was unfair for radio broadcasters who had been found in violation of the antitrust laws to be subject to license refusals by the Commission, even when the court as a part of its decree did not see fit to order the license revoked under 313. See S. Rep. No. 142, 82d Cong., \n\n[358 \nU.S. 334, 345]\n\u00a0\n 1st Sess. 9. Congress accordingly repealed all of the Section following the first comma, including the italicized sentence. It apparently considered that inherent in the scheme of the Act was the right to challenge under the antitrust laws even transactions approved by the Commission, for the Conference Committee carefully noted that repeal of the italicized sentence would not curtail such a right:\n13\n\u00a0\n\n \"To the extent that this section of the conference substitute will eliminate from section 311 of the present law the last sentence, which is quoted above, the committee of conference does not feel that this is of any legal significance. It is the view of the members of the conference committee that the last sentence of the present section 311 is surplusage and that by omitting it from the present law the power of the United States or of any private person to proceed under the antitrust laws would not be curtailed or affected in any way.\"\n\n\n Thus, appellees' reliance on repeal of the last sentence of 311 is clearly misplaced.\n\nSecond, appellees urge that the italicized sentence as originally enacted had a very narrow scope; that it was intended to insure only that the granting of a license would not estop the Government from prosecuting antitrust violations subsequent to the transaction giving rise to the license proceeding, or of which the transaction was merely a small part. They argue that the sentence was intended to permit only actions such as in Packaged Programs v. Westinghouse Broadcasting Co., 255 F.2d 708. But the language of the sentence cannot be naturally read in such a narrow manner, and it would take persuasive legislative history so to restrict its application. Appellees point to no such history, nor to any cases so holding. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 334, 346]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThus, the legislative history of the Act reveals that the Commission was not given the power to decide antitrust issues as such, and that Commission action was not intended to prevent enforcement of the antitrust laws in federal courts.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nWe now reach the question whether, despite the legislative history, the over-all regulatory scheme of the Act requires invocation of a primary jurisdiction doctrine. The doctrine originated with Mr. Justice (later Chief Justice) White in Texas & Pacific R. Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., \n204 \nU.S. 426\n. It was grounded on the necessity for administrative uniformity, and, in that particular case, for maintenance of uniform rates to all shippers.\n14\n A second reason for the doctrine was suggested by Mr. Justice Brandeis in Great Northern R. Co. v. Merchants Elevator Co., \n259 \nU.S. 285, 291\n, where he pointed to the need for administrative skill \"commonly to be found only in a body of experts\" in handling the \"intricate facts\" of, in that case, the transportation industry.\n\nThus, when questions arose as to the applicability of the doctrine to transactions allegedly violative of the antitrust \n\n[358 \nU.S. 334, 347]\n\u00a0\n laws, particularly involving fully regulated industries whose members were forced to charge only reasonable rates approved by the appropriate commission, this Court found the doctrine applicable.\n15\n United States v. Pacific & Arctic R. Co., \n228 \nU.S. 87\n; Keogh v. Chicago & N. W. R. Co., \n260 \nU.S. 156\n; United States Navigation Co. v. Cunard S. S. Co., \n284 \nU.S. 474\n; Georgia v. Pennsylvania R. Co., \n324 \nU.S. 439\n; Far East Conference v. United States, \n342 \nU.S. 570\n. At the same time, this Court carefully noted that the doctrine did not apply when the action was only for the purpose of dissolving the conspiracy through which the allegedly invalid rates were set, for in such a case there would be no interference with rate structures or a regulatory scheme.\n16\n United States v. Pacific & Arctic R. Co., supra; Georgia v. Pennsylvania R. Co., supra. The decisions sometimes emphasized the need for administrative uniformity and uniform rates, \n\n[358 \nU.S. 334, 348]\n\u00a0\n Keogh v. Chicago & N. W. R. Co., supra, while at other times they emphasized the need for administrative experience in distilling the relevant facts in a complex industry as a foundation for later court action. United States Navigation Co. v. Cunard S. S. Co., supra, and Far East Conference v. United States, supra, as explained in Federal Maritime Board v. Isbrandtsen Co., \n356 \nU.S. 481, 497\n-499.\n\nThe cases all involved, however, common carriers by rail and water. These carriers could charge only the published tariff, and that tariff must have been found by the appropriate agency to have been reasonable. Free rate competition was modified by federal controls. The Court's concern was that the agency which was expert in, and responsible for, administering those controls should be given the opportunity to determine questions within its special competence as an aid to the courts in resolving federal antitrust policy and federal regulatory patterns into a cohesive whole. That some resolution is necessary when the antitrust policy of free competition is placed beside a regulatory scheme involving fixed rates is obvious. Cf. McLean Trucking Co. v. United States, \n321 \nU.S. 67\n. Accordingly, this Court consistently held that when rates and practices relating thereto were challenged under the antitrust laws, the agencies had primary jurisdiction to consider the reasonableness of such rates and practices in the light of the many relevant factors including alleged antitrust violations, for otherwise sporadic action by federal courts would disrupt an agency's delicate regulatory scheme, and would throw existing rate structures out of balance.\n\nWhile the television industry is also a regulated industry, it is regulated in a very different way. That difference is controlling. Radio broadcasters, including television broadcasters, see Allen B. Dumont Laboratories \n\n[358 \nU.S. 334, 349]\n\u00a0\n v. Carroll, 184 F.2d 153, are not included in the definition of common carriers in 3 (h) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 153 (h), as are telephone and telegraph companies. Thus the extensive controls, including rate regulation, of Title II of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 201-222, do not apply.\n17\n Television broadcasters remain free to set their own advertising rates. As this Court said in Federal Communications Comm'n v. Sanders Bros. Radio Station, \n309 \nU.S. 470, 474\n:\n\n \"In contradistinction to communication by telephone and telegraph, which the Communications Act recognizes as a common carrier activity and regulates accordingly in analogy to the regulation of rail and other carriers by the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Act recognizes that broadcasters are not common carriers and are not to be dealt with as such. Thus the Act recognizes that the field of broadcasting is one of free competition. The sections dealing with broadcasting demonstrate that Congress has not, in its regulatory scheme, abandoned the principle of free competition as it has done in the case of railroads . . . .\" \n\n[358 \nU.S. 334, 350]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Thus, there being no pervasive regulatory scheme, and no rate structures to throw out of balance, sporadic action by federal courts can work no mischief. The justification for primary jurisdiction accordingly disappears.\n18\n\u00a0\n\nThe facts of this case illustrate that analysis. Appellees, like unregulated business concerns, made a business judgment as to the desirability of the exchange. Like unregulated concerns, they had to make this judgment with knowledge that the exchange might run afoul of the antitrust laws. Their decision varied from that of an \n\n[358 \nU.S. 334, 351]\n\u00a0\n unregulated concern only in that they also had to obtain the approval of a federal agency. But scope of that approval in the case of the FCC was limited to the statutory standard, \"public interest, convenience, and necessity.\" See, generally, Federal Radio Comm'n v. Nelson Bros. Co., \n289 \nU.S. 266\n; Federal Communications Comm'n v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co., \n309 \nU.S. 134\n; Federal Communications Comm'n v. Sanders Bros. Radio Station, supra; Federal Communications Comm'n v. RCA Communications, \n346 \nU.S. 86\n. The monetary terms of the exchange were set by the parties, and were of concern to the Commission only as they might have affected the ability of the parties to serve the public. Even after approval, the parties were free to complete or not to complete the exchange as their sound business judgment dictated. In every sense, the question faced by the parties was solely one of business judgment (as opposed to regulatory coercion), save only that the Commission must have found that the \"public interest\" would be served by their decision to make the exchange. No pervasive regulatory scheme was involved.\n\nThis is not to imply that federal antitrust policy may not be considered in determining whether the \"public interest, convenience, and necessity\" will be served by proposed action of a broadcaster, for this Court has held the contrary.\n19\n National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, \n319 \nU.S. 190, 222\n-224. Moreover, in a given case the Commission might find that antitrust considerations alone would keep the statutory standard from being met, as when the publisher of the sole newspaper in an area applies for a license for the only available radio and television \n\n[358 \nU.S. 334, 352]\n\u00a0\n facilities, which, if granted, would give him a monopoly of that area's major media of mass communication. See 98 Cong. Rec. 7399; Mansfield Journal Co. v. Federal Communications Comm'n, 86 U.S. App. D.C. 102, 107, 108, 180 F.2d 28, 33, 34.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nThe other contentions of appellees fall of their own weight if the FCC has no power to decide antitrust questions. Thus, before we can find the Government collaterally estopped by the FCC licensing, we must find \"whether or not in the earlier litigation the representative of the United States had authority to represent its interests in a final adjudication of the issue in controversy.\" Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, \n310 \nU.S. 381, 403\n. (Emphasis supplied.) But the issue in controversy before the Commission was whether the exchange would serve the public interest, not whether 1 of the Sherman Act had been violated. Consequently, there could be no estoppel. Res judicata principles are even more inapposite.\n\nSimilarly, there could be no laches unless the Government was under some sort of a duty to go forward in the FCC proceedings. But unless the FCC had power to decide the antitrust issues, and we have held that it did not, the Government had no duty either to enter the FCC proceedings or to seek review of the license grant.\n20\n\u00a0\n\n[358 \nU.S. 334, 353]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAccordingly, the judgment of the District Court dismissing the action is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n      It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE HARLAN concurs in the result, believing, as he understands part \"I\" of the Court's opinion to hold, that a Commission determination of \"public interest, convenience, and necessity\" cannot either constitute a binding adjudication upon any antitrust issues that may be involved in the Commission's proceeding or serve to exempt a licensee pro tanto from the antitrust laws, and that these considerations alone are dispositive of this appeal.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Under present FCC regulations, NBC can own no more than five stations, 47 CFR, 1958, 3.636, so that acquisition of a new station would require that an existing one be relinquished.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Federal Communications Commission Report No. 2793, Public Notice 27067, December 28, 1955.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Commissioner Bartley dissented from the action, urging that hearings should have been held because the facts theretofore revealed by the investigation had raised \"serious questions as to the desirability and possible legality of the competitive practices followed by the network in obtaining dominance of major broadcast markets.\" He suggested that there was \"a substantial question whether, once the Commission grants its approval to these transfers, certain provisions of the Clayton Act (viz. 15 U.S.C. 18) might prevent Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department from taking any effective action in the event they concluded that possible violations of the anti-trust laws were involved.\" (Emphasis by the Commissioner.) Commissioner Doerfer, joined by Commissioner Mack, responded that it was unnecessary to hold a hearing because the investigation had fully revealed the facts. He concluded, however: \"It is difficult to see how approval of this exchange may effectively preclude other governmental agencies from examining into this or any other transaction of the network companies.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] 44 Stat. 1162.

Co., \n352 \nU.S. 59, 63\n-64:\n\n\"The doctrine of primary jurisdiction, like the rule requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies, is concerned with promoting proper relationships between the courts and administrative agencies charged with particular regulatory duties. `Exhaustion' applies where a claim is cognizable in the first instance by an administrative agency alone; judicial interference is withheld until the administrative process has run its course. `Primary jurisdiction,' on the other hand, applies where a claim is originally cognizable in the courts, and comes into play whenever enforcement of the claim requires the resolution of issues which, under a regulatory scheme, have been placed within the special competence of an administrative body; in such a case the judicial process is suspended pending referral of such issues to the administrative body for its views.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] See, generally, 3 Davis, Administrative Law Treatise, 19.05, 19.06; Jaffe, Primary Jurisdiction Reconsidered: The Anti-Trust Laws, 102 U. of Pa. L. Rev. 577; Schwartz, Legal Restriction of Competition in the Regulated Industries: An Abdication of Judicial Responsibility, 67 Harv. L. Rev. 436; von Mehren, The Antitrust Laws and Regulated Industries: The Doctrine of Primary Jurisdiction, 67 Harv. L. Rev. 929.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] This followed because, in the words of Mr. Justice Brandeis in Keogh v. Chicago & N. W. R. Co., supra, at 161, \". . . a combination of carriers to fix reasonable and non-discriminatory rates may be illegal.\" This Court in Georgia v. Pennsylvania R. Co., supra took the position that shippers were entitled to have rates filed by carriers who were not parties to a conspiracy, even though the rates filed were the lowest which would be found to be reasonable. The risk that future filings would be at the uppermost limits of the zone of reasonableness was too great, and damage from the conspiratorial filings was presumed to flow. Of course, when the agency is permitted to exempt from antitrust coverage rates filed cooperatively, the doctrine equally applies to an attack on the alleged conspiracy. United States Navigation Co. v. Cunard S. S. Co., supra; Far East Conference v. United States, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] Under Title II, common carriers are required to furnish communications service on reasonable request and may charge only just and reasonable rates, 201. Such carriers must file rates with the FCC, and can charge only the rates as filed, 203. The Commission may hold hearings on the lawfulness of filed rates, 204, and after hearings may itself set the applicable rate, 205. Cf. 49 U.S.C. 15 et seq., 46 U.S.C. 817. In view of this extensive regulation, Congress has provided that certain actions of telephone and telegraph companies may be exempted from the antitrust laws by the Commission, 221 (a) and 222 (c) (1). Cf. 49 U.S.C. 5 (11), 5b (9) and 46 U.S.C. 814. Such exemptions are, however, subject to review, see Federal Maritime Board v. Isbrandtsen Co., \n356 \nU.S. 481\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] This conclusion is re-enforced by the Commission's disavowal of either the power or the desire to foreclose the Government from antitrust actions aimed at transactions which the Commission has licensed. This position was taken both before the district judge below, and in a Supplemental Memorandum filed in this Court, page 8:\n\n\"Concurrent with the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice to enforce the Sherman Act, the Commission, of course, has jurisdiction to designate license applications for hearing on public interest questions arising out of facts which might also constitute violations of the antitrust laws. This does not mean, however, that its action on these public interest questions of communications policy is a determination of the antitrust issues as such. Thus, while the Commission may deny applications as not in the public interest where violations of the Sherman Act have been determined to exist, its approval of transactions which might involve Sherman Act violations is not a determination that the Sherman Act has not been violated, and therefore cannot forestall the United States from subsequently bringing an antitrust suit challenging those transactions.\"\n\n\n Nor was this position taken merely for the purposes of this litigation, for it has been the view of the Commission over a period of years. See Report on Uniform Policy as to Violation by Applicants of Laws of United States, FCC Docket No. 9572 (1950), 1 Pike and Fischer, Radio Regulation, Part III, 91:495; National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, \n319 \nU.S. 190\n. Since, as Mr. Justice Brandeis observed, the doctrine of primary jurisdiction rests in part upon the need for the skill of a \"body of experts,\" it would be odd to impose the doctrine when the experts deny the relevance of their skill.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] See also Report on Uniform Policy as to Violation by Applicants of Laws of United States, FCC Docket No. 9572, 1 Pike and Fischer, Radio Regulation, Part III, 91:495.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] It is relevant to note that the Commission is not expressly required to give the Government notice that antitrust issues have been raised in a 310 (b) proceeding. Compare 222 (c) (1) of the Act relating to common carriers, which expressly makes consolidations and mergers exempt from antitrust coverage if approved by the Commission, but which also expressly requires that notice be given to the Attorney General of the United States prior to approval. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 334, 354]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","200":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v.

With him on the brief was Lewis Thomas Booker.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis is a suit for statutory penalties, instituted by the United States, charging respondent with the operation of four trains in violation of the Safety Appliance Act, 27 Stat. 531, as amended, 32 Stat. 943, 45 U.S.C. 1, 6, 9. That Act requires every \"train\" moving in interstate traffic\n1\n to have power brakes on not less than 50% of \n\n[361 \nU.S. 78, 79]\n\u00a0\n the cars ( 1, 9) - a requirement which the Interstate Commerce Commission by regulation has increased to 85%. 49 CFR 132.1. The penalties are $100 for each violation.\n2\n 6.\n\nThe District Court rendered judgment for respondent and the Court of Appeals affirmed by a divided vote. 258 F.2d 262. We granted the petition for a writ of certiorari because of the seeming conflict between that ruling and our prior decisions. \n358 \nU.S. 926\n.\n\nRespondent has a \"classification or assembly yard\" in Hopewell, Virginia. Trains to and from Hopewell use it for breaking up incoming trains and for assembling cars into outgoing trains. A track extends from this \"classification\" yard for about two miles through the city. In this stretch the tracks make an interchange connection with another railroad and cross, at grade, five streets, two private roads and four tracks of another railroad. Nine spur tracks branch off these tracks to industrial sidings. About two miles from the \"classification\" yard are plants of the Allied Chemical & Dye Company and Continental Can Company.\n\nThe complaint charged four violations: First, moving a locomotive and 26 cars as a single unit, without stops, from the track of Allied Chemical to the \"classification\" yard. Second, moving a locomotive and 28 cars as a single unit, without stops, from the \"classification\" yard to the track of Allied Chemical. Third, moving a locomotive and 29 cars as a single unit, without stops, from a track near Allied Chemical for about a mile to the interchange \n\n[361 \nU.S. 78, 80]\n\u00a0\n track where the locomotive was detached, coupled to 20 additional cars, and then recoupled to the 29 cars. The 49 cars were then hauled, without stops, for about a mile to the \"classification\" yard. Fourth, moving a locomotive and 23 cars as a single unit, without stops, from the \"classification\" yard to the track of Continental Can.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nThe meaning of the word \"train\" as used in the Act has been before the Court four times. In United States v. Erie R. Co., \n237 \nU.S. 402\n, it was recognized that while \"switching operations\" were not \"train\" movements within the meaning of the Act, the movement of cars from one yard to another yard of the same carrier was covered. It was emphasized that this movement, like other mainline movements, took the cars over switches and other tracks where the traffic was exposed to the hazards against which the Act was designed to afford protection. The same result was reached in United States v. Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co., \n237 \nU.S. 410\n, where the movements were of transfer trains, shifting cars from one yard in Kansas City to another on the opposite side of the Missouri River. It was again emphasized that this was \"not shifting cars about in a yard or on isolated tracks devoted to switching operations,\" but moving traffic over a line where there were great hazards in the operation. Id., at 412. Louisville & J. Bridge Co. v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 534\n, involved movements of cars for about three-quarters of a mile from one company's terminal to that of another, the cars passing over city streets, at grade, and along and over other tracks. The Court, in holding that these movements \n\n[361 \nU.S. 78, 81]\n\u00a0\n were covered by the Act, emphasized that this was not \"a sorting, or selecting, or classifying\" of cars \"involving coupling and uncoupling, and the movement of one or a few at a time for short distances,\" but an operation involving the typical hazards which gave rise to the need for the Act. Id., at 538. United States v. Northern Pacific R. Co., \n254 \nU.S. 251\n, involved so-called transfer trains running between points, four miles apart, within one yard. The railroad contended that the Act did not apply because the movement was within a yard and because no through or local trains moved over these tracks. The tracks did cross streets and other tracks at grade; and the trains were run without stops the four miles. It was held that these movements were covered by the Act. \"A moving locomotive with cars attached is without the provision of the act only when it is not a train; as where the operation is that of switching, classifying and assembling cars within railroad yards for the purpose of making up trains.\" Id., at 254-255.\n\nWe think this case, judged by the principles announced in the earlier four, was erroneously decided.\n\nThe end of each trip was characteristic of the usual freight run: cars were either received from a consignor or delivered to the consignee. This was not \"sorting, or selecting, or classifying\" cars \"involving coupling and uncoupling, and the movement of one or a few at a time for short distances\" (Louisville & J. Bridge Co. v. United States, supra, at 538) nor any other type of movement that is comparable to \"switching.\" In three of the movements there was a run of two miles without stops. In one, there was one stop to pick up additional cars; but a mile run preceded that stop and another mile of uninterrupted travel followed it. The prior decisions make clear that it is immaterial that the run was not on the main line but in a yard. The fact that switching preceded or followed these movements is likewise irrelevant to the statutory \n\n[361 \nU.S. 78, 82]\n\u00a0\n test. It may properly be said there is no \"train\" in a true \"switching\" operation. But when cars - at least in substantial number - are being received from consignors or delivered to consignees in an assembled unit of engine and cars that moves a substantial distance, the operation is intrinsically no different, for purposes of the Act, than a main-line haul.\n\nThe District Court found that \"The movements complained of would not have been less hazardous to employees or the public if air brakes had been coupled and used.\" Yet it is not for courts to determine in particular cases whether this safety measure is or is not needed. Congress determined the policy that governs us in applying the law. Traditionally, movements of assembled cars for substantial distances involved the hazards of crossing public highways and the tracks of other lines with attendant risks to the public. More important, they involved risks to those who ride the trains,\n4\n particularly the men who operate them. History showed that hundreds of workers had been injured or killed by the stopping of unbraked cars, by the operation of hand brakes, and by the use of hand couplers. This history, well known to Congress,\n5\n was the primary purpose behind \n\n[361 \nU.S. 78, 83]\n\u00a0\n the legislation. The Act, therefore, should be liberally construed as a safety measure. Movements which, though miniature when compared with main-line hauls, have the characteristics of the customary \"train\" movement and its attendant risks are to be included.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 1 provides, in relevant part: \"It shall be unlawful for any common carrier engaged in interstate commerce by railroad to use on its line any locomotive engine in moving interstate traffic not equipped with . . . appliances for operating \n\n[361 \nU.S. 78, 79]\n\u00a0\n the train-brake system, or to run any train in such traffic that has not a sufficient number of cars in it so equipped with power or train brakes that the engineer on the locomotive drawing such train can control its speed without requiring brakemen to use the common hand brake for that purpose.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The statute was amended August 14, 1957, to increase the penalty to $250 (71 Stat. 352, 45 U.S.C. (Supp. V) 6).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Respondent since 1951 had used air brakes on the cars in these movements after inspectors of the Interstate Commerce Commission had advised that it was necessary to do so. But it discontinued the practice in 1956, justifying the discontinuance on the ground that switching movements were involved, that the use of air brakes caused a delay of about 40 minutes in each movement, and that the increased annual cost for the use of air brakes was $30,000.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The title of the original Act described it as \"An Act to promote the safety of employees and travelers upon railroads . . .\" etc. 27 Stat. 531.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] See H. R. Rep. No. 1678, 52d Cong., 1st Sess., p. 3, where it is noted that for the years 1889 and 1890 \"38 per cent of the total number of deaths and 46 per cent of the total number of injuries sustained by railway employees resulted while coupling cars or setting brakes.\" On page 7 of a report of a subcommittee submitted as a part of S. Rep. No. 1930, 57th Cong., 1st Sess., the following statement of a witness appearing before the subcommittee was made: \"If only a portion of the equipped cars are operated, trainmen are exposed to great danger arising from the breakage of an air hose, or a coupling between the cars so braked, which causes an instantaneous \n\n[361 \nU.S. 78, 83]\n\u00a0\n and extremely powerful application of the power brakes, which causes the front cars in the train to quickly slacken speed and stop, and the other cars behind them, which are not braked, to rush forward against them, thus causing a severe shock, which often wrecks the train and jars the trainmen off and injures them, and in some cases they fall under the wheels and are killed. If the brakes on all of the cars were operated this would not be so, for the brakes would be applied equally all over the train, and the cars on the rear end would slacken their speed just as quickly as those on the front end, and thus prevent their running forward against the front cars and producing the shock just described. There is no way for trainmen to escape these injuries, for they are still required by the companies to ride out on the tops of trains, and when one of these shocks comes, it comes to them without warning, for the noise of the running train, together with darkness at night, prevents them from detecting any trouble ahead. \"Wrecks caused in this way do not only cause injury to the trainmen on the train which is wrecked, but also on double-tracked roads the opposite track is immediately blocked with wrecked cars, thus endangering not only the lives and limbs of trainmen, but passengers as well, who may be on trains approaching on the opposite track, which can not be stopped before striking the obstruction. I personally know of several bad wrecks of this character myself.\" \n\n[361 \nU.S. 78, 84]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","201":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. SHIREY(1959)\nNo. 72\nArgued: January 19, 1959Decided: April 20, 1959\n\n\n\n\n Alleging that he had offered to a Congressman to donate $1,000 a year to the republican Party if the Congressman would use his influence to procure for him a certain postmastership, an information was filed in a Federal District Court charging appellee with a violation of 18 U.S.C. 214, which provides that, \"Whoever . . . offers or promises any money or thing of value, to any person, firm or corporation in consideration of the use or promise to use any influence to procure any appointive office or place under the United States for any person\" shall be fined or imprisoned or both. Held: The information states facts sufficient to constitute an offense under the statute, since the word \"person\" is broad enough to include the Republican Party and the legislative history of the statute shows that it was intended to cover cases such as that alleged. Pp. 255-262.\n\n 168 F. Supp. 382, reversed.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Anderson argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Beatrice Rosenberg and J. F. Bishop.\n\nDonn I. Cohen argued the cause for appellee. With him on the brief was Sidney G. Handler.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nOn July 23, 1954, an information was filed in the District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania charging appellee with a violation of 18 U.S.C. 214 (originally 1 of the Act of December 11, 1926, 44 Stat. 918). That statute provides:\n\n \"Whoever pays or offers or promises any money or thing of value, to any person, firm, or corporation \n\n[359 \nU.S. 255, 256]\n\u00a0\n in consideration of the use or promise to use any influence to procure any appointive office or place under the United States for any person, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.\"\n\n\n The information alleged that appellee had offered S. Walter Stauffer, a member of Congress from Pennsylvania, to contribute $1,000 a year to the Republican Party in consideration of Stauffer's use of influence to procure for appellee the postmastership of York, Pennsylvania. The District Court granted a motion to dismiss for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute an offense against the United States. 168 F. Supp. 382. The Government appealed directly to this Court, 18 U.S.C. 3731, and we noted probable jurisdiction, \n358 \nU.S. 806\n, to determine whether the allegations of the information constituted a violation of 18 U.S.C. 214.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nWe turn first to the language of the statute. There are alternative constructions of its language. One sensible reading is to say that even though the Republican Party was to be the ultimate recipient of the money, this was a promise to Stauffer of money (which it plainly was) in consideration of his use of influence. Since Stauffer is a \"person,\" the statute covers the alleged offense. It may be urged that although a promise was made to \n\n[359 \nU.S. 255, 257]\n\u00a0\n Stauffer it was not a promise of money to him. Since the word \"to\" immediately follows the words \"money or thing of value\" and not the word \"promises,\" it is possible to read the statute as requiring that the recipient of the money or thing of value be the \"person, firm, or corporation\" which the statute describes. But either construction of the statute covers the classic three-party case: e. g., A tells X he will give $1,000 to Y if X will use influence to get him a job. Under the first construction this is a promise of $1,000 to X in consideration of the use of influence. Under the second construction this is a promise to give money to Y in consideration of a promise to use influence; a standard third-party beneficiary situation. The only difficulty with this second construction in the context of this case is the necessity of finding that the Republican Party is a \"person, firm, or corporation,\" as those words are used in the statute. The Republican Party is not a legal entity. It is an amorphous group of individuals that acts and only can act through persons. Its funds are received and managed by persons. Certainly the word \"person\" in the statute is broad enough to include the Republican Party, and since the content and manifest purpose of the statute confirm, as we shall see, such a construction, it would unjustifiably contract the law to withdraw gifts to the Republican Party from its scope.\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[359 \nU.S. 255, 258]\n\u00a0\n Thus, no matter how the statute is read, one thing is clear - its terms cover this case. Shirey's endeavor to purchase himself a postmastership as alleged has been interdicted by the Congress. Awkwardness is not ambiguity, nor do defined multiple meanings, each of which is satisfied by the allegations of the information, constitute a want of definiteness.\n\nNot only does the compulsion of language within the statutory framework seem clear, but the purpose and history of the enactment powerfully reaffirm the meaning \n\n[359 \nU.S. 255, 259]\n\u00a0\n yielded by its language. The bill was first introduced in Congress with a Committee Report which stated:\n\n \"This bill seeks to punish the purchase and sale of public offices. Certain Members of Congress have brought to the attention of the House both by speeches on the floor and statements before the Judiciary Committee a grave situation, disclosing corruption in connection with postal appointments in Mississippi and South Carolina. It is believed that this bill will prevent corrupt practices in connection with patronage appointments in the future.\" H. R. Rep. No. 1366, 69th Cong., 1st Sess.\n\n\n The information in this case deals with the very kind of situation that gave rise to the provision under scrutiny. In the years preceding the enactment of this legislation members of Congress referred to contributions to party treasuries and to campaign funds, as well as direct payments to those in charge of patronage, as among the corrupt methods of obtaining postmasterships.\n3\n See e. g., 65 Cong. Rec. 1408-1413. These revelations on the floor of the Congress, as disclosed by the authoritative history of enactment, indicate the aim of Congress to proscribe \n\n[359 \nU.S. 255, 260]\n\u00a0\n payments to political parties in return for influence. Indeed this form of payment was a major concern of Congress. Certainly we cannot infer that Congress expressed this concern in self-defeating terms.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nStatutes, including penal enactments, are not inert exercises in literary composition. They are instruments of government, and in construing them \"the general purpose is a more important aid to the meaning than any \n\n[359 \nU.S. 255, 261]\n\u00a0\n rule which grammar or formal logic may lay down.\" United States v. Whitridge, \n197 \nU.S. 135, 143\n. This is so because the purpose of an enactment is embedded in its words even though it is not always pedantically expressed in words. See United States v. Wurzbach, \n280 \nU.S. 396, 399\n. Statutory meaning, it is to be remembered, is more to be felt than demonstrated, see United States v. Johnson, \n221 \nU.S. 488, 496\n, or, as Judge Learned Hand has put it, the art of interpretation is \"the art of proliferating a purpose.\" Brooklyn Nat. Corp. v. Comm'r, 157 F.2d 450, 451. In ascertaining this purpose it is important to remember that no matter how elastic is the use to which the term scientific may be put, it cannot be used to describe the legislative process. That is a crude but practical process of the adaptation by the ordinary citizen of means to an end, except when it concerns technical problems beyond the ken of the average man.\n\nApplying these generalities to the immediate occasion, it is clear that the terms, the history, and the manifest purpose of 18 U.S.C. 214 coalesce in a construction of that statute which validates the information against Shirey.\n5\n The evil which Congress sought to check and the mischief wrought by what it proscribed are the same when the transaction is triangular as when only two parties are \n\n[359 \nU.S. 255, 262]\n\u00a0\n involved.\n6\n It is incredible to suppose that Congress meant to prohibit Shirey from giving $1,000 to Stauffer, to be passed on by the latter to the Party fund, but that Shirey was outside the congressional prohibition for securing the same influence by a promise to deposit $1,000 directly in the Party's fund. That is not the kind of finessing by which this Court has heretofore allowed penal legislation to be construed. See, e. g., United States v. Mosley, \n238 \nU.S. 383\n, and United States v. Saylor, \n322 \nU.S. 385\n.\n\nThe judgment is\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The information charges as follows:\n\n\"On or about the 5th day of December 1953, in the City of York, Middle District of Pennsylvania, and within the jurisdiction of this Court, GEORGE DONALD SHIREY, in violation of the Act of Congress, June 25, 1948, c. 645, Sec. 1, 62 Stat. 694, 18 U.S.C. 214, did KNOWINGLY, WILFULLY and UNLAWFULLY offer or promise to S. WALTER STAUFFER, a Member of Congress of the 19th Congressional District of Pennsylvania, to donate $1,000 a year to the Republican Party to be used as they see fit, in consideration of the use or the promise to use any influence to procure for him the appointive office, under the United States, of Postmaster of York, Pennsylvania.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Whether the word \"person\" in a particular statute includes a particular body, a corporation, or association is essentially a matter of construction of that statute, aided, where possible, by general statutory definitions. If the purpose of a statute is such as to dictate the inclusion of a particular body within its scope then the statute is generally so interpreted. Since 18 U.S.C. 214 was aimed at prohibiting the purchase of influence, it is difficult to conclude that Congress would prohibit payments to firms and corporations and not proscribe payments to political organizations, since the influence of political parties in securing jobs and their involvement in the patronage process is greater than that of private companies. We must be blind not to know that among the abuses which led to the legislation \n\n[359 \nU.S. 255, 258]\n\u00a0\n were gifts to political parties and campaign treasuries, etc. Although these mostly took the form of payments to local chairmen, etc., there is no reason to assume that Congress meant to proscribe the payment to the officer of the Party but if a check were made out to the Party itself, a check which could be cashed and used by the officers of the Party, it was not outlawed.\n\nIn Georgia v. Evans, \n316 \nU.S. 159\n, the Court decided that 7 of the Sherman Act allowing \"any person\" to bring a treble damage action, allowed the State of Georgia to bring such an action. This was in the face of an earlier case holding that the same act did not allow the United States to sue. In reconciling the cases the Court pointed out that the scope of the word \"person\" depended on its \"legislative environment,\" and pointed to the differences in considerations which led to the exclusion of the United States and the inclusion of Georgia.\n\nIn Ohio v. Helvering, \n292 \nU.S. 360\n, a statute taxed \"persons\" selling liquor. Person was defined to include \"partnership, association, company or corporation, as well as a natural person.\" The Court decided this allowed a State to be taxed, saying that the meaning of the word person \"depends upon the connection in which the word is found.\"\n\nIn Stanley v. Schwalby, \n147 \nU.S. 508\n, the Court said that the word \"person\" in a Texas statute of limitations included the United States, and thus the United States could claim the benefit of the statute. The Court said that \"the word `person' in the statute would include them as a body politic and corporate.\"\n\nUnder these principles the statutory context here clearly calls for including the Republican Party within the term \"person.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The bill was introduced by Congressman Stevenson. 67 Cong. Rec. 6419. Two years before, in describing the \"corruption in connection with postal appointments in . . . South Carolina\" to which the Committee Report refers, Congressman Stevenson said, in response to the question \"Where did this money finally find its home?\":\n\n\"I do not know. As I said here once before, I doubt if much of it gets to the Republican executive committee, but I do not care where it goes. Either it goes into his pocket and the pockets of his machine or it goes into the coffers of the Republican Party. If it does, it is the most blatant defiance of the civil service law that any party has ever had the hardihood to put over, and it is as disgraceful as the Teapot Dome proposition any day.\" 65 Cong. Rec. 1410.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] When the bill which became 1 of the Act of December 11, 1926 (now 18 U.S.C. 214), was introduced in the House, it was coupled with a bill requiring the filing of an affidavit by certain officers of the United States. (This bill, with changes from its original wording, is now 5 U.S.C. 21a.) Mr. Graham, introducing both bills, said: \"They are correlative. I promised the committee and the gentlemen who are proponents of the bill that I would try to get unanimous consent to consider both bills together.\" 67 Cong. Rec. 10840.\n\nThe text of this \"correlative\" bill was as follows:\n\n\"Be it enacted, etc., That each individual hereafter appointed as an officer of the United States by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, or by the President alone, or by a court of law, or by the head of a department, shall, within 30 days after the effective date of his appointment, file with the Comptroller General of the United States an affidavit under oath stating that neither he nor anyone acting in his behalf has given, transferred, or paid any consideration for or in the expectation or hope of receiving assistance in securing such appointment.\n\n .  .  .   .   .\n\n\n\n\"SEC. 3. When used in this Act the term `consideration' includes a payment, distribution, gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money, or anything of value, or a contract, promise, or agreement, whether or not legally enforceable, to make such a payment, distribution, gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit.\" Ibid.\n\n\n This Act has been since amended, but the portions here relevant - the last phrases of 1 - remain unchanged. This is the affidavit Shirey would have to file were he appointed Postmaster of York. It is clear that he could not truthfully file such an affidavit if the allegations of the information are true. The fact that the sponsor of both bills expressly declared them to be correlative is persuasive evidence that an act which would make the oath impossible to take is a violation of 214.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] This Court reviews judgments, not arguments assailing them or seeking to sustain them. See Williams v. United States, \n168 \nU.S. 382, 389\n. The judgment which the Government brought here for review under the Criminal Appeals Act of 1907 is that \"The information does not state facts sufficient to constitute an offense against the United States.\" The correctness of this judgment depends on the construction of 18 U.S.C. 214 and more particularly whether that section supports the allegations of the information. Arguments invoked by the Government do not determine the meaning of a statute nor do they define the scope of our inquiry into its meaning. If 214 brings the allegations of this information within its scope, an offense is charged and the course of the Government's reasoning is beside the point.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] It is claimed that because 2 of the Act of December 11, 1926, 44 Stat. 918, which deals with the user of influence, is restricted in scope to the \"payee\" of the money or thing of value, a similar restriction must be read into 1. There is not one shred of evidence in the legislative history or in the statutes themselves to indicate that the two sections are in any way to be read \"in pari materia.\" In fact, normal principles of statutory construction tell us that the use of the word \"payee\" in 2, and its absence in 1, is convincing evidence that the provisions are different in scope and not congruent. A look at the other statutes in the bribery and graft section of 18 U.S.C. shows that the wording of other Acts directed to the receipt and offer of bribes, etc., is not identical in the statute directed to offer and that directed to receipt. Whether this would mean a difference in ultimate construction is not now our concern.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, concurring.\n\nThe argument that 214 requires the payment of money or other thing of value be made to the person who is to use his influence \"to procure\" an \"appointive office\" is not frivolous. The legislative history shows that that was one of the evils against which Congress acted. But I am also convinced that Congress moved against the other evil as well - payment to a political party for the use of \"influence to procure any appointive office.\" The abuse in appointing postmasters during the Coolidge administration was the occasion for the law; and then as now (if the allegations in the information are to be \n\n[359 \nU.S. 255, 263]\n\u00a0\n believed) payments for those offices sometimes went to the party, sometimes to a politician. As Congressman Stevenson, who later introduced the measure in the House, said in answering a question as to who gets the money paid for \"the appointive office\":\n\n\"Either it goes into his pocket and the pockets of his machine or it goes into the coffers of the Republican Party. If it does, it is the most blatant defiance of the civil service law that any party has ever had the hardihood to put over, and it is as disgraceful as the Teapot Dome proposition any day.\" 65 Cong. Rec. 1410.\n\n\n The words used in 214 are broad enough to include both evils.\n\nI have sometimes felt, as my dissents show (see United States v. Classic, \n313 \nU.S. 299, 331\n; Rosenberg v. United States, \n346 \nU.S. 273, 310\n; United States v. A & P Trucking Co., \n358 \nU.S. 121, 127\n), that the Court has not always construed a criminal statute so as to resolve doubts in favor of the citizen. But that principle - as highly preferred as any in a government of laws - does no service here. To hold the conduct charged in this information outside the Act is to find ambiguities and doubts not obvious on the face of the legislation, nor justifiably imputed from the legislative history. The inclusion in the original version of 215 of limiting words can indicate no more than that Congress intended a narrower scope for that section than for 214. It does not show that 214 was to be similarly narrowed.\n\nAccordingly I join the opinion of the Court.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK, MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER, and MR. JUSTICE STEWART join, dissenting.\n\nThe Government's primary contention in this case is that an offer to a Congressman to make contributions of \n\n[359 \nU.S. 255, 264]\n\u00a0\n money to his political party is an offer of a \"thing of value\" to that Congressman within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 214. The Court, in ignoring this contention, appears to believe that it is not supportable. The Court holds, however, that the information here involved nevertheless states an offense under 214 on either of two theories, (1) that the offer alleged is an offer of money to Congressman Stauffer (a theory not even advanced by the Government), or (2) that the Republican Party is a \"person\" within the meaning of 214, and that the offer alleged is an offer of money to that \"person.\" In light of the history of 214, and with proper regard for the principle that an essentially ambiguous criminal statute is to be strictly construed, I cannot agree that this information states an offense under 214.\n\nDealing with the Government's principal contention, which the Court by-passes, the information does not charge that Congressman Stauffer would have received any direct, tangible benefit from the payment of money to the Republican Party. The initial problem, therefore, is to decide whether the term \"thing of value\" is sufficiently broad to embrace any act which might constitute an inducement to the person to whom the offer to do the act is made. The history of the statute of which 214 was passed as a part sheds clarifying light on this problem.\n\nTitle 18 U.S.C. 214 was originally enacted as 1 of a statute (44 Stat. 918) designed to \"punish the purchase and sale of public offices.\" See H. R. Rep. No. 1366, 69th Cong., 1st Sess. Section 2 of that statute read on the \"seller\" of influence as opposed to the \"purchaser,\" and in the 1948 codification became what is now the first paragraph of 18 U.S.C. 215.\n1\n As originally enacted 2 provided:\n\n \"It shall be unlawful to solicit or receive from anyone whatsoever, either as a political contribution, \n\n[359 \nU.S. 255, 265]\n\u00a0\n or for personal emolument, any sum of money or thing of value, whatsoever, in consideration of the promise of support, or use of influence, or for the support or influence of the payee, in behalf of the person paying the money, or any other person, in obtaining any appointive office under the Government of the United States.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n I think it plain that this language would not have reached one who solicited, in consideration of the promise of his influence, a general political contribution of money to be paid directly to his party. Under such circumstances the political party would be the \"payee\" of the money, but it would be the influence of the solicitor, as opposed to that of the party, which was promised. And although the payment of money to the solicitor's party might well be \"valuable\" to him in the sense that it would induce him to exert influence, the use of the word \"payee,\" an extremely unconventional term to describe the recipient of indefinite and intangible benefits which might flow from the payment of money to another, shows that it was not contemplated that such an indirect inducement should be considered a \"thing of value\" in the statutory sense.\n\nConfirmation for this view is found in a letter of Attorney General Clark written to the Senate on February 19, 1946, in connection with an amendment to 44 Stat. 918 proposed to deal with the solicitation of fees by private employment agencies for referring persons to federal employment openings. In contrasting the language of the proposed amendment with that of 2 of 44 Stat. 918 the Attorney General was of the opinion that the solicitation provisions of the existing statute reached only the solicitation of political contributions or emoluments \"on behalf of the solicitor himself.\"\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[359 \nU.S. 255, 266]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThis proposed amendment was enacted into law in 1951. 65 Stat. 320. Its effect was merely to add to present 215 what is now the second paragraph of that section.\n3\n The amendment did not disturb the first paragraph of 215, which alone is relevant in the \"use of influence\" context, and which, as it had formerly stood in 44 Stat. 918, had been construed by the Attorney General as already indicated.\n\nIn the 1948 codification the Revisers, in carrying over into 215 of the present Code 2 of 44 Stat. 918, omitted the language which had expressly restricted its scope to a situation where the influence of the \"payee\" is promised.\n4\n But it is apparent that this omission was not \n\n[359 \nU.S. 255, 267]\n\u00a0\n intended to work a substantive change in the statute.\n5\n Under these circumstances the solicitation provisions of present 215 must be read in the light of their history, and so read they require the conclusion that their impact is restricted to \"the solicitation or receipt of compensation . . . on behalf of the solicitor himself.\"\n6\n\u00a0\n\nGiven this conclusion, I turn once more to 214, the provision directly involved in this case. The Government has strongly urged, in an effort to avoid the District Court's holding that the specific mention of \"political contribution\" in 215 implied its exclusion from the term \"thing of value\" in 214, that the two sections are plainly reciprocal and must be construed in pari materia. I agree. There is not the slightest indication in the sparse legislative history that Congress intended that the \"purchase\" and \"sale\" provisions of the statute should have different scope, nor has any reason which would reasonably support a difference in scope been suggested to us.\n7\n I \n\n[359 \nU.S. 255, 268]\n\u00a0\n cannot believe that Congress intended that although a Congressman soliciting the kind of party contribution charged in this information in return for his influence would not be covered under 215 (as the Court appears to concede is so), nevertheless the individual from whom the contribution was solicited would, by promising to make it, become guilty of a crime against the United States under 214 (as the Court now holds). For surely Congress could not have been less eager to reach corruption on the part of government officials than attempts by individuals to take advantage of that corruption. It follows that just as the solicitation of political contributions to be paid directly to a party treasury in return for the promise of the solicitor's influence is not interdicted by 215, the converse of that situation, the offering to a Congressman of a contribution payable directly to his party's treasury, in return for the promise of his influence, is not reached by 214.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nGiven these considerations, even if the Court were right in holding that the conduct here alleged is an offer of money to Congressman Stauffer I would think it wrong in going on to decide that the information states an offense under 214. Entirely apart from the statutory history, however, I think it a remarkable construction of the language of 214 to find that an offer to X to pay money to Y, with whom X is not claimed to have any \n\n[359 \nU.S. 255, 269]\n\u00a0\n financial relationship, is an offer of money to X. Under these circumstances there is an offer to X, but it is plainly an offer to perform an act (pay money to Y) rather than an offer of money to X. The statute does not say that any offer to a person involving money is rendered criminal if the other statutory criteria are met, but only that an offer of money to a person may be.\n\nMy reading of the statute makes it unnecessary to decide whether, as the Government further contends and the Court holds, the Republican Party is a \"person\" within the meaning of 214, although I would have considerable difficulty in holding that what is characterized by the Court as an \"amorphous group of individuals\" fits within this term, particularly when Congress saw fit explicitly to add references to \"firm\" and \"corporation\" to secure the inclusion of these entities.\n9\n I think that the use of the words \"of the payee\" in what is now 215 merely made explicit what was intended to be implicit in 214 - that the \"influence\" sought must be that of the \"person, firm, or corporation\" to whom any money or thing of value is promised or paid.\n10\n And although the information does not charge in terms that it was the influence of Congressman Stauffer, as opposed to that of the Republican Party, which was sought by appellee, it is clear from the brief and argument of the Government in this Court that it stands on the former construction of the information.\n\nIt is of course true, as the Government argues, that relatively indirect and subtle inducements may contain the seeds of the same mischief as the crudest bribery. But \"it would be dangerous, indeed, to carry the principle, \n\n[359 \nU.S. 255, 270]\n\u00a0\n that a case which is within the reason or mischief of a statute, is within its provisions, so far as to punish a crime not enumerated in the statute, because it is of equal atrocity, or of kindred character, with those which are enumerated.\" United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76, 96. In light of the considerations discussed above it cannot be said that Congress in 18 U.S.C. 214 has unequivocally seen fit to outlaw conduct of the kind charged in this information.\n11\n The most that can be said in favor of the Government's position is that the statute is highly ambiguous in the respect involved here, and this in any event should require rejection of the Government's position under principles discussed in Bell v. United States, \n349 \nU.S. 81\n. I would affirm.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Note 4, infra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Attorney General wrote: \"Further, under the proposed language, the solicitation or receipt of compensation, either on behalf of the solicitor or another, would be prohibited, whereas the existing \n\n[359 \nU.S. 255, 266]\n\u00a0\n law merely prohibits the solicitation or receipt of compensation, either as a political contribution or personal emolument on behalf of the solicitor himself.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\nThe Attorney General's letter first appears in S. Rep. No. 1036, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., and was carried over into a series of Senate Reports on bills embodying the proposed amendment. S. Rep. No. 2, 80th Cong., 1st Sess.; S. Rep. No. 7, 81st Cong., 1st Sess.; S. Rep. No. 3, 82d Cong., 1st Sess.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] That paragraph provides:\n\n\"Whoever solicits or receives any thing of value in consideration of aiding a person to obtain employment under the United States either by referring his name to an executive department or agency of the United States or by requiring the payment of a fee because such person has secured such employment shall be fined not more than $1,000, or imprisoned not more than one year, or both. This section shall not apply to such services rendered by an employment agency pursuant to the written request of an executive department or agency of the United States.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The relevant portion of 18 U.S.C. 215 reads:\n\n\"Whoever solicits or receives, either as a political contribution, or for personal emolument, any money or thing of value, in consideration of the promise of support or use of influence in obtaining for any person any appointive office or place under the United States, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The Reviser's Note refers expressly to other substantive changes made in the section at the time of codification, and appears to class the omission of the \"payee\" language under \"changes in style.\"\n\nIt is also noteworthy that the Senate Report on the bill which became the \"employment agency\" amendment to 215 in the 82d Congress, three years after the codification of Title 18, contained the letter of the Attorney General construing the precodification language with no suggestion that the meaning of that language had been altered by the changes made at the time of codification. See S. Rep. No. 3, 82d Cong., 1st Sess.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] See Note 2, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] That the two provisions are reciprocal is further shown by the fact that the same substantive and stylistic changes were made in both of them in 1948, the Reviser's Note under 215 merely incorporating that under 214 by reference.\n\nIt is argued that this conclusion is controverted by the circumstance that on the same day as 44 Stat. 918 was introduced, another bill, also 44 Stat. 918 (now 5 U.S.C. 21a), was also introduced requiring those appointed to public office under the United States to file affidavits that they had not paid any consideration to anyone in the \n\n[359 \nU.S. 255, 268]\n\u00a0\n expectation of receiving appointment, and that the two bills were described as \"correlative.\" There is no reason to take the word \"correlative\" to imply an identity of scope between the two bills, since the word equally well bears the interpretation that 5 U.S.C. 21a was intended to be merely supplementary to the criminal provisions of 214 and 215. Indeed, it is on its face broader than 214 in its reference to mere \"assistance\" as opposed to \"influence.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] This is not, of course, to suggest that an offer of a \"political contribution\" to a Congressman's personal campaign fund in return for his promise of influence would be without the scope of 214, or that the solicitation of such a contribution would not fall within 215.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] All of the cases cited by the Court in this connection involve clearly defined entities - not \"amorphous\" groups.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] It is apparent that the Revisers believed that the omission of the words \"of the payee\" in the recodification of 44 Stat. 918 added nothing to the meaning of 215. See p. 266, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] The Court derives support for its holding from various statements concerning official corruption in office selling made on the floor of the House of Representatives some two years before the passage of the bill which is now 214 and 215. Since these statements were directed exclusively to revelations of corruption on the part of sellers of influence and the Court appears to concede that the seller of influence is not covered by 215 unless he is a \"payee,\" it is difficult to see how these statements can be utilized to support a broader reading of 214. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 255, 271]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","202":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v.

Pursuant to state procedure, he was brought before a state court. There he did not plead the privilege against self-incrimination but claimed that the investigation was beyond the power of the State, that the resolution was too vague, that the documents sought were not relevant to the inquiry, and that to compel him to produce them would violate his rights of free speech and association. These claims were decided against him and, persisting in his refusal, he was adjudged guilty of civil contempt and ordered committed to jail until he complied with the order. Held: The judgment and sentence are sustained. Pp. 73-82.\n\n (a) The New Hampshire Subversive Activities Act of 1951 and the resolution authorizing and directing the State Attorney General to investigate violations thereof have not been superseded by the Smith Act, as amended.

Coe filed a brief for the National Lawyers Guild, as amicus curiae, urging reversal.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case is here again on appeal from a judgment of civil contempt entered against appellant by the Merrimack County Court and affirmed by the Supreme Court of New Hampshire. It arises out of appellant's refusal to produce certain documents before a New Hampshire legislative investigating committee which was authorized and directed to determine, inter alia, whether there were subversive persons or organizations present in the State of New Hampshire. Upon the first appeal from the New Hampshire court, 100 N. H. 436, 130 A. 2d 278, we vacated the judgment and remanded the case to it, \n355 \nU.S. 16\n, for consideration in the light of Sweezy v. New Hampshire, \n354 \nU.S. 234\n (1957). That court reaffirmed its former decision, 101 N. H. 139, 136 A. 2d 221, deeming Sweezy not to control the issues in the instant case. For \n\n[360 \nU.S. 72, 74]\n\u00a0\n reasons which will appear, we agree with the Supreme Court of New Hampshire.\n\nAs in Sweezy, the Attorney General of New Hampshire, who had been constituted a one-man legislative investigating committee by Joint Resolution of the Legislature,\n1\n was conducting a probe of subversive activities in the State. In the course of his investigation the Attorney General called appellant, Executive Director of World Fellowship, Inc., a voluntary corporation organized under the laws of New Hampshire and maintaining a summer camp in the State. Appellant testified concerning his own activities, but refused to comply with two subpoenas duces tecum which called for the production of certain corporate records for the years 1954 and 1955. The information sought consisted of: (1) a list of the names of all the camp's nonprofessional employees for those two summer seasons; (2) the correspondence which appellant had carried on with and concerning those persons who came to the camp as speakers; and (3) the names of all persons who attended the camp during the same periods of time. Met with appellant's refusal, the Attorney General, in accordance with state procedure, N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann., c. 491, 19, 20, petitioned the Merrimack County Court to call appellant before it and require compliance with the subpoenas.\n\nIn court, appellant again refused to produce the information. He claimed that by the Smith Act,\n2\n as construed \n\n[360 \nU.S. 72, 75]\n\u00a0\n by this Court in Pennsylvania v. Nelson, \n350 \nU.S. 497\n (1956), Congress had so completely occupied the field of subversive activities that the States were without power to investigate in that area. Additionally, he contended that the Due Process Clause precluded enforcement of the subpoenas, first, because the resolution under which the Attorney General was authorized to operate was vague and, second, because the documents sought were not relevant to the inquiry. Finally, appellant argued that enforcement would violate his rights of free speech and association.\n\nThe Merrimack County Court sustained appellant's objection to the production of the names of the nonprofessional employees. The Attorney General took no appeal from that ruling, and it is not before us. Appellant's objections to the production of the names of the camp's guests were overruled, and he was ordered to produce them. Upon his refusal, he was adjudged in contempt of court and ordered committed to jail until he should have complied with the court order. On the demand for the correspondence and the objection thereto, the trial court made no ruling but transferred the question to the Supreme Court of New Hampshire. That court affirmed the trial court's action in regard to the guest list. Concerning the requested production of the correspondence, the Supreme Court entered no order, but directed that on remand the trial court \"may exercise its discretion with respect to the entry of an order to enforce the command of the subpoena for the production of correspondence.\" 100 N. H., at 448, 130 A. 2d, at 287. No remand having yet been effected, the trial court has not acted upon this phase of the case, and there is no final judgment requiring the appellant to produce the letters. We therefore do not treat with that question, 28 U.S.C. 1257. See Radio Station WOW v. Johnson, \n326 \nU.S. 120, 123\n-124 (1945). We now pass to a consideration of the sole \n\n[360 \nU.S. 72, 76]\n\u00a0\n question before us, namely, the validity of the order of contempt for refusal to produce the list of guests at World Fellowship, Inc., during the summer seasons of 1954 and 1955. In addition to the arguments appellant made to the trial court, he urges here that the \"indefinite sentence\" imposed upon him constitutes such cruel and unusual punishment as to be a denial of due process.\n\nAppellant vigorously contends that the New Hampshire Subversive Activities Act of 1951\n3\n and the resolution creating the committee have been superseded by the Smith Act, as amended.\n4\n In support of this position appellant cites Pennsylvania v. Nelson, supra. The argument is that Nelson, which involved a prosecution under a state sedition law, held that \"Congress has intended to occupy the field of sedition.\" This rule of decision, it is contended, should embrace legislative investigations made pursuant to an effort by the Legislature to inform itself of the presence of subversives within the State and possibly to enact laws in the subversive field. The appellant's argument sweeps too broad. In Nelson itself we said that the \"precise holding of the court . . . is that the Smith Act . . . which prohibits the knowing advocacy of the overthrow of the Government of the United States by force and violence, supersedes the enforceability of the Pennsylvania Sedition Act which proscribed the same conduct.\" (Italics supplied.) \n350 \nU.S., at 499\n. The basis of Nelson thus rejects the notion that it stripped the States of the right to protect themselves. All the opinion proscribed was a race between federal and state prosecutors to the courthouse door. The opinion made clear that a State could proceed with prosecutions for sedition against the State itself; that it can legitimately investigate in this area follows a fortiori. In Sweezy v. New Hampshire, supra, where the same contention was made \n\n[360 \nU.S. 72, 77]\n\u00a0\n as to the identical state Act, it was denied sub silentio. Nor did our opinion in Nelson hold that the Smith Act had proscribed state activity in protection of itself either from actual or threatened \"sabotage or attempted violence of all kinds.\" In footnote 8 of the opinion it is pointed out that the State had full power to deal with internal civil disturbances. Thus registration statutes, quo warranto proceedings as to subversive corporations, the subversive instigation of riots and a host of other subjects directly affecting state security furnish grist for the State's legislative mill. Moreover, the right of the State to require the production of corporate papers of a state-chartered corporation in an inquiry to determine whether corporate activity is violative of state policy is, of course, not touched upon in Nelson and today stands unimpaired, either by the Smith Act or the Nelson opinion.\n\nAppellant's other objections can be capsuled into the single question of whether New Hampshire, under the facts here, is precluded from compelling the production of the documents by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Let us first clear away some of the underbrush necessarily surrounding the case because of its setting.\n\nFirst, the academic and political freedoms discussed in Sweezy v. New Hampshire, supra, are not present here in the same degree, since World Fellowship is neither a university nor a political party. Next, since questions concerning the authority of the committee to act as it did are questions of state law, Dreyer v. Illinois, \n187 \nU.S. 71, 84\n (1902), we accept as controlling the New Hampshire Supreme Court's conclusion that \"[t]he legislative history makes it clear beyond a reasonable doubt that it [the Legislature] did and does desire an answer to these questions.\" 101 N. H., at 140, 136 A. 2d, at 221-222. Finally, we assume, without deciding, that Uphaus had sufficient standing to assert any rights of the guests whose \n\n[360 \nU.S. 72, 78]\n\u00a0\n identity the committee seeks to determine. See National Association for the Advancement of Colored People v. Alabama, \n357 \nU.S. 449\n (1958). The interest of the guests at World Fellowship in their associational privacy having been asserted, we have for decision the federal question of whether the public interests overbalance these conflicting private ones. Whether there was \"justification\" for the production order turns on the \"substantiality\" of New Hampshire's interests in obtaining the identity of the guests when weighed against the individual interests which the appellant asserts. National Association for the Advancement of Colored People v. Alabama, supra.\n\nWhat was the interest of the State? The Attorney General was commissioned\n5\n to determine if there were any subversive persons\n6\n within New Hampshire. The obvious starting point of such an inquiry was to learn what persons were within the State. It is therefore clear that the requests relate directly to the Legislature's area of interest, i. e., the presence of subversives in the State, as announced in its resolution. Nor was the demand of the subpoena burdensome; as to time, only a few months of each of the two years were involved; as to place, only the camp conducted by the Corporation; nor as to the lists of names, which included about 300 each year. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 72, 79]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMoreover, the Attorney General had valid reason to believe that the speakers and guests at World Fellowship might be subversive persons within the meaning of the New Hampshire Act. The Supreme Court of New Hampshire found Uphaus' contrary position \"unrelated to reality.\" Although the evidence as to the nexus between World Fellowship and subversive activities may not be conclusive, we believe it sufficiently relevant to support the Attorney General's action. The New Hampshire definition of subversive persons was born of the legislative determination that the Communist movement posed a serious threat to the security of the State. The record reveals that appellant had participated in \"Communist front\" activities and that \"[n]to less than nineteen speakers invited by Uphaus to talk at World Fellowship had either been members of the Communist Party or had connections or affiliations with it or with one or more of the organizations cited as subversive or Communist controlled in the United States Attorney General's list.\" 100 N. H., at 442, 130 A. 2d, at 283. While the Attorney General's list is designed for the limited purpose of determining fitness for federal employment, Wieman v. Updegraff, \n344 \nU.S. 183\n (1952), and guilt by association remains a thoroughly discredited doctrine, it is with a legislative investigation - not a criminal prosecution - that we deal here. Certainly the investigatory power of the State need not be constricted until sufficient evidence of subversion is gathered to justify the institution of criminal proceedings.\n\nThe nexus between World Fellowship and subversive activities disclosed by the record furnished adequate justification for the investigation we here review. The Attorney General sought to learn if subversive persons were in the State because of the legislative determination that such persons, statutorily defined with a view toward the Communist Party, posed a serious threat to the security \n\n[360 \nU.S. 72, 80]\n\u00a0\n of the State. The investigation was, therefore, undertaken in the interest of self-preservation, \"the ultimate value of any society,\" Dennis v. United States, \n341 \nU.S. 494, 509\n (1951). This governmental interest outweighs individual rights in an associational privacy which, however real in other circumstances, cf. National Association for the Advancement of Colored People v. Alabama, supra, were here tenuous at best. The camp was operating as a public one, furnishing both board and lodging to persons applying therefor. As to them, New Hampshire law requires that World Fellowship, Inc., maintain a register, open to inspection of sheriffs and police officers.\n7\n It is contended that the list might be \"circulated throughout the states and the Attorney Generals throughout the states have cross-indexed files, so that any guest whose name is mentioned in that kind of proceeding immediately becomes suspect, even in his own place of residence.\" Record, p. 7. The record before us, however, only reveals a report to the Legislature of New Hampshire made by the Attorney General in accordance with the requirements of the resolution. We recognize, of course, that compliance with the subpoena will result in exposing the fact that the persons therein named were guests at World Fellowship. But so long as a committee must report to its legislative \n\n[360 \nU.S. 72, 81]\n\u00a0\n parent, exposure - in the sense of disclosure - is an inescapable incident of an investigation into the presence of subversive persons within a State. And the governmental interest in self-preservation is sufficiently compelling to subordinate the interest in associational privacy of persons who, at least to the extent of the guest registration statute, made public at the inception the association they now wish to keep private. In the light of such a record we conclude that the State's interest has not been \"pressed, in this instance, to a point where it has come into fatal collision with the overriding\" constitutionally protected rights of appellant and those he may represent. Cantwell v. Connecticut, \n310 \nU.S. 296, 307\n (1940).\n\nWe now reach the question of the validity of the sentence. The judgment of contempt orders the appellant confined until he produces the documents called for in the subpoenas. He himself admitted to the court that although they were at hand, not only had he failed to bring them with him to court, but that, further, he had no intention of producing them. In view of appellant's unjustified refusal we think the order a proper one. As was said in Green v. United States, \n356 \nU.S. 165, 197\n (1958) (dissenting opinion):\n\n \"Before going any further, perhaps it should be emphasized that we are not at all concerned with the power of courts to impose conditional imprisonment for the purpose of compelling a person to obey a valid order. Such coercion, where the defendant carries the keys to freedom in his willingness to comply with the court's directive, is essentially a civil remedy designed for the benefit of other parties and has quite properly been exercised for centuries to secure compliance with judicial decrees.\"\n\n\n We have concluded that the committee's demand for the documents was a legitimate one; it follows that the judgment of contempt for refusal to produce them is valid. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 72, 82]\n\u00a0\n We do not impugn appellant's good faith in the assertion of what he believed to be his rights. But three courts have disagreed with him in interpreting those rights. If appellant chooses to abide by the result of the adjudication and obey the order of New Hampshire's courts, he need not face jail. If, however, he continues to disobey, we find on this record no constitutional objection to the exercise of the traditional remedy of contempt to secure compliance.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court convened:\n\n\"That the attorney general is hereby authorized and directed to make full and complete investigation with respect to violations of the subversive activities act of 1951 and to determine whether subversive persons as defined in said act are presently located within this state. . . .\" N. H. Laws, 1953, c. 307.\n\n\n The investigation authorized by this resolution was continued by N. H. Laws, 1955, c. 197.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 18 U.S.C. 2385 (1956).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann., 1955, c. 588, 1-16.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Note 2, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Note 1, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Section 1 of the Subversive Activities Act, N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann., 1955, c. 588, 1-16, defines \"subversive person\":\n\n\"`Subversive person' means any person who commits, attempts to commit, or aids in the commission, or advocates, abets, advises or teaches, by any means any person to commit, attempt to commit, or aid in the commission of any act intended to overthrow, destroy or alter, or to assist in the overthrow, destruction or alteration of, the constitutional form of the government of the United States, or of the state of New Hampshire, or any political subdivision of either of them, by force, or violence; or who is a member of a subversive organization or a foreign subversive organization.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Since 1927, there has been in effect the following statute in New Hampshire:\n\n\"All hotel keepers and all persons keeping public lodging houses, tourist camps, or cabins shall keep a book or card system and cause each guest to sign therein his own legal name or name by which he is commonly known. Said book or card system shall at all times be open to the inspection of the sheriff or his deputies and to any police officer. . . .\" N. H. Rev. Stat. Ann., 1955, c. 353, 3.\n\n\n The Attorney General represents that the public camp of World Fellowship, Inc., is clearly within the purview of this statute. Although the lists sought were more extensive than those required by the statute, it appears that most of the names were recorded pursuant to it.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS join, dissenting.\n\nThe Court holds today that the constitutionally protected rights of speech and assembly of appellant and those whom he may represent are to be subordinated to New Hampshire's legislative investigation because, as applied in the demands made on him, the investigation is rationally connected with a discernible legislative purpose. With due respect for my Brothers' views, I do not agree that a showing of any requisite legislative purpose or other state interest that constitutionally can subordinate appellant's rights is to be found in this record. Exposure purely for the sake of exposure is not such a valid subordinating purpose. Watkins v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 178, 187\n, 200; Sweezy v. New Hampshire, \n354 \nU.S. 234\n; NAACP v. Alabama, \n357 \nU.S. 449\n. This record, I think, not only fails to reveal any interest of the State sufficient to subordinate appellant's constitutionally protected rights, but affirmatively shows that the investigatory objective was the impermissible one of exposure for exposure's sake. I therefore dissent from the judgment of the Court.\n\nI fully appreciate the delicacy of the judicial task of questioning the workings of a legislative investigation. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 72, 83]\n\u00a0\n A proper regard for the primacy of the legislative function in its own field, and for the broad scope of the investigatory power to achieve legislative ends, necessarily should constrain the judiciary to indulge every reasonable intendment in favor of the validity of legislative inquiry. However, our frame of government also imposes another inescapable duty upon the judiciary, that of protecting the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and assembly from improper invasion, whether by the national or the state legislatures. See Watkins v. United States, supra; Sweezy v. New Hampshire, supra; NAACP v. Alabama, supra. Where that invasion is as clear as I think this record discloses, the appellant is entitled to our judgment of reversal.\n\nJudicial consideration of the collision of the investigatory function with constitutionally protected rights of speech and assembly is a recent development in our constitutional law. The Court has often examined the validity under the Federal Constitution of federal and state statutes and executive action imposing criminal and other traditional sanctions on conduct alleged to be protected by the guarantees of freedom of speech and of assembly. The role of the state-imposed sanctions of imprisonment, fines and prohibitory injunctions directed against association or speech and their limitations under the First and Fourteenth Amendments has been canvassed quite fully, beginning as early as Gitlow v. New York, \n268 \nU.S. 652\n, and Near v. Minnesota, \n283 \nU.S. 697\n. And other state action, such as deprivation of public employment and the denial of admission to a profession, has also been recognized as being subject to the restraints of the Constitution. See, e. g., Wieman v. Updegraff, \n344 \nU.S. 183\n; cf. Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, \n353 \nU.S. 232\n.\n\nBut only recently has the Court been required to begin a full exploration of the impact of the governmental \n\n[360 \nU.S. 72, 84]\n\u00a0\n investigatory function on these freedoms.\n1\n Here is introduced the weighty consideration that the power of investigation, whether exercised in aid of the governmental legislative power, see Watkins v. United States, supra, or in aid of the governmental power to adjudicate disputes, see NAACP v. Alabama, supra, is vital to the functioning of free governments and is therefore necessarily broad. But where the exercise of the investigatory power collides with constitutionally guaranteed freedoms, that power too has inevitable limitations, and the delicate and always difficult accommodation of the two with minimum sacrifice of either is the hard task of the judiciary and ultimately of this Court.\n\nIt was logical that the adverse effects of unwanted publicity - of exposure - as concomitants of the exercise of the investigatory power, should come to be recognized, in certain circumstances, as invading protected freedoms and offending constitutional inhibitions upon governmental actions. For in an era of mass communications and mass opinion, and of international tensions and domestic anxiety, exposure and group identification by the state of those holding unpopular and dissident views are fraught with such serious consequences for the individual as inevitably to inhibit seriously the expression of views which the Constitution intended to make free. Cf. Speiser v. Randall, \n357 \nU.S. 513, 526\n. We gave expression to this truism in NAACP v. Alabama: \"This Court has recognized the vital relationship between freedom to associate and privacy in one's associations. . . . Inviolability of privacy in group association may in many \n\n[360 \nU.S. 72, 85]\n\u00a0\n circumstances be indispensable to preservation of freedom of association, particularly where a group espouses dissident beliefs.\" \n357 \nU.S., at 462\n.\n\nOf course, the considerations entering into the weighing of the interests concerned are different where the problem is one of state exposure in the area of assembly and expression from where the problem is that of evaluating a state criminal or regulatory statute in these areas. Government must have freedom to make an appropriate investigation where there appears a rational connection with the lawmaking process, the processes of adjudication, or other essential governmental functions. In the investigatory stage of the legislative process, for example, the specific interest of the State and the final legislative means to be chosen to implement it are almost by definition not precisely defined at the start of the inquiry, and due allowance must accordingly be made. Also, when exposure is evaluated judicially as a governmental sanction, there should be taken into account the differences between it and the more traditional state-inflicted pains and penalties. True it is, therefore, that any line other than a universal subordination of free expression and association to the asserted interests of the State in investigation and exposure will be difficult of definition; but this Court has rightly turned its back on the alternative of universal subordination of protected interests, and we must define rights in this area the best we can. The problem is one in its nature calling for traditional case-by-case development of principles in the various permutations of circumstances where the conflict may appear. But guide lines must be marked out by the courts. \"This is the inescapable judicial task in giving substantive content, legally enforced, to the Due Process Clause, and it is a task ultimately committed to this Court.\" Sweezy v. New Hampshire, \n354 \nU.S. 234, 267\n (concurring opinion). On the facts of this case I think \n\n[360 \nU.S. 72, 86]\n\u00a0\n that New Hampshire's investigation, as applied to the appellant, was demonstrably and clearly outside the wide limits of the power which must be conceded to the State even though it be attended by some exposure. In demonstration of this I turn to the detailed examination of the facts which this case requires.\n\nThe appellant, Uphaus, is Executive Director of a group called World Fellowship which runs a discussion program at a summer camp in New Hampshire, at which the public is invited to stay. Various speakers come to the camp primarily for discussion of political, economic and social matters. The appellee reports that Uphaus and some of the speakers have been said by third persons to have a history of association with \"Communist front\" movements, to have followed the \"Communist line,\" signed amnesty petitions and amicus curiae briefs, and carried on similar activities of a sort which have recently been viewed hostilely and suspiciously by many Americans. A strain of pacifism runs through the appellant's thinking, and the appellee apparently would seek to determine whether there should be drawn therefrom an inference of harm for our institutions; he conjectures, officially, whether \"the advocacy of this so-called peace crusade is for the purpose of achieving a quicker and a cheaper occupation by the Soviet Union and Communism.\" There is no evidence that any activity of a sort that violates the law of New Hampshire or could in fact be constitutionally punished went on at the camp. What is clear is that there was some sort of assemblage at the camp that was oriented toward the discussion of political and other public matters. The activities going on were those of private citizens. The views expounded obviously were minority views. But the assemblage was, on its face, for purposes to which the First and Fourteenth Amendments give constitutional protection against incursion \n\n[360 \nU.S. 72, 87]\n\u00a0\n by the powers of government. Cf. Sweezy v. New Hampshire, supra, at 249-251.\n\nThe investigation with which this case is concerned was undertaken under authority of a 1953 Resolution of the New Hampshire General Court, N. H. Laws 1953, c. 307, and extended by an enactment in 1955, N. H. Laws, 1955, c. 197. The Resolution directed the Attorney General of the State (appellee here) to make a \"full and complete investigation\" of \"violations of the subversive activities act of 1951\"\n2\n and to determine whether \"subversive persons \n\n[360 \nU.S. 72, 88]\n\u00a0\n as defined in said act are presently located within the state.\" Under New Hampshire law, this constituted the Attorney General (who is ordinarily the chief law-enforcement official of the State) a one-man legislative committee. The sanctions of prosecution of individuals and dissolution of organizations for violation of the 1951 law seem to have been discarded, with the passage of the Resolution, in favor of the sanction of exposure. A provision of the 1951 Act providing for confidential treatment of material reflecting on individuals' loyalty was made inapplicable to the investigation the Attorney General was directed to conduct, and the Attorney General was authorized in sweeping terms to give publicity to the details of his investigation. A report to the Legislature of the fruits of the investigation was to be made on the first day of the 1955 legislative session; the 1955 extension called for a similar report to the 1957 session.\n3\n Efforts to obtain from the appellant the disclosures relative to World Fellowship in controversy here began during the period covered by the 1953 Resolution, but his final refusal and the proceeding for contempt under review here occurred during the extension.\n\nThe fruits of the first two years of the investigation were delivered to the Legislature in a comprehensive volume on January 5, 1955. The Attorney General urges this report on our consideration as extremely relevant to a consideration of the investigation as it relates to appellant. I think that this is quite the case; the report is an official indication of the nature of the investigation and is, in fact, the stated objective of the duty assigned by the Resolution to the Attorney General. It was with this \n\n[360 \nU.S. 72, 89]\n\u00a0\n report before it that the Legislature renewed the investigation, and it must be taken as characterizing the nature of the investigation before us. The report proper is divided into numerous sections. First is a series of general and introductory essays by various authors entitled \"Pertinent Aspects of World Communism Today.\" Essays discuss \"The Nature of the Russian Threat\"; \"The Role of the Communist Front Organizations\"; \"Some Important Aspects of Marxism and Marxism-Leninism\"; \"The Test of a Front Organization\"; and \"Communism vs. Religion.\" General descriptive matter on the Communist Party in New Hampshire follows. It hardly needs to be said that this introductory material would focus attention on the whole report in terms of \"Communism\" regardless of what was said about the individuals later named. Next comes a general section titled \"Communist Influence in a Field of Education\" which is replete with names and biographical material of individuals; a similar section on \"Communist Influence in the Field of Labor\"; and one more generically captioned \"Organizations,\" in which various details as to the appellant, his organization, and others associated in it are presented. Last comes a section entitled \"Individuals\" in which biographical sketches of 23 persons are presented.\n\nThe introductory matter in the volume, to put the matter mildly, showed consciousness of the practical effect of the change of policy from judicial prosecution to exposure by the Attorney General of persons reported to be connected with groups charged to be \"subversive\" or \"substantially Communist-influenced.\" Virtually the entire \"Letter of Transmittal\" of the Attorney General addressed itself to discussing the policy used in the report in disclosing the names of individuals. The Attorney General drew a significant distinction as to the names he would disclose: \"Persons with past membership or affiliation with the Communist Party or substantially \n\n[360 \nU.S. 72, 90]\n\u00a0\n Communist-influenced groups have not been disclosed in this report where those persons have provided assistance to the investigation. It is felt that no good reasons exist requiring a listing of names of cooperative witnesses in these categories.\" A \"Foreword\" declared that \"[t]his report deals with a controversial subject,\" and, concentrating on the fact that the report contained an extensive list of persons, their addresses, and miscellaneous activities and associations attributed to them, made several disclaimers. The report was not to be considered an indictment of any individual, the Attorney General suitably pointing out that a grand jury was the only authority in New Hampshire having the formal power of indictment. Nor was it \"the result of an inquisition. No witness in this investigation has ever, at any time, been treated other than courteously.\" Finally, the Attorney General stressed that \"[t]he reporting of facts herein does NOT (nor should it be taken to by any reader) constitute a charge against any witness.\" He observed that \"facts are facts . . . . Conclusions of opprobrium relative to any individual, while within the privilege of personal opinion, are neither recommended nor intended to be encouraged by any phraseology of this report.\" In fact, the listing of names might well contain the names of many innocent people, implied the Attorney General. This was permissible, he believed, because, as interpreted in the courts of New Hampshire, \"the scope of relevant questioning in the investigation goes far beyond the requirements of individual felonious intention. In fact, the General Court has directed that inquiry be made to determine the extent of innocent or ignorant membership, affiliation or support of subversive organizations . . . .\"\n\nThe report certainly is one that would be suggested by the quoted parts of the foreword. No opinion was, as a matter of course, expressed by the Attorney General as to whether any person named therein was in fact a \n\n[360 \nU.S. 72, 91]\n\u00a0\n \"subversive person\" within the meaning of the statute. The report did not disclose whether any indictments under the 1951 Act would be sought against any person. Its sole recommendations for legislation were for a broad evidentiary statute to be applied in trials of persons under the State Act as \"subversive,\" which cannot really be said to have been the fruit of the investigation, being copied from a then recent Act of Congress,\n4\n and which made apparently no change in the 1951 law's standard of guilt, and for an immunity measure calculated to facilitate future investigations. The report, once the introductory material on Communism is done with, contains primarily an assorted list of names with descriptions of what had been said about the named persons. In most cases, the caveat of the Attorney General that the information should not be understood as indicating a violation of the New Hampshire Subversive Activities Act was, to say the least, well-taken, in the light of the conduct ascribed to them. Many of the biographical summaries would strike a discerning analyst as very mild stuff indeed. In many cases, a positive diligence was demonstrated in efforts to add the names of individuals to a list and then render a Scotch verdict of \"not proven\" in regard to them. The most vivid example of this is the material relating to the appellant's group, World Fellowship. After some introductory pages, there comes extensive biographical material relating to the reported memberships, associations, advocacies, and signings of open letters on the part of certain speakers at the World Fellowship camp. A very few had admitted membership in the Communist Party, or had been \"identified\" as being members by third persons generally not named. Others were said to be or to have been members of \"Communist influenced,\" \"front,\" or \"officially cited\" groups. Some were said \n\n[360 \nU.S. 72, 92]\n\u00a0\n to have signed open letters and petitions against deportations, to have criticized the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to have given free medical treatment to Communist Party officials, and the like. Finally the report addresses itself to the remainder of the speakers: \"Information easily available to this office does not indicate records of affiliation with or support of Communist causes on the part of these people. However, due to the burden of work imposed on the staff of the House Committee on Un-American Activities by thousands of such requests received from all over the country, it has not been possible to check each of these persons thoroughly. Inasmuch as no committee or public agency can hope to have all the information in its files concerning all subversive activity all over this country, it is not possible for this office to guarantee that the following individuals do not have such activity in their backgrounds. Therefore, it is necessary to report their identities to the General Court, with the explanation that based upon what information we have been able to assemble, the following individuals would appear at this time to be the usual contingent of `dupes' and unsuspecting persons that surround almost every venture that is instigated or propelled by the `perennials' and articulate apologists for Communists and Soviet chicanery, but of this fact we are not certain. This list does not include the many persons who were merely guests . . . .\" The names of 36 persons with their addresses then followed.\n5\n\u00a0\n\n[360 \nU.S. 72, 93]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe emphasis of the entire report is on individual guilt, individual near-guilt, and individual questionable behavior. Its flavor and tone, regardless of its introductory disclaimers, cannot help but stimulate readers \n\n[360 \nU.S. 72, 94]\n\u00a0\n to attach a \"badge of infamy,\" Wieman v. Updegraff, \n344 \nU.S. 183, 190\n-191, to the persons named in it. The authorizing Resolution requested that the Attorney General address himself to ascertaining whether there were \"subversive persons\" in New Hampshire, and the report indicates that this was interpreted as the making of lists of persons who were either classifiable in this amorphous category, or almost so, and the presenting of the result, as a public, official document, to the Legislature, and to the public generally. The main thrust of the Resolution itself was in terms of individual behavior - violation of the 1951 Act and the presence, in the State, of \"subversive persons,\" were the objects of investigation. The collection of such data, and of data having some peripheral reference to it, with explicit detail as to names and places, was what the Attorney General set himself to doing in response to it. As the report itself stated, \"A very considerable amount of questioning is absolutely essential to separate the wheat from the chaff in applying the legislative formula to individual conduct which involves that part of the spectrum very close to the line of subversive conduct. Only through such questioning is it possible to be able to report to the Legislature whether the activity of a given individual has been subversive or not subversive; whether or not intentionally so or knowingly so on his \n\n[360 \nU.S. 72, 95]\n\u00a0\n part.\" One must feel, on reading the report, that the first sentence - \"A very considerable amount of questioning is absolutely essential . . . in applying the legislative formula to individual conduct which involves that part of the spectrum very close to the line of subversive conduct\" - is a serious overstatement, because in the usual citation of a person in the report no expression of his innocence or guilt, or his precise coloration in the Attorney General's spectrum was given. But still the report was made in terms of the activity of named individuals. Of course, if the Attorney General had information relating to guilt under the statute, he was empowered to seek indictment and conviction of the offenders in criminal proceedings, in which of course the normal rights afforded criminal defendants and the normal limitations on state prosecution for conduct related to political association and expression, under the Constitution, would apply. The citation of names in the book does not appear to have any relation to the possibility of an orthodox or traditional criminal prosecution, and the Attorney General seems to acknowledge this. The investigation in question here was not one ancillary to a prosecution - to grand jury or trial procedure. If it had been, if a definite prosecution were undertaken, we would have that narrowed context in which to relate the State's demand for exposure. Cf. NAACP v. Alabama, supra, at 464-465. This process of relation is part and parcel of examining the \"substantiality\" of the State's interest in the concrete context in which it is alleged. But here we are without the aid of such a precise issue and our task requires that we look further to ascertain whether this legislative investigation, as applied in the demands made upon the appellant, is connected rationally with a discernible general legislative end to which the rights of the appellant and those whom he may represent can constitutionally be subordinated. \n\n[360 \nU.S. 72, 96]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Legislature, upon receiving the report, extended the investigation for a further two years. It was during this period that the refusals of the appellant to furnish information with which we are now concerned took place. The Attorney General had already published the names of speakers at the World Fellowship camp. Now he wanted the correspondence between Uphaus and the speakers. The Attorney General admitted that it was unlikely that the correspondence between Uphaus and the speakers was going to contain a damning admission of a purpose to advocate the overthrow of the government (presumably of New Hampshire) by force and violence. He said that it might indicate a sinister purpose behind the advocacy of pacifism - \"the purpose of achieving a quicker and a cheaper occupation by the Soviet Union and Communism.\" The guest list, the nonavailability of which to the Attorney General was commented on in the passage from the 1955 report quoted above,\n6\n was also desired. Appellant's counsel, at the hearing in court giving rise to the contempt finding under review, protested that appellant did not want to allow the Attorney General to have the names to expose them. The Attorney General also wished the names of the nonprofessional help at the camp - the cooks and dishwashers and the like. It was objected that the cooks and dishwashers were hired from the local labor pool and that if such employment were attended by a trip to the Attorney General's office and the possibility of public exposure, help might become hard to find at the camp. This last objection was sustained in the trial court, but the other two inquiries were allowed and appellant's failure to respond to the one relating to the guest list was found contemptuous.\n\nFirst. The Court seems to experience difficulty in discerning that appellant has any standing to plead the rights \n\n[360 \nU.S. 72, 97]\n\u00a0\n of free speech and association he does because the material he seeks to withhold may technically belong to World Fellowship, Inc., a corporation, and may relate to the protected activities of other persons, rather than those of himself. In NAACP v. Alabama, supra, a corporation was permitted to represent its membership in pleading their rights to freedom of association for public purposes. Here appellant, as a corporate officer if one will, seeks to protect a list of those who have assembled together for public discussion on the corporation's premises. Of course this is not technically a membership list, but to distinguish NAACP v. Alabama on this ground is to miss its point. The point is that if the members of the assemblage could only plead their assembly rights themselves, the very interest being safeguarded by the Constitution here could never be protected meaningfully, since to require that the guests claim this right themselves would \"result in nullification of the right at the very moment of its assertion.\" Id., at 459. I do not think it likely that anyone would deny the right of a bookseller (including a corporate bookseller) to decline to produce the names of those who had purchased his books. Cf. United States v. Rumely, \n345 \nU.S. 41, 57\n (concurring opinion), and the opinion below in that case, 90 U.S. App. D.C. 382, 197 F.2d 166, 172.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nSecond. In examining the right of the State to obtain this information from the appellant by compulsory \n\n[360 \nU.S. 72, 98]\n\u00a0\n process, we must recollect what we so recently said in NAACP v. Alabama:\n\n \"Effective advocacy of both public and private points of view, particularly controversial ones, is undeniably enhanced by group association, as this Court has more than once recognized by remarking upon the close nexus between the freedoms of speech and assembly. De Jonge v. Oregon, \n299 \nU.S. 353, 364\n; Thomas v. Collins, \n323 \nU.S. 516, 530\n. It is beyond debate that freedom to engage in association for the advancement of beliefs and ideas is an inseparable aspect of the `liberty' assured by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which embraces freedom of speech. See Gitlow v. New York, \n268 \nU.S. 652, 666\n; Palko v. Connecticut, \n302 \nU.S. 319, 324\n; Cantwell v. Connecticut, \n310 \nU.S. 296, 303\n; Staub v. City of Baxley, \n355 \nU.S. 313, 321\n. Of course, it is immaterial whether the beliefs sought to be advanced by association pertain to political, economic, religious or cultural matters, and state action which may have the effect of curtailing the freedom to associate is subject to the closest scrutiny.\" \n357 \nU.S., at 460\n-461.\n\n\n And in examining the State's interest in carrying out a legislative investigation, as was said in a similar context in United States v. Rumely, supra, at 44, we must strive not to be \"that `blind' Court, against which Mr. Chief Justice Taft admonished in a famous passage, . . . that does not see what `[a]ll others can see and understand.'\" The problem of protecting the citizen's constitutional rights from legislative investigation and exposure is a practical one, and we must take a practical, realistic approach to it.\n\nMost legislative investigations unavoidably involve exposure of some sort or another. But it is quite clear \n\n[360 \nU.S. 72, 99]\n\u00a0\n that exposure was the very core, and deliberately and purposefully so, of the legislative investigation we are concerned with here. The Legislature had passed a broad and comprehensive statute, which included criminal sanctions. That statute was, to say the least, readily susceptible of many applications in which it might enter a constitutional danger zone. See Yates v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 298, 319\n. And it could not be applied at all insofar as it amounted to a sanction for behavior directed against the United States. Pennsylvania v. Nelson, \n350 \nU.S. 497\n. Therefore, indictment would be fraught with constitutional and evidentiary problems of an obvious and hardly subtle nature. This may suggest the reason why the pattern of application of the Subversive Activities statute in New Hampshire was not through the processes of indictment. The Resolution was cast in terms of an investigation of conduct restricted by this existing statute. The Resolution and the Attorney General's implementation of it reveal the making of a choice. The choice was to reach the end of exposure through the process of investigation, backed with the contempt power and the making of reports to the Legislature, of persons and groups thought to be somehow related to offenses under the statute or, further, to an uncertain penumbra of conduct about the proscribed area of the statute. And, as was said of the same investigation in Sweezy v. New Hampshire, supra, at 248: \"[T]he program for the rooting out of subversion . . . [was] drawn without regard to the presence or absence of guilty knowledge in those affected.\" The sanction of exposure was applied much more widely than anyone could remotely suggest that even traditional judicial sanctions might be applied in this area.\n\nOne may accept the Court's truism that preservation of the State's existence is undoubtedly a proper purpose for legislation. But, in descending from this peak of abstraction to the facts of this case, one must ask the \n\n[360 \nU.S. 72, 100]\n\u00a0\n question: What relation did this investigation of individual conduct have to legislative ends here? If bills of attainder were still a legitimate legislative end, it is clear that the investigations and reports might naturally have furnished the starting point (though only that) for a legislative adjudication of guilt under the 1951 Act. But what other legislative purpose was actually being fulfilled by the course taken by this investigation, with its overwhelming emphasis on individual associations and conduct?\n\nThe investigation, as revealed by the report, was overwhelmingly and predominantly a roving, self-contained investigation of individual and group behavior, and behavior in a constitutionally protected area. Its whole approach was to name names, disclose information about those named, and observe that \"facts are facts.\" The New Hampshire Supreme Court has upheld the investigation as being a proper legislative inquiry, it is true. In Nelson v. Wyman, 99 N. H. 33, 38, 105 A. 2d 756, 763, it said: \"No sound basis can exist for denying to the Legislature the power to so investigate the effectiveness of its 1951 act even though, as an incident to that general investigation, it may be necessary to inquire as to whether a particular person has violated the act. . . . When the investigation provided for is a general one, the discovery of a specific, individual violation of law is collateral and subordinate to the main object of the inquiry.\" In evalulating this, it must be admitted that maintenance of the separation of powers in the States is not, in and of itself, a concern of the Federal Constitution. Sweezy v. New Hampshire, supra, at 255; Crowell v. Benson, \n285 \nU.S. 22, 57\n. But for an investigation in the field of the constitutionally protected freedoms of speech and assemblage to be upheld by the broad standards of relevance permissible in a legislative inquiry, some relevance to a \n\n[360 \nU.S. 72, 101]\n\u00a0\n valid legislative purpose must be shown, and certainly the ruling made below, that under the state law the Legislature has authorized the inquiry, Wyman v. Uphaus, 100 N. H. 436, 445, 130 A. 2d 278, 285, does not conclude the issue here. The bare fact that the Legislature has authorized the inquiry does not mean that the inquiry is for a valid legislative end when viewed in the light of the federal constitutional test we must apply. Nor, while it is entitled to weight, is the determination by a state court that the inquiry relates to a valid legislative end conclusive. It is the task of this Court, as the Court recognizes in theory today, to evaluate the facts to determine if there actually has been demonstrated a valid legislative end to which the inquiry is related. With all due respect, the quoted observations of the New Hampshire Supreme Court in the case of Nelson v. Wyman bear little relationship to the course of the inquiry, as revealed by the report published after that decision. The report discloses an investigation in which the processes of law-making and law-evaluating were submerged entirely in exposure of individual behavior - in adjudication, of a sort, however much disclaimed, through the exposure process.\n8\n If an investigation or trial, conducted by any organ of the State, which is aimed at the application of sanctions to individual behavior is to be upheld, it must meet the traditional standards that the common law in this country has established for the application of sanctions to the individual, or a constitutionally permissible modification of them. Cf. Kilbourn v. Thompson, \n\n[360 \nU.S. 72, 102]\n\u00a0\n \n103 \nU.S. 168, 195\n. As a bare minimum there must be general standards of conduct, substantively constitutionally proper, applied to the individual in a fair proceeding with defined issues resulting in a binding, final determination. I had not supposed that a legislative investigation of the sort practiced here provided such a framework under the Constitution.\n\nIt is not enough to say, as the Court's position I fear may amount to, that what was taking place was an investigation and until the Attorney General and the Legislature had in all the data, the precise shape of the legislative action to be taken was necessarily unknown. Investigation and exposure, in the area which we are here concerned with, are not recognized as self-contained legislative powers in themselves. See Watkins v. United States, supra, at 200. Cf. NAACP v. Alabama, supra. Since this is so, it hardly fulfills the responsibility with which this Court is charged, of protecting the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and assembly, to admit that an investigation going on indefinitely in time, roving in subject matter, and cumulative in detail in this area can be in aid of a valid legislative end, on the theory that some day it may come to some point. Even the most abusive investigation, the one most totally committed to the constitutionally impermissible end of individual adjudication through publication, could pass such a test. At the stage of this investigation that we are concerned with, it continued to be a cumulative, broad inquiry into the specific details of past individual and associational behavior in the political area. It appears to have been a classic example of \"a fruitless investigation into the personal affairs of individuals.\" Kilbourn v. Thompson, supra, at 195. Investigation appears to have been a satisfactory end product for the State, but it cannot be so for us in this case as we \n\n[360 \nU.S. 72, 103]\n\u00a0\n evaluate the demands of the Constitution. Nor can we accept the legislative renewal of the investigation, or the taking of other legislative measures to facilitate the investigation, as being themselves the legislative justification of the inquiry. The report indicates that it so viewed them; in requesting legislation renewing the investigation and an investigation immunity statute, the Attorney General significantly stated that if the renewal legislation or some investigatory substitute were not passed, it \"would mean no further investigation, no continuing check upon Communist activities . . . .\" This is just to admit the continuing existence of the investigation as a self-contained justification for the inquiry. However much the State may be content to rely on the investigation as its own sanction, I think it perfectly plain that it cannot be regarded as a justification here. Nor can the faint possibility that an already questionably broad criminal statute might be further broadened, if constitutionally permissible, be considered the subordinating legislative purpose here, particularly in the light of what the investigation was in fact as revealed by its report. Of course, after further investigation and further reports, legislation of some sort might eventuate, or at least be considered. Perhaps it might be rejected because of serious doubts as to its constitutionality - which would, I think, underline the point I am making. But on such airy speculation, I do not see how we can say that the State has made any showing that this investigation, which on its surface has an overwhelming appearance of a simple, wide-ranging exposure campaign, presents an implementation of a subordinating lawmaking interest that, as the Court concedes, the State must be shown to have.\n\nThis Court's approach to a very similar problem in NAACP v. Alabama, supra, should furnish a guide to the proper course of decision here. There the State \n\n[360 \nU.S. 72, 104]\n\u00a0\n demonstrated a definite purpose which was admittedly within its competence. That purpose was the ascertainment whether a foreign corporation was unlawfully carrying on local activities within Alabama's borders, because not qualified to do business in the manner required by state law. In a judicial proceeding having this as its express stated purpose, the State sought to obtain the membership list of the corporation. This Court carefully recognized the curbing of associational freedom that the disclosure called for by this inquiry would entail. It then analyzed the relationship between the inquiry and this purpose, and, concluding that there was no rational connection, it held the inquiry constitutionally impermissible. Here the situation is even more extreme; there is no demonstration at all of what the legislative purpose is, outside of the investigation of violations, suspicions of violations, and conduct raising some question of violation, of an existing statute.\n9\n It is anomalous to say, as I fear the Court says today, that the vaguer the State's interest is, the more laxly will the Court view the matter and indulge a presumption of the existence of a valid subordinating state interest. In effect, a roving investigation and exposure of past associations and expressions in the political \n\n[360 \nU.S. 72, 105]\n\u00a0\n field is upheld because it might lead to some sort of legislation which might be sustained as constitutional, and the entire process is said to become the more defensible rather than the less because of the vagueness of the issues. The Court says that the appellant cannot argue against the exposure because this is an investigation and the exposure may make the investigation lead somewhere, possibly to legislative action. But this is just to say that an investigation, once under state law it is classified as \"legislative,\" needs no showing of purpose beyond its own existence. A start must be made somewhere, and if the principles this Court has announced, and to which the Court today makes some deference, are to have any meaning, it must be up to the State to make some at least plausible disclosure of its lawmaking interest so that the relevance of its inquiries to it may be tested. Then the courts could begin to evaluate the justification for the impact on the individual's rights of freedom of speech and assembly. But here not only has the State failed to begin to elucidate such an interest; it has positively demonstrated, it appears to me, through its Resolution, the Attorney General's and the state courts' interpretation of it, and the Resolution's re-enactment, that what it is interested in is exposure, in lieu of prosecution, and nothing definable else.\n\nThe precise details of the inquiry we are concerned with here underlines this. The Attorney General had World Fellowship's speaker list and had already made publication of it in the fashion to which I have alluded. He had considerable other data about World Fellowship, Inc., which he had already published. What reason has been demonstrated, in terms of a legislative inquiry, for going into the matter in further depth? Outside of the fact that it might afford some further evidence as to the existence of \"subversive persons\" within the State, which I have \n\n[360 \nU.S. 72, 106]\n\u00a0\n endeavored to show was not in itself a matter related to any legislative function except self-contained investigation and exposure themselves, the relevance of further detail is not demonstrated. But its damaging effect on the persons to be named in the guest list is obvious. And since the only discernible purpose of the investigation on this record is revealed to be investigation and exposure per se, and the relevance of the names to that purpose alone is quite apparent, this discloses the constitutional infirmity in the inquiry which requires us to strike down the adjudication of contempt in question here.\n\nThe Court describes the inquiry we must make in this matter as a balancing of interests. I think I have indicated that there has been no valid legislative interest of the State actually defined and shown in the investigation as it operated, so that there is really nothing against which the appellant's rights of association and expression can be balanced. But if some proper legislative end of the inquiry can be surmised, through what must be a process of speculation, I think it is patent that there is really no subordinating interest in it demonstrated on the part of the State. The evidence inquired about was simply an effort to get further details about an activity as to which there already were considerable details in the hands of the Attorney General. I can see no serious and substantial relationship between the furnishing of these further minutiae about what was going on at the World Fellowship camp and the process of legislation, and it is the process of legislation, the consideration of the enactment of laws, with which ultimately we are concerned. We have a detailed inquiry into an assemblage the general contours of which were already known on the one hand, and on the other the remote and speculative possibility of some sort of legislation - albeit legislation in a field where there are serious constitutional limitations. We \n\n[360 \nU.S. 72, 107]\n\u00a0\n have this in the context of an inquiry which was in practice being conducted in its overwhelming thrust as a vehicle of exposure, and where the practice had been followed of publishing names on the basis of a \"not proven\" verdict. We are not asked to hold that the State cannot carry on such fact-finding at all, with or without compulsory process. Nor are we asked to hold that as a general matter compulsory process cannot be used to amass facts whose initial relevance to an ultimate legislative interest may be remote. Cf. McGrain v. Daugherty, \n273 \nU.S. 135, 176\n-180.\n10\n We deal with a narrow and more subtle problem. We deal here with inquiries into the areas of free speech and assemblage where the process of compulsory disclosure itself tends to have a repressive effect. Cf. Speiser v. Randall, supra. We deal only with the power of the State to compel such a disclosure. We are asked, in this narrow context, only to give meaning to our statement in Watkins v. United States, supra, at 198, \"that the mere semblance of a legislative purpose would not justify an inquiry in the face of the Bill of Rights.\" Here we must demand some initial showing by the State sufficient to counterbalance the interest in privacy as it relates to \n\n[360 \nU.S. 72, 108]\n\u00a0\n freedom of speech and assembly. On any basis that has practical meaning, New Hampshire has not made such a showing here. I would reverse the judgment of the New Hampshire Supreme Court.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The two leading earlier cases relate generally to the congressional power to investigate, and were not required to explore it in the contexts of freedom of speech and of assembly. Kilbourn v. Thompson, \n103 \nU.S. 168\n; McGrain v. Daugherty, \n273 \nU.S. 135\n. See the opinion in the latter case, ibid., at 175-176.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Act was c. 193 of the Laws of New Hampshire, 1951. After an extensive preamble, 1 provided various definitions, including definitions of \"subversive organization\" and \"foreign subversive organization\"; the definition of \"subversive person,\" also provided, was: \"any person who commits, attempts to commit, or aids in the commission, or advocates, abets, advises or teaches, by any means any person to commit, attempt to commit, or aid in the commission of any act intended to overthrow, destroy or alter, or to assist in the overthrow, destruction or alteration of, the constitutional form of the government of the United States, or of the state of New Hampshire, or any political subdivision of either of them, by force, or violence; or who is a member of a subversive organization or a foreign subversive organization.\" For a discussion of the breadth of this definition, see Sweezy v. New Hampshire, supra, at 246-247.\n\nSection 2 of the Act defines the crime of sedition. The definition is based on the quoted definition of \"subversive person,\" except that the final \"membership clause\" is omitted and a \"clear and present danger\" test is introduced in regard to advocacy, abetting, advising and teaching. Assisting in the formation of a subversive organization or foreign subversive organization, managing one, contributing to its support, destroying its papers, or hiding its funds, \"knowing said organization to be a subversive organization or a foreign subversive organization\" also constitutes the offense, which is punishable by twenty years' imprisonment or a fine of $20,000, or both. Those who become or remain members of a subversive organization or a foreign subversive organization, after certain dates, \"knowing said organization to be a subversive organization or a foreign subversive organization,\" under 3, are liable to five years' imprisonment or a $5,000 fine, or both. Section 4 disqualifies those convicted under \n\n[360 \nU.S. 72, 88]\n\u00a0\n 2 or 3 from public office or employment, and 9 erects a similar disqualification in the case of all \"subversive persons.\" Section 5 provides for the dissolution of subversive organizations and foreign subversive organizations functioning in New Hampshire.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] None appears to have been made.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The Communist Control Act of 1954, 5, c. 886, 68 Stat. 776, 50 U.S.C. 844.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Although the nature of the investigation of individuals is difficult to convey without reproduction of the full report, two individual write-ups from other sections of the book (the names are used in the report but not here) are illustrative.\n\nA two-page item is entitled \"The Matter of . . . [X].\" It begins: \"In recent years there has been opposition to legislative investigations in some academic circles. Charges have been made, usually without an accompanying scintilla of evidence, that `hysteria' rules the country \n\n[360 \nU.S. 72, 93]\n\u00a0\n and that teachers are afraid to teach `the truth' because of the `witch hunters.' This line is repeated ad infinitum in the Communist `Daily Worker.'\n\n\"In New Hampshire, during the course of this investigation, a case did arise where rumors were circulated concerning a teacher. . . .\"\n\n\n The report proceeds: \"The teacher concerning whom the rumors were circulated was [X], a teacher in the [Y city] public school system. When the rumors concerning Mr. [X] came to the attention of this office, he was invited to testify. . . .\"\n\nThe report relates that X appeared \"voluntarily\" and testified \"fully\" that he was not a member of any organization on the Attorney General's list, and never had been. \"This office was prepared to make full investigation of the facts and to make public the results of such an investigation if it would effectuate the purposes of the current probe. [X] resigned and secured employment outside the state. Had [X] not decided to submit his resignation, such a course of action would have been taken, but facilities were not available for inquiring into moot problems. . . .\"\n\nThe report, after noting that none of its available usual informants had anything damaging to say about X, concludes its discussion of this \"matter\": \"It should be clear to factions who oppose per se any legislative investigation into subversion that such investigations can serve the purpose of insuring legitimate academic interests against unfounded rumor or gossip.\" We are left to conjecture whether Mr. X would subscribe to the Attorney General's conclusion.\n\nAn 11-page write-up is the story of Y, a Chief of Police in a New Hampshire municipality. Y admitted having been a Communist from 1936 till 1944, but said that he withdrew then, and currently regarded the Communist Party as something on a par with Hitler. A witness said that Y's name was on a secret Communist Party list after then. Pages of the details of inconclusive statements and counterstatements in this regard follow, including a \"confrontation\" of Chief Y and a witness in the Attorney General's office, at which were present the Board of Selectmen of the town for which he was Police Chief. The report then lists various \"situations in which Chief [Y] was not able to be of assistance to this investigation\" and finally comes to the \"Conclusion\": \"Due to the conspiratorial, \n\n[360 \nU.S. 72, 94]\n\u00a0\n clandestine, and currently underground nature of the Communist Party, as well as the inability to force witnesses to testify concerning subversive activities, the above conflicts in testimony here have not been resolved and are presented as they exist on the record, without further comment. . . .\"\n\nThe usual individual biography is shorter and less detailed than this; many just state the individual's name and street address, set forth a reference to him in the Daily Worker or an \"identification\" with the Communist Party at some date or with a \"front\" group, and state that the subject invoked or took refuge in the privilege against self-incrimination when questioned before the Attorney General.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] See p. 92, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The Court, apparently, draws some support from the New Hampshire lodging house registration statute for its conclusions about the lack of substantiality of the guests' interests in nondisclosure. Since the statute admittedly would not cover what the Attorney General desired to obtain and since the New Hampshire courts themselves did not rest on it, it is difficult to find any basis for this reliance. It would be time enough to deal with a production order based on that statute when it arose.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] While as a general matter it is true that a State can distribute its governmental powers as it sees fit, as far as the Federal Constitution is concerned, it is also true that (regardless of what organ exercises the functions) different constitutional tests apply in examining state legislative and state adjudicatory powers. See Bi-Metallic Investment Co. v. State Board of Equalization, \n239 \nU.S. 441\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Cf. the address of Mr. William T. Gossett, Vice-President and General Counsel of Ford Motor Company at the Annual Brotherhood Dinner, Detroit, Michigan, November 20, 1958, in which he said:\n\n\"We must urge upon our law-makers a scrupulous exactness, particularly in the exercise of their investigative powers. When we are frustrated by the feeling that certain people - suspected subversives, gangsters or labor racketeers, for example - have flaunted society with impunity, it is tempting to pillory them through prolonged public exposure to hearsay testimony, intemperate invective and other forms of abuse. But to try by such means to destroy those whom we are unable to convict by due process of law may destroy instead the very safeguards that protect us all against tyranny and arbitrary power.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] McGrain v. Daugherty found legislative justification in a congressional inquiry which presented a rather strong element of exposure of past wrongdoing, to be sure. But the possibility of legislation was much more real than is the case here, and the legislative subject matter - control and regulation of the structure and workings of an executive department - was one not fraught with the constitutional problems presented by legislation in the field of political advocacy and assembly. And the inquiry itself, most significantly, was not directed at private assembly and discussion, but at the conduct of a public official in office; it did not have the inhibitory effect on basic political freedoms that the inquiry we are here concerned with presents. Cf. Watkins v. United States, supra, at 200, n. 33. The Daugherty case is basically, then, one relating to the distribution of powers among branches of the Federal Government.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS\n\n would decide this case on the ground that appellant is being deprived of rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, for the reasons developed in Adler v. Board of Education, \n342 \nU.S. 485, 508\n (dissenting opinion); Beauharnais v. Illinois, \n343 \nU.S. 250, 267\n, 284 (dissenting opinions). But they join MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN'S dissent because he makes clear to them that New Hampshire's legislative program resulting in the incarceration of appellant for contempt violates Art. I, 10 of the Constitution which provides that \"No State shall . . . pass any Bill of Attainder.\" See United States v. Lovett, \n328 \nU.S. 303, 315\n-318, and cases cited; Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath, \n341 \nU.S. 123, 142\n-149 (concurring opinion). \n\n[360 \nU.S. 72, 109]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","204":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nVITARELLI v. SEATON(1959)\nNo. 101\nArgued: Decided: June 1, 1959\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner was an employee of the Department of the Interior in a position not designated as \"sensitive.\" He was not a veteran, had no protected Civil Service status, and could have been discharged summarily without cause. Purporting to proceed under the Act of August 26, 1950, Executive Order No. 10450 and departmental regulations prescribing the procedure to be followed in \"security risk\" cases, the Secretary suspended him and served him with written charges that his \"sympathetic association\" with Communists or Communist sympathizers, and other similar alleged activities, tended to show that his continued employment might be \"contrary to the best interests of national security.\" At a subsequent hearing before a security hearing board, no evidence was adduced in support of these charges and no witness testified against petitioner; but he and four witnesses who testified for him were subjected to an extensive cross-examination which went far beyond the activities specified in the charges. Subsequently, he was sent a notice of dismissal, effective September 10, 1954, \"in the interest of national security\" and for the reasons set forth in the charges. In 1956, he sued for a declaratory judgment that his discharge was illegal and an injunction directing his reinstatement. While the case was pending, a copy of a \"notification of personnel action,\" dated September 21, 1954, and reciting that it was \"a revision of and replaces the original bearing the same date,\" was filed in the court and a copy was delivered to petitioner. This notification was identical with one issued September 21, 1954, except that it omitted any reference to the reason for petitioner's discharge and to the authority under which it was carried out. Held: Petitioner's dismissal was illegal and he is entitled to reinstatement. Pp. 536-546.\n\n (a) Having chosen to proceed against petitioner on security grounds, the Secretary was bound by the regulations which he had promulgated for dealing with such cases, even though petitioner could have been discharged summarily and without cause independently of those regulations. Pp. 539-540. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 535, 536]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n (b) The record shows that the proceedings leading to petitioner's dismissal from Government service on grounds of national security violated petitioner's procedural rights under the applicable departmental regulations. Therefore, his dismissal was illegal and of no effect. Pp. 540-545.\n\n\n (c) Delivery to petitioner in 1956 of the revised \"notification of personnel action\" dated September 21, 1954, which was plainly intended only as a grant of relief to petitioner by expunging the grounds of the 1954 discharge, cannot be treated as an exercise of the Secretary's summary dismissal power as of the date of its delivery to petitioner. Pp. 545-546.\n\n\n (d) Petitioner is entitled to reinstatement, subject to any lawful exercise of the Secretary's authority hereafter to dismiss him from employment. P. 546.\n\n\n 102 U.S. App. D.C. 316, 253 F.2d 338, reversed.\n\nClifford J. Hynning argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the brief was Harry E. Sprogell.\n\nJohn G. Laughlin, Jr. argued the cause for respondents. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney General Doub and Samuel D. Slade.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case concerns the legality of petitioner's discharge as an employee of the Department of the Interior. Vitarelli, an educator holding a doctor's degree from Columbia University, was appointed in 1952 by the Department of the Interior as an Education and Training Specialist in the Education Department of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, at Koror in the Palau District, a mandated area for which this country has responsibility.\n\nBy a letter dated March 30, 1954, respondent Secretary's predecessor in office notified petitioner of his suspension from duty without pay, effective April 2, 1954, assigning as ground therefor various charges. Essentially, the charges were that petitioner from 1941 to 1945 \n\n[359 \nU.S. 535, 537]\n\u00a0\n had been in \"sympathetic association\" with three named persons alleged to have been members of or in sympathetic association with the Communist Party, and had concealed from the Government the true extent of these associations at the time of a previous inquiry into them; that he had registered as a supporter of the American Labor Party in New York City in 1945, had subscribed to the USSR Information Bulletin, and had purchased copies of the Daily Worker and New Masses; and that because such associations and activities tended to show that petitioner was \"not reliable or trustworthy\" his continued employment might be \"contrary to the best interests of national security.\"\n\nPetitioner filed a written answer to the statement of charges, and appeared before a security hearing board on June 22 and July 1, 1954. At this hearing no evidence was adduced by the Department in support of the charges, nor did any witness testify against petitioner. Petitioner testified at length, and presented four witnesses, and he and the witnesses were extensively cross-examined by the security officer and the members of the hearing board. On September 2, 1954, a notice of dismissal effective September 10, 1954, was sent petitioner over the signature of the Secretary, reciting that the dismissal was \"in the interest of national security for the reasons specifically set forth in the letter of charges dated March 30, 1954.\" This was followed on September 21, 1954, with the filing of a \"Notification of Personnel Action\" setting forth the Secretary's action. The record does not show that a copy of this document was ever sent to petitioner.\n\nAfter having failed to obtain reinstatement by a demand upon the Secretary, petitioner filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia seeking a declaration that his dismissal had been illegal and ineffective and an injunction requiring his reinstatement. On October 10, 1956, while the case was pending in the \n\n[359 \nU.S. 535, 538]\n\u00a0\n District Court, a copy of a new \"Notification of Personnel Action,\" dated September 21, 1954, and reciting that it was \"a revision of and replaces the original bearing the same date,\" was filed in the District Court, and another copy of this document was delivered to petitioner shortly thereafter. This notification was identical with the one already mentioned, except that it omitted any reference to the reason for petitioner's discharge and to the authority under which it was carried out.\n1\n Thereafter the District Court granted summary judgment for the respondent. That judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, one judge dissenting. 102 U.S. App. D.C. 316, 253 F.2d 338. We granted certiorari to consider the validity of petitioner's discharge. \n358 \nU.S. 871\n.\n\nThe Secretary's letter of March 30, 1954, and notice of dismissal of September 2, 1954, both relied upon Exec. Order No. 10450, 18 Fed. Reg. 2489 (1953), the Act of August 26, 1950, 64 Stat. 476, 5 U.S.C. 22-1 et seq., and Department of the Interior Order No. 2738, all relating to discharges of government employees on security or loyalty grounds, as the authority for petitioner's dismissal. In Cole v. Young, \n351 \nU.S. 536\n, this Court held that the statute referred to did not apply to government employees in positions not designated as \"sensitive.\" Respondent takes the position that since petitioner's position in government service has at no time been designated as sensitive the effect of Cole, which was decided after the 1954 dismissal of petitioner, was to render also inapplicable to petitioner Department of the Interior Order No. 2738, under which the proceedings relating to petitioner's dismissal were had. It is urged \n\n[359 \nU.S. 535, 539]\n\u00a0\n that in this state of affairs petitioner, who concededly was at no time within the protection of the Civil Service Act, Veterans' Preference Act, or any other statute relating to employment rights of government employees, and who, as a \"Schedule A\" employee, could have been summarily discharged by the Secretary at any time without the giving of a reason, under no circumstances could be entitled to more than that which he has already received - namely, an \"expunging\" from the record of his 1954 discharge of any reference to the authority or reasons therefor.\n\nRespondent misconceives the effect of our decision in Cole. It is true that the Act of August 26, 1950, and the Executive Order did not alter the power of the Secretary to discharge summarily an employee in petitioner's status, without the giving of any reason. Nor did the Department's own regulations preclude such a course. Since, however, the Secretary gratuitously decided to give a reason, and that reason was national security, he was obligated to conform to the procedural standards he had formulated in Order No. 2738 for the dismissal of employees on security grounds. Service v. Dulles, \n354 \nU.S. 363\n. That Order on its face applies to all security discharges in the Department of the Interior, including such discharges of Schedule A employees. Cole v. Young established that the Act of August 26, 1950, did not permit the discharge of nonsensitive employees pursuant to procedures authorized by that Act if those procedures were more summary than those to which the employee would have been entitled by virtue of any pre-existing statute or regulation. That decision cannot, however, justify noncompliance by the Secretary with regulations promulgated by him in the departmental Order, which as to petitioner afford greater procedural protections in the case of a dismissal stated to be for security reasons than in the case of dismissal without any statement of reasons. Having chosen to proceed against petitioner on security \n\n[359 \nU.S. 535, 540]\n\u00a0\n grounds, the Secretary here, as in Service, was bound by the regulations which he himself had promulgated for dealing with such cases, even though without such regulations he could have discharged petitioner summarily.\n\nPetitioner makes various contentions as to the constitutional invalidity of the procedures provided by Order No. 2738. He further urges that even assuming the validity of the governing procedures, his dismissal cannot stand because the notice of suspension and hearing given him did not comply with the Order. We find it unnecessary to reach the constitutional issues, for we think that petitioner's second position is well taken and must be sustained.\n\nPreliminarily, it should be said that departures from departmental regulations in matters of this kind involve more than mere consideration of procedural irregularities. For in proceedings of this nature, in which the ordinary rules of evidence do not apply, in which matters involving the disclosure of confidential information are withheld, and where it must be recognized that counsel is under practical constraints in the making of objections and in the tactical handling of his case which would not obtain in a cause being tried in a court of law before trained judges, scrupulous observance of departmental procedural safeguards is clearly of particular importance.\n2\n In this instance an examination of the record, and of the transcript of the hearing before the departmental security board, discloses that petitioner's procedural rights under the applicable regulations were violated in at least three material respects in the proceedings which terminated in the final notice of his dismissal.\n\nFirst, 15 (a) of Order No. 2738 requires that the statement of charges served upon an employee at the time \n\n[359 \nU.S. 535, 541]\n\u00a0\n of his suspension on security grounds \"shall be as specific and detailed as security considerations, including the need for protection of confidential sources of information, permit . . . and shall be subject to amendment within 30 days of issuance.\" Although the statement of charges furnished petitioner appears on its face to be reasonably specific,\n3\n the transcript of hearing establishes that the statement, which was never amended, cannot conceivably be said in fact to be as specific and detailed as \"security considerations . . . permit.\" For petitioner was questioned by the security officer and by the hearing board in great detail concerning his association with and knowledge of various persons and organizations nowhere mentioned in the statement of charges,\n4\n and at length concerning his activities in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and elsewhere after 1945, activities as to which the charges are also completely silent. These questions were presumably asked because they were deemed relevant to the inquiry before the board, and the very fact that they were asked and thus spread on the record is conclusive \n\n[359 \nU.S. 535, 542]\n\u00a0\n indication that \"security considerations\" could not have justified the omission of any statement concerning them in the charges furnished petitioner.\n\nSecond, 21 (a) and (e) require that hearings before security hearing boards shall be \"orderly\" and that \"reasonable restrictions shall be imposed as to relevancy, competency, and materiality of matters considered.\" The material set forth in the margin, taken from the transcript, and illustrative rather than exhaustive, shows that these indispensable indicia of a meaningful hearing were not observed.\n5\n It is not an overcharacterization to say \n\n[359 \nU.S. 535, 543]\n\u00a0\n that as the hearing proceeded it developed into a wide-ranging inquisition into this man's educational, social, and political beliefs, encompassing even a question as to whether he was \"a religious man.\" \n\n[359 \nU.S. 535, 544]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThird, 21 (c) (4) gives the employee the right \"to cross-examine any witness offered in support of the charges.\" It is apparent from an over-all reading of the regulations that it was not contemplated that this provision should require the Department to call witnesses to testify in support of any or all of the charges, because it was expected that charges might rest on information gathered from or by \"confidential informants.\" We think, however, that 21 (c) (4) did contemplate the calling by the Department of any informant not properly classifiable as \"confidential,\" if information furnished by that informant was to be used by the board in assessing an employee's status.\n6\n The transcript shows that this \n\n[359 \nU.S. 535, 545]\n\u00a0\n provision was violated on at least one occasion at petitioner's hearing, for the security officer identified by name a person who had given information apparently considered detrimental to petitioner, thus negating any possible inference that that person was considered a \"confidential informant\" whose identity it was necessary to keep secret, and questioned petitioner at some length concerning the information supplied from this source without calling the informant and affording petitioner the right to cross-examine.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nBecause the proceedings attendant upon petitioner's dismissal from government service on grounds of national security fell substantially short of the requirements of the applicable departmental regulations, we hold that such dismissal was illegal and of no effect.\n\nRespondent urges that even if the dismissal of September 10, 1954, was invalid, petitioner is not entitled to reinstatement by reason of the fact that he was at all events validly dismissed in October 1956, when a copy of the second \"Notification of Personnel Action,\" omitting all reference to any statute, order, or regulation relating to security discharges, was delivered to him. Granting that the Secretary could at any time after September 10, 1954, have validly dismissed petitioner without any statement of reasons, and independently of the proceedings taken against him under Order No. 2738, we cannot view the delivery of the new notification to petitioner as an exercise of that summary dismissal power. Rather, the fact that it was dated \"9-21-54,\" contained a termination of employment date of \"9-10-54,\" was designated as \"a revision\" of the 1954 notification, and was evidently filed in \n\n[359 \nU.S. 535, 546]\n\u00a0\n the District Court before its delivery to petitioner indicates that its sole purpose was an attempt to moot petitioner's suit in the District Court by an \"expunging\" of the grounds for the dismissal which brought Order No. 2738 into play.\n8\n In these circumstances, we would not be justified in now treating the 1956 action, plainly intended by the Secretary as a grant of relief to petitioner in connection with the form of the 1954 discharge, as an exercise of the Secretary's summary removal power as of the date of its delivery to petitioner.\n9\n\u00a0\n\nIt follows from what we have said that petitioner is entitled to the reinstatement which he seeks, subject, of course to any lawful exercise of the Secretary's authority hereafter to dismiss him from employment in the Department of the Interior.\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] An affidavit of the custodian of records of the Civil Service Commission, filed in the District Court together with this revised notification, states \"That all records of the said Commission have been expunged of all adverse findings made with respect to Mr. William Vincent Vitarelli under Executive Order 10450.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] As already noted, we do not reach the question of the constitutional permissibility of an administrative adjudication based on \"confidential information\" not disclosed to the employee.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The substance of the charges has been stated on pp. 536-537, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The statement of charges referred to petitioner's alleged associations with only three named persons, \"F_____, W_____, and W_____.\" During the course of the hearing the security officer, however, asked \"How well did you know L_____ B_____? . . . Did you ever meet H_____ B_____ C_____? . . . Did you ever remember meeting a J_____ L_____?\" Further, petitioner was questioned as to his knowledge of and relationships with a wide variety of organizations not mentioned in the statement of charges. Thus he was asked: \"Do you know what Black Mountain Transcendentalism is? . . . Do you recall an organization by the name of National Council for Soviet-American Friendship? . . . How about the Southern Conference for Human Welfare? . . . What is the organization called the Joint Antifascist Refugee Committee? . . . Have you ever had any contact with the Negro Youth Congress? . . . How about Abraham Lincoln Brigade? . . . Have you ever heard of a magazine called `Cooperative Union'? . . . I was wondering whether you had ever heard of Consumers Union?\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] \"Mr. ARMSTRONG [the departmental security officer, inquiring about petitioner's activities as a teacher in a Georgia college]: Were these activities designed to be put into effect by both the white and the colored races? . . . What were your feelings at that time concerning race equality? . . . How about civil rights?

Thomas, and Henry Wallace? . . . How many times did you vote for . . . [Thomas] if you care to say? . . . How about Henry Wallace? . . . How about Norman Thomas?

In other words, were they contacts with Negro groups, with Negro instructors, with Negro students, and so on?\"\n\n\n It is not apparent how any of the above matters could be material to a consideration of the question whether petitioner's retention in government service would be consistent with national security.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] This reading of the provision is supported by 21 (e) of the Order, which provides in part that \"if the employee is or may be handicapped by the nondisclosure to him of confidential information or by lack of opportunity to cross-examine confidential informants, the hearing board shall take that fact into consideration,\" thus implying that the employee is to have the right to cross-examine nonconfidential informants who provide material taken into consideration by the board.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The information was to the effect that petitioner had criticized as \"bourgeois\" the purchase of a house by a woman associate in Georgia. Petitioner flatly denied that he had made the remark attributed to him, and said that he could never have made such a statement except in a spirit of levity.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] The Secretary successfully took the position in the courts below that the only possible defect in the 1954 discharge was the articulation of the \"national security\" grounds therefor, and that since that defect did not void the dismissal as such, an \"expunging\" of these grounds gave petitioner the maximum relief to which he could possibly be entitled.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Respondent's brief in this Court refers to the 1956 notice as part of \"corrective administrative action which has been taken,\" and as \"relief voluntarily accorded [petitioner].\" The premise upon which the dissenting opinion essentially rests - that the 1956 action was an attempt \"to discharge Vitarelli retroactively\" - thus is contrary to the Secretary's own position as to the reason for that action.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, whom MR. JUSTICE CLARK, MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER and MR. JUSTICE STEWART join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\nAn executive agency must be rigorously held to the standards by which it professes its action to be judged. See Securities & Exchange Comm'n v. Chenery Corp., \n318 \nU.S. 80, 87\n-88. Accordingly, if dismissal from \n\n[359 \nU.S. 535, 547]\n\u00a0\n employment is based on a defined procedure, even though generous beyond the requirements that bind such agency, that procedure must be scrupulously observed. See Service v. Dulles, \n354 \nU.S. 363\n. This judicially evolved rule of administrative law is now firmly established and, if I may add, rightly so. He that takes the procedural sword shall perish with that sword. Therefore, I unreservedly join in the Court's main conclusion, that the attempted dismissal of Vitarelli in September 1954 was abortive and of no validity because the procedure under Department of the Interior Order No. 2738 was invoked but not observed.\n\nBut when an executive agency draws on the freedom that the law vests in it, the judiciary cannot deny or curtail such freedom. The Secretary of the Interior concededly had untrammelled right to dismiss Vitarelli out of hand, since he had no protected employment rights. He could do so as freely as a private employer who is not bound by procedural restrictions of a collective bargaining contract. The Secretary was under no law-imposed or self-imposed restriction in discharging an employee in Vitarelli's position without statement of reasons and without a hearing. And so the question is, did the Secretary take action, after the abortive discharge in 1954, dismissing Vitarelli?\n\nIn October 1956 there was served upon Vitarelli a copy of a new notice of dismissal which had been inserted in the Department's personnel records in place of the first notice. Another copy was filed with the District Court in this proceeding. This second notice contained no mention of grounds of discharge. If, instead of sending this second notice to Vitarelli, the Secretary had telephoned Vitarelli to convey the contents of the second notice, he would have said: \"I note that you are contesting the validity of the dismissal. I want to make this very clear to you. If I did not succeed in dismissing you before, \n\n[359 \nU.S. 535, 548]\n\u00a0\n I now dismiss you, and I dismiss you retroactively, effective September 1954.\"\n\nThe Court disallows this significance to the second notice of discharge because it finds controlling meaning in the suggestion of the Government that the expunging from the record of any adverse comment, and the second notice of discharge, signified a reassertion of the effectiveness of the first attempt at dismissal. And so, the Court concludes, no intention of severance from service in 1956 could legally be found since the Secretary expressed no doubt that the first dismissal had been effective. But this document of 1956 was not a mere piece of paper in a dialectic. The paper was a record of a process, a manifestation of purpose and action. The intendment of the second notice, to be sure, was to discharge Vitarelli retroactively, resting this attempted dismissal on valid authority - the summary power to dismiss without reason. Though the second notice could not pre-date the summary discharge because the Secretary rested his 1954 discharge on an unsustainable ground, and Vitarelli could not be deprived of rights accrued during two years of unlawful discharge, the prior wrongful action did not deprive the Secretary of the power in him to fire Vitarelli prospectively. And if the intent of the Secretary be manifested in fact by what he did, however that intent be expressed - here, the intent to be rid of Vitarelli - the Court should not frustrate the Secretary's rightful exercise of this power as of October 1956. The fact that he wished to accomplish more does not mean he accomplished nothing.\n\nTo construe the second notice to mean administratively nothing is to attribute to the Secretary the purpose of a mere diarist, the corrector of entries in the Department's archives. This wholly disregards the actualities in the conduct of a Department concerned with terminating the services of an undesired employee as completely and by \n\n[359 \nU.S. 535, 549]\n\u00a0\n whatever means that may legally be accomplished. If an employer summons before him an employee over whom he has unfettered power of dismissal and says to him: \"You are no longer employed here because I fired you last week,\" can one reasonably escape the conclusion that though the employer was in error and had not effectively carried out his purpose to fire the employee last week, the employer's statement clearly manifests a present belief that the employee is dismissed and an intention that he be foreverafter dismissed? Certainly the employee would have no doubt his employment was now at an end. Of course if some special formal document were required to bring about a severance of a relationship, cf. Felter v. Southern Pacific Co., \n359 \nU.S. 326\n, because of non-compliance with the formality the severance would not come into being. But no such formality was requisite to Vitarelli's dismissal.\n\nThis is the common sense of it: In 1956 the Secretary said to Vitarelli: \"This document tells you without any ifs, ands, or buts, you have been fired right along and of course that means you are not presently employed by this Department.\" Since he had not been fired successfully in 1954, the Court concludes he must still be employed. I cannot join in an unreal interpretation which attributes to governmental action the empty meaning of confetti throwing. \n\n[359 \nU.S. 535, 550]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","205":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWABASH RAILROAD CO. v.

JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis is a libel filed pursuant to the Public Vessels Act, 46 U.S.C. 781 et seq., and involving the liability of a shipowner for injuries suffered by an employee of an \n\n[361 \nU.S. 118, 119]\n\u00a0\n independent contractor while working inside the main engine of a vessel as it was undergoing a complete overhaul at the contractor's repair docks in Philadelphia. Petitioner claims the vessel was unseaworthy and that respondent was negligent, in any event, in not furnishing him a safe place to work. The District Court denied recovery, 143 F. Supp. 473, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, 256 F.2d 671. We granted certiorari. \n359 \nU.S. 924\n. We affirm the judgment.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nThe findings of the trial judge, approved by the Court of Appeals, show that the S. S. Mary Austin is owned by the United States and was built during World War II as a \"Liberty\" ship. It had been in the \"moth-ball fleet\" at Norfolk, Virginia, in total deactivation for several years, with its pipes, boilers, and tanks completely drained, and an oil preservative injected through them to prevent rusting. In 1951 the vessel was ordered reactivated and a contractor, Atlantic Port Contractors, Inc., was selected to prepare her for sea duty. Under the specifications of the contract, Atlantic was to overhaul and reactivate the Mary Austin completely, \"cleaning and repairing all water lines, replacement of all defective or missing plugs and other parts, and the testing of all lines before closing and placing them in active operating condition.\" The contractor was to have complete responsibility and control of the making of the repairs, with the right in the United States to inspect the work and materials to insure compliance with the contract. For this purpose, the United States placed six of its men - a captain, chief mate, second mate, chief engineer, assistant engineer, and steward - on board the vessel. However, they signed no shipping articles and had no \"control of the ship in the ordinarily accepted context,\" their sole function being to \n\n[361 \nU.S. 118, 120]\n\u00a0\n serve as inspectors for the United States. Thereafter the respondent towed the Mary Austin to the repair docks of the contractor at Philadelphia and turned her over to it for the performance of the repair contract.\n\nThe petitioner, a shore-based employee of the contractor, was working inside the low pressure cylinder of the main engine of the ship when he was injured. He was kneeling on his right knee when an end plug from a one-inch pipe in the water system was propelled through the top of the open cylinder and hit his left knee. The findings indicate that the plug was loosely fitted on an overhead water pipe and that, when another employee of the contractor turned on the water without warning, the plug was forced off, hitting petitioner.\n\nRecovery was sought on the theory that the vessel was unseaworthy in that the plug had been fitted insecurely on the pipe and was therefore incapable of withstanding the water pressure exerted upon it. In addition, petitioner claimed that the United States was liable for negligence in not maintaining a safe place for him to work, a duty asserted to be nondelegable and absolute.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nPetitioner contends that he comes under the doctrine of Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, \n328 \nU.S. 85\n (1946), and subsequent cases, holding that the warranty of seaworthiness applies to shore-based workers while on board ship and performing work traditionally done by seamen. We do not think so. In Sieracki, the Court said that the warranty applied because such a shore worker \"is, in short, a seaman . . . doing a seaman's work and incurring a seaman's hazards.\" Id., 99. The findings here, however, show that, for several years, the Mary Austin was withdrawn from any operation whatever while in storage with the \"moth-ball fleet.\" The water had been drained from her water system and an antirust preservative was injected \n\n[361 \nU.S. 118, 121]\n\u00a0\n therein. Her subsequent towing to Philadelphia was for the specific purpose of delivery to Atlantic to render her seaworthy. The representation of the repair contract specifications was that she was not seaworthy for a voyage and that the major repairs called for therein would be necessary before one would be undertaken. It is evident that the sole purpose of the ship's being at Atlantic's repair dock at Philadelphia was to make her seaworthy. The totality of the reparation on the vessel included compliance with the hundreds of specifications in the contract calling for the repairing, reconditioning, and replacement, where necessary, of equipment so as to make fit all the machinery, equipment, gear, and every part of the vessel. Strangely enough, the defective water line and the metal plug specifically pointed to by petitioner as being defective were listed in the specifications for \"cleaning and repairing\" and the \"replacement of all defective or missing plugs.\" In short, as the trial court said, the work to be done on the vessel was equivalent to \"home port structural repairs.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the vessels involved in the cases depended upon by petitioner\n2\n were, at the times of the injuries, in the hands and under the control of the owners or charterers and, instead of undergoing general repairs, were in active maritime service in the course of loading or unloading cargo pursuant to voyages. The workmen, like the seamen, depended upon the seaworthiness of the ships, their equipment, and gear. They were obliged to work with whatever the shipowners supplied and it was only fair for the latter to be subjected to the absolute warranty that the ships were seaworthy. But no such situation \n\n[361 \nU.S. 118, 122]\n\u00a0\n is present here. The Mary Austin, as anyone could see, was not in maritime service. She was undergoing major repairs and complete renovation, as the petitioner knew. Furthermore, he took his orders from the contractor, not the shipowner. He knew who was in control. This undertaking was not \"ship's work\" but a complete overhaul of such nature, magnitude, and importance as to require the vessel to be turned over to a ship repair contractor and docked at its pier for the sole purpose of making her seaworthy. It would be an unfair contradiction to say that the owner held the vessel out as seaworthy in such a case. It would appear that the focus should be upon the status of the ship, the pattern of the repairs, and the extensive nature of the work contracted to be done, rather than the specific type of work that each of the numerous shore-based workmen is doing on shipboard at the moment of injury. The job analysis which the latter would call for would lead to fortuitous results. We, therefore, do not believe that the Sieracki line of cases is applicable, which obviates any necessity of our discussion of situations where the vessels themselves are not in the status of the Mary Austin. Here there could be no express or implied warranty of seaworthiness to any person.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nIn presenting his alternative ground of recovery, the petitioner has a dual theory. He first says that the duty to furnish a safe place to work is a nondelegable duty, the violation of which does not depend on fault. If unsuccessful in this position, he insists that respondent's failure to keep the water plug tight was negligence.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nOther than the doctrine of seaworthiness, whose nonrelevancy to this case we have set forth, our decisions \n\n[361 \nU.S. 118, 123]\n\u00a0\n establish no basis of liability apart from fault. Of course, one aspect of the shipowner's duty to refrain from negligent conduct is embodied in his duty to exercise reasonable care to furnish a safe place to work. But we do not believe that such a duty was owed under the circumstances of this case. Petitioner overlooks that here the respondent had no control over the vessel, or power either to supervise or to control the repair work in which petitioner was engaged. We believe this to be decisive against both aspects of plaintiff's dual theory. There was no hidden defect in the water system. It was one of the objects to be repaired and its plugs were to be replaced where necessary. Its testing was to be done by the contractor - not by the shipowner. It appears manifestly unfair to apply the requirement of a safe place to work to the shipowner when he has no control over the ship or the repairs, and the work of repair in effect creates the danger which makes the place unsafe. The respondent, having hired Atlantic to perform the overhaul and reconditioning of the vessel - including the testing - was under no duty to protect petitioner from risks that were inherent in the carrying out of the contract. The Courts of Appeals seem to have followed this rule. See Filipek v. Moore-McCormack Lines, 258 F.2d 734. Although some of respondent's employees were on board the ship here, this would not attach liability since they gave no orders, and did not participate in the work or supervise its progress, but were simply inspectors or observers. Id., at 737.\n\nPetitioner cites Crumady v. The Joachim Hendrik Fisser, \n358 \nU.S. 423\n (1959), as the chief support for his contention. There the vessel was being unloaded of cargo and its employees had set the safety cutoff device on its winch at twice the tonnage limit of the rigging. When the stevedore, unaware of this situation, brought the winch into play, the rigging snapped and the injury resulted. \n\n[361 \nU.S. 118, 124]\n\u00a0\n We found that the safety cutoff had been adjusted by employees of the vessel in a way that made it unsafe and dangerous, and therefore the vessel was liable. But that situation is not comparable. There the vessel was in control of the owner, and he was liable under the absolute warranty of seaworthiness, as well as for the negligence of the ship's employees in setting the ship's safety cutoff device. Any culpability here could be chargeable only to the contractor, not to the shipowner. Nor was United Pilots Assn. v. Halecki, \n358 \nU.S. 613\n (1959), a similar situation. In that case the shipowner directed the use of carbon tetrachloride in the confined spaces of the engine room. The resulting fumes fatally injured the shore-based workman, necessitating a remand on the negligence question. But here the owner had no control of the ship; it had been turned over to a repair contractor for extensive overhaul, which was not performed under the direction of the shipowner. While there might be instances of hidden or inherent defects, sometimes called \"latent,\" that would make the owner guilty of negligence, even though he had no control of the repairs, we hold that under the circumstances here the shipowner could not be so chargeable. The judgment is therefore\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This obviates the necessity of deciding the respondent's claim over and against the contractor.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Atlantic Transport Co. v.

Over petitioners' motion to dismiss on the ground that jurisdiction lay in the tribal court rather than in the state court, judgment was entered in favor of respondent. The Supreme Court of Arizona affirmed, holding that since no Act of Congress expressly forbids their doing so Arizona courts are free to exercise jurisdiction over civil suits by non-Indians against Indians though the action arises on an Indian reservation. 83 Ariz. 241, 319 P.2d 998. Because this was a doubtful determination of the important question of state power over Indian affairs, we granted certiorari. \n356 \nU.S. 930\n.\n\nOriginally the Indian tribes were separate nations within what is now the United States. Through conquest and treaties they were induced to give up complete independence and the right to go to war in exchange for federal protection, aid, and grants of land. When the lands granted lay within States these governments sometimes sought to impose their laws and courts on the Indians. Around 1830 the Georgia Legislature extended its laws to the Cherokee Reservation despite federal treaties with the Indians which set aside this land for them.\n2\n The Georgia statutes forbade the Cherokees from enacting laws or holding courts and prohibited outsiders from being on the Reservation except with permission of the State Governor. The constitutionality of these laws was tested in Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, when the State sought to punish \n\n[358 \nU.S. 217, 219]\n\u00a0\n a white man, licensed by the Federal Government to practice as a missionary among the Cherokees, for his refusal to leave the Reservation. Rendering one of his most courageous and eloquent opinions, Chief Justice Marshall held that Georgia's assertion of power was invalid. \"The Cherokee nation . . . is a distinct community, occupying its own territory . . . in which the laws of Georgia can have no force, and which the citizens of Georgia have no right to enter, but with the assent of the Cherokees themselves, or in conformity with treaties, and with the acts of congress. The whole intercourse between the United States and this nation, is, by our constitution and laws, vested in the government of the United States.\" 6 Pet., at 561.\n\nDespite bitter criticism and the defiance of Georgia which refused to obey this Court's mandate in Worcester\n3\n the board principles of that decision came to be accepted as law.\n4\n Over the years this Court has modified these principles in cases where essential tribal relations were not involved and where the rights of Indians would not be jeopardized, but the basic policy of Worcester has remained. Thus, suits by Indians against outsiders in state courts have been sanctioned. See Felix v. Patrick, \n\n[358 \nU.S. 217, 220]\n\u00a0\n \n145 \nU.S. 317, 332\n; United States v. Candelaria, \n271 \nU.S. 432\n. See also Harrison v. Laveen, 67 Ariz. 337, 196 P.2d 456. And state courts have been allowed to try non-Indians who committed crimes against each other on a reservation. E. g., New York ex rel. Ray v. Martin, \n326 \nU.S. 496\n. But if the crime was by or against an Indian, tribal jurisdiction or that expressly conferred on other courts by Congress has remained exclusive.\n5\n Donnelly v. United States, \n228 \nU.S. 243, 269\n-272; Williams v. United States, \n327 \nU.S. 711\n. Essentially, absent governing Acts of Congress, the question has always been whether the state action infringed on the right of reservation Indians to make their own laws and be ruled by them. Cf. Utah & Northern Railway v. Fisher, \n116 \nU.S. 28\n.\n\nCongress has also acted consistently upon the assumption that the States have no power to regulate the affairs of Indians on a reservation. To assure adequate government of the Indian tribes it enacted comprehensive statutes in 1834 regulating trade with Indians and organizing a Department of Indian Affairs. 4 Stat. 729, 735. Not satisfied solely with centralized government of Indians, it encouraged tribal governments and courts to become stronger and more highly organized. See, e. g., the Wheeler-Howard Act, 16, 17, 48 Stat. 987, 988, 25 U.S.C. 476, 477. Congress has followed a policy calculated eventually to make all Indians full-fledged participants in American society. This policy contemplates criminal and civil jurisdiction over Indians by any State ready to assume the burdens that go with it as soon as the educational and economic status of the Indians permits the change without disadvantage to \n\n[358 \nU.S. 217, 221]\n\u00a0\n them. See H. R. Rep. No. 848, 83d Cong., 1st Sess. 3, 6, 7 (1953). Significantly, when Congress has wished the States to exercise this power it has expressly granted them the jurisdiction which Worcester v. Georgia had denied.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nNo departure from the policies which have been applied to other Indians is apparent in the relationship between the United States and the Navajos. On June 1, 1868, a treaty was signed between General William T. Sherman, for the United States, and numerous chiefs and headmen of the \"Navajo nation or tribe of Indians.\"\n7\n At the time this document was signed the Navajos were an exiled people, forced by the United States to live crowded together on a small piece of land on the Pecos River in eastern New Mexico, some 300 miles east of the area they had occupied before the coming of the white man. In return for their promises to keep peace, this treaty \"set apart\" for \"their permanent home\" a portion of what had been their native country, and provided that no one, except United States Government personnel, was to enter the reserved area. Implicit in these treaty terms, as it was in the treaties with the Cherokees involved in Worcester v. Georgia, was the understanding that the internal affairs of the Indians remained exclusively within \n\n[358 \nU.S. 217, 222]\n\u00a0\n the jurisdiction of whatever tribal government existed. Since then, Congress and the Bureau of Indian Affairs have assisted in strengthening the Navajo tribal government and its courts. See the Navajo-Hopi Rehabilitation Act of 1950, 6, 64 Stat. 46, 25 U.S.C. 636; 25 CFR 11.1 through 11.87NH. The Tribe itself has in recent years greatly improved its legal system through increased expenditures and better-trained personnel. Today the Navajo Courts of Indian Offenses exercise broad criminal and civil jurisdiction which covers suits by outsiders against Indian defendants.\n8\n No Federal Act has given state courts jurisdiction over such controversies.\n9\n In a general statute Congress did express its willingness to have any State assume jurisdiction over reservation Indians if the State Legislature or the people vote affirmatively to accept such responsibility.\n10\n To date, Arizona has not \n\n[358 \nU.S. 217, 223]\n\u00a0\n accepted jurisdiction, possibly because the people of the State anticipate that the burdens accompanying such power might be considerable.\n11\n\u00a0\n\nThere can be no doubt that to allow the exercise of state jurisdiction here would undermine the authority of the tribal courts over Reservation affairs and hence would infringe on the right of the Indians to govern themselves. It is immaterial that respondent is not an Indian. He was on the Reservation and the transaction with an Indian took place there. Cf. Donnelly v. United States, supra; Williams v. United States, supra. The cases in this Court have consistently guarded the authority of Indian governments over their reservations. Congress recognized this authority in the Navajos in the Treaty of 1868, and has done so ever since. If this power is to be taken away from them, it is for Congress to do it. Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock, \n187 \nU.S. 553, 564\n-566.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 31 Stat. 1066, as amended, 32 Stat. 1009, 25 U.S.C. 262, provides: \"Any person desiring to trade with the Indians on any Indian reservation shall, upon establishing the fact, to the satisfaction \n\n[358 \nU.S. 217, 218]\n\u00a0\n of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, that he is a proper person to engage in such trade, be permitted to do so under such rules and regulations as the Commissioner of Indian Affairs may prescribe for the protection of said Indians.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Georgia laws are set out extensively in Worcester v.

OKLAHOMA(1959)\nNo. 124\nArgued: January 21, 1959Decided: February 24, 1959\n\n\n\n\n While fleeing from police after robbing a filling station, petitioner forced his way at gunpoint into the automobile of one Cooke, forced him to drive far into the country, there shot and killed him, and escaped in his car. Charged in an Oklahoma court with murder, he entered a plea of guilty and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Thereafter, he was charged in another Oklahoma court with the kidnaping involved in the same occurrence. While represented by counsel and after being warned by the court that conviction might result in a death sentence, he pleaded guilty and was convicted. Before sentencing him, the court permitted the State's Attorney to make an unsworn statement in which he recounted at length the armed robbery, the chase, the elusion of police, the gruesome details of the kidnaping and murder and petitioner's past criminal record; and petitioner was sentenced to death on the kidnaping charge. Under Oklahoma law, kidnaping and murder are separate and distinct offenses, and petitioner made no claim prior to his conviction that he was being put twice in jeopardy for the same offense. Under Oklahoma law, the granting of a presentence hearing at which testimony is taken is discretionary with the trial court, and petitioner did not request such a hearing. Held: Petitioner was not denied due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Pp. 577-587.\n\n (a) On the record, this Court cannot say that petitioner was deprived of any right or of fundamental fairness by the fact that the trial court did not pursue the presentencing procedures prescribed by the Oklahoma statutes. Pp. 582-583.\n\n\n (b) The statement by the State's Attorney of the details of the crime and of petitioner's criminal record - all admitted by petitioner to be true - did not deprive petitioner of fundamental fairness or of any right of confrontation or cross-examination. Pp. 583-584.\n\n\n (c) On the record in this case, this Court cannot say that the sentencing judge was not entitled to consider the murder, along with all other circumstances involved, in determining the proper sentence for the kidnaping. Pp. 584-586. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 576, 577]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n (d) Since kidnaping and murder are separate and distinct crimes under Oklahoma law, the court's consideration of the murder as a circumstance involved in the kidnaping cannot be said to have resulted in punishing petitioner a second time for the same offense nor to have denied him due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. P. 586.\n\n\n (e) This Court cannot say that the death sentence for kidnaping, which was within the range of punishments authorized for that crime by Oklahoma law, denied to petitioner due process of law or any other constitutional right. Pp. 586-587.\n\n\n 321 P.2d 990, affirmed.\n\nJohn A. Ladner, Jr. filed a brief and argued the cause, pro hac vice, by special leave of the Court, for petitioner.\n\nMac Q. Williamson, Attorney General of Oklahoma, and Sam H. Lattimore, Assistant Attorney General, argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nUpon his plea of guilty to a charge of kidnaping in the District Court of Tulsa County, Oklahoma, petitioner was sentenced to death. On appeal, the Criminal Court of Appeals of Oklahoma affirmed, 321 P.2d 990, and certiorari was sought on the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. We granted the writ to determine that question. \n357 \nU.S. 925\n.\n\nThe undisputed facts are that on June 17, 1956, within a few hours after robbing a filling station attendant in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and eluding police in an ensuing chase, petitioner forced his way into an automobile being driven by one Tommy Cooke, a young divinity student, as it stopped for a traffic light in that city, and, at gunpoint, forced Cooke to drive beyond the City and County of Tulsa and for a considerable distance through northeastern \n\n[358 \nU.S. 576, 578]\n\u00a0\n Oklahoma to a point on a dead-end road in Muskogee County where he shot and killed him, and then escaped in the car. On June 19, 1956, petitioner was apprehended, and soon afterward he was charged in the District Court of Muskogee County with murdering Cooke in that county. On arraignment, he entered a plea of not guilty, but during the course of his trial petitioner, on November 19, 1956, withdrew that plea and entered a plea of guilty as charged. He was thereupon convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nThereafter, on December 17, 1956, petitioner was charged in the District Court of Tulsa County with kidnaping Cooke in that county on June 17, 1956, in violation of Okla. Stat., 1951, Tit. 21, 745.\n2\n At his arraignment on December 19, 1956, petitioner entered a plea of not guilty, but on January 30, 1957, a few days before the scheduled date of trial, he withdrew that plea and entered a plea of guilty as charged. After interrogating petitioner to make sure that he had entered the plea of guilty voluntarily and that he understood that he might be sentenced to death upon it,\n3\n the court accepted the plea \n\n[358 \nU.S. 576, 579]\n\u00a0\n and adjudged petitioner guilty of the crime of kidnaping Cooke as charged. Thereupon the court asked counsel for petitioner if he wished to be heard regarding the sentence to be imposed, and counsel replied that he preferred to reserve his statement until after the State's Attorney had spoken. The State's Attorney then made a statement - reading much of it from a prepared statement - recounting the armed robbery of the filling station attendant and the following chase by and elusion of the Tulsa police; reciting the gruesome details of the kidnaping of Cooke in Tulsa County and of his murder in Muskogee County; stating petitioner's past criminal record as shown \n\n[358 \nU.S. 576, 580]\n\u00a0\n by the files of the Federal Bureau of Investigation;\n4\n and concluding with a request for a death sentence. Counsel for petitioner objected to any reference to the murder on the ground that sentence for that crime had already been imposed by the District Court of Muskogee County and that it could not again lawfully be considered in imposing sentence on the kidnaping charge. The court, expressing the view that it was \"proper to advise the Court of all the facts [occurring while petitioner] had the victim in his charge and under his control,\" overruled the objection. After the State's Attorney had concluded, counsel for petitioner put in evidence a transcript of the sentencing proceedings had in the District Court of Muskogee County in the murder case, and made an extended plea for a sentence to life imprisonment rather than a sentence to death.\n\nAfter thus fully hearing the parties, the court deferred the imposition of sentence for two days. Upon reconvening, the court called petitioner to the bar and asked him whether he wished to make any correction in the statement that had been made to the court by the State's Attorney. Petitioner answered that he did not, and that the matters related in that statement were true.\n5\n Thereupon, \n\n[358 \nU.S. 576, 581]\n\u00a0\n the court sentenced petitioner to death, and in the course of his pronouncement the judge said, among other things, that he had considered the facts \"which [had] been stated [by counsel] and which [petitioner had] admitted were [involved in] this crime [of kidnaping], committed in Tulsa County, which resulted in the murder of the victim, [all of] which the Court takes into consideration . . . as a continuing thing.\"\n\nAs stated, petitioner's broad claim is that these proceedings show that the death sentence was determined and imposed in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In support of that position he makes, and variously repeats, a number of arguments which upon analysis come down to three contentions: first, that the trial court violated the presentence procedure prescribed by Okla. Stat., 1951, Tit. 22, 973, 974 and 975, in permitting the State's Attorney to make an unsworn statement to the court of the details of the crime and of petitioner's criminal record, and that this also denied to him the rights of confrontation and cross-examination; second, that the court in taking the murder into consideration in imposing sentence on the kidnaping charge punished him a second time for the same offense; and, third, that in any event the sentence to death for kidnaping was \"disproportionate\" to that crime and to \n\n[358 \nU.S. 576, 582]\n\u00a0\n the life sentence that had earlier been imposed upon him for the \"ultimate\" crime of murder.\n\nPetitioner's contentions that the trial court deprived him of his legal rights and of fundamental fairness in failing to pursue the formal presentence procedures prescribed by Okla. Stat., 1951, Tit. 22, 973, 974 and 975, and in permitting the State's Attorney to make an unsworn statement to the court of the details of the crime and of petitioner's criminal record were also made by petitioner in the Criminal Court of Appeals of Oklahoma. That court rejected those contentions. Sections 973-975 provide in substance that after a plea or verdict of guilty in a case where the extent of the punishment is left with the court, the court, upon the suggestion of either party that there are circumstances which may be properly taken into view, either in aggravation or mitigation of the punishment, may, in its discretion, hold a formal hearing and take evidence thereon.\n6\n The Oklahoma court held that whether those procedures shall be used is discretionary with the trial court, and that, at all events, petitioner waived their use by failing to request a hearing under those statutes. In construing those statutes it said: \"But, two things are clear under the provisions of 973. First, \n\n[358 \nU.S. 576, 583]\n\u00a0\n pursuing this method of procedure is a matter of the trial court's sound discretion. Second, its use is further contingent upon the request of either the state or the defendant.\" It further said: \"It is contended that under the provisions of 975 it is the mandatory duty of the court to hear witnesses. But, in construing 974 and 975 in light of the provisions of 973, we are of the opinion that both the provisions of 974 and 975 are contingent upon the request for evidence under the provisions of 973, [and that] [w]hen the parties fail to make a request for the privilege thereof, the same is waived and some other method of supplying the court with the necessary information for the pronouncement of judgment and sentence may be substituted instead.\" This construction of the State's statutes by its court of last resort must be accepted here.\n\nIt is not contended that petitioner requested or suggested that the trial court hear evidence in mitigation of the sentence. Nor did petitioner request or suggest that the court require the State to offer evidence in support of the aggravating circumstances. In these circumstances, we cannot say that petitioner was deprived of any right or of fundamental fairness by the fact that the trial court did not pursue the presentencing procedures prescribed by the Oklahoma statutes.\n\nNor did the State's Attorney's statement of the details of the crime and of petitioner's criminal record deprive petitioner of fundamental fairness or of any right of confrontation or cross-examination. As we have seen, the Court of Criminal Appeals of Oklahoma held in this case that when petitioner failed to request the privilege of adducing evidence in mitigation of the crime, and thereby waived the presentence procedures prescribed by 973-975, the law of Oklahoma authorized \"some other method of supplying the court with the necessary information for the pronouncement of judgment and sentence [to] be \n\n[358 \nU.S. 576, 584]\n\u00a0\n substituted instead,\" and it held that the State's Attorney's statement was a proper method in these circumstances under the law of Oklahoma. Moreover, after the State's Attorney had made his statement, petitioner, upon interrogation by the court, stated that the recitals of that statement were true. See Note 5. This alone should be a complete answer to the contention. But we go on to consider this Court's opinion in Williams v. New York, \n337 \nU.S. 241\n. This Court there dealt with very similar contentions and held that, once the guilt of the accused has been properly established, the sentencing judge, in determining the kind and extent of punishment to be imposed, is not restricted to evidence derived from the examination and cross-examination of witnesses in open court but may, consistently with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, consider responsible unsworn or \"out-of-court\" information relative to the circumstances of the crime and to the convicted person's life and characteristics.\n\nThese considerations make it clear that the State's Attorney's statement of the details of the crime and of petitioner's criminal record - all admitted by petitioner to be true - did not deprive petitioner of fundamental fairness or of any right of confrontation or cross-examination.\n\nWe come now to petitioner's contention that the court in taking the murder into consideration in imposing sentence on the kidnaping charge punished him a second time for the same offense. But murder and kidnaping are not the same offense in Oklahoma. The Oklahoma statutes separately create and define the crimes of murder\n7\n and \n\n[358 \nU.S. 576, 585]\n\u00a0\n of kidnaping,\n8\n and it is evident from their terms that, as held by the Oklahoma court in this case, they create \"separate and distinct offenses.\" It is not contended that the charge of murder to which petitioner pleaded guilty and was sentenced in Muskogee County made any reference to the crime of kidnaping, and the charge involved in this case made no reference to the murder but was substantially in the language of the kidnaping statute. See Note 2. Petitioner did not object to the charge in the trial court on double jeopardy or double punishment grounds as the Oklahoma courts have held to be necessary to preserve such a point,\n9\n but instead he entered a plea of guilty to the charge. Upon that plea it became the duty of the trial judge to impose an appropriate sentence. The statute made appropriate, and required the imposition of, a sentence within the range of imprisonment for a term of 10 years to the maximum of death (see Note 2), as determined by the sentencing judge in the exercise of his sound discretion. Necessarily, the exercise of a sound discretion in such a case required consideration of all the circumstances of the crime, for \"[t]he belief no longer prevails that every offense in a like legal category calls for an identical punishment. . . .\" Williams v. New York, supra, at 247. In discharging his duty of imposing a proper sentence, the sentencing judge is authorized, if not required, to consider all of the mitigating and aggravating circumstances involved in the crime. The Oklahoma \n\n[358 \nU.S. 576, 586]\n\u00a0\n court has so declared in this case and in Powell v. State, 94 Okla. Crim. 1, 229 P.2d 230. This Court, too, has so held. Williams v. New York, supra. Certainly one of the aggravating circumstances involved in this kidnaping crime was the fact that petitioner shot and killed the victim in the course of its commission. We cannot say that the sentencing judge was not entitled to consider that circumstance, along with all the other circumstances involved, in determining the proper sentence to be imposed for the kidnaping crime. And in view of the obvious fact that, under the law of Oklahoma, kidnaping is a separate crime, entirely distinct from the crime of murder, the court's consideration of the murder as a circumstance involved in the kidnaping crime cannot be said to have resulted in punishing petitioner a second time for the same offense, nor to have denied to him due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nPetitioner's further claim that the sentence to death for kidnaping was \"disproportionate\" to that crime and to the life sentence that had earlier been imposed upon him for the \"ultimate\" crime of murder proceeds on the basis that the sentence for kidnaping was excessive, that the murder was the greater offense, and that the sentence for the lesser crime of kidnaping ought not, in conscience and with due regard for fundamental fairness, exceed the life sentence that was imposed in another jurisdiction for the murder. But the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not, nor does anything in the Constitution, require a State to fix or impose any particular penalty for any crime it may define or to impose the same or \"proportionate\" sentences for separate and independent crimes. Therefore we cannot say that the sentence to death for the kidnaping, which was within the range of punishments authorized for that crime by the law of the State, denied to petitioner due process of \n\n[358 \nU.S. 576, 587]\n\u00a0\n law or any other constitutional right. Nor, in view of the fact that kidnaping and murder are separate and independent offenses in Oklahoma, is there any merit in petitioner's collateral claim that what he calls \"the lesser crime\" of kidnaping \"merged\" in what he calls \"the greater crime\" of murder and that the sentence to life imprisonment for the murder was a bar to the imposition of any sentence for the kidnaping, or at least to any greater sentence than was imposed for the murder, and that imposition of a death sentence for the kidnaping deprived him of due process in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nWe have now treated with all of petitioner's claims, and failing to find any deprivation by the Oklahoma courts of any of his fundamental rights, we must hold that petitioner was not denied due process of law.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE DOUGLAS, being of the view that petitioner was in substance tried for murder twice in violation of the guarantee against double jeopardy, dissents.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Okla.

The daily ore needs of the plant were taken from those \"ore yards\" and conveyed to \"stock bins,\" from which the ores were fed into the furnaces. Ohio assessed an ad valorem tax based on the average value of the ore in these \"ore yards\" during the tax year. Held: Since these ores were not only needed, imported and irrevocably committed to supply, but were actually being used to supply, the daily requirements of the manufacturing plant, they had lost their distinctive character as \"imports\" and all tax immunity as such.

From time to time, so much of the lumber as was about to be put into veneered products was taken from the stacks and placed in a kiln, where \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 535]\n\u00a0\n the drying was completed. The imported veneers were received \"in bundles\" and kept in that form in piles, separated as to specie, in the manufacturer's plant for use as needed in the day-to-day operations of the plant. The City assessed a tax against petitioner, based upon the value of one-half of the imported lumber and veneers then on hand. Held: The lumber and veneers that were taxed were not only needed, imported and irrevocably committed to supply, but actually were being used to supply, the daily requirements of the manufacturing plant, and they had lost their distinctive character as \"imports\" and all tax immunity as such.

JUSTICE WHITTAKER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe principal question presented by these cases is whether appellant in No. 9, the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company, and petitioner in No. 44, United States Plywood Corporation, have so acted upon the materials which they have imported for use in their manufacturing operations as to cause them to lose their distinctive character as \"imports,\" within the meaning of that term as used in the Import-Export Clause, Art. I, 10, cl. 2, of the United States Constitution.\n1\n The Supreme Courts of the States concerned have held that these manufacturers have done so. Our task is to decide whether, on the particular facts involved, those holdings violate the Import-Export Clause of the Constitution.\n\nThe facts in the Youngstown case are stipulated. In essence, they are that Youngstown, an Ohio corporation, operates an industrial plant in or near Youngstown, Ohio, where it manufactures iron and steel. In addition to the use of domestic ores, it imports iron ores from five countries \"for ultimate use in [its] open hearth [and] blast furnaces\" in its manufacturing processes. The imported ores arrive in shiploads \"in bulk\" either at an Atlantic or a Lake Erie port of entry where they are unloaded from the ship into railroad cars and are thereby transported to Youngstown's plant in Ohio. The plant is enclosed by a wire fence. Within the enclosure and \"adjacent to [the] manufacturing facilities\" are several \"ore yards\" for the storage of supplies of ore.\n2\n Each ore yard consists \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 537]\n\u00a0\n of \"two parallel walls, on which there [is] a movable ore bridge.\" When the imported ores arrive at this final destination, they are unloaded into one of the ore yards, but, because the ore from each country is different from the others and each is imported for a different use, the ores are kept segregated as to the country of origin by being \"placed in a separate pile in a separate area of the ore yard.\" The daily manufacturing needs for ore are taken from these piles. As needed, ores are conveyed from the particular pile or piles selected to \"stock bins\" or \"stock houses,\" holding one or two days' supply and located in close proximity to the furnaces, from which the ores are fed into the furnaces. As ore from a particular \"pile\" in the ore yard is thus taken and consumed, other like ore is similarly imported from the same country and is brought to the plant and unloaded on top of the remainder of that particular pile. This course is continuously repeated. Youngstown endeavors to maintain \"a supply of imported ores to meet its estimated requirements for a period of at least three months.\" The ores are not imported \"for resale,\" but \"for use in manufacturing [at the Ohio plant].\"\n\nActing under Ohio statutes which provide, inter alia, that \"All personal property located and used in business in this state [shall be] subject to taxation . . .\"\n3\n and that \"Personal property is `used' within the meaning of `used in business' . . . when stored or kept on hand as material, parts, products, or merchandise . . .,\"\n4\n the Tax Commissioner of Ohio proposed to assess an ad valorem tax against Youngstown based on the average value of the iron ores in its ore yards during the tax year ended January 1, 1954.\n5\n Youngstown contested the proposed \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 538]\n\u00a0\n assessment. It contended, among other things, that the imported ores had not lost their character as imports and were therefore immune from state taxation under Art. I, 10, cl. 2 of the United States Constitution.\n\nAfter exhaustion of administrative proceedings, the case reached the Supreme Court of Ohio. It held that the \"protection [of the Import-Export Clause cannot] extend to such iron ore (1) after it has been commingled with other iron ore imported at a different time, even though such other iron ore is of the same grade and was imported from the same place, and (2) after portions of such iron ore have been removed for use in manufacturing.\" It then entered judgment sustaining the tax, 166 Ohio St. 122, 140 N. E. 2d 313, and we noted probable jurisdiction of Youngstown's appeal. \n355 \nU.S. 911\n.\n\nThe facts in the United States Plywood Corporation case were found in detail by the trial court and those findings are not challenged here. In essence, they are that United States Plywood Corporation (petitioner) operates an industrial plant in Algoma, Wisconsin, where it manufactures veneered wood products. It uses both domestic and imported lumber and veneers in its manufacturing processes. The imported lumber is shipped in railroad cars directly from Canada to petitioner's plant. It is unfinished, and is received in bulk or as loose, individual pieces or boards. It is also \"green\" when received and therefore must be dried before it can be used by petitioner. Upon arrival at destination, it is unloaded and carted to petitioner's storage yard, located \"adjacent\" to \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 539]\n\u00a0\n its plant, where it is stacked in the open in such a way as to allow the air freely to circulate through the stacks for the \"dominant purpose\" of air-drying it. This method does not so completely dry the lumber as to make kiln-drying unnecessary, but it does materially reduce the time and expense of that process. From time to time, so much of the lumber as is about to be put into veneered products is taken from the stacks and placed in a kiln where the drying is completed and the lumber readied for use. The veneers are imported from three countries. They are received in bundles and are kept in that form in piles, separated as to specie, in petitioner's plant for use as needed in the day-to-day operations of the plant.\n\nOn the assessment date of May 1, 1955, the Assessor of the City of Algoma, acting under what is now Wis. Stat., 1957, 70.01, assessed a tax against petitioner based upon the value of one-half of the imported lumber and veneers then on hand. Petitioner paid the tax and then sued in the state court for its recovery. The trial court also found that air-drying the lumber \"was part of [petitioner's] manufacturing practices,\" and that, when stacked for air-drying, the lumber \"entered the process of manufacture\" and thus lost its character as an \"import,\" and therefore all of it might lawfully have been taxed by the city. The court further found that the lumber and veneers had been imported by petitioner \"for use in manufacturing\" at its Algoma plant, and that their importation journeys definitely had ended; that the lumber and veneers that were taxed (one-half of the amounts on hand) had been irrevocably committed to \"use in manufacturing,\" at that plant, were \"necessarily required to be kept on hand to meet [petitioner's] current operational needs,\" were being \"used in manufacturing,\" and had therefore lost their character as \"imports\" and were subject to local taxation. It then entered judgment for the city, sustaining the tax, and, on petitioner's appeal, the \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 540]\n\u00a0\n Supreme Court of Wisconsin affirmed. 2 Wis. 2d 567, 87 N. W. 2d 481. Because of the importance of the constitutional question presented we granted certiorari. \n356 \nU.S. 957\n.\n\nThe Constitution confers on Congress the power to lay and collect import duties, Art. I, 8, and provides that \"No State shall, without the Consent of the Congress, lay any Impost or Duties on Imports or Exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing it's inspection Laws. . . .\" Art. I, 10, cl. 2. That these provisions were intended to confer on the National Government the exclusive power to tax the act of importation is plain from their terms. And early in our national history Chief Justice Marshall held, in the landmark case of Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, that one who had imported goods for the purpose of selling them had, \"by payment of the duty to the United States, [acquired the] right to dispose of his merchandise, as well as to bring it into the country\" (id., at 442), and that the State could not tax it \"while remaining the property of the importer, in his warehouse, in the original form or package in which it was imported.\"\n6\n Id., at 442. But he made very clear that \". . . there must be a point of time when the prohibition ceases, and the power of the State to tax commences.\" Id., at 441. Elaborating this concept, he said:\n\n \"The constitutional prohibition on the States to lay a duty on imports . . . may certainly come in conflict with their acknowledged power to tax persons \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 541]\n\u00a0\n and property within their territory. The power, and the restriction on it, though quite distinguishable when they do not approach each other, may yet . . . approach so nearly as to perplex the understanding. . . . Yet the distinction exists, and must be marked as the cases arise. Till they do arise, it might be premature to state any rule as being universal in its application. It is sufficient for the present to say, generally, that when the importer has so acted upon the thing imported, that it has become incorporated and mixed up with the mass of property in the country, it has, perhaps, lost its distinctive character as an import, and has become subject to the taxing power of the State. . . .\" Id., at 441-442. (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n While Chief Justice Marshall did not undertake definitively to state just what acts or conduct of the importer would be deemed to have \"so acted upon the thing imported\" as to cause it to be \"mixed up with the mass of property in the country [and to lose] its distinctive character as an import,\" he did specify some of the acts that would so result. He held that the goods lose their character as an imports when the importer (1) \"sells them,\"\n7\n or (2) \"[breaks] up his packages, and [travels] with them as an itinerant pedlar.\" Id., at 443. More important to the question confronting us, he also held (3) that goods brought into this country by an importer \"for his own use\" and here \"used\" by him are to be regarded as a \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 542]\n\u00a0\n part of \"the common mass\" of property and are not immune from state taxation.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nIn Hooven & Allison Co. v. Evatt, \n324 \nU.S. 652\n, it was held that goods imported for \"use\" share the same immunity as goods imported for \"sale,\" and that goods imported \"for manufacture [do not] lose their character as imports any sooner or more readily than imports for sale\" (id., at 667); but \"when [the imported goods are] used for the purpose for which they are imported, they cease to be imports and their tax exemption is at an end.\" Id., at 665.\n\nThus, though Brown v. Maryland, supra, holds that goods brought into the country by an importer \"for his own use\" are not exempted from state taxation by the Import-Export Clause, and Hooven & Allison Co. v. Evatt, supra, holds that they are, both agree that when the imported goods are \"used for the purpose for which they are imported, they cease to be imports and their tax exemption is at an end.\" Hooven & Allison Co. v. Evatt, supra, at 665. Compare Brown v. Maryland, supra, at 441-443. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 543]\n\u00a0\n\n\nDo the facts as stipulated and found in the cases before us, when considered in the light of applicable legal principles, show that these manufacturers have so acted upon the imported materials as to cause them to lose their distinctive character as \"imports\" by irrevocably committing them, after their importation journeys have definitely ended, to \"use in manufacturing\" at the plant and point of final destination, and by \"entering\" and \"using\" them \"in manufacturing\" at that place? The manufacturers, relying upon their understanding of the Hooven case, argue that they do not, but we have concluded that they do.\n\nIn Hooven the taxpayer had imported bales of hemp and other fibers which it stored in its warehouse at its factory in Ohio with the intention of eventually using them in the manufacture of cordage and similar products. Ohio sought to lay an ad valorem tax on the bales of fibers so stored in the taxpayer's warehouse. The taxpayer contended that the bales of fibers were \"imports\" and thus immune from state taxation under the Import-Export Clause of the Constitution. The Supreme Court of Ohio \"thought that Brown v. Maryland, supra, laid down a rule applicable only to imports for the purpose of sale, and that imports for use became, upon storage, even if still in the original package, so intermingled with the common mass of property within the State as to be subject to the State power of taxation\" (\n324 \nU.S., at 655\n), and upon that ground upheld the tax. This Court, holding that the tax immunity applies to goods imported for \"use\" as well as for \"sale,\" that the bales of fibers would not lose their character as imports \"until [they were] put to the use for which [they were] imported\" (id., at 665), and that the fibers were not shown by the record in that case to have been \"subjected to manufacture \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 544]\n\u00a0\n when they were placed in [the taxpayer's] warehouse in their original packages\" (id., at 667), reversed the judgment. But the record there did not present, and this Court did not reach or decide, the question we have here. Indeed, the Court expressly reserved it. It said:\n\n\"[I]t is unnecessary to decide whether, for purposes of the constitutional immunity, the presence of some fibers in the factory was so essential to current manufacturing requirements that they could be said to have entered the process of manufacture, and hence were already put to the use for which they were imported, before they were removed from the original packages. Even though the inventory of raw material required to be kept on hand to meet the current operational needs of a manufacturing business could be thought to have then entered the manufacturing process, the decision of the Ohio Supreme Court did not rest on that ground, and the record affords no basis for saying that any part of petitioner's fibers, stored in its warehouse, were required to meet such immediate current needs. Hence we have no occasion to consider that question.\" Id., at 667.\n\n\n Unlike Hooven, these are not cases of the mere storage in a warehouse of imported materials intended for eventual use in manufacturing but not found to have been essential to current operational needs. Here the Ohio and Wisconsin courts have in effect held that the stipulated and found facts show that the imported materials that were taxed by those States were so essential to current manufacturing requirements that they must be said to have entered the process of manufacture, and those courts have rested their judgments, in major part at least, on that ground. Our question therefore is precisely the one which the Court did not reach or consider in the Hooven case. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 545]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are therefore confronted with the practical, albeit vexing, problem of reconciling the competing demands of the constitutional immunity of imports and of the State's power to tax property within its borders. The design of the constitutional immunity was to prevent \"[t]he great importing States [from laying] a tax on the non-importing States,\" to which the imported property is or might ultimately be destined, which would not only discriminate against them but also \"would necessarily produce countervailing measures on the part of those States whose situation was less favourable to importation.\" Brown v. Maryland, supra, at 440. See Madison, Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787, August 28, 1787 (Hunt & Scott ed.). And see, e. g., Cook v. Pennsylvania, \n97 \nU.S. 566, 574\n; Richfield Oil Corp. v. State Board, \n329 \nU.S. 69, 76\n-77. The constitutional design was then to immunize imports from taxation by the importing States, and all others through or into which they may pass, so long as they retain their distinctive character as imports. Hence, that design is not impinged by the taxation of materials that were imported for use in manufacturing after all phases of the importation definitely have ended and the materials have been \"put to the use for which they [were] imported\" (Hooven & Allison Co. v. Evatt, supra, at 657), for in such a case they have lost their distinctive character as imports and are subject to taxation. And inasmuch as \"the reconciliation of the competing demands of the constitutional immunity and of the state's power to tax, is an extremely practical matter\" (Hooven & Allison Co. v. Evatt, supra, at 668), we must approach the question whether these materials had been \"put to the use for which they [were] imported\" (id., at 657) with full awareness of realities and treat with them in a practical way.\n\nThe stipulation in the Youngstown case shows that the imported ores were essential to the operation of Youngstown's \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 546]\n\u00a0\n Ohio plant; that Youngstown had imported them \"for use in manufacturing\" and \"to meet its estimated [manufacturing] requirements\" at that plant; that the ores had arrived at their destination, had been placed in \"piles\" in the \"ore yards\" of that plant, and their importation journey definitely had ended; that the ores were irrevocably committed to \"use in manufacturing\" at that plant and point of final destination; and that the daily ore needs of the plant were conveyed from the \"piles\" in the \"ore yards\" to \"stock bins\" or \"stock houses,\" holding one or two days' supply, from which they were fed into the furnaces. Does not the stipulation thus show that the ores were not only needed, imported, and irrevocably committed to supply, but were actually being used to supply, the daily requirements of the plant? It seems to us that these stipulated facts inescapably establish that Youngstown had \"so acted upon the [imported ores]\" (Brown v. Maryland, supra, at 441), by using them \"for the purpose for which they [were] imported,\" that they must be held \"to have then entered the manufacturing process\" (Hooven & Allison Co. v. Evatt, supra, at 665, 667) and to have lost their distinctive character as \"imports\" and all tax immunity as such.\n\nYoungstown does not deny that so much of the ores as have been conveyed from the \"piles\" in the \"ore yards\" to the \"stock bins\" or \"stock houses\" have lost their distinctive character as imports. Is there any real basis of distinction? The only possible differences are in the sizes of the piles and their distances from the furnaces. Surely the size of the pile is not material. Just as surely the short distance between the smaller piles in the \"stock bins\" or \"stock houses\" and the larger piles in the ore yards is not a real distinction. If the larger piles stood on higher ground adjoining the \"stock bins\" and \"stock houses\" so that the ores might feed by gravity from the \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 547]\n\u00a0\n former to the latter there would be no practical difference from the actual facts involved, but it could not be argued that the ores in the one are any less certainly being used in the processes of manufacture than the ores in the other. It seems entirely plain that the ores in the smaller piles in the \"stock bins\" and \"stock houses\" are no more definitely and irrevocably committed to use, or being used, at the plant than are the ores in the larger piles in the ore yards from which the smaller ones are constantly kept supplied. \"[R]econciliation of the competing demands of the constitutional immunity and of the state's power to tax [being] an extremely practical matter\" (Hooven & Allison Co. v. Evatt, supra, at 668), taxability cannot depend upon whether the size of the pile of stored materials or its distance from the place of actual fabrication or consumption is a little more or a little less.\n\nIn the United States Plywood Corporation case, two types of imported materials are involved - unfinished \"green\" lumber received \"in bulk\" and veneers received in \"bundles\". The Assessor of the City of Algoma, believing that one-half of the lumber and veneers on hand on the taxing date was necessarily required to be kept on hand to meet the current operating needs of petitioner's manufacturing plant, assessed an ad valorem tax upon the value of that one-half of the lumber and veneers. In the ensuing litigation, the Wisconsin courts found that the imported materials had been imported by petitioner \"for use in manufacturing\" at its Algoma plant, had arrived at that place and that their importation journeys definitely had ended; that the lumber and veneers that were taxed (one-half of the amounts on hand on the taxing date) had been irrevocably committed to \"use in manufacturing\" at that plant, were \"necessarily required to be kept on hand to meet [its] current operational needs,\" and were actually being \"used\" to supply those \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 548]\n\u00a0\n needs. These findings are amply supported by the evidence and are not contested here. We think they clearly show that the lumber and veneers that were taxed were not only needed, imported, and irrevocably committed to supply, but were actually being used to supply, the day-to-day manufacturing requirements of the plant. They thus establish that petitioner had \"so acted upon the [imported materials]\" (Brown v. Maryland, supra, at 441) that were taxed by using them \"for the purpose for which they [were] imported,\" that - like the ores in the Youngstown case - they must be held \"to have then entered the manufacturing process\" (Hooven & Allison Co. v. Evatt, supra, at 665, 667) and to have lost their distinctive character as \"imports\" and all tax immunity as such.\n\nThe fact that the veneers were received in \"bundles\" which were not opened until the veneers were put into the daily manufacturing operations of the plant is not controlling under the facts and findings here. Whatever may be the significance of retaining in the \"original package\" goods that have been so imported for sale (Brown v. Maryland, supra; Waring v. The Mayor, 8 Wall. 110, 122-123; Low v. Austin, 13 Wall. 29, 32-33; Cook v. Pennsylvania, \n97 \nU.S. 566, 573\n; May v. New Orleans, \n178 \nU.S. 496, 501\n, 507-508), goods that have been so imported for use in manufacturing are not exempt from taxation, though not removed from the \"original package,\" if, as found here, they have been \"put to the use for which they [were] imported.\" Hooven & Allison Co. v. Evatt, supra, at 657. Breaking the original package is only one of the ways by which packaged goods that have been imported for use in manufacturing may lose their distinctive character as imports. Another way is by putting them \"to the use for which they [were] imported.\" Id. That the package has not been broken is, therefore, \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 549]\n\u00a0\n only one of the several factors to be considered in factually determining whether the goods are being \"used for the purpose for which they [were] imported.\" Hooven & Allison Co. v. Evatt, supra, at 665. Here the fact that the bundles are not opened until the veneers are put into the day-to-day manufacturing operations of the plant was fully considered by the Wisconsin courts before they made the finding that the veneers that were taxed were \"necessarily required to be kept on hand to meet [petitioner's] current operational needs,\" and were actually being \"used\" to supply those needs.\n\nBecause of the views expressed, it is unnecessary to reach or discuss the further finding and conclusion of the Wisconsin courts that when the \"green\" lumber was stacked by petitioner in the open in a particular way for the \"dominant purpose\" of air-drying it, the lumber \"entered the process of manufacture,\" and, for that reason also, lost its character as an import.\n\nThe materials here in question were imported to supply, and were essential to supply, the manufacturer's current operating needs. When, after all phases of their importation had ended, they were put to that use and indiscriminate portions of the whole were actually being used to supply daily operating needs, they stood in the same relation to the State as like piles of domestic materials at the same place that were kept for use and used in the same way. The one was then as fully subject to taxation as the other. In those circumstances, the tax was not on \"imports,\" nor was it a tax on the materials because they had been imported, but because at the time of the assessment they were being used, in every practical sense, for the purposes for which they had been imported. They were therefore subject to taxation just like domestic property that was kept at the same place in the same way \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 550]\n\u00a0\n for the same use. We cannot impute to the Framers of the Constitution a purpose to make such a discrimination in favor of materials imported from other countries as would result if we approved the views pressed upon us by the manufacturers. Compare May v. New Orleans, \n178 \nU.S., at 509\n.\n\nYoungstown also challenged a portion of the tax on the ground that its domestic ores stored on public docks on the shore of Lake Erie in Ohio were \"merchandise . . . held in a storage warehouse for storage only\" within the meaning of 5701.08 (A),\n9\n and that, because the section exempted nonresidents but taxed residents on stocks of merchandise so held, it denied to Youngstown, a resident of Ohio, the equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution. The Supreme Court of Ohio answered that contention by saying: \"For the reasons stated in Allied Stores of Ohio, Inc., v. Bowers, Tax Commr., ante [166 Ohio St.], 116, the taxpayer's contentions [in that respect] must be rejected . . . .\" Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Bowers, 166 Ohio St. 122, 124, 140 N. E. 2d 313, 316. We have today affirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court of Ohio in Allied Stores of Ohio, Inc., v. Bowers, Tax Comm'r, ante, p. 522, and for the reasons stated in our \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 551]\n\u00a0\n opinion in that case we hold that 5701.08 (A) and the questioned tax laid thereunder did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nIt follows that the judgment in each case must be\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE STEWART took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Article I, 10, cl. 2 of the United States Constitution, in pertinent part, provides: \"No State shall, without the Consent of the Congress, lay any Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing it's inspection Laws. . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Exhibits in the record, though not giving measurements, indicate that the nearest ore yard is located within two or three hundred feet, and the most distant one is located within two or three hundred yards, of the furnaces.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Title 57, Page's Ohio Rev.

Code Ann., 1953, 5711.03. But personal property held by a \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 538]\n\u00a0\n manufacturer for use in manufacturing is valued for tax purposes \"by taking the value of all [such] property . . . owned by such manufacturer on the last business day of each month [that] the manufacturer was engaged in business during the year, adding the monthly values together, and dividing the result by the number of months the manufacturer was engaged in such business during the year.\" Title 57, Page's Ohio Rev. Code Ann., 1953, 5711.16.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Chief Justice Taney, while still at the bar, had argued that case for the State of Maryland. After coming to this Court, he had occasion to say that the theory of that holding was that while the imported articles \"are in the hands of the importer for sale . . . they may be regarded as merely in transitu, and on their way to the distant cities, villages and country for which they are destined, and where they are expected to be used and consumed, and for the supply of which they were in truth imported.\" License Cases, 5 How. 504, 575.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The Court said that when the imported goods are sold \"the tax intercepts the import, as an import, in its way to become incorporated with the general mass of property, and denies it the privilege of becoming so incorporated until it shall have contributed to the revenue of the State.\" 12 Wheat., at 443. That imported goods lose their character as \"imports\" upon being sold is well-settled. License Cases, 5 How. 504, 575; Waring v. The Mayor, 8 Wall. 110; Low v. Austin, 13 Wall. 29; May v. New Orleans, \n178 \nU.S. 496\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Counsel for Maryland had argued that to permit state tax immunity in that case would result in granting immunity to \"an importer who may bring in goods, as plate, for his own use, and thus retain much valuable property exempt from taxation.\" In reply to that argument, Marshall rejected the assumption that the principles then announced would grant state tax exemptions to imports that were being used or held for use by the importer. In such a case, as in a case where the importer \"[breaks] up his packages, and [travels] with them as an itinerant pedlar,\" he said \"[T]he tax finds the article already incorporated with the mass of property by the act of the importer. He has used the privilege [i.e., of importation and sale] he had purchased, and has himself mixed them up with the common mass, and the law may treat them as it finds them. The same observations apply to plate, or other furniture used by the importer.\" 12 Wheat., at 443.

Code Ann., 1953, 5701.08 (A).\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER, whom MR. JUSTICE HARLAN joins, dissenting on the main issue.\n\nAs one follows the tortuous and anguished endeavors to establish a free trade area within Western Europe, unhampered by interior barriers, against the opposition of inert and narrow conceptions of self-interest by the component nations, admiration for the far-sighted statecraft of the Framers of the Constitution is intensified. Guided by the experience of the evils generated by the parochialism of the new States, the wise men at the Philadelphia Convention took measures to make of the expansive United States a free trade area and to withdraw from the States the selfish exercise of power over foreign trade, both import and export. They accomplished this by two provisions in the Constitution: the Commerce Clause and the Import-Export Clause.\n\nThe former reached its aim, as a matter of settled judicial construction, by placing the regulation of commerce among the States in the hands of Congress, except insofar as predominantly local interests give the States concurrent power until displaced by congressional legislation. This leeway to the States was established by the decision in Cooley v. Board of Wardens, 12 How. 299, foreshadowed by Marshall's decision in Willson v. Black Bird Creek Marsh Co., 2 Pet. 245. This permissive area for state action has given rise, as we know too well, to multitudinous litigation. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 552]\n\u00a0\n\n\nBut in dealing with foreign commerce the Constitution left no such leeway. It rigorously confined the States to what might be \"absolutely necessary,\" the only constitutional permission in terms so drastically limited, and beyond this permission of what is \"absolutely necessary\" state action was barred except by consent of Congress as expressive of the national interest. Thus, hardly any room was left by the Constitution for judicial construction of the command, \"No State shall, without the Consent of the Congress, lay any Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing its inspection Laws . . . .\" This strict limitation on the States was still further qualified by the requirement that the \"net Produce of all Duties and Imposts, laid by any State on Imports or Exports, shall be for the Use of the Treasury of the United States; and all such Laws shall be subject to the Revision and Controul of the Congress.\"\n\nFor one hundred and thirty-two years, in a course of decision following Chief Justice Marshall's seminal discussion in Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, this Court has held, without a single deviation, that a State may not tax imports from foreign countries while retained by the importer in their original \"package\"\n1\n or form prior to the use of the goods or their sale. Today the Court, I am \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 553]\n\u00a0\n bound most respectfully to say, disregards this historic course of constitutional adjudication by allowing the States of Wisconsin and Ohio, and, therefore, all the States, to tax foreign imports despite the prohibition of Art. I, 10, cl. 2, that \"No State shall, without the Consent of the Congress, lay any Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports, . . .\" as that clause has been authoritatively interpreted by this Court. And it does so, moreover, without overruling the decisions which the basis and logic of this new reading of the Constitution can no longer sustain. But they remain decisions of this Court. Thus, we are left with a confusing series of conflicting cases amidst which the States must blindly move in determining the extent of their constitutional power to tax. This confusion is substituted for a principle so plain of application that the controversies in this Court over the meaning of this far-reaching constitutional provision have numbered less than a dozen in our entire history. Of course, I do not believe that we should overrule this consistent course of decisions. But to do so would at least have the merit of explicit announcement of a new legal policy, with its concomitant repercussions on the conduct of our national economic life.\n\nSince the legal analysis of the challenged taxes must derive from due regard for the precise circumstances on which they are based, it becomes necessary to set forth the facts of the two cases now before us.\n\nIn No. 44, United States Plywood Corp. v. City of Algoma, petitioner, a New York corporation licensed to do business in Wisconsin, attacks the validity of a tax levied by the City of Algoma on its storage stock of imported lumber and veneers. The veneers are imported from Canada, France and the Belgian Congo. From Canada comes birch veneer, from France, French oak veneer, and from Africa, species of veneer known as korina and fuma. The veneers are shipped to petitioner \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 554]\n\u00a0\n in wooden crates or in bundles secured by metal straps. After arrival at petitioner's plant the veneers are stored in a warehouse in their original packages prior to their use in the manufacture of veneered products. When used the packages are broken and take their course through the factory. The lumber, birch and cedar, is imported from Ontario, Canada. When received it is piled in the yard preparatory to use in manufacture.\n\nThe City of Algoma assessed for taxation one-half of the total value of the imported lumber piled in the yard and the veneers stored in their original packages in the warehouse, on tax day - May 1, 1955. The city said that at least that amount of the imported materials was necessary to meet the \"current operational requirements\" of petitioner and thus was subject to state taxation.\n\nThe State Supreme Court upheld the tax on the basis of the finding below that the goods taxed were necessary for the \"current operational needs\" of the plant. The tax on the lumber was sustained on an alternative ground. Since the dominant purpose of piling the lumber in the storage yard was to prepare it for manufacture by air drying, the lumber had entered the process of manufacture and lost its immunity from state taxation. Most of the Canadian lumber was received green and, as a matter of good business practice, it is customary to air dry such lumber before running it through dry kilns to further remove moisture.\n\nIn No. 9, Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Bowers, appellant challenges the application of a personal property tax to its stocks of imported iron ore stored at its plant in Youngstown, Ohio. The facts were stipulated. Appellant purchases and imports five grades of iron ore: Brazilian ore, Cuban ore, Mexican ore, Liberian ore, and Seine River ore. These ores are loaded in bulk at foreign ports into chartered vessels, each of which carries but a single cargo of a single grade of ore. When \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 555]\n\u00a0\n the vessels reach the port of entry, the ore is discharged into railroad cars and transported in bulk to appellant's plant in Youngstown. Upon arrival the ore is unloaded into a storage yard adjacent to the manufacturing plant. A separate storage pile in a separate area of the storage yard is maintained for each grade of imported ore, and such ore is not commingled with any other property. A supply of ore necessary to meet estimated requirements for at least three months is maintained. Since the ore is located at some distance from stock bins and furnaces, when the need arises for a particular grade of ore it is taken from the grade stock pile and transported to stock bins or stock houses preparatory to use in the furnaces. When a shipment of bulk ore of a particular grade is received it is placed in the stock pile designated for that grade, i. e., all imports of Brazilian ore are placed in the Brazilian pile, etc. Hence a stock pile of a particular grade may be diminished by a particular day's need, and augmented the next by subsequently imported ore of the same grade.\n\nAppellant conceded that the imported ores had lost their immunity from taxation once they were removed from storage piles and placed in stock bins. The Supreme Court of Ohio decided that all the imported ore, including that remaining in the storage piles, could be taxed by the State, and upheld the challenged assessment. The Ohio court thought that the mere mingling of imported ore with other imported ore of the same grade, coupled with the fact that parts of each pile were taken for use in manufacturing, had terminated the constitutional immunity and subjected the entire stock of imported ore to state taxation.\n\nPrimary among the forces which led to the inclusion of Art. I, 10, cl. 2, the Import-Export Clause, in the Constitution, was the deeply felt necessity of vesting exclusive power over foreign economic relations and foreign \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 556]\n\u00a0\n commerce in the new National Government.\n2\n The importance of control over duties, imposts, and subsidies as an instrument of foreign trade and as a protection for the encouragement and growth of domestic manufactures was recognized as a matter of course by the Framers. For the effective exercise of this control it was necessary that the Government speak with one voice when regulating commercial intercourse with foreign nations. Orderly and effective policy would be impossible if thirteen States, each with their distinctive interests, and often conflicting, one with another, were allowed to exercise their own initiative in the regulation of foreign economic affairs. And so the States were prohibited from such regulation - they were forbidden, except by leave of Congress, to lay any duties on imports or on exports. Second only to this goal in importance, was the need to secure to the National Government an important source of revenue.\n3\n The Framers assumed that, for many years, duties on foreign imports would be the prime source of national funds; the revenue on whose constant flow the operations of government would depend. It therefore was essential to the fiscal well-being of the new country to ensure exclusive access to this revenue to the National Government. Subordinate to these goals in importance was the desire to prevent the seaboard States, possessed of important ports of entry, from levying taxes on goods flowing through their ports to inland States.\n4\n It was important not to allow these States to take advantage of their favorable geographical position in order to exact a price for the use of their ports from the consumers dwelling in \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 557]\n\u00a0\n less advantageously situated parts of the country. This fear of the use of geographical position to exact a form of tribute found an especially forceful expression in the absolute prohibition against duties on exports by either Nation or States.\n\nThe Import Clause was a result of the desire to safeguard these national goals and realize these necessities. Thus, the considerations governing its interpretation marked out for it a special path in the stream of constitutional adjudication - a course which diverged in many respects from the history of the Commerce Clause: that broad grant of power designed primarily to assure national control over commercial trade among the States. The often difficult, and continually delicate, considerations of the economic impact of a challenged tax, of the directness of its burden upon commerce, of its potential or actual discrimination against interstate trade, which have been of controlling importance to the proper evaluation of state taxes challenged under the Commerce Clause, are not the pertinent factors in assessing the constitutional validity of a tax charged with being in violation of the bar of Art. I, 10, cl. 2. In the taxation of imports, the grant of power to the National Government is exclusive; the prohibition of the States, absolute.\n5\n Thus the \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 558]\n\u00a0\n objects of relevant inquiry have been carefully circumscribed. Once it is clear, as a matter of economic fact, that a State has levied a tax upon foreign goods, this Court has always found it necessary to answer only one further question. The question was put by Chief Justice Marshall in 1827 in Brown v. Maryland: Have the goods retained their status as imports in the hands of the importer? If so, the tax is invalid. If not, if the goods have become part of the general property of the State, the tax is not barred by the Import Clause. The answer to this question involves essentially a determination of the physical status of the foreign goods. But, however variant the facts in different situations, the determinative principles have remained constant. And in the cases now before us, just as in every case this Court has decided under the Import Clause, the rules of decision must flow from the careful and authoritative exposition of Chief Justice Marshall in the governing case of Brown v. Maryland. The Chief Justice recognized that at some point in the importing process foreign goods lose their immunity and become subject to the taxing power of the State. Yet the goods must remain immune from state levies long enough to give the constitutional prohibition its intended effect. Every case decided under the Import Clause, from that day to this, has been concerned with applying to the particular facts before the Court the considerations and standards formulated in Brown v. Maryland for determining \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 559]\n\u00a0\n when the exclusive national power ends and state power begins.\n6\n In words grown familiar with judicial statement, yet deserving of repetition here, the great Chief Justice stated both the problem and the guide for decision. \"[T]here must be a point of time,\" Marshall postulated, \"when the prohibition ceases, and the power of the State to tax commences; . . . It is sufficient for the present to say, generally, that when the importer has so acted upon the thing imported, that it has become incorporated and mixed up with the mass of property in the country, it has, perhaps, lost its distinctive character as an import, and has become subject to the taxing power of the State; but while remaining the property of the importer, in his warehouse, in the original form or package in which it was imported, a tax upon it is too plainly a duty on imports to escape the prohibition in the constitution.\" 12 Wheat., at 441-442.\n\nSince, in Brown v. Maryland, the object of importation had been sale, reasoned the Chief Justice, certainly the importer was entitled to realize that aim without being subject to state taxation. Although more subtle, more befogging cases might be imagined, it was \"plain\" that, at least while in the hands of the importer in its original form or package, the foreign good remained an import and thus free from state levies.\n\nThe counsel for the State of Maryland in Brown v. Maryland was its Attorney General, Roger B. Taney. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 560]\n\u00a0\n Twenty years later, sitting as Chief Justice, Taney acknowledged that \"further and more mature reflection\" had made clear to him the wisdom of the principles laid down by his predecessor. \"Indeed,\" said Mr. Chief Justice Taney, \"goods imported, while they remain in the hands of the importer, in the form and shape in which they were brought into the country, can in no just sense be regarded as a part of that mass of property in the State usually taxed for the support of the State government.\"\n7\n\u00a0\n\nIt is needless to review the consistency with which this Court has repeated and applied the formulas of Marshall and Taney. A few of the more important examples will serve as concrete illustrations. In Low v. Austin, 13 Wall. 29, the Supreme Court of the State of California had sustained the application of a general ad valorem property tax to cases of imported French champagne which were being held in the warehouse of the importer, a commission merchant, for purposes of sale. The California court was unable to discern any \"reason why imported goods, exposed in the store of a merchant for sale, do not constitute a portion of the wealth of the state as much as do domestic goods similarly situated.\"\n8\n This Court rejected the reasoning of the state court as in conflict with the principles of Brown v. Maryland, and invalidated the application of the tax to the imported wine. \"[G]oods imported,\" said this Court, \"do not lose their character as imports, and become incorporated into the mass of property of the State, until they have passed from the control of the importer or been broken up by him from their original cases. Whilst retaining their character as imports, a tax upon them, in any shape, is within the constitutional prohibition.\"\n9\n Similarly, in Anglo-Chilean Corp. v. Alabama, \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 561]\n\u00a0\n \n288 \nU.S. 218\n, bags of Chilean nitrate stored in the importer's warehouse, awaiting sale, were held to be immune from assessment under the general franchise tax of the State of Alabama. The consistency with which these principles have been applied is demonstrated even more lucidly in those instances in which the Court has upheld a tax on goods held by the importer. In each such case the tax has been allowed only after an indubitable demonstration that the goods involved had been so altered from the physical form in which they had arrived upon importation that they had lost their character as foreign imports and had become, through the importer's action, a new ingredient of the general mass of property of the State.\n10\n\u00a0\n\nThe historic standards governing the application of the Import Clause received recent reaffirmation in Hooven & Allison Co. v. Evatt, \n324 \nU.S. 652\n. That case is of compelling significance here. For the situation there involved so precisely parallels the circumstances now before us as to control these cases, unless Hooven & Allison is to be overruled and the dissenting views expressed in that case adopted as the Court's views.\n\nThe Hooven & Allison Company imported bales of foreign hemp for use in the manufacture of cordage and similar products. The State of Ohio sought to tax this hemp while it was stored in the manufacturer's warehouse subsequent to importation, and prior to use. During hearings before the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals it was established that the company was accustomed to keep on hand merely a \"minimum working inventory\" of imported hemp, an amount sufficient to compensate for the three-to six-month delay involved in shipping the hemp from foreign countries. On appeal, the Ohio Supreme Court \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 562]\n\u00a0\n sustained the tax on the grounds that the hemp, having been stored for the purposes of manufacture, had lost its constitutional immunity. In support of its conclusion the Ohio court quoted the portion of the proceedings below in which the company had admitted the presence of only a \"minimum working inventory.\" This fact was urged before this Court in support of the State's request for affirmance.\n11\n\u00a0\n\nThis Court invalidated the tax and reversed the judgment of the Ohio Supreme Court. Mr. Chief Justice Stone thus spoke for the Court:\n\n \"Although one Justice dissented in Brown v. Maryland, supra, from that day to this, this Court has held, without a dissenting voice, that things imported are imports entitled to the immunity conferred by the Constitution; that that immunity survives their arrival in this country and continues until they are sold, removed from the original package, or put to the use for which they are imported.\" \n324 \nU.S., at 657\n.\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n\". . . no opinion of this Court has ever said or intimated that imports held by the importer in the original package and before they were subjected to the manufacture for which they were imported, are liable to state taxation. On the contrary, Chief Justice Taney, in affirming the doctrine of Brown v. Maryland, in which he appeared as counsel for the State, declared, as we now affirm: `Indeed, goods imported, while they remain in the hands of the importer, in the form and shape in which they were brought into the country, can in no just \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 563]\n\u00a0\n sense be regarded as a part of that mass of property in the state usually taxed for the support of state government.' . . .\n\n\n \". . . We do not perceive upon what grounds it can be thought that imports for manufacture lose their character as imports any sooner or more readily than imports for sale. The constitutional necessity that the immunity, if it is to be preserved at all, survive the landing of the merchandise in the United States and continue until a point is reached, capable of practical determination, when it can fairly be said that it has become a part of the mass of taxable property within a state, is the same in both cases.\" \n324 \nU.S., at 666\n-667.\n\n\n Indeed there is no process of logic, however dextrous, which would strike down a tax on imported goods being held prior to sale and allow a tax on goods stored prior to the processing which is preliminary to sale. In fact, the latter tax is less essential to state revenue since, in the case of goods held for manufacture, the State still retains the opportunity to impose a tax on the first sale. If the merchant who imported goods for the purpose of sale was entitled to realize that purpose before being subject to state taxes, certainly the manufacturer who had imported goods in order to process them was entitled to no lesser privilege. Goods lying in a manufacturer's warehouse in their original form or container are no more a part of the general mass of property of a State than are goods which are displayed by a commission merchant, in their original crates, for purposes of sale; nor is a tax on goods stored for manufacture any less of an \"interception\" of those goods while they are still imports than is a tax on goods immediately prior to their first sale. Clearly Hooven & Allison did not represent an extension of the principles of Brown v. Maryland but was an application of that decision \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 564]\n\u00a0\n in a context where to distinguish the principle would have been to reject it.\n12\n\u00a0\n\nThe lucid standards developed by this Court for the interpretation of the Import Clause give clear guidance \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 565]\n\u00a0\n for the disposition of the present cases. We accept the finding of the Wisconsin courts that the imported lumber was stored for the dominant purpose of air drying. Having entered the process of manufacture, the goods had become subject to the taxing power of the State. However, neither the imported ores in No. 9 nor the foreign veneers in No. 44 had been subject to manufacturing. On tax day they lay in the manufacturer's storage area, in their original \"form and shape,\" awaiting their initial processing. Thus the taxes sought to be levied on these materials are clearly barred by the historic series of adjudications of this Court, which have established that goods so situated, whether awaiting sale or manufacture, are constitutionally immune from state taxation under the proscription of Art. I, 10, cl. 2, of the Constitution.\n\nYet the Court does not choose to take this plainly marked path of constitutional decision. Rather it has \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 566]\n\u00a0\n effectively departed from established doctrine and upholds the challenged taxes. It does so on the basis of a theory which is as elusive to logic as it is opposed to authority - a theory which is not only unsupported by economic fact or reason and without basis in any of the invoked \"realities,\" but which turns Brown v. Maryland and its progeny into ad hoc results unrelated to their rationale, and disregards the harmonious reasoning on which these decisions were based and the process of one hundred and thirty-two years of constitutional adjudication.\n\nThe Court finds support for its decision in the language of Hooven & Allison. \"Unlike Hooven,\" we are told, \"these are not cases of the mere storage in a warehouse of imported materials intended for eventual use in manufacturing but not found to have been essential to current operational needs.\" On the assumption that the cases before us present a situation not governed by prior adjudication, it is maintained that, since the goods in question had been \"irrevocably committed . . . to `use in manufacturing' at the plant and point of final destination,\" and were being used to supply the daily manufacturing needs of the plant, petitioners must be deemed to have \"so acted upon the imported materials as to cause them to lose their distinctive character as `imports.'\" But is not this merely a way of giving an asserted conclusion of law the appearance of a fact? The vital question is how, if not when, do \"imported materials . . . lose their distinctive character as `imports.'\" After all, the vast bulk of imports are brought in for commercial purposes - to be exposed for sale in their original form or to be used as raw materials in manufacture. They are, that is, \"irrevocably committed\" to be sold or to be used in manufacturing. They are not, normally, brought in to be dumped into the sea, as was the tea at the Boston Tea Party. Of course the goods here had been imported and stored for \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 567]\n\u00a0\n a manufacturing purpose. The manufacturer did not import them to sit idly in his storage area.\n\nThe very ground now relied upon by the Court, in its affirmance of the challenged taxes, was rejected in Hooven & Allison, as the record in that case overwhelmingly demonstrates.\n13\n One is bound to say that the passage \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 568]\n\u00a0\n quoted by the Court from Mr. Chief Justice Stone's opinion in support of the statement that the cases before us are \"unlike Hooven & Allison,\" does not support that proposition.\n14\n\u00a0\n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 569]\n\u00a0\n\n\nPutting thus to one side the unwarranted reliance on language in Hooven & Allison, let us examine the basis on which the state taxes are upheld. Both the imported veneers in City of Algoma and the ore in Youngstown, the Court holds, must be said to have been \"put to the use for which they were imported,\" to have \"entered the manufacturing process\" and therefore to have lost their constitutional immunity, since they were \"not only needed, imported and irrevocably committed to supply, but were actually being used to supply, the daily requirements of the plant.\" Again one must ask whether these phrases mean any more than that the goods were being held by the manufacturer for the purpose for which he had imported them - use in manufacture. They had not been processed, changed from their original form or shape, acted upon, physically altered in the slightest, mingled with domestic goods, or \"used,\" in the sense that anything \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 570]\n\u00a0\n was done to them. They simply lay in storage areas awaiting use. To say that the goods \"were actually being used to supply, the daily requirements of the plant,\" simply affirms the obvious fact that the imports, unaffected in the form in which they were brought in from abroad and deposited, awaited their intended, but not begun, manufacturing process. In all prior considerations of the Import-Export Clause the immunity of imported goods has been terminated only by physical handling or alteration, not by reference to their assumed prospective role in the importer's use of them. The imported hemp in Hooven & Allison was similarly \"needed.\" It too was \"irrevocably committed to supply,\" and clearly it was \"actually being used to supply the daily requirements of the plant.\" To that end the hemp was imported. If the hemp was not to be so used it would not have been imported.\n\nFurthermore, if we simply substitute \"place of sale,\" for \"plant\" in the Court's reasoning - and we are not vouchsafed reasons either in abstract reasoning or in practical logic to disallow it - the identical enumeration of factors here thought sufficient to subject the imports to tax is found to be present in virtually every case in which this Court has invalidated a state tax on imports. The crates of champagne in Low v. Austin, and the bags of nitrate in Anglo-Chilean Corp. were also \"needed, imported and irrevocably committed to supply,\" and \"were actually being used to supply, the daily requirements\" of the place of sale. In effect, the result of today's decision means that if imported goods are needed, they are taxable. If useless, they retain their constitutional immunity.\n\nA close examination of the Youngstown case makes apparent this effective reversal of all previous judicial decision on the Import Clause, and justifies concern over today's holding. The stipulation of facts merely provides that the ore had been imported for purposes of manufacture \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 571]\n\u00a0\n and that \"at least\" three months' supply was generally kept on hand. (R. 35.) There were no stipulations, nor were there any findings, as to the rate of use of the ore, the immediacy of the need for it, or its relation to the requirements of the plant, which also used domestic ore in its manufacturing. We have simply the fact that an inventory of ore was kept for eventual use. The tax was sustained by the Ohio Supreme Court on the ground that the bulk ore had become mingled with the general property of the State because new ore had been added to the pile, and old ore removed.\n15\n The Ohio court did not discuss or rest on that fact that the goods were \"so essential to current manufacturing requirements that they must be said to have entered the process of manufacture.\" There is no possible way to make the Court's reasoning fit with the circumstances which underlie and define Brown v. Maryland or Hooven & Allison. Nothing has been done to the ore; it is in its original form and shape prior to use. Even as a matter of sound accounting, were that relevant, the goods could not be said to have entered the process of manufacture. We cannot assume or fictionalize facts. They must be found to exist. By assuming them, the Court strips them of relevance and impliedly rejects the unbroken meaning that the decisions have given the Import Clause.\n\nNor is the Court's conclusion strengthened by the suggestion that, since petitioner did not contest the taxability of that ore which had been removed to stock bins or houses, we must allow the rest of the ore to be taxed, as to distinguish between the two would be incongruous. \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 572]\n\u00a0\n The question of the taxability of the removed ore is not before us. That question was not involved in any previous proceeding in this case. We have not the basis for knowledge as to what, if any, processing the ore under-went when removed to the stock bins. There is certainly no basis for assigning a hypothetical constitutional position to the removed ore, and using such an argumentative figment as the means for upholding the tax on the ore about which we do have the precise facts and whose immunity is the question before us.\n\nIn United States Plywood v. City of Algoma, one-half of the value of the imported wood was assessed for taxation. That amount was found to be necessary in order to meet \"current operational needs,\" (R. 31) and was thus thought to be subject to state taxation. Formulas for the determination of current operational needs were discussed in detail by the Wisconsin courts, but the Court's opinion in Youngstown makes it unnecessary to examine those formulas here.\n16\n For the reasoning of Youngstown makes it clear that not merely half, but all of the imported veneers can be properly taxed by Wisconsin, since they were all \"not only needed, imported, and irrevocably committed to supply, but were actually \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 573]\n\u00a0\n being used to supply, the daily manufacturing requirements of the plant.\" I can only reiterate that the fact that goods were \"actually\" to be used for the purpose for which imported is not, and has never been thought to be, relevant in determining their taxability under the Import Clause. The abstract assignment of a status to goods which are to be used in manufacture is certainly not germane to an evaluation of that physical transformation of the goods which has hitherto been required before an import could become vulnerable to state taxes. To say that goods are necessary to meet requirements merely asserts a truism which is equally applicable in every case this Court has decided under the Import Clause.\n\nThe Court summarizes its conclusion by stating that the imported goods \"stood in the same relation to the State as like piles of domestic materials at the same place that were kept for use and used in the same way . . . .\"\n17\n The Court then continues:\n\n \"In those circumstances, the tax was not on `imports,' nor was it a tax on the materials because they had been imported, but because at the time of the assessment they were being used, in every practical sense, for the purposes for which they had been imported. They were therefore subject to taxation just like domestic property that was kept at the same place in the same way for the same use. We cannot impute to the Framers of the Constitution a purpose to make such a discrimination in favor of materials imported from other countries as would result if we approved the views pressed upon us by the manufacturers.\" \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 574]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n This is exactly the argument offered by the Supreme Court of California in support of the tax involved in Low v. Austin. That argument was then rejected unanimously by this Court and has never thereafter won acceptance. Whether the imposition of a tax resulted in \"a discrimination in favor of materials imported from other countries\" has never been thought relevant to the determination of its constitutional validity. The taxes which the Court struck down in Low v. Austin, in Anglo-Chilean Corp. and in Hooven & Allison were non-discriminatory taxes which fell equally on imported and domestic goods similarly situated. The Framers of the Constitution provided an absolute immunity for imports. The decisions of this Court have given to the brief phrases of Art. I, 10, cl. 2, the content of a command: \"a state shall not tax imports,\" not, \"a state shall not tax imports discriminatorily.\" It is one hundred and thirty-two years too late to refuse to attribute to the Framers the purpose of freeing imports from state taxation which this Court has consistently assumed.\n18\n\u00a0\n\nMoreover, it cannot properly be said that the application here of the settled principles of the Import Clause results in \"discrimination\" in favor of foreign goods. Whether foreign goods are receiving a tax advantage over similar domestic goods can only be determined by an evaluation of the full range of imposts and duties which the importer has been required to pay to the National Government. Only then can we know, as a matter of economic reality, whether, in fact, there is discrimination. And if we find discrimination, it is the result of the decision of the Congress and the President that the goods involved should, as a matter of national policy, receive \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 575]\n\u00a0\n preferential treatment. Certainly this Court should be reluctant to make inroads on a rule of law so well and lucidly settled that it may legitimately be regarded as an ingredient in the formulation which is made by the National Government when it determines, as a considered national policy, the extent to which import duties should be imposed.\n\nReluctant as one is to say so, it must be said that the Court proposes no reason for its decision which has not heretofore been rejected by this Court. Nor are we pointed to new compelling policies which must be invoked in order to upset a firmly established principle of our constitutional law; a principle which, perhaps more clearly than any other constitutional standard, has arrived at a lucid, coherent, and eminently workable distribution of power between the Nation and the States.\n\nIn the Youngstown case appellant also claims that the tax on a portion of its domestic ores was imposed in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. I concur in the Court's rejection of that claim.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Although the principles of Brown v. Maryland are often termed the \"original package doctrine,\" Marshall was concerned with a \"package\" only because the statute in that case taxed the selling of goods in their original packages. 12 Wheat., at 436 & 443. Marshall himself is careful to use the phrase, \"from or package,\" 12 Wheat., at 442, and Mr. Chief Justice Taney, in his reformulation of Brown v. Maryland, used the characterization \"from and shape.\" See p. 560, infra. \"It is a matter of hornbook knowledge that the original package statement of Justice Marshall was an illustration, rather than a formula, and that its application is evidentiary, and not substantive, . . . .\" City of Galveston v.

That accommodation has been made by upholding taxes designed to make interstate commerce bear a fair share of the cost of the local government from which it receives benefits . . . and by invalidating those which discriminate against interstate commerce, which impose a levy for the privilege of doing it, which place an undue burden on it. . . .\n\n\n\"It seems clear that we cannot write any such qualifications into \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 558]\n\u00a0\n the Import-Export Clause.

It would entail a substantial revision of the Import-Export Clause to substitute for the prohibition against `any' tax a prohibition against `any discriminatory' tax. . . . the two clauses, though complementary, serve different ends.

Maryland. We are told that Brown v. Maryland \"holds that goods brought into the country by an importer `for his own use' are not exempted from state taxation . . . and Hooven & Allison Co. v. Evatt, . . . holds that they are. . . .\" Surely this expresses a misapprehension of what Marshall said. Such a contention was made here, by the dissent in Hooven & Allison Co. v. Evatt, \n324 \nU.S. 652\n, at 686-688 (dissenting opinion), and silently rejected. For its refutation see Professor Thomas Reed Powell's State Taxation of Imports - When Does an Import Cease to be an Import, 58 Harv. L. Rev. 858, 859-864.\n\nThe statement of Marshall which is the basis of what is attributed to him was made by the Chief Justice in response to a contention by the State of Maryland that to grant immunity in this case would mean that an importer \"may bring in goods, as plate, for his own use, and thus retain much valuable property exempt from taxation.\" 12 Wheat., at 442-443. Marshall thus dealt with this and similar contentions:\n\n\"This indictment is against the importer, for selling a package of dry goods in the form in which it was imported, without a license. This state of things is changed if he sells them, or otherwise mixes them with the general property of the State, by breaking up his packages, and travelling with them as an itinerant pedlar. In the first case, the tax intercepts the import, as an import, in its way to become incorporated with the general mass of property, and denies it the privilege of becoming so incorporated until it shall have contributed to the revenue of the State. It denies to the importer the right of using the privilege which he has purchased from the United States, until he shall have also purchased it from the State. In the last cases, the tax finds the article already incorporated with the mass of property by the act of the importer. He has used the privilege he had purchased, and has himself mixed them up with the common mass, and the law may treat them as it finds them. The same observations apply to plate, or other furniture used by the importer.\" 12 Wheat., at 443.\n\n\n It is clear that Marshall is referring to personal household goods \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 565]\n\u00a0\n brought in by the importer and used by him. He is rejecting the idea that immunity can continue indefinitely after use if there has been no sale. He does not say, as the Court would have him say, that goods brought in by an importer \"for his own use,\" or goods \"held for use,\" are subject to state taxation. The phrase \"for his own use,\" which the Court places in quotation marks and attributes to Marshall, was the Chief Justice's statement of counsel's contention and is not to be found in his own conclusion. The phrase \"held for use,\" which the Court also attributes to Marshall in its paraphrase of his views, is an interpolation nowhere to be found in the Chief Justice's discussion. Goods which are imported for purposes of sale are brought in for \"use\" as much as are goods which have been brought in for manufacture. A tax imposed prior to processing \"intercepts\" goods on their way to incorporation in the general mass of property as effectively as does a tax prior to sale. Marshall was not distinguishing between goods brought in for manufacture and those brought in for sale. There is no rational distinction. He was merely denying immunity to goods which had been brought in and thereafter actively used by the importer. There is nothing in Brown v. Maryland that is not in complete accord with what was decided in Hooven & Allison.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] At the hearing before the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, the general manager of the Hooven & Allison Company was asked if the imported hemp was kept in the warehouse for any definite length of time. He answered:\n\n\"No; it might be we would need the stuff as soon as it got there and again we might not; it comes from long distances and we do not carry any more inventory than we need to; it takes three to six months for it to get to us; we attempt to keep a backlog for that; we attempt to run our business with a minimum working inventory, of course.\" Transcript of Record, p. 42, Hooven & Allison Co. v. Evatt, \n324 \nU.S. 652\n.\n\n\n Relying in large part on this testimony the Supreme Court of Ohio concluded that the goods \"had so come to rest as to be mingled with the mass of property in this country . . . .\" Hooven & Allison Co. v. Evatt, 142 Ohio St. 235, 242, 51 N. E. 2d 723, 726. In its brief before this Court, Ohio supported the validity of the tax on the basis of the above industrial circumstances:\n\n\"The evidence in the instant case shows that the petitioner purchased fibers solely for its own use, never for sale. It was impracticable to buy fibers a bale at a time to meet the immediate needs of its mill. It took from three to six months to get delivery after an order was placed. The undisputed testimony shows that the petitioner did not carry any more inventory than was actually needed, but due to the uncertainty of deliveries, it attempted `to keep a backlog for that.' It attempted to operate `with a minimum working inventory' (R. 16). In other words, when the imported goods reached the plant they were immediately used, in that they were essential to the continuous daily operation of petitioner's plant.\" Brief for Respondent, p. 20, Hooven & Allison Co. v. Evatt, \n324 \nU.S. 652\n.\n\n\n This Court's decision did not accept the arguments made by the State throughout the course of litigation. The theory thus rejected now serves as the basis for this decision.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] In support of its argument that the cases before us are \"unlike\" Hooven & Allison, the Court quotes from the following passage from that case:\n\n\"It cannot be said that the fibers were subjected to manufacture when they were placed in petitioner's warehouse in their original packages. And it is unnecessary to decide whether, for purposes of the constitutional immunity, the presence of some fibers in the factory was so essential to current manufacturing requirements that they could be said to have entered the process of manufacture, and hence were already put to the use for which they were imported, before they were removed from the original packages. Even though the inventory of raw material required to be kept on hand to meet the current operational needs of a manufacturing business could be thought to have then entered the manufacturing process, the decision of the Ohio Supreme Court did not rest on that ground, and the record affords no basis for saying that any part of petitioner's fibers, stored in its warehouse, were required to meet such immediate current needs. Hence we have no occasion to consider that question.\" (Italics added.) \n324 \nU.S., at 667\n.\n\n\n The record in the case, the opinions below, and the briefs in this Court, leave no doubt that this passage does not refer to the bulk of the imported hemp stored in the warehouse of the Hooven & Allison Company as a \"minimum working inventory.\" Indeed, such reference would be wholly inconsistent with the principles on which the opinion rests. Due regard for the record and for the opinions clarifies the Chief Justice's meaning. When the imported hemp was ready for use it was moved from the warehouse to the factory. At the hearing, the general manager testified as to this hemp:\n\n\". . . it is removed from the raw material account and charged into processing in the mill; each bale of fiber as it is removed from the raw material warehouse becomes, according to our records, in process. Of course we have to batch and treat this stuff; it may not be used for a couple of days; but as soon as it leaves the warehouse it is charged in process; . . . .\" Transcript of Record, p. 43, Hooven & Allison Co. v. Evatt, \n324 \nU.S. 652\n.\n\n\n The Ohio Supreme Court took special note of this hemp which was \n\n[358 \nU.S. 534, 569]\n\u00a0\n in transit from the warehouse to the processing line. It remarked that:\n\n\"While the bales remain in the raw-material warehouse, they are carried in a raw-material account on appellant's books; but upon their removal from such warehouse the bales are immediately charged to goods-in-process account whether the bales have been broken or not.\" Hooven & Allison Co. v. Evatt, 142 Ohio St. 235, 237, 51 N. E. 2d 723, 724.\n\n\n As far as appears, these bales of hemp which had been removed to the factory as immediately necessary for current needs, but which remained in their original packages, were not separately assessed for taxation, nor were they, at any stage of the proceedings, treated as a separate item. It is obvious, though his language is somewhat cloudy, that what Chief Justice Stone meant was that he was not considering whether the removed hemp had a special status. Therefore, although it could not \"be said that the fibers were subjected to manufacture when they were placed in petitioner's warehouse . . .\" it was \"unnecessary to decide whether, for purposes of the constitutional immunity, the presence of some fibers in the factory was so essential to current manufacturing requirements that they could be said to have entered the process of manufacture.\" (Italics added.)\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] Since the Court does not rely on the reasoning of the Ohio court, I will not stop to examine closely its ground of decision. It is sufficient to note that it is difficult to understand by what mutation an import loses its status as an import merely by mingling it with identical imported goods which are similarly being stored prior to use.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] The Wisconsin court found that one-half of the imported goods was necessary to meet \"current operational needs.\" On the basis of this finding of \"fact,\" this Court finds its new interpretation of the Import Clause satisfied. Since that interpretation is far broader than the narrow concept of \"current operational need,\" as applied by the Wisconsin court, it is unnecessary to discuss the constitutional validity of a rule based on \"current operational need.\" It is sufficient to note here that such a formula possesses no basis in economics; it is merely an arbitrary figure assigned to a portion of inventory. An appropriate analysis of the formulas tentatively offered by the Wisconsin Circuit Court to support its finding would reveal the unreal and arbitrary nature of the finding. However such discussion would be superfluous here.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] This merely states a legal conclusion.
