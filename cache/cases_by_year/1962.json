States Supreme Court\nA. & G. STEVEDORES v. ELLERMAN LINES(1962)\nNo. 282\nArgued: February 20, 1962Decided: April 2, 1962\n\n\n\n\n A longshoreman employed by petitioner, a stevedoring contractor, was injured while helping to unload a vessel, and he sued respondents, the shipowners, in a Federal District Court on the basis of diversity of citizenship, alleging that the vessel was unseaworthy and that they were negligent. Respondents impleaded petitioner and asked indemnity, alleging that it was negligent in the manner of unloading. The jury found that the injury resulted from unseaworthiness of the vessel and negligence of respondents and not from any failure of petitioner to do its work in accordance with its contract. The District Court entered judgment in favor of the longshoreman against respondents and in favor of petitioner on respondents' claim for indemnity. The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment in favor of the longshoreman but reversed the judgment in favor of petitioner on the ground that it also was negligent. Held: Redetermination by the Court of Appeals of the facts found by the jury was contrary to the provision of the Seventh Amendment that \"no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise reexamined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.\" Pp. 356-364.\n\n (a) Even though a stevedoring contract is a maritime contract, the Seventh Amendment was applicable in this case, because the suit, being in a Federal Court by reason of diversity of citizenship, carried with it the right to trial by jury. Pp. 359-360.\n\n\n (b) On the record in this case, it cannot be said that petitioner was liable as a matter of law, that the trial judge in the charge to the jury omitted any ingredient from petitioner's contractual liability, or that the jury's verdict was inconsistent. Pp. 360-364.\n\n\n (c) Where an appellate court is asked to review the jury's answers to special interrogatories, the Seventh Amendment prohibits a reversal on the ground that the jury's answers are inconsistent, if under any view of the case they are, or can be made, consistent. P. 364.\n\n\n 289 F.2d 201, reversed. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 355, 356]\n\u00a0\n\n\nFrancis E. Marshall argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs was James J. Davis, Jr.\n\nThomas E. Byrne, Jr. argued the cause and filed briefs for respondents.\n\nMartin J. McHugh argued the cause for the National Association of Stevedores, as amicus curiae, urging reversal. With him on the brief was James M. Leonard.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nLeighton Beard was a longshoreman employed by Atlantic and Gulf Stevedores, Inc. Atlantic, the petitioner, performed stevedoring services for respondents. Beard received injuries while helping to discharge bales of burlap from a vessel owned by respondents. These bales, loaded in India, were bound by four parallel one-inch steel bands that petitioner had not placed around the bales but were part of the cargo; and each bale, containing 30 to 40 bolts of burlap, was stowed in tiers. The discharging operation consisted of pulling the bales from their stowed positions to the hatch and then raising them vertically through the hatch and lowering them onto the pier. This was accomplished by using a ring to which six equal-length ropes were attached. A hook was on the end of each rope; and two hooks were used on each bale, three bales being raised in one operation. Beard and his co-workers would signal the winch operator to pull the bales from their stow to a position under the hatch. When the sideways movement had ended, the bales would be raised vertically. After several hours of one unloading operation, two bands of one bale broke. The bale fell, injuring Beard.\n\nThe evidence showed that Atlantic played no part in the loading or stowage of this cargo of burlap. There were sixty-three tons of bales in the forward end of the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 355, 357]\n\u00a0\n hold destined for New York; and they extended halfway into the space under the hatch. The bales being unloaded were in the after end of the hold. The bale that fell struck the New York cargo and bounded toward Beard, pinning him against the after bulkhead and causing injuries resulting in the amputation of his right leg.\n\nBeard sued respondents in the District Court on the basis of diversity of citizenship, alleging that their vessel was unseaworthy and that they were negligent. Respondents impleaded petitioner, alleging that it was negligent in its manner and method of unloading and asking indemnity from it in case respondents were held liable to Beard. Counsel near the end of the trial agreed upon five special interrogatories, to which the jury responded as follows:\n\n  1. Was unseaworthiness a substantial factor in  causing the injuries to the plaintiff?\n\n\n  Yes.\n\n\n  2. Was there negligence on the part of Ellerman  Lines, Ltd., which was a substantial factor in causing  injuries to the plaintiff?\n\n\n  Yes.\n\n\n  3. In what amount, if any, did you assess the  damages to be awarded the plaintiff?\n\n\n  $100,000.\n\n\n  4. If you have answered yes to Interrogatories  1 or 2, did the fault of Ellerman Lines, Ltd., and the  City Line, Ltd., arise out of any failure on the part of  Atlantic and Gulf Stevedores, Inc., to do its work  in accordance with the contractual obligation?\n\n\n  No.\n\n\n  5. If you have answered yes to Interrogatory  No. 4 was Atlantic and Gulf Stevedores, Inc.'s breach  of this contract a substantial factor in bringing about  the injuries to the plaintiff?\n\n\n  No. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 355, 358]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The District Court thereupon entered judgment in favor of Beard against respondents and in favor of petitioner on respondents' claim for indemnity.\n\nOn appeal it was argued, inter alia, that a finding of negligence on the part of respondents was warranted because they failed to provide a safe place to work in view of the manner in which the New York cargo was stowed. With this the Court of Appeals agreed. Negligence on the part of respondents, it said, was also established by the knowledge of their chief mate that the use of bale hooks was a dangerous way to discharge burlap bales, and from evidence that bands on the bales broke in \"roughly between 3 and 5 percent of the bales\" during discharging operations. The court said that though the use of bale hooks may have been customary in Philadelphia, such use was not sufficient to relieve respondents of negligence.\n\nIt went on to say that there was evidence to show that respondents, by virtue of the manner of loading, were negligent in not affording Beard a safe place to work. It held, however, that since the \"warranty of workmanlike service extends to the handling of cargo . . . as well as to the use of equipment incidental to cargo handling\" (Waterman Co. v. Dugan & McNamara, \n364 \nU.S. 421, 423\n), petitioner was liable, as a matter of law, to respondents. For if it was negligent for respondents to permit Beard to work in an unsafe place, it was \"equally negligent\" for petitioner to handle the cargo in the manner it did, in light of the unsafe place where Beard worked. 289 F.2d 201, 207.\n\nThe Court of Appeals therefore affirmed the judgment in favor of Beard and against respondents on the issue of negligence (without reaching the question of unseaworthiness), but reversed the judgment in favor of Atlantic. The case is here on a petition for certiorari. \n368 \nU.S. 874\n.\n\nWe might agree with the Court of Appeals had the questions of fact been left to us. But neither we nor the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 355, 359]\n\u00a0\n Court of Appeals can redetermine facts found by the jury any more than the District Court can predetermine them. For the Seventh Amendment says that \"no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise reexamined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.\"\n\nThe requirements of the Seventh Amendment were brought into play in this case, even though a stevedoring contract is a maritime contract.\n1\n Since \"loading and stowing a ship's cargo\" is part of the \"maritime service,\" a stevedore can recover against his employer in admiralty for the latter's negligence (Atlantic Transport Co. v. Imbrovek, \n234 \nU.S. 52, 61\n), on the conditions provided in the Longshoremen's Act, 33 U.S.C. 905, 44 Stat. 1426. And when the shipowner is held liable, it may in the same suit recover over against the stevedoring company on the stevedore contract in order to prevent needless multiplicity of litigation. American Stevedores v. Porello, \n330 \nU.S. 446, 456\n.\n\nCongress since 1789, in giving Federal District Courts original jurisdiction of civil cases in admiralty, has saved \"to suitors in all cases all other remedies to which they are otherwise entitled.\" 28 U.S.C. 1333 (1). Therefore, a suit for breach of a maritime contract, while it may be brought in admiralty, may also be pursued in an ordinary civil action,\n2\n since, unlike the proceeding in The Moses \n\n[369 \nU.S. 355, 360]\n\u00a0\n Taylor, 4 Wall. 411, it is a suit in personam. \"Where the suit is in personam, it may be brought either in admiralty or, under the saving clause, in an appropriate non-maritime court, by ordinary civil action.\" Gilmore and Black, The Law of Admiralty (1957), p. 36. And such suits on the law side are not restricted to enforcement of commonlaw rights but extend as well to maritime torts. Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, \n328 \nU.S. 85, 88\n-89.\n\nThis suit being in the federal courts by reason of diversity of citizenship carried with it, of course, the right to trial by jury. As in cases under the Jones Act (Schulz v. Pennsylvania R. Co., \n350 \nU.S. 523\n; Senko v. LaCrosse Dredging Corp., \n352 \nU.S. 370\n) and under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (Tennant v. Peoria & P. U. R. Co., \n321 \nU.S. 29\n; Ellis v. Union Pacific R. Co., \n329 \nU.S. 649, 653\n; Dice v. Akron, C. & Y. R. Co., \n342 \nU.S. 359\n; Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., \n352 \nU.S. 500\n), trial by jury is part of the remedy. Thus the provisions of the Seventh Amendment, noted above, are brought into play. Schulz v. Pennsylvania R. Co., supra, at 524. As we recently stated in another diversity case, it is the Seventh Amendment that fashions \"the federal policy favoring jury decisions of disputed fact questions.\" Byrd v. Blue Ridge Cooperative, \n356 \nU.S. 525, 538\n, 539. And see Herron v. Southern Pac. Co., \n283 \nU.S. 91, 94\n-95.\n\nIn answer to interrogatories Nos. 4 and 5 the jury found that petitioner had not failed to perform its contractual obligation to respondents. The contract provided that petitioner should do the work \"with every care and due dispatch to the satisfaction\" of the owners. In its charge to the jury the District Court said that the owner had a duty to provide longshoremen a safe place to work; and it left to the jury whether respondents had warning that the method of unloading was unsafe and whether the manner of loading the cargo by respondents made this an unsafe place for Beard to work. It left to \n\n[369 \nU.S. 355, 361]\n\u00a0\n the jury respondents' contention that, if anyone was negligent in leaving the New York cargo in the place where it was and in not shifting it, it was petitioner's negligence, not theirs. It also charged the jury on petitioner's liability, should Beard be found to have established his case. It referred the jury to the contract saying petitioner was obliged \"to unload and discharge this cargo of burlap with the utmost care.\"\n\nThe Court of Appeals held that the jury had been charged too restrictively, that their attention had been called only to the manner of using the hook. The trial judge did indeed charge:\n\n \"You must answer the question, was that a reasonable and safe method of operation for the discharge of that cargo? Taking into consideration that it had been done over a period of years, that it was a usual and accepted method in various places, you will have to examine into the nature of the application of the hook to the bale, and you will take into consideration the testimony of both experts, and both counsel argued to you in their interpretation of the testimony the results that they feel favor their side.\"\n\n\n But it went further and charged that if petitioner was responsible for the breaking of the bands, petitioner would be liable:\n\n\". . . if you . . . find that that negligent conduct was such that it broke the band, rather than any unseaworthiness of the band,\n3\n then you must find for the defendant shipping companies; but you have to make that finding in the light of all the circumstances, whether or not there was sufficient evidence \n\n[369 \nU.S. 355, 362]\n\u00a0\n that persuades you that that conduct of the longshoremen was responsible for the breaking of the band - not any unseaworthiness in the band itself.\"\n\n\n It also charged that if the verdict was for Beard, the jury should determine whether petitioner created the condition that made respondents liable. It charged:\n\n  \"There again you have to run the whole gamut of  facts in the case. You will have to decide whether  or not there was an unreasonable discharge of this  cargo, an unsafe method used in the discharge of this  cargo, in the placing of the hook. Did they breach  that contract to do it in a workmanlike manner with  the utmost care? The steamship company says,  `Yes, they did. They breached that contract. They  did not do it in a workmanlike manner. All the evidence  here points to the fact that they did not do  it with the utmost care, and therefore they caused  the condition which created the liability which is  ours, which the plaintiff has secured against us as  defendants.'\"\n\n\n The trial judge further charged:\n\n  \". . . Whether or not there was a breach of that contract, what you look to decide is whether or not there was reasonably safe discharge of that cargo by the Atlantic & Gulf Stevedores. If it was not, if it was not done in a reasonably safe manner, then Atlantic & Gulf Stevedores would breach their warranty under the contract. If there was sub-standard performance on which it was foreseeable by them that some injury might happen or eventuate, then Atlantic & Gulf Stevedores would be responsible to the plaintiff shipping company.\"\n\n\n More specifically the trial judge charged:\n\n\". . . you will have to determine whether there was negligence in the leaving of that New York part of \n\n[369 \nU.S. 355, 363]\n\u00a0\n that cargo in the place where it was, and whether it was an interference, as the plaintiff claims, with his condition of safety.\n\n\n \"On the other hand, the defendant says, `This was not our job; the shifting should have been done by the stevedores. We, the shipping company, were not negligent in failing to get it out of the way.'\n\n\n \"The plaintiff asserts here and asks you to believe and to weigh in the balance toward meeting the burden which he has to establish by the fair preponderance of the evidence that this officer was there but did not stop the operation. The defendant says, `If you find, no matter what the officer says, that this was being unloaded in a reasonably safe manner then we were not liable; it may well be that the Atlantic & Gulf stevedores are liable, but we were not liable.'\"\n\n\n We disagree with the Court of Appeals that the trial judge limited the issue of petitioner's liability to \"the use of the bale hook method in discharging the cargo.\" 289 F.2d, at p. 208. When the District Court charged that in determining petitioner's contractual obligation the jury should decide \"whether or not there was a reasonably safe discharge\" of the cargo, it included the totality of the circumstances.\n\nThe question of the manner in which the New York cargo had been stored was prominent in the case; and the trial judge left it to the jury on the question of respondents' negligence. On the issue of petitioner's liability his charge was no more precise than has been indicated. Yet respondents did not ask for more on this phase of the controversy. In their requested charge they were no more specific, except they maintained,\n4\n as did the Court \n\n[369 \nU.S. 355, 364]\n\u00a0\n of Appeals, that under these circumstances the stevedore is liable under its contract as a matter of law.\n\nWe cannot say that petitioner was liable as a matter of law nor that the trial judge in the charge to the jury omitted any ingredient from petitioner's contractual liability. Moreover, we cannot say that the jury's verdict was inconsistent. The Court of Appeals said that the case of the respondents' negligence was established because\n\n \". . . the record affords ample basis for a jury fact-finding  that (1) use of the bale hook method in the  discharge of the burlap bales constituted negligence,  and (2) that the injured longshoreman was not  afforded a safe place to work.\" 289 F.2d, p. 207.\n\n\n So far as we know the jury may have found respondents liable not on either of those two grounds but solely on a third, namely, because of defective bands - a matter which was covered by the charge to the jury on the issue of unseaworthiness, and properly so. Weyerhaeuser S. S. Co. v. Nacirema Co., \n355 \nU.S. 563, 567\n. If that was the jury's view of the facts, then petitioner plainly would not be liable under its warranty. Where there is a view of the case that makes the jury's answers to special interrogatories consistent, they must be resolved that way. For a search for one possible view of the case which will make the jury's finding inconsistent results in a collision with the Seventh Amendment. Arnold v. Panhandle & S. F. R. Co., \n353 \nU.S. 360\n. Cf. Dick v. New York Life Ins. Co., \n359 \nU.S. 437, 446\n.\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE HARLAN concurs in the result.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] A stevedore's contract with a shipowner is \"comparable to a manufacturer's warranty of the soundness of its manufactured product. The shipowner's action is not changed from one for a breach of contract to one for a tort simply because recovery may turn upon the standard of the performance\" of the stevedoring service. Ryan Co. v. Pan-Atlantic Corp., \n350 \nU.S. 124, 133\n-134.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Suits on maritime contracts may be brought in the federal courts under the head of diversity jurisdiction. Pope & Talbot, Inc., v. Hawn, \n346 \nU.S. 406\n; Wilburn Boat Co. v. Fireman's Ins. Co., \n348 \nU.S. 310\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The trial judge also charged that \"if you find that the bands of the bale were defective, were inadequate, or insufficient . . . then you might find the defendants liable under the doctrine of unseaworthiness.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] One of respondents' requested charges was:\n\n\"If, on the other hand, you find in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant, and the basis of your finding is that the method of \n\n[369 \nU.S. 355, 364]\n\u00a0\n discharging was not reasonably safe and proper under the circumstances existing at the time of the accident, then I charge you that under these circumstances you must further find a verdict in favor of the defendant and against Atlantic & Gulf Stevedores, Inc.\" \n\n[369 \nU.S. 355, 365]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE STEWART, whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER joins, dissenting.\n\nIn my view the Court of Appeals correctly ruled that the respondents were entitled to indemnity from the petitioner under principles first set forth by this Court in Ryan Co. v. Pan-Atlantic Corp., \n350 \nU.S. 124\n, and followed in Weyerhaeuser S. S. Co. v. Nacirema Co., \n355 \nU.S. 563\n, Crumady v. The J. H. Fisser, \n358 \nU.S. 423\n, and Waterman Co. v. Dugan & McNamara, \n364 \nU.S. 421\n.\n\nBeard's action was based upon both negligence and unseaworthiness. The respondents were alleged to have been negligent (1) in permitting the use of the bale hook method of discharging the bales, particularly in view of the chief officer's statement that he thought the method dangerous, and (2) in improperly stowing the New York cargo and thereby failing to use ordinary care to provide Beard with a safe place to work.\n*\n The Court of Appeals properly determined that there was sufficient evidence on either ground to support the jury's general finding of negligence, a determination which I do not understand to be contested here. But a finding of negligence on either ground would necessarily carry with it the conclusion that the petitioner had breached its contractual obligation to the respondents.\n\nAs we said only last Term in Waterman Co. v. Dugan & McNamara, supra, at 423, the stevedore's \"warranty of workmanlike service extends to the handling of cargo . . . as well as to the use of equipment incidental to cargo handling . . . .\" If the respondents were negligent in permitting the petitioner's use of a dangerous method of unloading cargo, the petitioner surely breached its \"warranty \n\n[369 \nU.S. 355, 366]\n\u00a0\n of workmanlike service\" by using such a method in the first instance. Similarly, if the location of the so-called New York bales in the hold made the hold an unsafe place to work, the petitioner necessarily breached its warranty to the respondents by unloading the cargo before first moving those bales. The petitioner is in the business of handling cargo, and any danger created by the New York bales was at least as apparent to the petitioner as to the respondents. Under its warranty the petitioner had a duty to see that the danger was removed before proceeding to unload the Philadelphia cargo.\n\nIt is questionable whether the right to a jury trial under the Seventh Amendment is involved in this case, since the respondents' rights against the petitioner depend upon a maritime contract, not upon the common law. American Stevedores, Inc., v. Porello, \n330 \nU.S. 446, 456\n. We need not pursue that inquiry, however, because in any event nothing in the Seventh Amendment removes the duty of a trial judge to give proper instructions to a jury, or the duty of a reviewing court to correct a trial judge's errors. Fed. Rules Civ. Proc., 50. Here, each possible ground of the respondents' negligence vis-a-vis the original plaintiff involved a breach of the petitioner's warranty as a matter of law. The Court of Appeals correctly held that the trial judge was in error in not so instructing the jury.\n\nI would affirm.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] The opinion of the Court suggests that there was a third possible ground for the jury's finding of negligence, namely, failure to inspect the bands on the bale which fell. No such issue was ever submitted to the jury. The only issues submitted to the jury with respect to the bands related to the plaintiff's unseaworthiness claim. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 355, 367]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","1":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAHOYIAN v.

W. 2d 708) against the claim that the laws violated the First Amendment, applicable to the States by reason of the Fourteenth Amendment. The case differs from Braunfeld v. Brown, \n366 \nU.S. 599\n, and Gallagher v. Crown Kosher Market, \n366 \nU.S. 617\n, in that those who actually observe the Sabbath on a day of the week other than Sunday are exempt from the penal provisions.\n2\n But as I indicated in my dissent in McGowan v. Maryland, \n366 \nU.S. 420, 561\n, the unconstitutionality of Sunday laws strikes much deeper. By what authority can government compel one person not to work on Sunday because the majority of the populace deems Sunday to be a holy day? Moslems may someday control a state legislature. Could they make criminal the opening of a shop on Friday? Would not we Christians fervently believe, if that came to pass, that government had no authority to make us bow to the scruples of the Moslem majority?\n\nI said in my dissent in the McGowan case:\n\n\". . . it is a strange Bill of Rights that makes it possible for the dominant religious group to bring the minority to heel because the minority, in the doing of acts which intrinsically are wholesome and not antisocial, does not defer to the majority's religious beliefs. Some have religious scruples against eating pork. Those scruples, no matter how bizarre \n\n[371 \nU.S. 218, 220]\n\u00a0\n they might seem to some, are within the ambit of the First Amendment. . . . Is it possible that a majority of a state legislature having those religious scruples could make it criminal for the nonbeliever to sell pork? Some have religious scruples against slaughtering cattle. Could a state legislature, dominated by that group, make it criminal to run an abattoir? . . . A legislature of Christians can no more make minorities conform to their weekly regime than a legislature of Moslems, or a legislature of Hindus. The religious regime of every group must be respected - unless it crosses the line of criminal conduct.

That is my reading of the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause.\" \n366 \nU.S., at 575\n.\n\n\n The religious nature of this state regulation is emphasized by the fact that it exempts \"members of a religious society\" who actually observe the Sabbath on a day other than Sunday.

This necessarily means, first, that the dogma, creed, scruples, or practices of no religious group or sect are to be preferred over those of any others; second, that no one shall be interfered with by government for practicing the religion of his choice; third, that the State may not require anyone to practice a religion or even any \n\n[371 \nU.S. 218, 221]\n\u00a0\n religion; and fourth, that the State cannot compel one so to conduct himself as not to offend the religious scruples of another.

SINCLAIR REFINING CO.(1962)\nNo. 430\nArgued: April 18, 1962Decided: June 18, 1962\n\n\n\n\n1. \nUnder 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, an employer sued an international union and its local union in a Federal District Court for damages for a strike or work stoppage caused by them in violation of a collective bargaining agreement. The agreement provided for grievance procedures culminating, if requested by the union, in compulsory, final and binding arbitration of employee grievances regarding wages, hours and working conditions, and the union promised not to strike over such matters. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on various grounds and to stay the action, for the reasons that (1) all of the issues in the suit were referable to arbitration under the contract, and (2) important issues in the suit were also involved in certain grievances filed by employees and said to be in arbitration under the contract. Held: This count of the complaint should not be dismissed or stayed. Pp. 241-245.\n\n (a) This count of the complaint properly states a cause of action under 301 and is to be governed by federal law. P. 241.\n\n\n (b) The contract here involved is not susceptible to a construction binding the employer to arbitrate its claim for damages against the union for breach of the undertaking not to strike. Pp. 241-243.\n\n\n (c) It does not appear from the record that the arbitrator's award on pending employee grievances would determine any significant issue in the damage suit. Pp. 243-245.\n\n\n2. \nBasing jurisdiction on diversity of citizenship, the employer, in another count of the same complaint, also sought damages for the same strike or work stoppage from 24 individual employees, each of whom was alleged to have been an agent of the union and to have been acting in a representative capacity when he allegedly fomented or assisted and participated in the strike or work stoppage in violation of the collective bargaining contract. Held: Under 301, this count of the complaint was governed by federal, not state, law and it was properly dismissed for failure to state a claim for which relief could be granted, since it actually was based \n\n[370 \nU.S. 238, 239]\n\u00a0\n on the union's breach of its contract, and a union's officers or members cannot be held personally liable for the union's actions. Pp. 245-249.\n\n 290 F.2d 312, affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n\nGilbert A. Cornfield argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the briefs were Gilbert Feldman and William E. Rentfro.\n\nGeorge B. Christensen argued the cause for respondent. With him on the briefs were Fred H. Daugherty and Richard W. Austin.\n\nJ. Albert Woll, Theodore J. St. Antoine and Thomas E. Harris filed a brief for the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, as amicus curiae, urging reversal.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe respondent company employs at its refinery in East Chicago, Indiana, approximately 1,700 men, for whom the petitioning international union and its local are bargaining agents, and 24 of whom are also petitioners here. In early February 1959, the respondent company docked three of its employees at the East Chicago refinery a total of $2.19. On February 13 and 14, 999 of the 1,700 employees participated in a strike or work stoppage, or so the complaint alleges. On March 12, the company filed this suit for damages and an injunction, naming the international and its local as defendants, together with 24 individual union member-employees.\n\nCount I of the complaint, which was in three counts, stated a cause of action under 301 of the Taft-Hartley Act (29 U.S.C. 185) against the international and its local. It alleged an existing collective bargaining agreement between the international and the company containing, among other matters, a promise by the union not to strike over any cause which could be the subject of a grievance under other provisions of the contract. It was \n\n[370 \nU.S. 238, 240]\n\u00a0\n alleged that the international and the local caused the strike or work stoppage occurring on February 13 and 14 and that the strike was over the pay claims of three employees in the amount of $2.19, which claims were properly subject to the grievance procedure provided by the contract. The complaint asked for damages in the amount of $12,500 from the international and the local.\n\nCount II of the complaint purported to invoke the diversity jurisdiction of the District Court. It asked judgment in the same amount against 24 individual employees, each of whom was alleged to be a committeeman of the local union and an agent of the international, and responsible for representing the international, the local, and their members. The complaint asserted that on February 13 and 14, the individuals, \"contrary to their duty to plaintiff to abide by said contract, and maliciously confederating and conspiring together to cause the plaintiff expense and damage, and to induce breaches of the said contract, and to interfere with performance thereof by the said labor organizations and the affected employees, and to cause breaches thereof, individually and as officers, committeemen and agents of the said labor organizations, fomented, assisted and participated in a strike or work stoppage . . . .\"\n\nCount III of the complaint asked for an injunction but that matter need not concern us here since it is disposed of in Sinclair Refining Co. v. Atkinson, ante, p. 195, decided this day.\n\nThe defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on various grounds and a motion to stay the action for the reasons (1) that all of the issues in the suit were referable to arbitration under the collective bargaining contract and (2) that important issues in the suit were also involved in certain grievances filed by employees and said to be in arbitration under the contract. The District Court denied the motion to dismiss Count I, dismissed Count II, and denied the motion to stay (187 F. Supp. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 238, 241]\n\u00a0\n 225). The Court of Appeals upheld the refusal to dismiss or stay Count I, but reversed the dismissal of Count II (290 F.2d 312), and this Court granted certiorari (\n368 \nU.S. 937\n).\n\n\nI.\n\n\nWe have concluded that Count I should not be dismissed or stayed. Count I properly states a cause of action under 301 and is to be governed by federal law. Local 174 v. Lucas Flour Co., \n369 \nU.S. 95, 102\n-104; Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills, \n353 \nU.S. 448\n. Under our decisions, whether or not the company was bound to arbitrate, as well as what issues it must arbitrate, is a matter to be determined by the Court on the basis of the contract entered into by the parties. \"The Congress . . . has by 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, assigned the courts the duty of determining whether the reluctant party has breached his promise to arbitrate. For arbitration is a matter of contract and a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.\" United Steelworkers v. Warrior & Gulf Nav. Co., \n363 \nU.S. 574, 582\n. See also United Steelworkers v. American Mfg. Co., \n363 \nU.S. 564, 570\n-571 (concurring opinion). We think it unquestionably clear that the contract here involved is not susceptible to a construction that the company was bound to arbitrate its claim for damages against the union for breach of the undertaking not to strike.\n\nWhile it is quite obvious from other provisions of the contract\n1\n that the parties did not intend to commit all \n\n[370 \nU.S. 238, 242]\n\u00a0\n of their possible disputes and the whole scope of their relationship to the grievance and arbitration procedures established in Article XXVI,\n2\n that article itself is determinative of the issue in this case since it precludes arbitration boards from considering any matters other than employee grievances.\n3\n After defining a grievance as \"any difference regarding wages, hours or working conditions between the parties hereto or between the Employer and an employee covered by this working agreement,\" Article XXVI provides that the parties desire to settle employee grievances fairly and quickly and that therefore a stated procedure \"must be followed.\" The individual employee is required to present his grievance to his foreman, and if not satisfied there, he may take his grievance to the plant superintendent who is to render a written decision. There \n\n[370 \nU.S. 238, 243]\n\u00a0\n is also provision for so-called Workmen's Committees to present grievances to the local management. If the local superintendent's decision is not acceptable, the matter is to be referred for discussion between the President of the International and the Director of Industrial Relations for the company (or their representatives), and for decision by the Director alone. If the Director's decision is disputed, then \"upon request of the President or any District Director\" of the international, a local arbitration board may be convened and the matter finally decided by this board.\n\nArticle XXVI then imposes the critical limitation. It is provided that local arbitration boards \"shall consider only individual or local employee or local committee grievances arising under the application of the currently existing agreement.\" There is not a word in the grievance and arbitration article providing for the submission of grievances by the company. Instead, there is the express, flat limitation that arbitration boards should consider only employee grievances. Furthermore, the article expressly provides that arbitration may be invoked only at the option of the union. At no place in the contract does the union agree to arbitrate at the behest of the company. The company is to take its claims elsewhere, which it has now done.\n\nThe union makes a further argument for a stay. Following the strike, and both before and after the company filed its suit, 14 of the 24 individual defendants filed grievances claiming reimbursement for pay withheld by the employer. The union argues that even though the company need not arbitrate its claim for damages, it is bound to arbitrate these grievances; and the arbitrator, in the process of determining the grievants' right to reimbursement, will consider and determine issues which also underlie the company's claim for damages. Therefore, it is said that a stay of the court action is appropriate.\n\nWe are not satisfied from the record now before us, however, that any significant issue in the damage suit \n\n[370 \nU.S. 238, 244]\n\u00a0\n will be presented to and decided by an arbitrator. The grievances filed simply claimed reimbursement for pay due employees for time spent at regular work or processing grievances. Although the record is a good deal less than clear and although no answer has been filed in this case, it would appear from the affidavits of the parties presented in connection with the motion to stay that the grievants claimed to have been disciplined as a result of the work stoppage and that they were challenging this disciplinary action. The company sharply denies in its brief in this Court that any employee was disciplined. In any event, precisely what discipline was imposed, upon what grounds it is being attacked by the grievants, and the circumstances surrounding the withholding of pay from the employees are unexplained in the record. The union's brief here states that the important issue underlying the arbitration and the suit for damages is whether the grievants instigated or participated in a work stoppage contrary to the collective bargaining contract. This the company denies and it asserts that no issue in the damage suit will be settled by arbitrating the grievances.\n\nThe District Court must decide whether the company is entitled to damages from the union for breach of contract. The arbitrator, if arbitration occurs, must award or deny reimbursement in whole or in part to all or some of the 14 employees. His award, standing alone, obviously would determine no issue in the damage suit. If he awarded reimbursement to the employees and if it could be ascertained with any assurance\n4\n that one of his subsidiary findings was that the 14 men had not participated in a forbidden work stoppage - the critical issue according to the union's brief - the company would nevertheless not be foreclosed in court since, even if it were \n\n[370 \nU.S. 238, 245]\n\u00a0\n bound by such a subsidiary finding made by the arbitrator, it would be free to prove its case in court through the conduct of other agents of the union. In this state of the record, the union has not made out its case for a stay.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the lower courts properly denied the union's motion to dismiss Count I or stay it pending arbitration of the employer's damage claim.\n\n\nII.\n\n\nWe turn now to Count II of the complaint, which charged 24 individual officers and agents of the union with breach of the collective bargaining contract and tortious interference with contractual relations. The District Court held that under 301 union officers or members cannot be held personally liable for union actions, and that therefore \"suits of the nature alleged in Count II are no longer cognizable in state or federal courts.\" The Court of Appeals reversed, however, ruling that \"Count II stated a cause of action cognizable in the courts of Indiana and, by diversity, maintainable in the District Court.\"\n\nWe are unable to agree with the Court of Appeals, for we are convinced that Count II is controlled by federal law and that it must be dismissed on the merits for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 238, 246]\n\u00a0\n\n\nUnder 301 a suit for violation of the collective bargaining contract in either a federal or state court is governed by federal law (Local 174 v. Lucas Flour Co., \n369 \nU.S. 95, 102\n-104; Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills, \n353 \nU.S. 448\n), and Count II on its face charges the individual defendants with a violation of the no-strike clause. After quoting verbatim the no-strike clause, Count II alleges that the 24 individual defendants \"contrary to their duty to plaintiff to abide by\" the contract fomented and participated in a work stoppage in violation of the no-strike clause. The union itself does not quarrel with the proposition that the relationship of the members of the bargaining unit to the employer is \"governed by\" the bargaining agreement entered into on their behalf by the union. It is universally accepted that the no-strike clause in a collective agreement at the very least establishes a rule of conduct or condition of employment the violation of which by employees justifies discipline or discharge (Mastro Plastics Corp. v. Labor Board, \n350 \nU.S. 270, 280\n & n. 10; Labor Board v. Rockaway News Co., \n345 \nU.S. 71, 80\n; Labor Board v. Sands Mfg. Co., \n306 \nU.S. 332\n; Labor Board v. Draper Corp., 145 F.2d 199 (C. A. 4th Cir.); United Biscuit Co. v. Labor Board, 128 F.2d 771 (C. A. 7th Cir.); see R. R. Donnelley & Sons Co., 5 Lab. Arb. 16; Ford Motor Co., 1 Lab. Arb. 439). The conduct charged in Count II is therefore within the scope of a \"violation\" of the collective agreement.\n\nAs well as charging a violation of the no-strike clause by the individual defendants, Count II necessarily charges a violation of the clause by the union itself. The work stoppage alleged is the identical work stoppage for which the union is sued under Count I and the same damage is alleged as is alleged in Count I. Count II states that the individual defendants acted \"as officers, committeemen and agents of the said labor organizations\" in breaching \n\n[370 \nU.S. 238, 247]\n\u00a0\n and inducing others to breach the collective bargaining contract. Count I charges the principal, and Count II charges the agents for acting on behalf of the principal. Whatever individual liability Count II alleges for the 24 individual defendants, it necessarily restates the liability of the union which is charged under Count I, since under 301 (b) the union is liable for the acts of its agents, under familiar principles of the law of agency (see also 301 (e)). Proof of the allegations of Count II in its present form would inevitably prove a violation of the no-strike clause by the union itself. Count II, like Count I, is thus a suit based on the union's breach of its collective bargaining contract with the employer, and therefore comes within 301 (a). When a union breach of contract is alleged, that the plaintiff seeks to hold the agents liable instead of the principal does not bring the action outside the scope of 301.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nUnder any theory, therefore, the company's action is governed by the national labor relations law which Congress commanded this Court to fashion under 301 (a). We hold that this law requires the dismissal of Count II for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted - whether the contract violation charged is that of the union or that of the union plus the union officers and agents.\n\nWhen Congress passed 301, it declared its view that only the union was to be made to respond for union \n\n[370 \nU.S. 238, 248]\n\u00a0\n wrongs, and that the union members were not to be subject to levy. Section 301 (b) has three clauses. One makes unions suable in the courts of the United States. Another makes unions bound by the acts of their agents according to conventional principles of agency law (cf. 301 (e)). At the same time, however, the remaining clause exempts agents and members from personal liability for judgments against the union (apparently even when the union is without assets to pay the judgment). The legislative history of 301 (b) makes it clear that this third clause was a deeply felt congressional reaction against the Danbury Hatters case (Loewe v. Lawlor, \n208 \nU.S. 274\n; Lawlor v. Loewe, \n235 \nU.S. 522\n), and an expression of legislative determination that the aftermath (Loewe v. Savings Bank of Danbury, 236 F. 444 (C. A. 2d Cir.)) of that decision was not to be permitted to recur. In that case, an antitrust treble damage action was brought against a large number of union members, including union officers and agents, to recover from them the employer's losses in a nationwide, union-directed boycott of his hats. The union was not named as a party, nor was judgment entered against it. A large money judgment was entered, instead, against the individual defendants for participating in the plan \"emanating from headquarters\" (\n235 \nU.S., at 534\n), by knowingly authorizing and delegating authority to the union officers to do the acts involved. In the debates, Senator Ball, one of the Act's sponsors, declared that 301, \"by providing that the union may sue and be sued as a legal entity, for a violation of contract, and that liability for damages will lie against union assets only, will prevent a repetition of the Danbury Hatters case, in which many members lost their homes\" (93 Cong. Rec. 5014). See also 93 Cong. Rec. 3839, 6283; S. Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong., Ist Sess. 16.\n\nConsequently, in discharging the duty Congress imposed on us to formulate the federal law to govern \n\n[370 \nU.S. 238, 249]\n\u00a0\n 301 (a) suits, we are strongly guided by and do not give a niggardly reading to 301 (b). \"We would undercut the Act and defeat its policy if we read 301 narrowly\" (Lincoln Mills, \n353 \nU.S., at 456\n). We have already said in another context that 301 (b) at least evidences \"a congressional intention that the union as an entity, like a corporation, should in the absence of agreement be the sole source of recovery for injury inflicted by it\" (Lewis v. Benedict Coal Corp., \n361 \nU.S. 459, 470\n). This policy cannot be evaded or truncated by the simple device of suing union agents or members, whether in contract or tort, or both, in a separate count or in a separate action for damages for violation of a collective bargaining contract for which damages the union itself is liable. The national labor policy requires and we hold that when a union is liable for damages for violation of the no-strike clause, its officers and members are not liable for these damages. Here, Count II, as we have said, necessarily alleges union liability but prays for damages from the union agents. Where the union has inflicted the injury it alone must pay. Count II must be dismissed.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nThe case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n    It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 238, 250]\n\u00a0\n\n\n   APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT.\n\n\n Article XXVI provides:\n\n  \"GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION PROCEDURE\n\n\n   \"Definition\n\n\n\"1. A grievance is defined to be any difference regarding wages, hours or working conditions between the parties hereto or between the Employer and an employee covered by this working agreement which might arise within any plant or within any region of operations.\n\n  \"Grievance Procedure\n\n\n\n\"It is the sincere desire of both parties that employee grievances be settled as fairly and as quickly as possible. Therefore, when a grievance arises, the following procedure must be followed:\n\n\n\"2. For the purpose of adjusting employee grievances and disputes as defined above, it is agreed that any employee, individually or accompanied by his committeeman, if desired shall:\n\n\n\"(a) Seek direct adjustment of any grievance or dispute with the foreman under whom he is employed. Such meeting will be without loss of time to the employee and\/or his committeeman during regular working hours for time spent in conference with the foreman. The foreman shall reply to said employee within three (3) working days (Saturday, Sunday and Holidays excluded) from the date on which the grievance was first presented to him;\n\n\n\"(b) If the question is not then settled, the employee may submit his grievance in writing, on forms supplied by Union, to a committee selected as hereinafter provided for the particular plant or region in which such employee is employed. Such committee shall investigate said complaint and if in its opinion the grievance has merit it shall have the right to meet with the local company superintendent or his representative, who shall receive the committee for this purpose. Written decisions shall be made by the local superintendent or his representative within ten (10) days after meeting with the committee, provided that prior to the time of or at the meeting with the committee such complaint or grievance has been submitted in writing to the local superintendent or his representative.\n\n\n\"(c) In exceptional cases, Workmen's Committees shall have the right to institute grievances concerning any alleged violation of this Agreement by filing written complaint with the official locally in charge. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 238, 251]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"(d) Any grievance filed with or by the local Workmen's Committee can only be withdrawn with the Workmen's Committee's consent.\n\n\n\"3. No complaint or grievance shall be considered hereunder unless it is presented to the superintendent or official locally in charge within sixty (60) days from the date on which the complaint or grievance arose, or from the date on which the employee or employees concerned first learned of the cause of complaint.\n\n\n\"4. The committee above mentioned shall be selected from among and by employees of the Employer who are members of the Union. No official, foreman, or employee having authority to hire or discharge men shall serve on the committee.\n\n\n\"5. In case of discharge or lay-off, employees who may desire to file complaints must present such complaints within one (1) week after the effective date of discharge or lay-off to the committee mentioned in this Article. Before any such employee is to be discharged for cause, other than flagrant violation of rules, or is to be laid off, he shall be given a written notice, dated and signed by his foreman or other representative of the Employer, setting forth the reason for such discharge or lay-off. In the event an employee has been discharged for a flagrant violation of a company rule, he shall subsequently, upon request, be given a written notice, dated and signed by his foreman or other representative of the Employer setting forth the reason for such discharge. The Workmen's Committee will be furnished with a copy of the statement furnished to the employee, both where the discharge or lay-off is for cause or for flagrant violation of a Company rule. Any grievance to be filed under this section must be filed within forty (40) days from the effective date of the discharge or lay-off.\n\n\n\"6. In the event the decision of the superintendent or his representative shall not be satisfactory to the committee, it is agreed that the President of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union, AFL-CIO, or someone designated by him, shall, not later than forty-five (45) days after such decision, have the right to confer with the Director of Industrial Relations for the Sinclair Companies, or someone designated by him, for the purpose of discussing grievances or disputes and of obtaining decisions thereon. It is agreed that the Director of Industrial Relations for the Sinclair Companies, or someone designated by him, shall render a decision to the President of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union, AFL-CIO, within twenty (20) days after grievances or disputes have been so submitted to him in writing. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 238, 252]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"7. If such decision is not satisfactory, then, upon request of the President or any District Director of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union, AFL-CIO and within sixty (60) days from the posting date of the final appeal answer, there shall be set up a local Arbitration Board, and such grievances and disputes submitted to it within ten (10) days after formation of such Board. Such local boards may be set up at each refinery to deal with cases arising therefrom; cases arising from Sinclair Oil & Gas Company shall be heard and determined at Tulsa, Oklahoma; Fort Worth, Texas; Midland, Texas; or Casper, Wyoming; cases arising from Sinclair Pipe Line Company shall be heard and determined at the cities previously named or at Kansas City, Missouri; Toledo, Ohio; Houston, Texas; Chicago, Illinois; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; or Independence, Kansas. These local Arbitration Boards shall consider only individual or local employee or local committee grievances arising under the application of the currently existing agreement, or supplements thereto, and local wage and classification disputes submitted on the initiative of the President or any District Director of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union, AFL-CIO. In this connection, Employer agrees to give consideration to local classification rate inequity complaints existing by reason of a comparison with the average of competitive rates of pay for like jobs having comparable duties and responsibilities being paid by agreed-upon major competitive companies in the local area. Such requests for adjustments of classification rate inequities, if any, shall be made not more frequently than twice annually, to be effective on February 1st and August 1st. Such requests to be submitted at least thirty (30) days prior to such semi-annual dates.\n\n\n\"8. The above mentioned local Arbitration Board shall be composed of one person designated by Employer and one designated by the President or District Director of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union, AFL-CIO. The board shall be requested by both parties to render a decision within seven (7) days from date of submission. Should the two members of the board selected as above provided, be unable to agree within seven (7) days, or to mutually agree upon an impartial third arbitrator, an impartial third member shall be selected within seven (7) days thereafter by the employer or employee member of the Arbitration Board, or such two parties jointly, requesting the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to submit a panel of arbitrators from which the third member of the board will be selected in accordance with the procedure of such Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 238, 253]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"9. The decision of the Board aforesaid, as provided in Section 8 hereof, shall be final. However, if the rules and conditions existing at the time a given case originated are subsequently changed, it is understood that the arbitration award rendered under former rules and conditions shall not act to prohibit consideration of a complaint originating under the changed rules and conditions.\n\n\n\"10. Cases arising from the Gasoline Plants shall be considered as coming within the Producing Division in which they are located.\n\n\n\"11. The fee and expense of the impartial arbitrator selected as above provided shall be divided equally between the parties to such arbitration. The Parties agree to attempt to hold the arbitrator's fees to a reasonable basis.\"\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The no-strike clause (Article III) provides that \"[T]here shall be no strikes . . .

Moreover, the management-prerogative clause (Article XXXI) recognizes that \"operation \n\n[370 \nU.S. 238, 242]\n\u00a0\n of the Employer's facilities and the direction of the working forces, including the right to hire, suspend or discharge for good and sufficient cause and pursuant to the seniority Article of this agreement, the right to relieve employees from duties because of lack of work, are among the sole prerogatives of the Employer; provided, however, that . . . such suspensions and discharges shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration clause . . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Article XXVI is set out in full infra, at p. 250, as an Appendix.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] We do not need to reach, therefore, the question of whether, under the contract involved here, breaches of the no-strike clause are \"grievances,\" i. e., \"difference[s] regarding wages, hours or working conditions,\" or are \"grievances\" in the more general sense of the term. See Hoover Express Co. v. Teamsters Local, No. 327, 217 F.2d 49 (C. A. 6th Cir.). The present decision does not approve or disapprove the doctrine of the Hoover case or the Sixth Circuit cases following it (e. g., Vulcan-Cincinnati, Inc., v. United Steelworkers, 289 F.2d 103; United Auto Workers v. Benton Harbor Indus., 242 F.2d 536). See also cases collected in Yale & Towne Mfg. Co. v.

Local 50, post, p. 254, decided this day, the question of arbitrability of a damages claim for breach of a no-strike clause is considered and resolved in favor of arbitration in the presence of an agreement to arbitrate \"all complaints, disputes or grievances arising between them [i. e., the parties] involving . . . any act or conduct or relation between the parties.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Arbitrators generally have no obligation to give their reasons for an award. United Steelworkers v. Enterprise Corp., \n363 \nU.S. 593, 598\n; Bernhardt v. Polygraphic Co., \n350 \nU.S. 198, 203\n. The record of their proceedings is not as complete as it is in a court trial. Ibid.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The union also argues that the preemptive doctrine of cases such as San Diego Bldg. Trades Council v. Garmon, \n359 \nU.S. 236\n, is applicable and prevents the courts from asserting jurisdiction. Since this is a 301 suit, that doctrine is inapplicable. Local 174 v. Lucas Flour Co., \n369 \nU.S. 95, 101\n n. 9.\n\nWe put aside, since it is unnecessary to reach them, the questions of whether the employer was excused from arbitrating the damage claim because it was over breach of the no-strike clause (see Drake Bakeries, Inc., v. Local 50, post, p. 254, decided this day) and whether the underlying factual or legal determination, made by an arbitrator in the process of awarding or denying reimbursement to 14 employees, would bind either the union or the company in the latter's action for damages against the union in the District Court.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Swift & Co. v.

Teamsters Union, 166 F. Supp. 885 (S. D. Ind.), concluding, as we do, that the complaint should be dismissed because of 301 (b) and 301 (e), but for want of jurisdiction rather than on the merits. Our holding, however, is that the suit is a 301 suit; whether there is a claim upon which relief can be granted is a separate question. See Bell v. Hood, \n327 \nU.S. 678\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] In reaching this conclusion, we have not ignored the argument that Count II was drafted in order to anticipate the possible union defense under Count I that the work stoppage was unauthorized by the union, and was a wildcat strike led by the 24 individual defendants acting not in behalf of the union but in their personal and nonunion capacity. The language of Count II contradicts the argument, however, and we therefore do not reach the question of whether the count would state a proper 301 (a) claim if it charged unauthorized, individual action. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 238, 254]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","6":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBAILEY v.

They alleged that such rights had been denied them under color of state statutes, municipal ordinances, and state custom and usage. A three-judge District Court convened to consider the case abstained from further proceedings, pending construction of the challenged laws by the state courts, and appellants appealed directly to this Court under 28 U.S.C. 1253. Held:\n\n 1. Appellants lack standing to enjoin criminal prosecutions under Mississippi's breach-of-peace statutes, since they do not allege that they have been prosecuted or threatened with prosecution there-under; but, as passengers using the segregated transportation facilities, they have standing to enforce their rights to nonsegregated treatment. Pp. 32-33.\n\n\n 2. That no State may require racial segregation of interstate or intrastate transportation facilities has been so well settled that it is foreclosed as a litigable issue, and a three-judge court was not required to pass on this case under 28 U.S.C. 2281. P. 33.\n\n\n 3. Since this case is not one required to be heard and determined by a district court of three judges under 28 U.S.C. 2281, it cannot be brought to this Court on direct appeal under 1253; but this Court has jurisdiction to determine the authority of the Court below and to make such corrective order as may be appropriate to the enforcement of the limitation which that section imposes.

Supp. 595. Plaintiffs have appealed, 28 U.S.C. 1253; N. A. A. C. P. v. Bennett, \n360 \nU.S. 471\n. We denied a motion to stay the prosecution of a number of criminal cases pending disposition of this appeal. \n368 \nU.S. 346\n.\n\nAppellants lack standing to enjoin criminal prosecutions under Mississippi's breach-of-peace statutes, since they do not allege that they have been prosecuted or threatened with prosecution under them. They cannot \n\n[369 \nU.S. 31, 33]\n\u00a0\n represent a class of whom they are not a part. McCabe v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co., \n235 \nU.S. 151, 162\n-163. But as passengers using the segregated transportation facilities they are aggrieved parties and have standing to enforce their rights to nonsegregated treatment. Mitchell v. United States, \n313 \nU.S. 80, 93\n; Evers v.

Section 2281 does not require a three-judge court when the claim that a statute is unconstitutional is wholly insubstantial, legally speaking nonexistent. Ex parte Poresky, \n290 \nU.S. 30\n; Bell v. Water-front Comm'n, 279 F.2d 853, 857-858. We hold that three judges are similarly not required when, as here, prior decisions make frivolous any claim that a state statute on its face is not unconstitutional. Willis v. Walker, 136 F. Supp. 181; Bush v. Orleans Parish School Board, 138 F. Supp. 336; Kelley v. Board of Education, 139 F. Supp. 578. We denied leave to file petitions for mandamus in Bush, \n351 \nU.S. 948\n, and from a similar ruling in Booker v. Tennessee Board of Education, \n351 \nU.S. 948\n. The reasons for convening an extraordinary court are inapplicable in such cases, for the policy behind the three-judge requirement - that a single judge ought not to be empowered to invalidate a state statute under a federal claim - does not apply. The three-judge requirement is a technical one to be narrowly construed, Phillips v. United States, \n312 \nU.S. 246, 251\n. The statute comes into play only when an injunction is sought \"upon the ground of the unconstitutionality\" of a statute. There is no such ground when the constitutional issue presented is essentially fictitious. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 31, 34]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThis case is therefore not one \"required . . . to be heard and determined by a district court of three judges,\" 28 U.S.C. 1253, and therefore cannot be brought here on direct appeal. However, we have jurisdiction to determine the authority of the court below and \"to make such corrective order as may be appropriate to the enforcement of the limitations which that section imposes,\" Gully v. Interstate Natural Gas Co., \n292 \nU.S. 16, 18\n; Oklahoma Gas & Elec. Co. v. Oklahoma Packing Co., \n292 \nU.S. 386, 392\n; Phillips v. United States, \n312 \nU.S. 246, 254\n.

They brought suit in a Federal District Court in Tennessee under 42 U.S.C. 1983, on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated, to redress the alleged deprivation of their federal constitutional rights by legislation classifying voters with respect to representation in the General Assembly. They alleged that, by means of a 1901 statute of Tennessee arbitrarily and capriciously apportioning the seats in the General Assembly among the State's 95 counties, and a failure to reapportion them subsequently notwithstanding substantial growth and redistribution of the State's population, they suffer a \"debasement of their votes\" and were thereby denied the equal protection of the laws guaranteed them by the Fourteenth Amendment. They sought, inter alia, a declaratory judgment that the 1901 statute is unconstitutional and an injunction restraining certain state officers from conducting any further elections under it. The District Court dismissed the complaint on the grounds that it lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter and that no claim was stated upon which relief could be granted. Held:\n\n 1. The District Court had jurisdiction of the subject matter of the federal constitutional claim asserted in the complaint. Pp. 198-204.\n\n\n 2. Appellants had standing to maintain this suit.

JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis civil action was brought under 42 U.S.C. 1983 and 1988 to redress the alleged deprivation of federal constitutional rights. The complaint, alleging that by means of a 1901 statute of Tennessee apportioning the members of the General Assembly among the State's 95 counties,\n1\n \"these plaintiffs and others similarly situated, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 188]\n\u00a0\n are denied the equal protection of the laws accorded them by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States by virtue of the debasement of their votes,\" was dismissed by a three-judge court convened under 28 U.S.C. 2281 in the Middle District of Tennessee.\n2\n The court held that it lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter and also that no claim was stated upon which relief could be granted. 179 F. Supp. 824. We noted probable jurisdiction of the appeal. \n364 \nU.S. 898\n.\n3\n We hold that the dismissal was error, and remand the cause to the District Court for trial and further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nThe General Assembly of Tennessee consists of the Senate with 33 members and the House of Representatives with 99 members. The Tennessee Constitution provides in Art. II as follows:\n\n \"Sec. 3. Legislative authority - Term of office. - The Legislative authority of this State shall be vested in a General Assembly, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives, both dependent on the people; who shall hold their offices for two years from the day of the general election.\n\n\n \"Sec. 4. Census. - An enumeration of the qualified voters, and an apportionment of the Representatives in the General Assembly, shall be made in the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy-one, and within every subsequent term of ten years.\n\n\n \"Sec. 5. Apportionment of representatives. - The number of Representatives shall, at the several \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 189]\n\u00a0\n periods of making the enumeration, be apportioned among the several counties or districts, according to the number of qualified voters in each; and shall not exceed seventy-five, until the population of the State shall be one million and a half, and shall never exceed ninety-nine; Provided, that any county having two-thirds of the ratio shall be entitled to one member.\n\n\n \"Sec. 6. Apportionment of senators. - The number of Senators shall, at the several periods of making the enumeration, be apportioned among the several counties or districts according to the number of qualified electors in each, and shall not exceed one-third the number of representatives. In apportioning the Senators among the different counties, the fraction that may be lost by any county or counties, in the apportionment of members to the House of Representatives, shall be made up to such county or counties in the Senate, as near as may be practicable. When a district is composed of two or more counties, they shall be adjoining; and no county shall be divided in forming a district.\"\n\n\n Thus, Tennessee's standard for allocating legislative representation among her counties is the total number of qualified voters resident in the respective counties, subject only to minor qualifications.\n4\n Decennial reapportionment \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 190]\n\u00a0\n in compliance with the constitutional scheme was effected by the General Assembly each decade from 1871 to 1901. The 1871 apportionment\n5\n was preceded by an 1870 statute requiring an enumeration.\n6\n The 1881 apportionment involved three statutes, the first authorizing an enumeration, the second enlarging the Senate from 25 to \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 191]\n\u00a0\n 33 members and the House from 75 to 99 members, and the third apportioning the membership of both Houses.\n7\n In 1891 there were both an enumeration and an apportionment.\n8\n In 1901 the General Assembly abandoned separate enumeration in favor of reliance upon the Federal Census and passed the Apportionment Act here in controversy.\n9\n In the more than 60 years since that action, all proposals in both Houses of the General Assembly for reapportionment have failed to pass.\n10\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 192]\n\u00a0\n\n\nBetween 1901 and 1961, Tennessee has experienced substantial growth and redistribution of her population. In 1901 the population was 2,020,616, of whom 487,380 were eligible to vote.\n11\n The 1960 Federal Census reports the State's population at 3,567,089, of whom 2,092,891 are eligible to vote.\n12\n The relative standings of the counties in terms of qualified voters have changed significantly. It is primarily the continued application of the 1901 Apportionment Act to this shifted and enlarged voting population which gives rise to the present controversy.\n\nIndeed, the complaint alleges that the 1901 statute, even as of the time of its passage, \"made no apportionment of Representatives and Senators in accordance with the constitutional formula . . ., but instead arbitrarily and capriciously apportioned representatives in the Senate and House without reference . . . to any logical or reasonable formula whatever.\"\n13\n It is further alleged \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 193]\n\u00a0\n that \"because of the population changes since 1900, and the failure of the Legislature to reapportion itself since 1901,\" the 1901 statute became \"unconstitutional and obsolete.\" Appellants also argue that, because of the composition of the legislature effected by the 1901 Apportionment Act, redress in the form of a state constitutional amendment to change the entire mechanism for reapportioning, or any other change short of that, is difficult or impossible.\n14\n The complaint concludes that \"these plaintiffs \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 194]\n\u00a0\n and others similarly situated, are denied the equal protection of the laws accorded them by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States by virtue of the debasement of their votes.\"\n15\n They seek a \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 195]\n\u00a0\n declaration that the 1901 statute is unconstitutional and an injunction restraining the appellees from acting to conduct any further elections under it. They also pray that unless and until the General Assembly enacts a valid reapportionment, the District Court should either decree a reapportionment by mathematical application of the Tennessee constitutional formulae to the most recent Federal Census figures, or direct the appellees to conduct legislative elections, primary and general, at large. They also pray for such other and further relief as may be appropriate.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n THE DISTRICT COURT'S OPINION AND ORDER OF DISMISSAL.\n\n\n Because we deal with this case on appeal from an order of dismissal granted on appellees' motions, precise identification \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 196]\n\u00a0\n of the issues presently confronting us demands clear exposition of the grounds upon which the District Court rested in dismissing the case. The dismissal order recited that the court sustained the appellees' grounds \"(1) that the Court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, and (2) that the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted . . . .\"\n\nIn the setting of a case such as this, the recited grounds embrace two possible reasons for dismissal:\n\nFirst: That the facts and injury alleged, the legal bases invoked as creating the rights and duties relied upon, and the relief sought, fail to come within that language of Article III of the Constitution and of the jurisdictional statutes which define those matters concerning which United States District Courts are empowered to act;\n\nSecond: That, although the matter is cognizable and facts are alleged which establish infringement of appellants' rights as a result of state legislative action departing from a federal constitutional standard, the court will not proceed because the matter is considered unsuited to judicial inquiry or adjustment.\n\nWe treat the first ground of dismissal as \"lack of jurisdiction of the subject matter.\" The second we consider to result in a failure to state a justiciable cause of action.\n\nThe District Court's dismissal order recited that it was issued in conformity with the court's per curiam opinion. The opinion reveals that the court rested its dismissal upon lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and lack of a justiciable cause of action without attempting to distinguish between these grounds. After noting that the plaintiffs challenged the existing legislative apportionment in Tennessee under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses, and summarizing the supporting allegations and the relief requested, the court stated that\n\n \"The action is presently before the Court upon the defendants' motion to dismiss predicated upon three \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 197]\n\u00a0\n grounds: first, that the Court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter; second, that the complaints fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted; and third, that indispensable party defendants are not before the Court.\" 179 F. Supp., at 826.\n\n\n The court proceeded to explain its action as turning on the case's presenting a \"question of the distribution of political strength for legislative purposes.\" For,\n\n\"From a review of [numerous Supreme Court] . . . decisions there can be no doubt that the federal rule, as enunciated and applied by the Supreme Court, is that the federal courts, whether from a lack of jurisdiction or from the inappropriateness of the subject matter for judicial consideration, will not intervene in cases of this type to compel legislative reapportionment.\" 179 F. Supp., at 826.\n\n\n The court went on to express doubts as to the feasibility of the various possible remedies sought by the plaintiffs. 179 F. Supp., at 827-828. Then it made clear that its dismissal reflected a view not of doubt that violation of constitutional rights was alleged, but of a court's impotence to correct that violation:\n\n\"With the plaintiffs' argument that the legislature of Tennessee is guilty of a clear violation of the state constitution and of the rights of the plaintiffs the Court entirely agrees. It also agrees that the evil is a serious one which should be corrected without further delay. But even so the remedy in this situation clearly does not lie with the courts. It has long been recognized and is accepted doctrine that there are indeed some rights guaranteed by the Constitution for the violation of which the courts cannot give redress.\" 179 F. Supp., at 828.\n\n\n In light of the District Court's treatment of the case, we hold today only (a) that the court possessed jurisdiction of the subject matter; (b) that a justiciable cause of \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 198]\n\u00a0\n action is stated upon which appellants would be entitled to appropriate relief; and (c) because appellees raise the issue before this Court, that the appellants have standing to challenge the Tennessee apportionment statutes.\n16\n Beyond noting that we have no cause at this stage to doubt the District Court will be able to fashion relief if violations of constitutional rights are found, it is improper now to consider what remedy would be most appropriate if appellants prevail at the trial.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n  JURISDICTION OF THE SUBJECT MATTER.\n\n\n The District Court was uncertain whether our cases withholding federal judicial relief rested upon a lack of federal jurisdiction or upon the inappropriateness of the subject matter for judicial consideration - what we have designated \"nonjusticiability.\" The distinction between the two grounds is significant. In the instance of nonjusticiability, consideration of the cause is not wholly and immediately foreclosed; rather, the Court's inquiry necessarily proceeds to the point of deciding whether the duty asserted can be judicially identified and its breach judicially determined, and whether protection for the right asserted can be judicially molded. In the instance of lack of jurisdiction the cause either does not \"arise under\" the Federal Constitution, laws or treaties (or fall within one of the other enumerated categories of Art. III, 2), or is not a \"case or controversy\" within the meaning of that section; or the cause is not one described by any jurisdictional statute. Our conclusion, see pp. 208-237. infra, that this cause presents no nonjusticiable \"political question\" settles the only possible doubt that it is a case or controversy. Under the present heading of \"Jurisdiction \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 199]\n\u00a0\n of the Subject Matter\" we hold only that the matter set forth in the complaint does arise under the Constitution and is within 28 U.S.C. 1343.\n\nArticle III, 2, of the Federal Constitution provides that \"The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority . . . .\" It is clear that the cause of action is one which \"arises under\" the Federal Constitution. The complaint alleges that the 1901 statute effects an apportionment that deprives the appellants of the equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Dismissal of the complaint upon the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the subject matter would, therefore, be justified only if that claim were \"so attenuated and unsubstantial as to be absolutely devoid of merit,\" Newburyport Water Co. v. Newburyport, \n193 \nU.S. 561, 579\n, or \"frivolous,\" Bell v. Hood, \n327 \nU.S. 678, 683\n.\n17\n That the claim is unsubstantial must be \"very plain.\" Hart v. Keith Vaudeville Exchange, \n262 \nU.S. 271, 274\n. Since the District Court obviously and correctly did not deem the asserted federal constitutional claim unsubstantial and frivolous, it should not have dismissed the complaint for want of jurisdiction of the subject matter. And of course no further consideration of the merits of the claim is relevant to a determination of the court's jurisdiction of the subject matter. We said in an earlier voting case from Tennessee: \"It is obvious . . . that the court, in dismissing for want of jurisdiction, was controlled by what it deemed to be the want of merit in the averments which were made in the complaint as to the violation of the Federal right. But as the very nature of the controversy was Federal, and, therefore, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 200]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction existed, whilst the opinion of the court as to the want of merit in the cause of action might have furnished ground for dismissing for that reason, it afforded no sufficient ground for deciding that the action was not one arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States.\" Swafford v. Templeton, \n185 \nU.S. 487, 493\n. \"For it is well settled that the failure to state a proper cause of action calls for a judgment on the merits and not for a dismissal for want of jurisdiction.\" Bell v. Hood, \n327 \nU.S. 678, 682\n. See also Binderup v. Pathe Exchange, \n263 \nU.S. 291, 305\n-308.\n\nSince the complaint plainly sets forth a case arising under the Constitution, the subject matter is within the federal judicial power defined in Art. III, 2, and so within the power of Congress to assign to the jurisdiction of the District Courts. Congress has exercised that power in 28 U.S.C. 1343 (3):\n\n \"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action authorized by law\n18\n to be commenced by any person . . . [t]o redress the deprivation, under color of any State law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom or usage, of any right, privilege or immunity secured by the Constitution of the United States . . . .\"\n19\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 201]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n An unbroken line of our precedents sustains the federal courts' jurisdiction of the subject matter of federal constitutional claims of this nature. The first cases involved the redistricting of States for the purpose of electing Representatives to the Federal Congress. When the Ohio Supreme Court sustained Ohio legislation against an attack for repugnancy to Art. I, 4, of the Federal Constitution, we affirmed on the merits and expressly refused to dismiss for want of jurisdiction \"In view . . . of the subject-matter of the controversy and the Federal characteristics which inhere in it . . . .\" Ohio ex rel. Davis v. Hildebrant, \n241 \nU.S. 565, 570\n. When the Minnesota Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of a suit to enjoin the Secretary of State of Minnesota from acting under Minnesota redistricting legislation, we reviewed the constitutional merits of the legislation and reversed the State Supreme Court. Smiley v. Holm, \n285 \nU.S. 355\n. And see companion cases from the New York Court of Appeals and the Missouri Supreme Court, Koenig v. Flynn, \n285 \nU.S. 375\n; Carroll v. Becker, \n285 \nU.S. 380\n. When a three-judge District Court, exercising jurisdiction under the predecessor of 28 U.S.C. 1343 (3), permanently enjoined officers of the State of Mississippi from conducting an election of Representatives under a Mississippi redistricting act, we reviewed the federal questions on the merits and reversed the District Court. Wood v. Broom, \n287 \nU.S. 1\n, reversing 1 F. Supp. 134. A similar decree of a District Court, exercising jurisdiction under the same statute, concerning a Kentucky redistricting act, was \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 202]\n\u00a0\n reviewed and the decree reversed. Mahan v. Hume, \n287 \nU.S. 575\n, reversing 1 F. Supp. 142.\n20\n\u00a0\n\nThe appellees refer to Colegrove v. Green, \n328 \nU.S. 549\n, as authority that the District Court lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter. Appellees misconceive the holding of that case. The holding was precisely contrary to their reading of it. Seven members of the Court participated in the decision. Unlike many other cases in this field which have assumed without discussion that there was jurisdiction, all three opinions filed in Colegrove discussed the question. Two of the opinions expressing the views of four of the Justices, a majority, flatly held that there was jurisdiction of the subject matter. MR. JUSTICE BLACK joined by MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice Murphy stated: \"It is my judgment that the District Court had jurisdiction . . .,\" citing the predecessor of 28 U.S.C. 1343 (3), and Bell v. Hood, supra. \n328 \nU.S., at 568\n. Mr. Justice Rutledge, writing separately, expressed agreement with this conclusion. \n328 \nU.S., at 564\n, 565, n. 2. Indeed, it is even questionable that the opinion of MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, joined by Justices Reed and Burton, doubted jurisdiction of the subject matter. Such doubt would have been inconsistent with the professed willingness to turn the decision on either the majority or concurring views in Wood v. Broom, supra. \n328 \nU.S., at 551\n.\n\nSeveral subsequent cases similar to Colegrove have been decided by the Court in summary per curiam statements. None was dismissed for want of jurisdiction of the subject matter. Cook v. Fortson, \n329 \nU.S. 675\n; Turman v. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 203]\n\u00a0\n Duckworth, ibid.; Colegrove v. Barrett, \n330 \nU.S. 804\n;\n21\n Tedesco v. Board of Supervisors, \n339 \nU.S. 940\n; Remmey v. Smith, \n342 \nU.S. 916\n; Cox v. Peters, \n342 \nU.S. 936\n; Anderson v. Jordan, \n343 \nU.S. 912\n; Kidd v. McCanless, \n352 \nU.S. 920\n; Radford v. Gary, \n352 \nU.S. 991\n; Hartsfield v. Sloan, \n357 \nU.S. 916\n; Matthews v. Handley, \n361 \nU.S. 127\n.\n22\n\u00a0\n\nTwo cases decided with opinions after Colegrove likewise plainly imply that the subject matter of this suit is within District Court jurisdiction. In MacDougall v. Green, \n335 \nU.S. 281\n, the District Court dismissed for want of jurisdiction, which had been invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1343 (3), a suit to enjoin enforcement of the requirement that nominees for state-wide elections be supported by a petition signed by a minimum number of persons from at least 50 of the State's 102 counties. This Court's disagreement with that action is clear since the Court affirmed the judgment after a review of the merits and concluded that the particular claim there was without merit. In South v. Peters, \n339 \nU.S. 276\n, we affirmed the dismissal of an attack on the Georgia \"county unit\" system but founded our action on a ground that plainly would not have been reached if the lower court lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter, which allegedly existed under 28 U.S.C. 1343 (3). The express words of our holding were that \"Federal courts consistently refuse to exercise their equity powers in cases posing \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 204]\n\u00a0\n political issues arising from a state's geographical distribution of electoral strength among its political subdivisions.\" \n339 \nU.S., at 277\n.\n\nWe hold that the District Court has jurisdiction of the subject matter of the federal constitutional claim asserted in the complaint.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nSTANDING.\n\n\nA federal court cannot \"pronounce any statute, either of a State or of the United States, void, because irreconcilable with the Constitution, except as it is called upon to adjudge the legal rights of litigants in actual controversies.\" Liverpool Steamship Co. v. Commissioners of Emigration, \n113 \nU.S. 33, 39\n. Have the appellants alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions? This is the gist of the question of standing. It is, of course, a question of federal law.\n\nThe complaint was filed by residents of Davidson, Hamilton, Knox, Montgomery, and Shelby Counties. Each is a person allegedly qualified to vote for members of the General Assembly representing his county.\n23\n These appellants sued \"on their own behalf and on behalf of all qualified voters of their respective counties, and further, on behalf of all voters of the State of Tennessee who \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 205]\n\u00a0\n are similarly situated . . . .\"\n24\n The appellees are the Tennessee Secretary of State, Attorney General, Coordinator of Elections, and members of the State Board of Elections; the members of the State Board are sued in their own right and also as representatives of the County Election Commissioners whom they appoint.\n25\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 206]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe hold that the appellants do have standing to maintain this suit. Our decisions plainly support this conclusion. Many of the cases have assumed rather than articulated the premise in deciding the merits of similar claims.\n26\n And Colegrove v. Green, supra, squarely held that voters who allege facts showing disadvantage to themselves as individuals have standing to sue.\n27\n A number \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 207]\n\u00a0\n of cases decided after Colegrove recognized the standing of the voters there involved to bring those actions.\n28\n\u00a0\n\nThese appellants seek relief in order to protect or vindicate an interest of their own, and of those similarly situated. Their constitutional claim is, in substance, that the 1901 statute constitutes arbitrary and capricious state action, offensive to the Fourteenth Amendment in its irrational disregard of the standard of apportionment prescribed by the State's Constitution or of any standard, effecting a gross disproportion of representation to voting population. The injury which appellants assert is that this classification disfavors the voters in the counties in which they reside, placing them in a position of constitutionally unjustifiable inequality vis-a-vis voters \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 208]\n\u00a0\n in irrationally favored counties. A citizen's right to a vote free of arbitrary impairment by state action has been judicially recognized as a right secured by the Constitution, when such impairment resulted from dilution by a false tally, cf. United States v. Classic, \n313 \nU.S. 299\n; or by a refusal to count votes from arbitrarily selected precincts, cf. United States v. Mosley, \n238 \nU.S. 383\n, or by a stuffing of the ballot box, cf. Ex parte Siebold, \n100 \nU.S. 371\n; United States v. Saylor, \n322 \nU.S. 385\n.\n\nIt would not be necessary to decide whether appellants' allegations of impairment of their votes by the 1901 apportionment will, ultimately, entitle them to any relief, in order to hold that they have standing to seek it. If such impairment does produce a legally cognizable injury, they are among those who have sustained it. They are asserting \"a plain, direct and adequate interest in maintaining the effectiveness of their votes,\" Coleman v. Miller, \n307 \nU.S., at 438\n, not merely a claim of \"the right, possessed by every citizen, to require that the Government be administered according to law . . . .\" Fairchild v. Hughes, \n258 \nU.S. 126, 129\n; compare Leser v. Garnett, \n258 \nU.S. 130\n. They are entitled to a hearing and to the District Court's decision on their claims. \"The very essence of civil liberty certainly consists in the right of every individual to claim the protection of the laws, whenever he receives an injury.\" Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 163.\n\n\nIV.\n\n\n   JUSTICIABILITY.\n\n\n In holding that the subject matter of this suit was not justiciable, the District Court relied on Colegrove v. Green, supra, and subsequent per curiam cases.\n29\n The \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 209]\n\u00a0\n court stated: \"From a review of these decisions there can be no doubt that the federal rule . . . is that the federal courts . . . will not intervene in cases of this type to compel legislative reapportionment.\" 179 F. Supp., at 826. We understand the District Court to have read the cited cases as compelling the conclusion that since the appellants sought to have a legislative apportionment held unconstitutional, their suit presented a \"political question\" and was therefore nonjusticiable. We hold that this challenge to an apportionment presents no nonjusticiable \"political question.\" The cited cases do not hold the contrary.\n\nOf course the mere fact that the suit seeks protection of a political right does not mean it presents a political question. Such an objection \"is little more than a play upon words.\" Nixon v. Herndon, \n273 \nU.S. 536, 540\n. Rather, it is argued that apportionment cases, whatever the actual wording of the complaint, can involve no federal constitutional right except one resting on the guaranty of a republican form of government,\n30\n and that complaints based on that clause have been held to present political questions which are nonjusticiable.\n\nWe hold that the claim pleaded here neither rests upon nor implicates the Guaranty Clause and that its justiciability is therefore not foreclosed by our decisions of cases involving that clause. The District Court misinterpreted Colegrove v. Green and other decisions of this Court on which it relied. Appellants' claim that they are being denied equal protection is justiciable, and if \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 210]\n\u00a0\n \"discrimination is sufficiently shown, the right to relief under the equal protection clause is not diminished by the fact that the discrimination relates to political rights.\" Snowden v. Hughes, \n321 \nU.S. 1, 11\n. To show why we reject the argument based on the Guaranty Clause, we must examine the authorities under it. But because there appears to be some uncertainty as to why those cases did present political questions, and specifically as to whether this apportionment case is like those cases, we deem it necessary first to consider the contours of the \"political question\" doctrine.\n\nOur discussion, even at the price of extending this opinion, requires review of a number of political question cases, in order to expose the attributes of the doctrine - attributes which, in various settings, diverge, combine, appear, and disappear in seeming disorderliness. Since that review is undertaken solely to demonstrate that neither singly nor collectively do these cases support a conclusion that this apportionment case is nonjusticiable, we of course do not explore their implications in other contexts. That review reveals that in the Guaranty Clause cases and in the other \"political question\" cases, it is the relationship between the judiciary and the coordinate branches of the Federal Government, and not the federal judiciary's relationship to the States, which gives rise to the \"political question.\"\n\nWe have said that \"In determining whether a question falls within [the political question] category, the approriateness under our system of government of attributing finality to the action of the political departments and also the lack of satisfactory criteria for a judicial determination are dominant considerations.\" Coleman v. Miller, \n307 \nU.S. 433, 454\n-455. The nonjusticiability of a political question is primarily a function of the separation of powers. Much confusion results from the capacity of the \"political question\" label to obscure the need for \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 211]\n\u00a0\n case-by-case inquiry. Deciding whether a matter has in any measure been committed by the Constitution to another branch of government, or whether the action of that branch exceeds whatever authority has been committed, is itself a delicate exercise in constitutional interpretation, and is a responsibility of this Court as ultimate interpreter of the Constitution. To demonstrate this requires no less than to analyze representative cases and to infer from them the analytical threads that make up the political question doctrine. We shall then show that none of those threads catches this case.\n\nForeign relations: There are sweeping statements to the effect that all questions touching foreign relations are political questions.\n31\n Not only does resolution of such issues frequently turn on standards that defy judicial application, or involve the exercise of a discretion demonstrably committed to the executive or legislature;\n32\n but many such questions uniquely demand single-voiced statement of the Government's views.\n33\n Yet it is error to suppose that every case or controversy which touches foreign relations lies beyond judicial cognizance. Our cases in this field seem invariably to show a discriminating analysis of the particular question posed, in terms of the history of its management by the political branches, of its susceptibility to judicial handling in the light of its nature and posture in the specific case, and of the possible consequences \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 212]\n\u00a0\n of judicial action. For example, though a court will not ordinarily inquire whether a treaty has been terminated, since on that question \"governmental action . . . must be regarded as of controlling importance,\" if there has been no conclusive \"governmental action\" then a court can construe a treaty and may find it provides the answer. Compare Terlinden v. Ames, \n184 \nU.S. 270, 285\n, with Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts v. New Haven, 8 Wheat. 464, 492-495.\n34\n Though a court will not undertake to construe a treaty in a manner inconsistent with a subsequent federal statute, no similar hesitancy obtains if the asserted clash is with state law. Compare Whitney v. Robertson; \n124 \nU.S. 190\n, with Kolovrat v. Oregon, \n366 \nU.S. 187\n.\n\nWhile recognition of foreign governments so strongly defies judicial treatment that without executive recognition a foreign state has been called \"a republic of whose existence we know nothing,\"\n35\n and the judiciary ordinarily follows the executive as to which nation has sovereignty over disputed territory,\n36\n once sovereignty over an area is politically determined and declared, courts may examine the resulting status and decide independently whether a statute applies to that area.\n37\n Similarly, recognition of belligerency abroad is an executive responsibility, but if the executive proclamations fall short of an explicit answer, a court may construe them seeking, for example, to determine whether the situation is such that statutes designed to assure American neutrality have \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 213]\n\u00a0\n become operative. The Three Friends, \n166 \nU.S. 1, 63\n, 66. Still again, though it is the executive that determines a person's status as representative of a foreign government, Ex parte Hitz, \n111 \nU.S. 766\n, the executive's statements will be construed where necessary to determine the court's jurisdiction, In re Baiz, \n135 \nU.S. 403\n. Similar judicial action in the absence of a recognizedly authoritative executive declaration occurs in cases involving the immunity from seizure of vessels owned by friendly foreign governments. Compare Ex parte Peru, \n318 \nU.S. 578\n, with Mexico v. Hoffman, \n324 \nU.S. 30, 34\n-35.\n\nDates of duration of hostilities: Though it has been stated broadly that \"the power which declared the necessity is the power to declare its cessation, and what the cessation requires,\" Commercial Trust Co. v. Miller, \n262 \nU.S. 51, 57\n, here too analysis reveals isolable reasons for the presence of political questions, underlying this Court's refusal to review the political departments' determination of when or whether a war has ended. Dominant is the need for finality in the political determination, for emergency's nature demands \"A prompt and unhesitating obedience,\" Martin v. Mott, 12 Wheat. 19, 30 (calling up of militia). Moreover, \"the cessation of hostilities does not necessarily end the war power. It was stated in Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries & W. Co., \n251 \nU.S. 146, 161\n, that the war power includes the power `to remedy the evils which have arisen from its rise and progress' and continues during that emergency. Stewart v. Kahn, 11 Wall. 493, 507.\" Fleming v. Mohawk Wrecking Co., \n331 \nU.S. 111, 116\n. But deference rests on reason, not habit.\n38\n The question in a particular case may not seriously implicate considerations of finality - e. g., a public program of importance \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 214]\n\u00a0\n (rent control) yet not central to the emergency effort.\n39\n Further, clearly definable criteria for decision may be available. In such case the political question barrier falls away: \"[A] Court is not at liberty to shut its eyes to an obvious mistake, when the validity of the law depends upon the truth of what is declared. . . . [It can] inquire whether the exigency still existed upon which the continued operation of the law depended.\" Chastleton Corp. v. Sinclair, \n264 \nU.S. 543, 547\n-548.\n40\n Compare Woods v. Miller Co., \n333 \nU.S. 138\n. On the other hand, even in private litigation which directly implicates no feature of separation of powers, lack of judicially discoverable standards and the drive for even-handed application may impel reference to the political departments' determination of dates of hostilities' beginning and ending. The Protector, 12 Wall. 700.\n\nValidity of enactments: In Coleman v. Miller, supra, this Court held that the questions of how long a proposed amendment to the Federal Constitution remained open to ratification, and what effect a prior rejection had on a subsequent ratification, were committed to congressional resolution and involved criteria of decision that necessarily escaped the judicial grasp.\n41\n Similar considerations apply to the enacting process: \"The respect due to coequal and independent departments,\" and the need for finality and certainty about the status of a statute contribute to judicial reluctance to inquire whether, as passed, it complied with all requisite formalities. Field v. Clark, \n143 \nU.S. 649, 672\n, 676-677; see Leser v. Garnett, \n258 \nU.S. 130, 137\n. But it is not true that courts will never delve \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 215]\n\u00a0\n into a legislature's records upon such a quest: If the enrolled statute lacks an effective date, a court will not hesitate to seek it in the legislative journals in order to preserve the enactment. Gardner v. The Collector, 6 Wall. 499. The political question doctrine, a tool for maintenance of governmental order, will not be so applied as to promote only disorder.\n\nThe status of Indian tribes: This Court's deference to the political departments in determining whether Indians are recognized as a tribe, while it reflects familiar attributes of political questions,\n42\n United States v. Holliday, 3 Wall. 407, 419, also has a unique element in that \"the relation of the Indians to the United States is marked by peculiar and cardinal distinctions which exist no where else. . . . [The Indians are] domestic dependent nations . . . in a state of pupilage. Their relation to the United States resembles that of a ward to his guardian.\" The Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1, 16, 17.\n43\n Yet, here too, there is no blanket rule. While \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 216]\n\u00a0\n \"`It is for [Congress] . . ., and not for the courts, to determine when the true interests of the Indian require his release from [the] condition of tutelage' . . ., it is not meant by this that Congress may bring a community or body of people within the range of this power by arbitrarily calling them an Indian tribe . . . .\" United States v. Sandoval, \n231 \nU.S. 28, 46\n. Able to discern what is \"distinctly Indian,\" ibid., the courts will strike down \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 217]\n\u00a0\n any heedless extension of that label. They will not stand impotent before an obvious instance of a manifestly unauthorized exercise of power.\n\nIt is apparent that several formulations which vary slightly according to the settings in which the questions arise may describe a political question, although each has one or more elements which identify it as essentially a function of the separation of powers. Prominent on the surface of any case held to involve a political question is found a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion; or the impossibility of a court's undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government; or an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made; or the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.\n\nUnless one of these formulations is inextricable from the case at bar, there should be no dismissal for nonjusticiability on the ground of a political question's presence. The doctrine of which we treat is one of \"political questions,\" not one of \"political cases.\" The courts cannot reject as \"no law suit\" a bona fide controversy as to whether some action denominated \"political\" exceeds constitutional authority. The cases we have reviewed show the necessity for discriminating inquiry into the precise facts and posture of the particular case, and the impossibility of resolution by any semantic cataloguing.\n\nBut it is argued that this case shares the characteristics of decisions that constitute a category not yet considered, cases concerning the Constitution's guaranty, in Art. IV, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 218]\n\u00a0\n 4, of a republican form of government. A conclusion as to whether the case at bar does present a political question cannot be confidently reached until we have considered those cases with special care. We shall discover that Guaranty Clause claims involve those elements which define a \"political question,\" and for that reason and no other, they are nonjusticiable. In particular, we shall discover that the nonjusticiability of such claims has nothing to do with their touching upon matters of state governmental organization.\n\nRepublican form of government: Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1, though in form simply an action for damages for trespass was, as Daniel Webster said in opening the argument for the defense, \"an unusual case.\"\n44\n The defendants, admitting an otherwise tortious breaking and entering, sought to justify their action on the ground that they were agents of the established lawful government of Rhode Island, which State was then under martial law to defend itself from active insurrection; that the plaintiff was engaged in that insurrection; and that they entered under orders to arrest the plaintiff. The case arose \"out of the unfortunate political differences which agitated the people of Rhode Island in 1841 and 1842,\" 7 How., at 34, and which had resulted in a situation wherein two groups laid competing claims to recognition as the lawful government.\n45\n The plaintiff's right to \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 219]\n\u00a0\n recover depended upon which of the two groups was entitled to such recognition; but the lower court's refusal to receive evidence or hear argument on that issue, its charge to the jury that the earlier established or \"charter\" government was lawful, and the verdict for the defendants, were affirmed upon appeal to this Court.\n\nChief Justice Taney's opinion for the Court reasoned as follows: (1) If a court were to hold the defendants' acts unjustified because the charter government had no legal existence during the period in question, it would follow that all of that government's actions - laws enacted, taxes collected, salaries paid, accounts settled, sentences passed - were of no effect; and that \"the officers who carried their decisions into operation [were] answerable as trespassers, if not in some cases as criminals.\"\n46\n There was, of course, no room for application of any doctrine of de facto status to uphold prior acts of an officer not authorized de jure, for such would have defeated the plaintiff's very action. A decision for the plaintiff would inevitably have produced some significant measure of chaos, a consequence to be avoided if it could be done without abnegation of the judicial duty to uphold the Constitution.\n\n(2) No state court had recognized as a judicial responsibility settlement of the issue of the locus of state governmental authority. Indeed, the courts of Rhode Island had in several cases held that \"it rested with the political power to decide whether the charter government had been displaced or not,\" and that that department had acknowledged no change. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 220]\n\u00a0\n\n\n(3) Since \"[t]he question relates, altogether, to the constitution and laws of [the] . . . State,\" the courts of the United States had to follow the state courts' decisions unless there was a federal constitutional ground for overturning them.\n47\n\u00a0\n\n(4) No provision of the Constitution could be or had been invoked for this purpose except Art. IV, 4, the Guaranty Clause. Having already noted the absence of standards whereby the choice between governments could be made by a court acting independently, Chief Justice Taney now found further textual and practical reasons for concluding that, if any department of the United States was empowered by the Guaranty Clause to resolve the issue, it was not the judiciary:\n\n \"Under this article of the Constitution it rests with Congress to decide what government is the established one in a State. For as the United States guarantee to each State a republican government, Congress must necessarily decide what government is established in the State before it can determine whether it is republican or not. And when the senators and representatives of a State are admitted into the councils of the Union, the authority of the government under which they are appointed, as well as its republican character, is recognized by the proper constitutional authority. And its decision is binding on every other department of the government, and could not be questioned in a judicial tribunal. It is true that the contest in this case did not last long enough to bring the matter to this issue; and . . . Congress was not called upon to decide the controversy. Yet the right to decide is placed there, and not in the courts. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 221]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \"So, too, as relates to the clause in the above-mentioned article of the Constitution, providing for cases of domestic violence. It rested with Congress, too, to determine upon the means proper to be adopted to fulfill this guarantee. . . . [B]y the act of February 28, 1795, [Congress] provided, that, `in case of an insurrection in any State against the government thereof, it shall be lawful for the President of the United States, on application of the legislature of such State or of the executive (when the legislature cannot be convened), to call forth such number of the militia of any other State or States, as may be applied for, as he may judge sufficient to suppress such insurrection.'\n\n\n \"By this act, the power of deciding whether the exigency had arisen upon which the government of the United States is bound to interfere, is given to the President. . . .\n\n\n \"After the President has acted and called out the militia, is a Circuit Court of the United States authorized to inquire whether his decision was right? . . . If the judicial power extends so far, the guarantee contained in the Constitution of the United States is a guarantee of anarchy, and not of order. . . .\n\n\n \"It is true that in this case the militia were not called out by the President. But upon the application of the governor under the charter government, the President recognized him as the executive power of the State, and took measures to call out the militia to support his authority if it should be found necessary for the general government to interfere . . . . [C]ertainly no court of the United States, with a knowledge of this decision, would have been justified in recognizing the opposing party as the lawful government \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 222]\n\u00a0\n . . . . In the case of foreign nations, the government acknowledged by the President is always recognized in the courts of justice. . . .\" 7 How., at 42-44.\n\n\n Clearly, several factors were thought by the Court in Luther to make the question there \"political\": the commitment to the other branches of the decision as to which is the lawful state government; the unambiguous action by the President, in recognizing the charter government as the lawful authority; the need for finality in the executive's decision; and the lack of criteria by which a court could determine which form of government was republican.\n48\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 223]\n\u00a0\n\n\nBut the only significance that Luther could have for our immediate purposes is in its holding that the Guaranty Clause is not a repository of judicially manageable standards which a court could utilize independently in order to identify a State's lawful government. The Court has since refused to resort to the Guaranty Clause - which alone had been invoked for the purpose - as the source of a constitutional standard for invalidating state action. See Taylor & Marshall v. Beckham (No. 1), \n178 \nU.S. 548\n (claim that Kentucky's resolution of contested gubernatorial election deprived voters of republican government held nonjusticiable); Pacific States Tel. Co. v. Oregon, \n223 \nU.S. 118\n (claim that initiative and referendum negated republican government held nonjusticiable); Kiernan v. Portland, \n223 \nU.S. 151\n (claim that municipal charter amendment per municipal initiative and referendum negated republican government held nonjusticiable); \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 224]\n\u00a0\n Marshall v. Dye, \n231 \nU.S. 250\n (claim that Indiana's constitutional amendment procedure negated republican government held nonjusticiable); O'Neill v. Leamer, \n239 \nU.S. 244\n (claim that delegation to court of power to form drainage districts negated republican government held \"futile\"); Ohio ex rel. Davis v. Hildebrant, \n241 \nU.S. 565\n (claim that invalidation of state reapportionment statute per referendum negates republican government held nonjusticiable);\n49\n Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, \n243 \nU.S. 219\n (claim that workmen's compensation violates republican government held nonjusticiable); Ohio ex rel. Bryant v. Akron Metropolitan Park District, \n281 \nU.S. 74\n (claim that rule requiring invalidation of statute by all but one justice of state court negated republican government held nonjusticiable); Highland Farms Dairy v. Agnew, \n300 \nU.S. 608\n (claim that delegation to agency of power to control milk prices violated republican government, rejected).\n\nJust as the Court has consistently held that a challenge to state action based on the Guaranty Clause presents no justiciable question so has it held, and for the same reasons, that challenges to congressional action on the ground of inconsistency with that clause present no justiciable question. In Georgia v. Stanton, 6 Wall. 50, the State sought by an original bill to enjoin execution of the Reconstruction Acts, claiming that it already possessed \"A republican State, in every political, legal, constitutional, and juridical sense,\" and that enforcement of the new Acts \"Instead of keeping the guaranty against a forcible overthrow of its government by foreign invaders or domestic insurgents, . . . is destroying that very government by force.\"\n50\n Congress had clearly refused to \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 225]\n\u00a0\n recognize the republican character of the government of the suing State.\n51\n It seemed to the Court that the only constitutional claim that could be presented was under the Guaranty Clause, and Congress having determined that the effects of the recent hostilities required extraordinary measures to restore governments of a republican form, this Court refused to interfere with Congress' action at the behest of a claimant relying on that very guaranty.\n52\n\u00a0\n\nIn only a few other cases has the Court considered Art. IV, 4, in relation to congressional action. It has refused to pass on a claim relying on the Guaranty Clause to establish that Congress lacked power to allow the States to employ the referendum in passing on legislation redistricting for congressional seats. Ohio ex rel. Davis v. Hildebrant, supra. And it has pointed out that Congress is not required to establish republican government in the territories before they become States, and before they have attained a sufficient population to warrant a \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 226]\n\u00a0\n popularly elected legislature. Downes v. Bidwell, \n182 \nU.S. 244, 278\n-279 (dictum).\n53\n\u00a0\n\nWe come, finally, to the ultimate inquiry whether our precedents as to what constitutes a nonjusticiable \"political question\" bring the case before us under the umbrella of that doctrine. A natural beginning is to note whether any of the common characteristics which we have been able to identify and label descriptively are present. We find none: The question here is the consistency of state action with the Federal Constitution. We have no question decided, or to be decided, by a political branch of government coequal with this Court. Nor do we risk embarrassment of our government abroad, or grave disturbance at home\n54\n if we take issue with Tennessee as to the constitutionality of her action here challenged. Nor need the appellants, in order to succeed in this action, ask the Court to enter upon policy determinations for which judicially manageable standards are lacking. Judicial standards under the Equal Protection Clause are well developed and familiar, and it has been open to courts since the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment to determine, if on the particular facts they must, that a discrimination reflects no policy, but simply arbitrary and capricious action.\n\nThis case does, in one sense, involve the allocation of political power within a State, and the appellants \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 227]\n\u00a0\n might conceivably have added a claim under the Guaranty Clause. Of course, as we have seen, any reliance on that clause would be futile. But because any reliance on the Guaranty Clause could not have succeeded it does not follow that appellants may not be heard on the equal protection claim which in fact they tender. True, it must be clear that the Fourteenth Amendment claim is not so enmeshed with those political question elements which render Guaranty Clause claims nonjusticiable as actually to present a political question itself. But we have found that not to be the case here.\n\nIn this connection special attention is due Pacific States Tel. Co. v. Oregon, \n223 \nU.S. 118\n. In that case a corporation tax statute enacted by the initiative was attacked ostensibly on three grounds: (1) due process; (2) equal protection; and (3) the Guaranty Clause. But it was clear that the first two grounds were invoked solely in aid of the contention that the tax was invalid by reason of its passage:\n\n\"The defendant company does not contend here that it could not have been required to pay a license tax. It does not assert that it was denied an opportunity to be heard as to the amount for which it was taxed, or that there was anything inhering in the tax or involved intrinsically in the law which violated any of its constitutional rights. If such questions had been raised they would have been justiciable, and therefore would have required the calling into operation of judicial power. Instead, however, of doing any of these things, the attack on the statute here made is of a wholly different character. Its essentially political nature is at once made manifest by understanding that the assault which the contention here advanced makes it [sic] not on the tax as a tax, but on the State as a State. It is addressed to the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 228]\n\u00a0\n framework and political character of the government by which the statute levying the tax was passed. It is the government, the political entity, which (reducing the case to its essence) is called to the bar of this court, not for the purpose of testing judicially some exercise of power assailed, on the ground that its exertion has injuriously affected the rights of an individual because of repugnancy to some constitutional limitation, but to demand of the State that it establish its right to exist as a State, republican in form.\" \n223 \nU.S., at 150\n-151.\n\n\n The due process and equal protection claims were held nonjusticiable in Pacific States not because they happened to be joined with a Guaranty Clause claim, or because they sought to place before the Court a subject matter which might conceivably have been dealt with through the Guaranty Clause, but because the Court believed that they were invoked merely in verbal aid of the resolution of issues which, in its view, entailed political questions. Pacific States may be compared with cases such as Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, \n243 \nU.S. 219\n, wherein the Court refused to consider whether a workmen's compensation act violated the Guaranty Clause but considered at length, and rejected, due process and equal protection arguments advanced against it; and O'Neill v. Leamer, \n239 \nU.S. 244\n, wherein the Court refused to consider whether Nebraska's delegation of power to form drainage districts violated the Guaranty Clause, but went on to consider and reject the contention that the action against which an injunction was sought was not a taking for a public purpose.\n\nWe conclude then that the nonjusticiability of claims resting on the Guaranty Clause which arises from their embodiment of questions that were thought \"political,\" can have no bearing upon the justiciability of the equal protection claim presented in this case. Finally, we \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 229]\n\u00a0\n emphasize that it is the involvement in Guaranty Clause claims of the elements thought to define \"political questions,\" and no other feature, which could render them nonjusticiable. Specifically, we have said that such claims are not held nonjusticiable because they touch matters of state governmental organization. Brief examination of a few cases demonstrates this.\n\nWhen challenges to state action respecting matters of \"the administration of the affairs of the State and the officers through whom they are conducted\"\n55\n have rested on claims of constitutional deprivation which are amenable to judicial correction, this Court has acted upon its view of the merits of the claim. For example, in Boyd v. Nebraska ex rel. Thayer, \n143 \nU.S. 135\n, we reversed the Nebraska Supreme Court's decision that Nebraska's Governor was not a citizen of the United States or of the State and therefore could not continue in office. In Kennard v. Louisiana ex rel. Morgan, \n92 \nU.S. 480\n, and Foster v. Kansas ex rel. Johnston, \n112 \nU.S. 201\n, we considered whether persons had been removed from public office by procedures consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment's due process guaranty, and held on the merits that they had. And only last Term, in Gomillion v. Lightfoot, \n364 \nU.S. 339\n, we applied the Fifteenth Amendment to strike down a redrafting of municipal boundaries which effected a discriminatory impairment of voting rights, in the face of what a majority of the Court of Appeals thought to be a sweeping commitment to state legislatures of the power to draw and redraw such boundaries.\n56\n\u00a0\n\nGomillion was brought by a Negro who had been a resident of the City of Tuskegee, Alabama, until the municipal boundaries were so recast by the State Legislature \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 230]\n\u00a0\n as to exclude practically all Negroes. The plaintiff claimed deprivation of the right to vote in municipal elections. The District Court's dismissal for want of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. This Court unanimously reversed. This Court's answer to the argument that States enjoyed unrestricted control over municipal boundaries was:\n\n\"Legislative control of municipalities, no less than other state power, lies within the scope of relevant limitations imposed by the United States Constitution . . . . The opposite conclusion, urged upon us by respondents, would sanction the achievement by a State of any impairment of voting rights whatever so long as it was cloaked in the garb of the realignment of political subdivisions. `It is inconceivable that guaranties embedded in the Constitution of the United States may thus be manipulated out of existence.'\" \n364 \nU.S., at 344\n-345.\n\n\n To a second argument, that Colegrove v. Green, supra, was a barrier to hearing the merits of the case, the Court responded that Gomillion was lifted \"out of the so-called `political' arena and into the conventional sphere of constitutional litigation\" because here was discriminatory treatment of a racial minority violating the Fifteenth Amendment.\n\n\"A statute which is alleged to have worked unconstitutional deprivations of petitioners' rights is not immune to attack simply because the mechanism employed by the legislature is a redefinition of municipal boundaries. . . . While in form this is merely an act redefining metes and bounds, if the allegations are established, the inescapable human effect of this essay in geometry and geography is to despoil colored citizens, and only colored citizens, of \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 231]\n\u00a0\n their theretofore enjoyed voting rights. That was not Colegrove v. Green.\n\n\n \"When a State exercises power wholly within the domain of state interest, it is insulated from federal judicial review. But such insulation is not carried over when state power is used as an instrument for circumventing a federally protected right.\" \n364 \nU.S., at 347\n.\n57\n\u00a0\n\n\n We have not overlooked such cases as In re Sawyer, \n124 \nU.S. 200\n, and Walton v. House of Representatives, \n265 \nU.S. 487\n, which held that federal equity power could not be exercised to enjoin a state proceeding to remove a public officer. But these decisions explicitly reflect only a traditional limit upon equity jurisdiction, and not upon federal courts' power to inquire into matters of state governmental organization. This is clear not only from the opinions in those cases, but also from White v. Berry, \n171 \nU.S. 366\n, which, relying on Sawyer, withheld federal equity from staying removal of a federal officer. Wilson v. North Carolina, \n169 \nU.S. 586\n, simply dismissed an appeal from an unsuccessful suit to upset a State's removal procedure, on the ground that the constitutional claim presented - that a jury trial was necessary if the removal procedure was to comport with due process requirements - was frivolous. Finally, in Taylor and Marshall v. Beckham (No. 1), \n178 \nU.S. 548\n, where losing candidates attacked the constitutionality of Kentucky's resolution of a contested gubernatorial election, the Court refused to consider the merits of a claim posited upon \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 232]\n\u00a0\n the Guaranty Clause, holding it presented a political question, but also held on the merits that the ousted candidates had suffered no deprivation of property without due process of law.\n58\n\u00a0\n\nSince, as has been established, the equal protection claim tendered in this case does not require decision of any political question, and since the presence of a matter affecting state government does not render the case nonjusticiable, it seems appropriate to examine again the reasoning by which the District Court reached its conclusion that the case was nonjusticiable.\n\nWe have already noted that the District Court's holding that the subject matter of this complaint was nonjusticiable relied upon Colegrove v. Green, supra, and later cases. Some of those concerned the choice of members of a state legislature, as in this case; others, like Colegrove itself and earlier precedents, Smiley v. Holm, \n285 \nU.S. 355\n, Koenig v. Flynn, \n285 \nU.S. 375\n, and Carroll v. Becker, \n285 \nU.S. 380\n, concerned the choice of Representatives in the Federal Congress. Smiley, Koenig and Carroll settled the issue in favor of justiciability of questions of congressional redistricting. The Court followed these precedents in Colegrove although over the dissent of three of the seven Justices who participated in that decision. On the issue of justiciability, all four Justices comprising a majority relied upon Smiley v. Holm, but in two opinions, one for three Justices, \n328 \nU.S., at 566\n, 568, and a separate one by Mr. Justice Rutledge, \n328 \nU.S., at 564\n. The argument that congressional redistricting problems presented a \"political question\" the resolution of which was confided to Congress might have been rested upon Art. I, 4, Art. I, 5, Art. I, 2, and Amendment \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 233]\n\u00a0\n XIV, 2. Mr. Justice Rutledge said: \"But for the ruling in Smiley v. Holm, \n285 \nU.S. 355\n, I should have supposed that the provisions of the Constitution, Art. I, 4, that \"The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for . . . Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations . . .'; Art. I, 2 [but see Amendment XIV, 2], vesting in Congress the duty of apportionment of representatives among the several states `according to their respective Numbers'; and Art. I, 5, making each House the sole judge of the qualifications of its own members, would remove the issues in this case from justiciable cognizance. But, in my judgment, the Smiley case rules squarely to the contrary, save only in the matter of degree. . . . Assuming that that decision is to stand, I think . . . that its effect is to rule that this Court has power to afford relief in a case of this type as against the objection that the issues are not justiciable.\" \n328 \nU.S., at 564\n-565. Accordingly, Mr. Justice Rutledge joined in the conclusion that the case was justiciable, although he held that the dismissal of the complaint should be affirmed. His view was that \"The shortness of the time remaining [before forthcoming elections] makes it doubtful whether action could, or would, be taken in time to secure for petitioners the effective relief they seek. . . . I think, therefore, the case is one in which the Court may properly, and should, decline to exercise its jurisdiction. Accordingly, the judgment should be affirmed and I join in that disposition of the cause.\" \n328 \nU.S., at 565\n-566.\n59\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 234]\n\u00a0\n\n\nArticle I, 2, 4, and 5, and Amendment XIV, 2, relate only to congressional elections and obviously do not govern apportionment of state legislatures. However, our decisions in favor of justiciability even in light of those provisions plainly afford no support for the District Court's conclusion that the subject matter of this controversy presents a political question. Indeed, the refusal to award relief in Colegrove resulted only from the controlling view of a want of equity. Nor is anything contrary to be found in those per curiams that came after Colegrove. This Court dismissed the appeals in Cook v. Fortson and Turman v. Duckworth, \n329 \nU.S. 675\n, as moot. MacDougall v. Green, \n335 \nU.S. 281\n, held only that in that case equity would not act to void the State's requirement that there be at least a minimum of support for nominees \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 235]\n\u00a0\n for state-wide office, over at least a minimal area of the State. Problems of timing were critical in Remmey v. Smith, \n342 \nU.S. 916\n, dismissing for want of a substantial federal question a three-judge court's dismissal of the suit as prematurely brought, 102 F. Supp. 708; and in Hartsfield v. Sloan, \n357 \nU.S. 916\n, denying mandamus sought to compel the convening of a three-judge court - movants urged the Court to advance consideration of their case, \"Inasmuch as the mere lapse of time before this case can be reached in the normal course of . . . business may defeat the cause, and inasmuch as the time problem is due to the inherent nature of the case . . . .\" South v. Peters, \n339 \nU.S. 276\n, like Colegrove appears to be a refusal to exercise equity's powers; see the statement of the holding, quoted, supra, p. 203. And Cox v. Peters, \n342 \nU.S. 936\n, dismissed for want of a substantial federal question the appeal from the state court's holding that their primary elections implicated no \"state action.\" See 208 Ga. 498, 67 S. E. 2d 579. But compare Terry v. Adams, \n345 \nU.S. 461\n.\n\nTedesco v. Board of Supervisors, \n339 \nU.S. 940\n, indicates solely that no substantial federal question was raised by a state court's refusal to upset the districting of city council seats, especially as it was urged that there was a rational justification for the challenged districting. See 43 So.2d 514. Similarly, in Anderson v. Jordan, \n343 \nU.S. 912\n, it was certain only that the state court had refused to issue a discretionary writ, original mandamus in the Supreme Court. That had been denied without opinion, and of course it was urged here that an adequate state ground barred this Court's review. And in Kidd v. McCanless, 200 Tenn. 273, 292 S. W. 2d 40, the Supreme Court of Tennessee held that it could not invalidate the very statute at issue in the case at bar, but its holding rested on its state law of remedies, i. e., the state view of \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 236]\n\u00a0\n de facto officers,\n60\n and not on any view that the norm for legislative apportionment in Tennessee is not numbers of qualified voters resident in the several counties. Of course this Court was there precluded by the adequate state ground, and in dismissing the appeal, \n352 \nU.S. 920\n, we cited Anderson, supra, as well as Colegrove. Nor does the Tennessee court's decision in that case bear upon this, for just as in Smith v. Holm, 220 Minn. 486, 19 N. W. 2d 914, and Magraw v. Donovan, 163 F. Supp. 184, 177 F. Supp. 803, a state court's inability to grant relief does not bar a federal court's assuming jurisdiction to inquire into alleged deprivation of federal constitutional rights. Problems of relief also controlled in Radford v. Gary, \n352 \nU.S. 991\n, affirming the District Court's refusal to mandamus the Governor to call a session of the legislature, to mandamus the legislature then to apportion, and if they did not comply, to mandamus the State Supreme Court to do so. And Matthews v. Handley, \n361 \nU.S. 127\n, affirmed a refusal to strike down the State's gross income tax statute - urged on the ground that the legislature was malapportioned - that had rested on the adequacy of available state legal remedies for suits involving that tax, including challenges to its constitutionality. Lastly, Colegrove v. Barrett, \n330 \nU.S. 804\n, in which Mr. Justice Rutledge concurred in this Court's refusal to note the appeal from a dismissal for want of equity, is sufficiently explained by his statement in Cook v. Fortson, supra: \"The discretionary exercise or nonexercise of equitable or declaratory judgment jurisdiction . . . in one case is not precedent in another case \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 237]\n\u00a0\n where the facts differ.\" \n329 \nU.S., at 678\n, n. 8. (Citations omitted.)\n\nWe conclude that the complaint's allegations of a denial of equal protection present a justiciable constitutional cause of action upon which appellants are entitled to a trial and a decision. The right asserted is within the reach of judicial protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe judgment of the District Court is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE WHITTAKER did not participate in the decision of this case.\n\n   APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT.\n\n\n The Tennessee Code Annotated provides for representation in the General Assembly as follows:\n\n\"3-101.

For example:\n\n(1) In 1957, Shelby County was raised from 7 1\/2 to 8 representatives. Acts of 1957, c. 220. See also Acts of 1959, c. 213. The 1957 Act, 2, abolished the Twenty-seventh Joint Representative District, which had included Shelby and Fayette Counties.\n\n(2) In 1907, Marion County was given a whole House seat instead of sharing a joint seat with Franklin County. Acts of 1907, c. 178. Acts of 1915, c. 145, repealed that change, restoring the status quo ante. And that reversal was itself reversed, Acts of 1919, c. 147.\n\n(3) James County was in 1901 one of five counties in the Seventh State Senate District and one of the three in the Ninth House District. It appears that James County no longer exists but we are not advised when or how it was dissolved.\n\n(4) In 1945, Anderson and Roane Counties were shifted to the Sixth State Senate District from the Seventh, and Monroe and Polk Counties were shifted to the Seventh from the Sixth. Acts of 1945, c. 11.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Public Acts of Tennessee, c. 122 (1901), now Tenn. Code Ann. 3-101 to 3-107. The full text of the 1901 Act as amended appears in an Appendix to this opinion, post, p. 237.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The three-judge court was convened pursuant to the order of a single district judge, who, after he had reviewed certain decisions of this Court and found them distinguishable in features \"that may ultimately prove to be significant,\" held that the complaint was not so obviously without merit that he would be justified in refusing to convene a three-judge court. 175 F. Supp. 649, 652.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] We heard argument first at the 1960 Term and again at this Term when the case was set over for reargument. \n366 \nU.S. 907\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] A county having less than, but at least two-thirds of, the population required to choose a Representative is allocated one Representative. See also Tenn. Const., Art. II, 6. A common and much more substantial departure from the number-of-voters or total-population standard is the guaranty of at least one seat to each county. See, e. g., Kansas Const., Art. 2, 2; N. J. Const., Art. 4, 3, \u00a7 1.\n\nWhile the Tennessee Constitution speaks of the number of \"qualified voters,\" the exhibits attached to the complaint use figures based on the number of persons 21 years of age and over. This basis seems to have been employed by the General Assembly in apportioning legislative seats from the outset. The 1870 statute providing for the first enumeration, Acts of 1870 (1st Sess.), c. 107, directed the courts of \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 190]\n\u00a0\n the several counties to select a Commissioner to enumerate \"all the male inhabitants of their respective counties, who are twenty-one years of age and upward, who shall be resident citizens of their counties on the first day of January, 1871 . . . .\" Reports compiled in the several counties on this basis were submitted to the General Assembly by the Secretary of State and were used in the first apportionment. Appendix to Tenn. S. J., 1871, 41-43. Yet such figures would not reflect the numbers of persons qualified to exercise the franchise under the then-governing qualifications: (a) citizenship; (b) residence in the State 12 months, and in the county 6 months; (c) payment of poll taxes for the preceding year unless entitled to exemption. Acts of 1870 (2d Sess.), c. 10. (These qualifications continued at least until after 1901. See Shan. Tenn. Code Ann., 1167, 1220 (1896; Supp. 1904).) Still, when the General Assembly directed the Secretary of State to do all he could to obtain complete reports from the counties, the Resolution spoke broadly of \"the impossibility of . . . [redistricting] without the census returns of the voting population from each county . . . .\" Tenn. S. J., 1871, 46-47, 96. The figures also showed a correlation with Federal Census figures for 1870. The Census reported 259,016 male citizens 21 and upward in Tennessee. Ninth Census of the United States, 1870, Statistics of the Population 635 (1872). The Tennessee Secretary of State's Report, with 15 counties not reported, gave a figure of 237,431. Using the numbers of actual votes in the last gubernatorial election for those 15 counties, the Secretary arrived at a total of 250,025. Appendix to Tenn. S. J., 1871, 41-43. This and subsequent history indicate continued reference to Census figures and finally in 1901, abandonment of a state enumeration in favor of the use of Census figures. See notes 7, 8, 9, infra. See also Williams, Legislative Apportionment in Tennessee, 20 Tenn. L. Rev. 235, 236, n. 6. It would therefore appear that unless there is a contrary showing at the trial, appellant's current figures, taken from the United States Census Reports, are apposite.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Acts of 1871 (1st Sess.), c. 146.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Acts of 1870 (1st Sess.), c. 107.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The statute authorizing the enumeration was Acts of 1881 (1st Sess.), c. 124. The enumeration commissioners in the counties were allowed \"access to the U.S. Census Reports of the enumeration of 1880, on file in the offices of the County Court Clerks of the State, and a reference to said reports by said commissioners shall be legitimate as an auxiliary in the enumeration required . . . .\" Ibid., 4.\n\nThe United States Census reported 330,305 male citizens 21 and upward in Tennessee. The Tenth Census of the United States, 1880, Compendium 596 (1883). The Tennessee Secretary of State's Report gave a figure of 343,817, Tenn. H. J. (1st Extra. Sess.), 1881, 12-14 (1882).\n\nThe General Assembly was enlarged in accordance with the constitutional mandate since the State's population had passed 1,500,000. Acts of 1881 (1st Extra. Sess.), c. 5; and see, id., S. J. Res. No. III; see also Tenth Census of the United States, 1880, Statistics of the Population 77 (1881).

Reference to United States Census figures was allowed just as in 1881, see supra, n. 7. The United States Census reported 402,476 males 21 and over in Tennessee. The Eleventh Census of the United States, 1890, Population (Part I) 781 (1895). The Tennessee Secretary of State's Report gave a figure of 399,575. 1 Tenn. S.

The Joint Resolution said: \"The Federal census of 1900 has been very recently taken and by reference to said Federal census an accurate enumeration of the qualified voters of the respective counties of the State of Tennessee can be ascertained and thereby save the expense of an actual enumeration . . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] For the history of legislative apportionment in Tennessee, including attempts made since 1901, see Tenn. S. J., 1959, 909-930; \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 192]\n\u00a0\n and \"A Documented Survey of Legislative Apportionment in Tennessee, 1870-1957,\" which is attached as exhibit 2 to the intervening complaint of Mayor West of Nashville, both prepared by the Tennessee State Historian, Dr. Robert H. White. Examples of preliminary steps are: In 1911, the Senate called upon the Redistricting Committee to make an enumeration of qualified voters and to use the Federal Census of 1910 as the basis. Acts of 1911, S. J. Res. No. 60, p. 315. Similarly, in 1961, the Senate called for appointment of a select committee to make an enumeration of qualified voters. Acts of 1961, S. J. Res. No. 47. In 1955, the Senate called for a study of reapportionment. Tenn. S. J., 1955, 224; but see id., at 1403. Similarly, in 1961, the House directed the State Legislative Council to study methods of reapportionment. Acts of 1961, H. J. Res. No. 65.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] Twelfth Census of the United States, 1900, Population (Part 1) 39 (1901); (Part 2) 202 (1902).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] United States Census of Population: 1960, General Population Characteristics - Tennessee, Table 16 (1961).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] In the words of one of the intervening complaints, the apportionment was \"wholly arbitrary, . . . and, indeed, based upon no lawfully pertinent factor whatever.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] The appellants claim that no General Assembly constituted according to the 1901 Act will submit reapportionment proposals either to the people or to a Constitutional Convention. There is no provision for popular initiative in Tennessee. Amendments proposed in the Senate or House must first be approved by a majority of all members of each House and again by two-thirds of the members in the General Assembly next chosen. The proposals are then submitted to the people at the next general election in which a Governor is to be chosen. Alternatively, the legislature may submit to the people at any general election the question of calling a convention to consider specified proposals. Such as are adopted at a convention do not, however, become effective unless approved by a majority of the qualified voters voting separately on each proposed change or amendment at an election fixed by the convention. Conventions shall not be held oftener than once in six years. Tenn. Const., Art. XI, 3. Acts of 1951, c. 130, 3, and Acts of 1957, c. 340, 3, provided that delegates to the 1953 and 1959 conventions were to be chosen from the counties and floterial districts just as are members of the State House of Representatives. The General Assembly's call for a 1953 Constitutional Convention originally contained a provision \"relating to the appointment [sic] of representatives and senators\" but this was excised. Tenn. H. J., 1951, 784. A Resolution introduced at the 1959 Constitutional Convention and reported unfavorably by the Rules Committee of the Convention was as follows:\n\n\"By Mr. Chambliss (of Hamilton County), Resolution No. 12 - Relative to Convention considering reapportionment, which is as follows:\n\n\n\"WHEREAS, there is a rumor that this Limited Convention has been called for the purpose of postponing for six years a Convention that would make a decision as to reapportionment; and \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 194]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"WHEREAS, there is pending in the United States Courts in Tennessee a suit under which parties are seeking, through decree, to compel reapportionment; and\n\n\n\"WHEREAS, it is said that this Limited Convention, which was called for limited consideration, is yet a Constitutional Convention within the language of the Constitution as to Constitutional Conventions, forbidding frequent Conventions in the last sentence of Article Eleven, Section 3, second paragraph, more often than each six years, to-wit:\n\n\n\"`No such Convention shall be held oftener than once in six years.'\n\n\n\"NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, That it is the consensus of opinion of the members of this Convention that since this is a Limited Convention as hereinbefore set forth another Convention could be had if it did not deal with the matters submitted to this Limited Convention.\n\n\n\"BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That it is the consensus of opinion of this Convention that a Convention should be called by the General Assembly for the purpose of considering reapportionment in order that a possibility of Court enforcement being forced on the Sovereign State of Tennessee by the Courts of the National Government may be avoided.\n\n\n\"BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That this Convention be adjourned for two years to meet again at the same time set forth in the statute providing for this Convention, and that it is the consensus of opinion of this body that it is within the power of the next General Assembly of Tennessee to broaden the powers of this Convention and to authorize and empower this Convention to consider a proper amendment to the Constitution that will provide, when submitted to the electorate, a method of reapportionment.\" Tenn. Constitutional Convention of 1959, The Journal and Debates, 35, 278.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] It is clear that appellants' federal constitutional claims rest exclusively on alleged violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Their primary claim is that the 1901 statute violates the Equal Protection Clause of that amendment. There are allegations invoking the Due Process Clause but from the argument and the exhibits it appears that the Due Process Clause argument is directed at certain tax statutes. Insofar as the claim involves the validity of those statutes \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 195]\n\u00a0\n under the Due Process Clause we find it unnecessary to decide its merits. And if the allegations regarding the tax statutes are designed as the framework for proofs as to the effects of the allegedly discriminatory apportionment, we need not rely upon them to support our holding that the complaint states a federal constitutional claim of violation of the Equal Protection Clause. Whether, when the issue to be decided is one of the constitutional adequacy of this particular apportionment, taxation arguments and exhibits as now presented add anything, or whether they could add anything however presented, is for the District Court in the first instance to decide.\n\nThe complaint, in addition to the claims under the Federal Constitution, also alleges rights, and the General Assembly's duties, under the Tennessee Constitution. Since we hold that appellants have - if it develops at trial that the facts support the allegations - a cognizable federal constitutional cause of action resting in no degree on rights guaranteed or putatively guaranteed by the Tennessee Constitution, we do not consider, let alone enforce, rights under a State Constitution which go further than the protections of the Fourteenth Amendment. Lastly, we need not assess the legal significance, in reaching our conclusion, of the statements of the complaint that the apportionment effected today under the 1901 Act is \"contrary to the philosophy of government in the United States and all Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence . . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] We need not reach the question of indispensable parties because the District Court has not yet decided it.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] The accuracy of calling even such dismissals \"jurisdictional\" was questioned in Bell v. Hood. See \n327 \nU.S., at 683\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] 42 U.S.C. 1983 provides: \"Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] This Court has frequently sustained District Court jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1343 (3) or its predecessors to entertain suits to redress deprivations of rights secured against state infringement by the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 201]\n\u00a0\n Amendment. Douglas v. Jeannette, \n319 \nU.S. 157\n; Stefanelli v. Minard, \n342 \nU.S. 117\n; cf. Nixon v. Herndon, \n273 \nU.S. 536\n; Nixon v. Condon, \n286 \nU.S. 73\n; Snowden v. Hughes, \n321 \nU.S. 1\n; Smith v. Allwright, \n321 \nU.S. 649\n; Monroe v. Pape, \n365 \nU.S. 167\n; Egan v. Aurora, \n365 \nU.S. 514\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] Since that case was not brought to the Court until after the election had been held, the Court cited not only Wood v. Broom, but also directed dismissal for mootness, citing Brownlow v. Schwartz, \n261 \nU.S. 216\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 21\n] Compare Boeing Aircraft Co. v. King County, \n330 \nU.S. 803\n (\"the appeal is dismissed for want of jurisdiction\"). See Coleman v. Miller, \n307 \nU.S. 433, 440\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 22\n] Matthews did affirm a judgment that may be read as a dismissal for want of jurisdiction, 179 F. Supp. 470. However, the motion to affirm also rested on the ground of failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Cf. text following, on MacDougall v. Green. And see text, infra, p. 236.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 23\n] The Mayor of Nashville suing \"on behalf of himself and all residents of the City of Nashville, Davidson County, . . .\" and the Cities of Chattanooga (Hamilton County) and Knoxville (Knox County), each suing on behalf of its residents, were permitted to intervene as parties plaintiff. Since they press the same claims as do the initial plaintiffs, we find it unnecessary to decide whether the intervenors would have standing to maintain this action in their asserted representative capacities.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 24\n] The complaint also contains an averment that the appellants sue \"on their own behalf and on behalf of all other voters in the State of Tennessee.\" (Emphasis added.) This may be read to assert a claim that voters in counties allegedly over-represented in the General Assembly also have standing to complain. But it is not necessary to decide that question in this case.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 25\n] The duties of the respective appellees are alleged to be as follows:\n\n\"Defendant, Joe C. Carr, is the duly elected, qualified and acting Secretary of State of the State of Tennessee, with his office in Nashville in said State, and as such he is charged with the duty of furnishing blanks, envelopes and information slips to the County Election Commissioners, certifying the results of elections and maintaining the records thereof; and he is further ex officio charged, together with the Governor and the Attorney General, with the duty of examining the election returns received from the County Election Commissioners and declaring the election results, by the applicable provisions of the Tennessee Code Annotated, and by Chapter 164 of the Acts of 1949, inter alia.\n\n\n\"Defendant, George F. McCanless, is the duly appointed and acting Attorney General of the State of Tennessee, with his office in Nashville in said State, and is charged with the duty of advising the officers of the State upon the law, and is made by Section 23-1107 of the Tennessee Code Annotated a necessary party defendant in any declaratory judgment action where the constitutionality of statutes of the State of Tennessee is attacked, and he is ex-officio charged, together with the Governor and the Secretary of State, with the duty of declaring the election results, under Section 2-140 of the Tennessee Code Annotated.\n\n\n\"Defendant, Jerry McDonald, is the duly appointed Coordinator of Elections in the State of Tennessee, with his office in Nashville, Tennessee, and as such official, is charged with the duties set forth in the public law enacted by the 1959 General Assembly of Tennessee creating said office.\n\n\n\"Defendant, Dr. Sam Coward, James Alexander, and Hubert Brooks are the duly appointed and qualified members constituting \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 206]\n\u00a0\n the State Board of Elections, and as such they are charged with the duty of appointing the Election Commissioners for all the counties of the State of Tennessee, the organization and supervision of the biennial elections as provided by the Statutes of Tennessee, Chapter 9 of Title 2 of the Tennessee Code Annotated, Sections 2-901, et seq.\n\n\n\"That this action is brought against the aforenamed defendants in their representative capacities, and that said Election Commissioners are sued also as representatives of all of the County Election Commissioners in the State of Tennessee, such persons being so numerous as to make it impracticable to bring them all before the court; that there is a common question of law involved, namely, the constitutionality of Tennessee laws set forth in the Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 3-101 through Section 3-109, inclusive; that common relief is sought against all members of said Election Commissions in their official capacities, it being the duties of the aforesaid County Election Commissioners, within their respective jurisdictions, to appoint the judges of elections, to maintain the registry of qualified voters of said County, certify the results of elections held in said County to the defendants State Board of Elections and Secretary of State, and of preparing ballots and taking other steps to prepare for and hold elections in said Counties by virtue of Sections 2-1201, et seq. of Tennessee Code Annotated, and Section 2-301, et seq. of Tennessee Code Annotated, and Chapter 164 of the Acts of 1949, inter alia.\"\n\n\n The question whether the named defendants are sufficient parties remains open for consideration on remand.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 26\n] Smiley v. Holm, supra, at 361 (\"`citizen, elector and taxpayer' of the State\"); Koenig v. Flynn, supra, at 379 (\"`citizens and voters' of the State\") Wood v. Broom, supra, at 4 (\"citizen of Mississippi, a qualified elector under its laws, and also qualified to be a candidate for election as representative in Congress\"); cf. Carroll v. Becker, supra (candidate for office).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 27\n] Mr. Justice Rutledge was of the view that any question of standing was settled in Smiley v. Holm, supra; MR. JUSTICE BLACK stated \"that appellants had standing to sue, since the facts alleged show that \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 207]\n\u00a0\n they have been injured as individuals.\" He relied on Coleman v. Miller, \n307 \nU.S. 433, 438\n, 467. See \n328 \nU.S. 564, 568\n.\n\nCommentators have suggested that the following statement in MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER'S opinion might imply a view that appellants there had no standing: \"This is not an action to recover for damage because of the discriminatory exclusion of a plaintiff from rights enjoyed by other citizens. The basis for the suit is not a private wrong, but a wrong suffered by Illinois as a polity.\" \n328 \nU.S., at 552\n. See Jaffe, Standing to Secure Judicial Review: Public Actions, 74 Harv. L. Rev. 1265, 1298 (1961); Lewis, Legislative Apportionment and the Federal Courts, 71 Harv. L. Rev. 1057, 1081-1083 (1958). But since the opinion goes on to consider the merits, it seems that this statement was not intended to intimate any view that the plaintiffs in that action lacked standing. Nor do the cases cited immediately after the above quotation deal with standing. See especially Lane v. Wilson, \n307 \nU.S. 268, 272\n-273.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 28\n] MacDougall v.

Braden, 16 How. 635, 657.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 43\n] This case, so frequently cited for the broad proposition that the status of an Indian tribe is a matter for the political departments, is in fact a noteworthy example of the limited and precise impact of a political question. The Cherokees brought an original suit in this Court to enjoin Georgia's assertion of jurisdiction over Cherokee territory and abolition of Cherokee government and laws. Unquestionably the case lay at the vortex of most fiery political embroilment. See 1 Warren, The Supreme Court in United States History (Rev. ed.), 729-779. But in spite of some broader language in separate opinions, all that the Court held was that it possessed no original jurisdiction over the suit: for the Cherokees could in no view be considered either a State of this Union or a \"foreign state.\" Chief Justice Marshall treated the question as one of de novo interpretation of words in the Constitution. The Chief Justice did say that \"The acts of our government plainly recognize the Cherokee nation \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 216]\n\u00a0\n as a state, and the courts are bound by those acts,\" but here he referred to their existence \"as a state, as a distinct political society, separated from others . . . .\" From there he went to \"A question of much more difficulty . . . . Do the Cherokees constitute a foreign state in the sense of the constitution?\" Id., at 16. Thus, while the Court referred to \"the political\" for the decision whether the tribe was an entity, a separate polity, it held that whether being an entity the tribe had such status as to be entitled to sue originally was a judicially soluble issue: criteria were discoverable in relevant phrases of the Constitution and in the common understanding of the times. As to this issue, the Court was not hampered by problems of the management of unusual evidence or of possible interference with a congressional program. Moreover, Chief Justice Marshall's dictum that \"It savours too much of the exercise of political power to be within the proper province of the judicial department,\" id., at 20, was not addressed to the issue of the Cherokees' status to sue, but rather to the breadth of the claim asserted and the impropriety of the relief sought. Compare Georgia v. Stanton, 6 Wall. 50, 77. The Chief Justice made clear that if the issue of the Cherokees' rights arose in a customary legal context, \"a proper case with proper parties,\" it would be justiciable. Thus, when the same dispute produced a case properly brought, in which the right asserted was one of protection under federal treaties and laws from conflicting state law, and the relief sought was the voiding of a conviction under that state law, the Court did void the conviction. Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515. There, the fact that the tribe was a separate polity served as a datum contributing to the result, and despite the consequences in a heated federal-state controversy and the opposition of the other branches of the National Government, the judicial power acted to reverse the State Supreme Court. An example of similar isolation of a political question in the decision of a case is Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1, see infra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 44\n] 7 How., at 29. And see 11 The Writings and Speeches of Daniel Webster 217 (1903).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 45\n] See Mowry, The Dorr War (1901), and its exhaustive bibliography. And for an account of circumstances surrounding the decision here, see 2 Warren, The Supreme Court in United States History (Rev. ed.), 185-195.\n\nDorr himself, head of one of the two groups and held in a Rhode Island jail under a conviction for treason, had earlier sought a decision from the Supreme Court that his was the lawful government. His application for original habeas corpus in the Supreme Court was \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 219]\n\u00a0\n denied because the federal courts then lacked authority to issue habeas for a prisoner held under a state court sentence. Ex parte Dorr, 3 How. 103.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 46\n] 7 How., at 39.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 47\n] Id., at 39, 40.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 48\n] Even though the Court wrote of unrestrained legislative and executive authority under this Guaranty, thus making its enforcement a political question, the Court plainly implied that the political question barrier was no absolute: \"Unquestionably a military government, established as the permanent government of the State, would not be a republican government, and it would be the duty of Congress to overthrow it.\" 7 How., at 45. Of course, it does not necessarily follow that if Congress did not act, the Court would. For while the judiciary might be able to decide the limits of the meaning of \"republican form,\" and thus the factor of lack of criteria might fall away, there would remain other possible barriers to decision because of primary commitment to another branch, which would have to be considered in the particular fact setting presented.\n\nThat was not the only occasion on which this Court indicated that lack of criteria does not obliterate the Guaranty's extreme limits: \"The guaranty is of a republican form of government. No particular government is designated as republican, neither is the exact form to be guaranteed, in any manner especially designated. Here, as in other parts of the instrument, we are compelled to resort elsewhere to ascertain what was intended.\n\n\"The guaranty necessarily implies a duty on the part of the States themselves to provide such a government. All the States had governments when the Constitution was adopted. In all the people participated to some extent, through their representatives elected in the manner specially provided. These governments the Constitution did not change. They were accepted precisely as they were, and it \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 223]\n\u00a0\n is, therefore, to be presumed that they were such as it was the duty of the States to provide. Thus we have unmistakable evidence of what was republican in form, within the meaning of that term as employed in the Constitution.\" Minor v. Happersett, 21 Wall. 162, 175-176. There, the question was whether a government republican in form could deny the vote to women.\n\n\n In re Duncan, \n139 \nU.S. 449\n, upheld a murder conviction against a claim that the relevant codes had been invalidly enacted. The Court there said:\n\n\"By the Constitution, a republican form of government is guaranteed to every State in the Union, and the distinguishing feature of that form is the right of the people to choose their own officers for governmental administration, and pass their own laws in virtue of the legislative power reposed in representative bodies, whose legitimate acts may be said to be those of the people themselves; but, while the people are thus the source of political power, their governments, National and State, have been limited by written constitutions, and they have themselves thereby set bounds to their own power, as against the sudden impulses of mere majorities.\" \n139 \nU.S., at 461\n. But the Court did not find any of these fundamental principles violated.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 49\n] But cf. Hawke v. Smith (No. 1), \n253 \nU.S. 221\n; National Prohibition Cases, \n253 \nU.S. 350\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 50\n] 6 Wall., at 65, 66.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 51\n] The First Reconstruction Act opened: \"Whereas no legal State governments . . . now exists [sic] in the rebel States of . . . Georgia [and] Mississippi . . .; and whereas it is necessary that peace and good order should be enforced in said States until loyal and republican State governments can be legally established: . . .\" 14 Stat. 428. And see 15 Stat. 2, 14.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 52\n] In Mississippi v. Johnson, 4 Wall. 475, the State sought to enjoin the President from executing the Acts, alleging that his role was purely ministerial. The Court held that the duties were in no sense ministerial, and that although the State sought to compel inaction rather than action, the absolute lack of precedent for any such distinction left the case one in which \"general principles . . . forbid judicial interference with the exercise of Executive discretion.\" 4 Wall., at 499. See also Mississippi v. Stanton, \n154 \nU.S. 554\n; and see 2 Warren, The Supreme Court in United States History (Rev. ed.), 463.\n\nFor another instance of congressional action challenged as transgressing the Guaranty Clause, see The Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113, 125-126, overruled, Graves v. O'Keefe, \n306 \nU.S. 466\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 53\n] On the other hand, the implication of the Guaranty Clause in a case concerning congressional action does not always preclude judicial action. It has been held that the clause gives Congress no power to impose restrictions upon a State's admission which would undercut the constitutional mandate that the State be on an equal footing. Coyle v. Smith, \n221 \nU.S. 559\n. And in Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700, although Congress had determined that the State's government was not republican in form, the State's standing to bring an original action in this Court was sustained.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 54\n] See, infra, p. 235, considering Kidd v. McCanless, \n352 \nU.S. 920\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 55\n] Boyd v. Nebraska ex rel. Thayer, \n143 \nU.S. 135, 183\n (Field, J., dissenting).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 56\n] Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 270 F.2d 594, relying upon, inter alia, Hunter v. Pittsburgh, \n207 \nU.S. 161\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 57\n] The Court's opinion was joined by MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, noting his adherence to the dissents in Colegrove and South v. Peters, supra; and the judgment was concurred in by MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER, who wrote that the decision should rest on the Equal Protection Clause rather than on the Fifteenth Amendment, since there had been not solely a denial of the vote (if there had been that at all) but also a \"fencing out\" of a racial group.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 58\n] No holding to the contrary is to be found in Cave v. Newell, \n246 \nU.S. 650\n, dismissing a writ of error to the Supreme Court of Missouri, 272 Mo. 653, 199 S. W. 1014; or in Snowden v. Hughes, \n321 \nU.S. 1\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 59\n] The ground of Mr. Justice Rutledge's vote to affirm is further explained in his footnote 3, \n328 \nU.S., at 566\n: \"`The power of a court of equity to act is a discretionary one. . . . Where a federal court of equity is asked to interfere with the enforcement of state laws, it should do so only \"to prevent irreparable injury which is clear and \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 234]\n\u00a0\n imminent.\"' American Federation of Labor v. Watson, \n327 \nU.S. 582, 593\n and cases cited.\"\n\nNo constitutional questions, including the question whether voters have a judicially enforceable constitutional right to vote at elections of congressmen from districts of equal population, were decided in Colegrove. Six of the participating Justices reached the questions but divided three to three on their merits. Mr. Justice Rutledge believed that it was not necessary to decide them. He said: \"There is [an alternative to constitutional decision] in this case. And I think the gravity of the constitutional questions raised so great, together with the possibilities for collision [with the political departments of the Government], that the admonition [against avoidable constitutional decision] is appropriate to be followed here. Other reasons support this view, including the fact that, in my opinion, the basic ruling and less important ones in Smiley v. Holm, supra, would otherwise be brought into question.\" \n328 \nU.S., at 564\n-565. He also joined with his brethren who shared his view that the issues were justiciable in considering that Wood v. Broom, \n287 \nU.S. 1\n, decided no constitutional questions but \"the Court disposed of the cause on the ground that the 1929 Reapportionment Act, 46 Stat. 21, did not carry forward the requirements of the 1911 Act, 37 Stat. 13, and declined to decide whether there was equity in the bill.\" \n328 \nU.S., at 565\n; see also, id., at 573. We agree with this view of Wood v. Broom.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 60\n] See also Buford v. State Board of Elections, 206 Tenn. 480, 334 S. W. 2d 726; State ex rel. Sanborn v. Davidson County Board of Election Comm'rs, No. 36,391 Tenn. Sup. Ct., Oct. 29, 1954 (unreported); 8 Vand. L. Rev. 501 (1955).\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, concurring.\n\nWhile I join the opinion of the Court and, like the Court, do not reach the merits, a word of explanation is necessary.\n1\n I put to one side the problems of \"political\" \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 242]\n\u00a0\n questions involving the distribution of power between this Court, the Congress, and the Chief Executive. We have here a phase of the recurring problem of the relation of the federal courts to state agencies. More particularly, the question is the extent to which a State may weight one person's vote more heavily than it does another's.\n\nSo far as voting rights are concerned, there are large gaps in the Constitution. Yet the right to vote is inherent in the republican form of government envisaged by Article IV, Section 4 of the Constitution. The House - and now the Senate - are chosen by the people. The time, manner, and place of elections of Senators and Representatives are left to the States (Article I, Section 4, Clause 1; Amendment XVII) subject to the regulatory power of Congress. A \"republican form\" of government is guaranteed each State by Article IV, Section 4, and each is likewise promised protection against invasion.\n2\n Ibid. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 243]\n\u00a0\n That the States may specify the qualifications for voters is implicit in Article I, Section 2, Clause 1, which provides that the House of Representatives shall be chosen by the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 244]\n\u00a0\n people and that \"the Electors (voters) in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors (voters) of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature.\" The same provision, contained in the Seventeenth Amendment, governs the election of Senators. Within limits those qualifications may be fixed by state law. See Lassiter v. Northampton Election Board, \n360 \nU.S. 45, 50\n-51. Yet, as stated in Ex parte Yarbrough, \n110 \nU.S. 651, 663\n-664, those who vote for members of Congress do not \"owe their right to vote to the State law in any sense which makes the exercise of the right to depend exclusively on the law of the State.\" The power of Congress to prescribe the qualifications for voters and thus override state law is not in issue here. It is, however, clear that by reason of the commands of the Constitution there are several qualifications that a State may not require.\n\nRace, color, or previous condition of servitude is an impermissible standard by reason of the Fifteenth Amendment, and that alone is sufficient to explain Gomillion v. Lightfoot, \n364 \nU.S. 339\n. See Taper, Gomillion versus Lightfoot (1962), pp. 12-17.\n\nSex is another impermissible standard by reason of the Nineteenth Amendment.\n\nThere is a third barrier to a State's freedom in prescribing qualifications of voters and that is the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the provision invoked here. And so the question is, may a State weight the vote of one county or one district more heavily than it weights the vote in another?\n\nThe traditional test under the Equal Protection Clause has been whether a State has made \"an invidious discrimination,\" as it does when it selects \"a particular race or nationality for oppressive treatment.\" See Skinner v. Oklahoma, \n316 \nU.S. 535, 541\n. Universal equality is not \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 245]\n\u00a0\n the test; there is room for weighting. As we stated in Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., \n348 \nU.S. 483, 489\n, \"The prohibition of the Equal Protection Clause goes no further than the invidious discrimination.\"\n\nI agree with my Brother CLARK that if the allegations in the complaint can be sustained a case for relief is established. We are told that a single vote in Moore County, Tennessee, is worth 19 votes in Hamilton County, that one vote in Stewart or in Chester County is worth nearly eight times a single vote in Shelby or Knox County. The opportunity to prove that an \"invidious discrimination\" exists should therefore be given the appellants.\n\nIt is said that any decision in cases of this kind is beyond the competence of courts. Some make the same point as regards the problem of equal protection in cases involving racial segregation. Yet the legality of claims and conduct is a traditional subject for judicial determination. Adjudication is often perplexing and complicated. An example of the extreme complexity of the task can be seen in a decree apportioning water among the several States. Nebraska v. Wyoming, \n325 \nU.S. 589, 665\n. The constitutional guide is often vague, as the decisions under the Due Process and Commerce Clauses show. The problem under the Equal Protection Clause is no more intricate. See Lewis, Legislative Apportionment and the Federal Courts, 71 Harv. L. Rev. 1057, 1083-1084.\n\nThere are, of course, some questions beyond judicial competence. Where the performance of a \"duty\" is left to the discretion and good judgment of an executive officer, the judiciary will not compel the exercise of his discretion one way or the other (Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66, 109), for to do so would be to take over the office. Cf. Federal Communications Comm'n v. Broadcasting Co., \n309 \nU.S. 134, 145\n. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 246]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhere the Constitution assigns a particular function wholly and indivisibly\n3\n to another department, the federal judiciary does not intervene. Oetjen v. Central Leather Co., \n246 \nU.S. 297, 302\n. None of those cases is relevant here. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 247]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThere is no doubt that the federal courts have jurisdiction of controversies concerning voting rights. The Civil Rights Act gives them authority to redress the deprivation \"under color of any State law\" of any \"right, privilege or immunity secured by the Constitution of the United States or by any Act of Congress providing for equal rights of citizens . . . .\" 28 U.S.C. 1343 (3). And 28 U.S.C. 1343 (4) gives the federal courts authority to award damages or issue an injunction to redress the violation of \"any Act of Congress providing for the protection of civil rights, including the right to vote.\" (Italics added.) The element of state action covers a wide range. For as stated in United States v. Classic, \n313 \nU.S. 299, 326\n:\n\n\"Misuse of power, possessed by virtue of state law and made possible only because the wrongdoer is clothed with the authority of state law, is action taken `under color of' state law.\" And see Monroe v. Pape, \n365 \nU.S. 167\n.\n\n\n The right to vote in both federal and state elections was protected by the judiciary long before that right received the explicit protection it is now accorded by 1343 (4). Discrimination against a voter on account of race has been penalized (Ex parte Yarbrough, \n110 \nU.S. 651\n) or struck down. Nixon v. Herndon, \n273 \nU.S. 536\n; Smith v. Allwright, \n321 \nU.S. 649\n; Terry v. Adams, \n345 \nU.S. 461\n. Fraudulent acts that dilute the votes of some \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 248]\n\u00a0\n have long been held to be within judicial cognizance. Ex parte Siebold, \n100 \nU.S. 371\n. The \"right to have one's vote counted\" whatever his race or nationality or creed was held in United States v. Mosley, \n238 \nU.S. 383, 386\n, to be \"as open to protection by Congress as the right to put a ballot in a box.\" See also United States v. Classic, supra, 324-325; United States v. Saylor, \n322 \nU.S. 385\n.\n\nChief Justice Holt stated in Ashby v. White, 2 Ld. Raym. 938, 956 (a suit in which damages were awarded against election officials for not accepting the plaintiff's vote, 3 Ld. Raym. 320) that:\n\n\"To allow this action will make publick officers more careful to observe the constitution of cities and boroughs, and not to be so partial as they commonly are in all elections, which is indeed a great and growing mischief, and tends to the prejudice of the peace of the nation.\"\n\n\n The same prophylactic effect will be produced here, as entrenched political regimes make other relief as illusory in this case as a petition to Parliament in Ashby v. White would have been.\n4\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 249]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIntrusion of the Federal Government into the election machinery of the States has taken numerous forms - investigations (Hannah v. Larche, \n363 \nU.S. 420\n); criminal proceedings (Ex parte Siebold, supra; Ex parte Yarbrough, supra; United States v. Mosley, supra; United States v. Classic, supra); collection of penalties (Smith v. Allwright, supra); suits for declaratory relief and for an injunction (Terry v. Adams, supra); suits by the United States under the Civil Rights Act to enjoin discriminatory practices. United States v. Raines, \n362 \nU.S. 17\n.\n\nAs stated by Judge McLaughlin in Dyer v. Kazuhisa Abe, 138 F. Supp. 220, 236 (an apportionment case in Hawaii which was reversed and dismissed as moot, 256 F.2d 728):\n\n\"The whole thrust of today's legal climate is to end unconstitutional discrimination. It is ludicrous to preclude judicial relief when a mainspring of representative government is impaired. Legislators have no immunity from the Constitution. The legislatures of our land should be made as responsive to the Constitution of the United States as are the citizens who elect the legislators.\"\n\n\n With the exceptions of Colegrove v. Green, \n328 \nU.S. 549\n; MacDougall v. Green, \n335 \nU.S. 281\n; South v. Peters, \n339 \nU.S. 276\n, and the decisions they spawned, the Court has never thought that protection of voting rights \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 250]\n\u00a0\n was beyond judicial cognizance. Today's treatment of those cases removes the only impediment to judicial cognizance of the claims stated in the present complaint.\n\nThe justiciability of the present claims being established, any relief accorded can be fashioned in the light of well-known principles of equity.\n5\n\u00a0\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] I feel strongly that many of the cases cited by the Court and involving so-called \"political\" questions were wrongly decided.\n\nIn joining the opinion, I do not approve those decisions but only construe the Court's opinion in this case as stating an accurate historical account of what the prior cases have held.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The statements in Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1, 42, that this guaranty is enforceable only by Congress or the Chief Executive is not maintainable. Of course the Chief Executive, not the Court, determines how a State will be protected against invasion. Of course each House of Congress, not the Court, is \"the Judge of the Elections, Returns, and Qualifications of its own Members.\" Article I, Section 5, Clause 1. But the abdication of all judicial functions respecting voting rights (7 How., at 41), however justified by the peculiarities of the charter form of government in Rhode Island at the time of Dorr's Rebellion, states no general principle. It indeed is contrary to the cases discussed in the body of this opinion - the modern decisions of the Court that give the full panoply of judicial protection to voting rights. Today we would not say with Chief Justice Taney that it is no part of the judicial function to protect the right to vote of those \"to whom it is denied by the written and established constitution and laws of the State.\" Ibid.\n\nMoreover, the Court's refusal to examine the legality of the regime of martial law which had been laid upon Rhode Island (id., at 45-46) is indefensible, as Mr. Justice Woodbury maintained in his dissent. Id., at 59 et seq. Today we would ask with him: \". . . who \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 243]\n\u00a0\n could hold for a moment, when the writ of habeas corpus cannot be suspended by the legislature itself, either in the general government or most of the States, without an express constitutional permission, that all other writs and laws could be suspended, and martial law substituted for them over the whole State or country, without any express constitutional license to that effect, in any emergency?\" Id., at 67.\n\nJustice Woodbury went on to say:\n\n\"It would be alarming enough to sanction here an unlimited power, exercised either by legislatures, or the executive, or courts, when all our governments are themselves governments of limitations and checks, and of fixed and known laws, and the people a race above all others jealous of encroachments by those in power. And it is far better that those persons should be without the protection of the ordinary laws of the land who disregard them in an emergency, and should look to a grateful country for indemnity and pardon, than to allow, beforehand, the whole frame of jurisprudence to be overturned, and every thing placed at the mercy of the bayonet.\n\n\n\"No tribunal or department in our system of governments ever can be lawfully authorized to dispense with the laws, like some of the tyrannical Stuarts, or to repeal, or abolish, or suspend the whole body of them; or, in other words, appoint an unrestrained military dictator at the head of armed men.\n\n\n\"Whatever stretches of such power may be ventured on in great crises, they cannot be upheld by the laws, as they prostrate the laws and ride triumphant over and beyond them, however the Assembly of Rhode Island, under the exigency, may have hastily supposed that such a measure in this instance was constitutional. It is but a branch of the omnipotence claimed by Parliament to pass bills of attainder, belonging to the same dangerous and arbitrary family with martial law.\" Id., at 69-70.\n\n\n What he wrote was later to become the tradition, as expressed by Chief Justice Hughes in Sterling v. Constantin, \n287 \nU.S. 378, 401\n: \"What are the allowable limits of military discretion, and whether or not they have been overstepped in a particular case, are judicial questions.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The category of the \"political\" question is, in my view, narrower than the decided cases indicate. \"Even the English courts have held that a resolution of one House of Parliament does not change the law (Stockdale v. Hansard (1839), 9 A. & E. 1; and Bowles v. Bank of England (No. 2) 1913. 1 Ch. 57), and these decisions imply that the House of Commons acting alone does not constitute the `Parliament' recognized by the English courts.\" 103 Sol. Jour. 995, 996. The Court in Bowles v. Bank of England, 1913. 1 Ch. 57, 84-85, stated: \"By the statute 1 W. & M., usually known as the Bill of Rights, it was finally settled that there could be no taxation in this country except under authority of an Act of Parliament. The Bill of Rights still remains unrepealed, and no practice or custom, however prolonged, or however acquiesced in on the part of the subject, can be relied on by the Crown as justifying any infringement of its provisions. It follows that, with regard to the powers of the Crown to levy taxation, no resolution, either of the Committee for Ways and Means or of the House itself, has any legal effect whatever. Such resolutions are necessitated by a parliamentary procedure adopted with a view to the protection of the subject against the hasty imposition of taxes, and it would be strange to find them relied on as justifying the Crown in levying a tax before such tax is actually imposed by Act of Parliament.\"\n\nIn The Pocket Veto Case, \n279 \nU.S. 655\n, the Court undertook a review of the veto provisions of the Constitution and concluded that the measure in litigation had not become a law. Cf. Coleman v. Miller, \n307 \nU.S. 433\n.\n\nGeorgia v. Stanton, 6 Wall. 50, involved the application of the Reconstruction Acts to Georgia - laws which destroyed by force the internal regime of that State. Yet the Court refused to take jurisdiction. That question was no more \"political\" than a host of others we have entertained. See, e. g., Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, \n262 \nU.S. 553\n; Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, \n343 \nU.S. 579\n; Alabama v. Texas, \n347 \nU.S. 272\n. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 247]\n\u00a0\n\n\nToday would this Court hold nonjusticiable or \"political\" a suit to enjoin a Governor who, like Fidel Castro, takes everything into his own hands and suspends all election laws?\n\nGeorgia v. Stanton, supra, expresses a philosophy at war with Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2, and Duncan v. Kahanamoku, \n327 \nU.S. 304\n. The dominance of the civilian authority has been expressed from the beginning. See Wise v. Withers, 3 Cranch 331, 337; Sterling v. Constantin, supra, note 2.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] We are told by the National Institute of Municipal Law Officers in an amicus brief:\n\n\"Regardless of the fact that in the last two decades the United States has become a predominantly urban country where well over two-thirds of the population now lives in cities or suburbs, political representation in the majority of state legislatures is 50 or more years behind the times. Apportionments made when the greater part of the population was located in rural communities are still determining and undermining our elections.\n\n\n\"As a consequence, the municipality of 1960 is forced to function in a horse and buggy environment where there is little political recognition of the heavy demands of an urban population. These demands will become even greater by 1970 when some 150 million people will be living in urban areas.\n\n\n\"The National Institute of Municipal Law Officers has for many years recognized the wide-spread complaint that by far the greatest \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 249]\n\u00a0\n preponderance of state representatives and senators are from rural areas which, in the main, fail to become vitally interested in the increasing difficulties now facing urban administrators.\n\n\n\"Since World War II, the explosion in city and suburban population has created intense local problems in education, transportation, and housing. Adequate handling of these problems has not been possible to a large extent, due chiefly to the political weakness of municipalities. This situation is directly attributable to considerable under-representation of cities in the legislatures of most states.\" Amicus brief, pp. 2-3.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The recent ruling by the Iowa Supreme Court that a legislature, though elected under an unfair apportionment scheme, is nonetheless a legislature empowered to act (Cedar Rapids v. Cox, 252 Iowa 948, 964, 108 N. W. 2d 253, 262-263; cf. Kidd v. McCanless, 200 Tenn. 273, 292 S. W. 2d 40) is plainly correct.\n\nThere need be no fear of a more disastrous collision between federal and state agencies here than where a federal court enjoins gerrymandering based on racial lines. See Gomillion v. Lightfoot, supra.\n\nThe District Court need not undertake a complete reapportionment. It might possibly achieve the goal of substantial equality merely by directing respondent to eliminate the egregious injustices. Or its conclusion that reapportionment should be made may in itself stimulate legislative action. That was the result in Asbury Park Press v. Woolley, 33 N. J. 1, 161 A. 2d 705, where the state court ruled it had jurisdiction:\n\n\"If by reason of passage of time and changing conditions the reapportionment statute no longer serves its original purpose of securing to the voter the full constitutional value of his franchise, and the legislative branch fails to take appropriate restorative action, the doors of the courts must be open to him. The law-making body cannot by inaction alter the constitutional system under which it has its own existence.\" 33 N. J., at 14, 161 A. 2d, at 711. The court withheld its decision on the merits in order that the legislature might have an opportunity to consider adoption of a reapportionment act. For the sequel see Application of Lamb, 67 N. J. Super. 39, 46-47, 169 A. 2d 822, 825-826.\n\n\n Reapportionment was also the result in Magraw v. Donovan, 159 F. Supp. 901, where a federal three-judge District Court took jurisdiction, saying, 163 F. Supp. 184, 187:\n\n\"Here it is the unmistakable duty of the State Legislature to reapportion itself periodically in accordance with recent population changes. . . . Early in January 1959 the 61st Session of the Minnesota Legislature will convene, all of the members of which will be newly elected on November 4th of this year. The facts which have \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 251]\n\u00a0\n been presented to us will be available to them. It is not to be presumed that the Legislature will refuse to take such action as is necessary to comply with its duty under the State Constitution. We defer decision on all the issues presented (including that of the power of this Court to grant relief), in order to afford the Legislature full opportunity to `heed the constitutional mandate to redistrict.'\"\n\n\n See 177 F. Supp. 803, where the case was dismissed as moot, the State Legislature having acted. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 251]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK, concurring.\n\nOne emerging from the rash of opinions with their accompanying clashing of views may well find himself suffering a mental blindness. The Court holds that the appellants have alleged a cause of action. However, it refuses to award relief here - although the facts are undisputed - and fails to give the District Court any guidance whatever. One dissenting opinion, bursting with words that go through so much and conclude with so little, contemns the majority action as \"a massive repudiation of the experience of our whole past.\" Another describes the complaint as merely asserting conclusory allegations that Tennessee's apportionment is \"incorrect,\" \"arbitrary,\" \"obsolete,\" and \"unconstitutional.\" I believe it can be shown that this case is distinguishable from earlier cases dealing with the distribution of political power by a State, that a patent violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution has been shown, and that an appropriate remedy may be formulated.\n\n\nI.\n\n\nI take the law of the case from MacDougall v. Green, \n335 \nU.S. 281\n (1948), which involved an attack under the Equal Protection Clause upon an Illinois election statute. The Court decided that case on its merits without hindrance from the \"political question\" doctrine. Although the statute under attack was upheld, it is clear \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 252]\n\u00a0\n that the Court based its decision upon the determination that the statute represented a rational state policy. It stated:\n\n\"It would be strange indeed, and doctrinaire, for this Court, applying such broad constitutional concepts as due process and equal protection of the laws, to deny a State the power to assure a proper diffusion of political initiative as between its thinly populated counties and those having concentrated masses, in view of the fact that the latter have practical opportunities for exerting their political weight at the polls not available to the former.\" Id., at 284. (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n The other cases upon which my Brethren dwell are all distinguishable or inapposite. The widely heralded case of Colegrove v. Green, \n328 \nU.S. 549\n (1946), was one not only in which the Court was bobtailed but in which there was no majority opinion. Indeed, even the \"political question\" point in MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER'S opinion was no more than an alternative ground.\n1\n Moreover, the appellants did not present an equal protection argument.\n2\n While it has served as a Mother Hubbard to most of the subsequent cases, I feel it was in that respect illcast and for all of these reasons put it to one side.\n3\n Likewise, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 253]\n\u00a0\n I do not consider the Guaranty Clause cases based on Art. I, 4, of the Constitution, because it is not invoked here and it involves different criteria, as the Court's opinion indicates. Cases resting on various other considerations not present here, such as Radford v. Gary, \n352 \nU.S. 991\n (1957) (lack of equity); Kidd v. McCanless, \n352 \nU.S. 920\n (1956) (adequate state grounds supporting the state judgment); Anderson v. Jordan, \n343 \nU.S. 912\n (1952) (adequate state grounds); Remmey v. Smith, \n342 \nU.S. 916\n (1952) (failure to exhaust state procedures), are of course not controlling. Finally, the Georgia county-unit-system cases, such as South v. Peters, \n339 \nU.S. 276\n (1950), reflect the viewpoint of MacDougall, i. e., to refrain from intervening where there is some rational policy behind the State's system.\n4\n\u00a0\n\n\nII.\n\n\nThe controlling facts cannot be disputed. It appears from the record that 37% of the voters of Tennessee elect 20 of the 33 Senators while 40% of the voters elect 63 of the 99 members of the House. But this might not on its face be an \"invidious discrimination,\" Williamson v. Lee Optical of Oklahoma, \n348 \nU.S. 483, 489\n (1955), for a \"statutory discrimination will not be set aside if any state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify it.\" McGowan v. Maryland, \n366 \nU.S. 420, 426\n (1961).\n\nIt is true that the apportionment policy incorporated in Tennessee's Constitution, i. e., state-wide numerical equality of representation with certain minor qualifications,\n5\n is a rational one. On a county-by-county comparison \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 254]\n\u00a0\n a districting plan based thereon naturally will have disparities in representation due to the qualifications. But this to my mind does not raise constitutional problems, for the overall policy is reasonable. However, the root of the trouble is not in Tennessee's Constitution, for admittedly its policy has not been followed. The discrimination lies in the action of Tennessee's Assembly in allocating legislative seats to counties or districts created by it. Try as one may, Tennessee's apportionment just cannot be made to fit the pattern cut by its Constitution. This was the finding of the District Court. The policy of the Constitution referred to by the dissenters, therefore, is of no relevance here. We must examine what the Assembly has done.\n6\n The frequency and magnitude of the inequalities in the present districting admit of no policy whatever. An examination of Table I accompanying this opinion, post, p. 262, conclusively reveals that the apportionment picture in Tennessee is a topsy-turvical of gigantic proportions. This is not to say that some of the disparity cannot be explained, but when the entire table is examined - comparing the voting strength of counties of like population as well as contrasting that of the smaller with the larger counties - it leaves but one conclusion, namely that Tennessee's apportionment is a crazy quilt without rational basis. At the risk of being accused of picking out a few of the horribles I shall allude to a series of examples that are taken from Table I.\n\nAs is admitted, there is a wide disparity of voting strength between the large and small counties. Some \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 255]\n\u00a0\n samples are: Moore County has a total representation of two\n7\n with a population (2,340) of only one-eleventh of Rutherford County (25,316) with the same representation; Decatur County (5,563) has the same representation as Carter (23,303) though the latter has four times the population; likewise, Loudon County (13,264), Houston (3,084), and Anderson County (33,990) have the same representation, i. e., 1.25 each. But it is said that in this illustration all of the under-represented counties contain municipalities of over 10,000 population and they therefore should be included under the \"urban\" classification, rationalizing this disparity as an attempt to effect a rural-urban political balance. But in so doing one is caught up in the backlash of his own bull whip, for many counties have municipalities with a population exceeding 10,000, yet the same invidious discrimination is present. For example:\n\nCounty  Population Representation\n\nCarter ........................... 23,303   1.10 Maury ........................... 24,556   2.25\n\nWashington ....................... 36,967   1.93 Madison .......................... 37,245   3.50 \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 256]\n\u00a0\n\n\n Likewise, counties with no municipality of over 10,000 suffer a similar discrimination:\n\nCounty  Population  Representation\n\nGrundy ............................ 6,540   0.95 Chester ........................... 6,391   2.00\n\nCumberland ........................ 9,593   0.63 Crockett .......................... 9,676   2.00\n\nLoudon ............................ 13,264   1.25 Fayette ........................... 13,577   2.50\n\n This could not be an effort to attain political balance between rural and urban populations. Since discrimination is present among counties of like population, the plan is neither consistent nor rational. It discriminates horizontally creating gross disparities between rural areas themselves as well as between urban areas themselves,\n8\n still maintaining the wide vertical disparity already pointed out between rural and urban.\n\nIt is also insisted that the representation formula used above (see n. 7) is \"patently deficient\" because \"it eliminates from consideration the relative voting power of the counties that are joined together in a single election district.\" This is a strange claim coming from those who rely on the proposition that \"the voice of every voter\" need not have \"approximate equality.\" Indeed, representative government, as they say, is not necessarily one of \"bare numbers.\" The use of floterial districts in our political system is not ordinarily based on the theory that the floterial representative is splintered among the counties of his district per relative population. His function is to represent the whole district. However, I shall meet the charge on its own ground and by use of its \"adjusted \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 257]\n\u00a0\n `total representation'\" formula show that the present apportionment is loco. For example, compare some \"urban\" areas of like population, using the HARLAN formula:\n\nCounty  Population  Representation\n\nWashington ......................... 36,967   2.65 Madison ............................ 37,245   4.87\n\nCarter ............................. 23,303   1.48 Greene ............................. 23,649   2.05 Maury .............................. 24,556   3.81\n\nCoffee ............................. 13,406   2.32 Hamblen ............................ 14,090   1.07\n\n And now, using the same formula, compare some so-called \"rural\" areas of like population:\n\nCounty  Population  Representation\n\nMoore .............................. 2,340   1.23 Pickett ............................ 2,565    .22\n\nStewart ............................ 5,238   1.60 Cheatham ........................... 5,263    .74\n\nChester ............................ 6,391   1.36 Grundy ............................. 6,540    .69\n\nSmith .............................. 8,731   2.04 Unicoi ............................. 8,787   0.40\n\n And for counties with similar representation but with gross differences in population, take:\n\nCounty  Population  Representation\n\nSullivan ........................... 55,712   4.07 Maury .............................. 24,556   3.81\n\nBlount ............................. 30,353   2.12 Coffee ............................. 13,406   2.32\n\n These cannot be \"distorted effects,\" for here the same formula proposed by the dissenters is used and the result is even \"a crazier\" quilt. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 258]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe truth is that - although this case has been here for two years and has had over six hours' argument (three times the ordinary case) and has been most carefully considered over and over again by us in Conference and individually - no one, not even the State nor the dissenters, has come up with any rational basis for Tennessee's apportionment statute.\n\nNo one - except the dissenters advocating the HARLAN \"adjusted `total representation'\" formula - contends that mathematical equality among voters is required by the Equal Protection Clause. But certainly there must be some rational design to a State's districting. The discrimination here does not fit any pattern - as I have said, it is but a crazy quilt. My Brother HARLAN contends that other proposed apportionment plans contain disparities. Instead of chasing those rabbits he should first pause long enough to meet appellants' proof of discrimination by showing that in fact the present plan follows a rational policy. Not being able to do this, he merely counters with such generalities as \"classic legislative judgment,\" no \"significant discrepancy,\" and \"de minimis departures.\" I submit that even a casual glance at the present apportionment picture shows these conclusions to be entirely fanciful. If present representation has a policy at all, it is to maintain the status quo of invidious discrimination at any cost. Like the District Court, I conclude that appellants have met the burden of showing \"Tennessee is guilty of a clear violation of the state constitution and of the [federal] rights of the plaintiffs. . . .\"\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nAlthough I find the Tennessee apportionment statute offends the Equal Protection Clause, I would not consider intervention by this Court into so delicate a field if there were any other relief available to the people of Tennessee. But the majority of the people of Tennessee have no \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 259]\n\u00a0\n \"practical opportunities for exerting their political weight at the polls\" to correct the existing \"invidious discrimination.\" Tennessee has no initiative and referendum. I have searched diligently for other \"practical opportunities\" present under the law. I find none other than through the federal courts. The majority of the voters have been caught up in a legislative strait jacket. Tennessee has an \"informed, civically militant electorate\" and \"an aroused popular conscience,\" but it does not sear \"the conscience of the people's representatives.\" This is because the legislative policy has riveted the present seats in the Assembly to their respective constituencies, and by the votes of their incumbents a reapportionment of any kind is prevented. The people have been rebuffed at the hands of the Assembly; they have tried the constitutional convention route, but since the call must originate in the Assembly it, too, has been fruitless. They have tried Tennessee courts with the same result,\n9\n and Governors have fought the tide only to flounder. It is said that there is recourse in Congress and perhaps that may be, but from a practical standpoint this is without substance. To date Congress has never undertaken such a task in any State. We therefore must conclude that the people of Tennessee are stymied and without judicial intervention will be saddled with the present discrimination in the affairs of their state government.\n\n\nIV.\n\n\nFinally, we must consider if there are any appropriate modes of effective judicial relief. The federal courts are of course not forums for political debate, nor should they \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 260]\n\u00a0\n resolve themselves into state constitutional convention or legislative assemblies. Nor should their jurisdiction be exercised in the hope that such a declaration as is made today may have the direct effect of bringing on legislative action and relieving the courts of the problem of fashioning relief. To my mind this would be nothing less than blackjacking the Assembly into reapportioning the State. If judicial competence were lacking to fashion an effective decree, I would dismiss this appeal. However, like the Solicitor General of the United States, I see no such difficulty in the position of this case. One plan might be to start with the existing assembly districts, consolidate some of them, and award the seats thus released to those counties suffering the most egregious discrimination. Other possibilities are present and might be more effective. But the plan here suggested would at least release the strangle hold now on the Assembly and permit it to redistrict itself.\n\nIn this regard the appellants have proposed a plan based on the rationale of state-wide equal representation. Not believing that numerical equality of representation throughout a State is constitutionally required, I would not apply such a standard albeit a permissive one. Nevertheless, the dissenters attack it by the application of the HARLAN \"adjusted `total representation'\" formula. The result is that some isolated inequalities are shown, but this in itself does not make the proposed plan irrational or place it in the \"crazy quilt\" category. Such inequalities, as the dissenters point out in attempting to support the present apportionment as rational, are explainable. Moreover, there is no requirement that any plan have mathematical exactness in its application. Only where, as here, the total picture reveals incommensurables of both magnitude and frequency can it be said that there is present an invidious discrimination. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 261]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn view of the detailed study that the Court has given this problem, it is unfortunate that a decision is not reached on the merits. The majority appears to hold, at least sub silentio, that an invidious discrimination is present, but it remands to the three-judge court for it to make what is certain to be that formal determination. It is true that Tennessee has not filed a formal answer. However, it has filed voluminous papers and made extended arguments supporting its position. At no time has it been able to contradict the appellants' factual claims; it has offered no rational explanation for the present apportionment; indeed, it has indicated that there are none known to it. As I have emphasized, the case proceeded to the point before the three-judge court that it was able to find an invidious discrimination factually present, and the State has not contested that holding here. In view of all this background I doubt if anything more can be offered or will be gained by the State on remand, other than time. Nevertheless, not being able to muster a court to dispose of the case on the merits, I concur in the opinion of the majority and acquiesce in the decision to remand. However, in fairness I do think that Tennessee is entitled to have my idea of what it faces on the record before us and the trial court some light as to how it might proceed.\n\nAs John Rutledge (later Chief Justice) said 175 years ago in the course of the Constitutional Convention, a chief function of the Court is to secure the national rights.\n10\n Its decision today supports the proposition for which our forebears fought and many died, namely, that to be fully conformable to the principle of right, the form of government must be representative.\n11\n That is the keystone upon which our government was founded \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 262]\n\u00a0\n and lacking which no republic can survive. It is well for this Court to practice self-restraint and discipline in constitutional adjudication, but never in its history have those principles received sanction where the national rights of so many have been so clearly infringed for so long a time. National respect for the courts is more enhanced through the forthright enforcement of those rights rather than by rendering them nugatory through the interposition of subterfuges. In my view the ultimate decision today is in the greatest tradition of this Court.\n\n    TABLE I.\n\n\n      Present total Present total      representation  representation       using  using J.    1950 voting   J.

Broom [287 \nU.S. 1 (1932)].\" Wood v. Broom involved only the interpretation of a congressional reapportionment Act.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Similarly, the Equal Protection Clause was not invoked in Tedesco v. Board of Supervisors, \n339 \nU.S. 940\n (1950).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] I do not read the later case of Colegrove v. Barrett, \n330 \nU.S. 804\n (1947), as having rejected the equal protection argument adopted here. That was merely a dismissal of an appeal where the equal protection point was mentioned along with attacks under three other constitutional provisions, two congressional Acts, and three state constitutional provisions.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Georgia based its election system on a consistent combination of political units and population, giving six unit votes to the eight most populous counties, four unit votes to the 30 counties next in population, and two unit votes to each of the remaining counties.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] See Part I of the Appendix to MR. JUSTICE HARLAN'S dissent, post, p. 341.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] It is suggested that the districting is not unconstitutional since it was established by a statute that was constitutional when passed some 60 years ago. But many Assembly Sessions since that time have deliberately refused to change the original act, and in any event \"[a] statute [constitutionally] valid when enacted may become invalid by change in the conditions to which it is applied.\" Nashville, C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Walters, \n294 \nU.S. 405, 415\n (1935).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] \"Total representation\" indicates the combined representation in the State Senate (33 members) and the State House of Representatives (99 members) in the Assembly of Tennessee. Assuming a county has one representative, it is credited in this calculation with 1\/99. Likewise, if the same county has one-third of a senate seat, it is credited with another 1\/99, and thus such a county, in our calculation, would have a \"total representation\" of two; if a county has one representative and one-sixth of a senate seat, it is credited with 1.5\/99, or 1.50. It is this last figure that I use here in an effort to make the comparisons clear. The 1950 rather than the 1960 census of voting population is used to avoid the charge that use of 1960 tabulations might not have allowed sufficient time for the State to act. However, the 1960 picture is even more irrational than the 1950 one.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Of course this was not the case in the Georgia county unit system, South v. Peters, supra, or the Illinois initiative plan, MacDougall v. Green, supra, where recognized political units having independent significance were given minimum political weight.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] It is interesting to note that state judges often rest their decisions on the ground that this Court has precluded adjudication of the federal claim. See, e. g., Scholle v. Secretary of State, 360 Mich. 1, 104 N. W. 2d 63 (1960).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] 1 Farrand, The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, 124.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] Kant, Perpetual Peace. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 265]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART, concurring.\n\nThe separate writings of my dissenting and concurring Brothers stray so far from the subject of today's decision as to convey, I think, a distressingly inaccurate impression of what the Court decides. For that reason, I think it appropriate, in joining the opinion of the Court, to emphasize in a few words what the opinion does and does not say.\n\nThe Court today decides three things and no more: \"(a) that the court possessed jurisdiction of the subject matter; (b) that a justiciable cause of action is stated upon which appellants would be entitled to appropriate relief; and (c) . . . that the appellants have standing to challenge the Tennessee apportionment statutes.\" Ante, pp. 197-198.\n\nThe complaint in this case asserts that Tennessee's system of apportionment is utterly arbitrary - without any possible justification in rationality. The District Court did not reach the merits of that claim, and this Court quite properly expresses no view on the subject. Contrary to the suggestion of my Brother HARLAN, the Court does not say or imply that \"state legislatures must be so structured as to reflect with approximate equality the voice of every voter.\" Post, p. 332. The Court does not say or imply that there is anything in the Federal Constitution \"to prevent a State, acting not irrationally, from choosing any electoral legislative structure it thinks best suited to the interests, temper, and customs of its people.\" Post, p. 334. And contrary to the suggestion of my Brother DOUGLAS, the Court most assuredly does not decide the question, \"may a State weight the vote of one county or one district more heavily than it weights the vote in another?\" Ante, p. 244.\n\nIn MacDougall v. Green, \n335 \nU.S. 281\n, the Court held that the Equal Protection Clause does not \"deny a State the power to assure a proper diffusion of political initiative \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 266]\n\u00a0\n as between its thinly populated counties and those having concentrated masses, in view of the fact that the latter have practical opportunities for exerting their political weight at the polls not available to the former.\" \n335 \nU.S., at 284\n. In case after case arising under the Equal Protection Clause the Court has said what it said again only last Term - that \"the Fourteenth Amendment permits the States a wide scope of discretion in enacting laws which affect some groups of citizens differently than others.\" McGowan v. Maryland, \n366 \nU.S. 420, 425\n. In case after case arising under that Clause we have also said that \"the burden of establishing the unconstitutionality of a statute rests on him who assails it.\" Metropolitan Casualty Ins. Co. v. Brownell, \n294 \nU.S. 580, 584\n.\n\nToday's decision does not turn its back on these settled precedents. I repeat, the Court today decides only: (1) that the District Court possessed jurisdiction of the subject matter; (2) that the complaint presents a justiciable controversy; (3) that the appellants have standing. My Brother CLARK has made a convincing prima facie showing that Tennessee's system of apportionment is in fact utterly arbitrary - without any possible justification in rationality. My Brother HARLAN has, with imagination and ingenuity, hypothesized possibly rational bases for Tennessee's system. But the merits of this case are not before us now. The defendants have not yet had an opportunity to be heard in defense of the State's system of apportionment; indeed, they have not yet even filed an answer to the complaint. As in other cases, the proper place for the trial is in the trial court, not here.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, whom MR. JUSTICE HARLAN joins, dissenting.\n\nThe Court today reverses a uniform course of decision established by a dozen cases, including one by which the very claim now sustained was unanimously rejected \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 267]\n\u00a0\n only five years ago. The impressive body of rulings thus cast aside reflected the equally uniform course of our political history regarding the relationship between population and legislative representation - a wholly different matter from denial of the franchise to individuals because of race, color, religion or sex. Such a massive repudiation of the experience of our whole past in asserting destructively novel judicial power demands a detailed analysis of the role of this Court in our constitutional scheme. Disregard of inherent limits in the effective exercise of the Court's \"judicial Power\" not only presages the futility of judicial intervention in the essentially political conflict of forces by which the relation between population and representation has time out of mind been and now is determined. It may well impair the Court's position as the ultimate organ of \"the supreme Law of the Land\" in that vast range of legal problems, often strongly entangled in popular feeling, on which this Court must pronounce. The Court's authority - possessed of neither the purse nor the sword - ultimately rests on sustained public confidence in its moral sanction. Such feeling must be nourished by the Court's complete detachment, in fact and in appearance, from political entanglements and by abstention from injecting itself into the clash of political forces in political settlements.\n\nA hypothetical claim resting on abstract assumptions is now for the first time made the basis for affording illusory relief for a particular evil even though it foreshadows deeper and more pervasive difficulties in consequence. The claim is hypothetical and the assumptions are abstract because the Court does not vouchsafe the lower courts - state and federal - guidelines for formulating specific, definite, wholly unprecedented remedies for the inevitable litigations that today's umbrageous disposition is bound to stimulate in connection with politically motivated reapportionments in so many States. In \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 268]\n\u00a0\n such a setting, to promulgate jurisdiction in the abstract is meaningless. It is as devoid of reality as \"a brooding omnipresence in the sky,\" for it conveys no intimation what relief, if any, a District Court is capable of affording that would not invite legislatures to play ducks and drakes with the judiciary. For this Court to direct the District Court to enforce a claim to which the Court has over the years consistently found itself required to deny legal enforcement and at the same time to find it necessary to withhold any guidance to the lower court how to enforce this turnabout, new legal claim, manifests an odd - indeed an esoteric - conception of judicial propriety. One of the Court's supporting opinions, as elucidated by commentary, unwittingly affords a disheartening preview of the mathematical quagmire (apart from divers judicially inappropriate and elusive determinants) into which this Court today catapults the lower courts of the country without so much as adumbrating the basis for a legal calculus as a means of extrication. Even assuming the indispensable intellectual disinterestedness on the part of judges in such matters, they do not have accepted legal standards or criteria or even reliable analogies to draw upon for making judicial judgments. To charge courts with the task of accommodating the incommensurable factors of policy that underlie these mathematical puzzles is to attribute, however flatteringly, omnicompetence to judges. The Framers of the Constitution persistently rejected a proposal that embodied this assumption and Thomas Jefferson never entertained it.\n\nRecent legislation, creating a district appropriately described as \"an atrocity of ingenuity,\" is not unique. Considering the gross inequality among legislative electoral units within almost every State, the Court naturally shrinks from asserting that in districting at least substantial equality is a constitutional requirement enforceable \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 269]\n\u00a0\n by courts.\n*\n Room continues to be allowed for weighting. This of course implies that geography, economics, urban-rural conflict, and all the other non-legal factors which have throughout our history entered into political districting are to some extent not to be ruled out in the undefined vista now opened up by review in the federal courts of state reapportionments. To some extent - aye, there's the rub. In effect, today's decision empowers the courts of the country to devise what should constitute the proper composition of the legislatures of the fifty States. If state courts should for one reason or another find themselves unable to discharge this task, the duty of doing so is put on the federal courts or on this Court, if State views do not satisfy this Court's notion of what is proper districting.\n\nWe were soothingly told at the bar of this Court that we need not worry about the kind of remedy a court could effectively fashion once the abstract constitutional right to have courts pass on a state-wide system of electoral districting is recognized as a matter of judicial rhetoric, because legislatures would heed the Court's admonition. This is not only a euphoric hope. It implies a sorry \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 270]\n\u00a0\n confession of judicial impotence in place of a frank acknowledgement that there is not under our Constitution a judicial remedy for every political mischief, for every undesirable exercise of legislative power. The Framers carefully and with deliberate forethought refused so to enthrone the judiciary. In this situation, as in others of like nature, appeal for relief does not belong here. Appeal must be to an informed, civically militant electorate. In a democratic society like ours, relief must come through an aroused popular conscience that sears the conscience of the people's representatives. In any event there is nothing judicially more unseemly nor more self-defeating than for this Court to make in terrorem pronouncements, to indulge in merely empty rhetoric, sounding a word of promise to the ear, sure to be disappointing to the hope.\n\nThis is the latest in the series of cases in which the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment have been invoked in federal courts as restrictions upon the power of the States to allocate electoral weight among the voting populations of their various geographical subdivisions.\n1\n The present action, which \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 271]\n\u00a0\n comes here on appeal from an order of a statutory three-judge District Court dismissing amended complaints seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, challenges the provisions of Tenn. Code Ann., 1955 3-101 to 3-109, which apportion state representative and senatorial seats among Tennessee's ninety-five counties.\n\nThe original plaintiffs, citizens and qualified voters entitled to vote for members of the Tennessee Legislature in the several counties in which they respectively reside, bring this action in their own behalf and \"on behalf of all other voters in the State of Tennessee,\" or, as they alternatively assert, \"on behalf of all qualified voters of their respective counties, and further, on behalf of all voters of the State of Tennessee who are similarly situated.\" The cities of Knoxville and Chattanooga, and the Mayor of Nashville - on his own behalf as a qualified voter and, pursuant to an authorizing resolution by the Nashville City Council, as a representative of all the city's residents - were permitted to intervene as parties plaintiff.\n2\n The defendants are executive officials charged with statutory duties in connection with state elections.\n3\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 272]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe original plaintiffs' amended complaint avers, in substance, the following.\n4\n The Constitution of the State of Tennessee declares that \"elections shall be free and equal,\" provides that no qualifications other than age, citizenship and specified residence requirements shall be attached to the right of suffrage, and prohibits denying to any person the suffrage to which he is entitled except upon conviction of an infamous crime. Art. I, 5; Art. IV, 1. It requires an enumeration of qualified voters within every term of ten years after 1871 and an apportionment of representatives and senators among the several counties or districts according to the number of qualified voters in each\n5\n at the time of each decennial \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 273]\n\u00a0\n enumeration. Art. II, 4, 5, 6. Notwithstanding these provisions, the State Legislature has not reapportioned itself since 1901. The Reapportionment Act of that year, Tenn. Acts 1901, c. 122, now Tenn. Code Ann., 1955, 3-101 to 3-109,\n6\n was unconstitutional when enacted, because not preceded by the required enumeration of qualified voters and because it allocated legislative seats arbitrarily, unequally and discriminatorily, as measured by the 1900 federal census. Moreover, irrespective of the question of its validity in 1901, it is asserted that the Act became \"unconstitutional and obsolete\" in 1911 by virtue of the decennial reapportionment requirement of the Tennessee Constitution. Continuing a \"purposeful and systematic plan to discriminate against a geographical class of persons,\" recent Tennessee Legislatures have failed, as did their predecessors, to enact reapportionment legislation, although a number of bills providing for reapportionment have been introduced. Because of population shifts since 1901, the apportionment fixed by the Act of that year and still in effect is not proportionate to population, denies to the counties in which the plaintiffs \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 274]\n\u00a0\n live an additional number of representatives to which they are entitled, and renders plaintiffs' votes \"not as effective as the votes of the voters residing in other senatorial and representative districts . . . .\" Plaintiffs \"suffer a debasement of their votes by virtue of the incorrect, arbitrary, obsolete and unconstitutional apportionment of the General Assembly . . .,\" and the totality of the malapportionment's effect - which permits a minority of about thirty-seven percent of the voting population of the State to control twenty of the thirty-three members of Tennessee's Senate, and a minority of forty percent of the voting population to control sixty-three of the ninety-nine members of the House - results in \"a distortion of the constitutional system\" established by the Federal and State Constitutions, prevents the General Assembly \"from being a body representative of the people of the State of Tennessee, . . .\" and is \"contrary to the basic principle of representative government . . .,\" and \"contrary to the philosophy of government in the United States and all Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence . . . .\"\n\nExhibits appended to the complaint purport to demonstrate the extent of the inequalities of which plaintiffs complain. Based upon \"approximate voting population,\"\n7\n these set forth figures showing that the State \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 275]\n\u00a0\n Senator from Tennessee's most populous senatorial district represents five and two-tenths times the number of voters represented by the Senator from the least populous district, while the corresponding ratio for most and least populous House districts is more than eighteen to one. The General Assembly thus apportioned has discriminated against the underrepresented counties and in favor of the overrepresented counties in the collection and distribution of various taxes and tax revenues, notably in the distribution of school and highway-improvement funds,\n8\n this discrimination being \"made possible and effective\" by the Legislature's failure to reapportion itself. Plaintiffs conclude that election of the State Legislature pursuant to the apportionment fixed by the 1901 Act violates the Tennessee Constitution and deprives them of due process of law and of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Their prayer below was for a declaratory judgment striking down the Act, an injunction restraining defendants from any acts necessary to the holding of elections in the districts prescribed by Tenn. Code Ann., 1955, 3-101 to 3-109, until such time as the legislature is reapportioned \"according to the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 276]\n\u00a0\n Constitution of the State of Tennessee,\" and an order directing defendants to declare the next primary and general elections for members of the Tennessee Legislature on an at-large basis - the thirty-three senatorial candidates and the ninety-nine representative candidates receiving the highest number of votes to be declared elected.\n9\n\u00a0\n\nMotions to dismiss for want of jurisdiction of the subject matter and for failure to state a claim were made and granted, 179 F. Supp. 824, the District Court relying upon this Court's series of decisions beginning with Colegrove v. Green, \n328 \nU.S. 549\n, rehearing denied, \n329 \nU.S. 825\n, motion for reargument before the full bench denied, \n329 \nU.S. 828\n. The original and intervening plaintiffs bring the case here on appeal. \n364 \nU.S. 898\n. In this Court they have altered their request for relief, suggesting a \"step-by-step approach.\" The first step is a remand to the District Court with directions to vacate the order dismissing the complaint and to enter an order retaining jurisdiction, providing \"the necessary spur to legislative action . . . .\" If this proves insufficient, appellants will ask the \"additional spur\" of an injunction prohibiting elections under the 1901 Act, or a declaration of the Act's unconstitutionality, or both. Finally, all other means failing, the District Court is invited by the plaintiffs, greatly daring, to order an election at large or redistrict the State itself or through a master. The Solicitor General of the United States, who has filed a brief amicus and argued in favor of reversal, asks the Court on this appeal to hold only that the District Court has \"jurisdiction\" and may properly exercise it to entertain the plaintiffs' claims on the merits. This would leave to that court after remand the questions of the challenged statute's \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 277]\n\u00a0\n constitutionality and of some undefined, unadumbrated relief in the event a constitutional violation is found. After an argument at the last Term, the case was set down for reargument, \n366 \nU.S. 907\n, and heard this Term.\n\n\nI.\n\n\nIn sustaining appellants' claim, based on the Fourteenth Amendment, that the District Court may entertain this suit, this Court's uniform course of decision over the years is overruled or disregarded. Explicitly it begins with Colegrove v. Green, supra, decided in 1946, but its roots run deep in the Court's historic adjudicatory process.\n\nColegrove held that a federal court should not entertain an action for declaratory and injunctive relief to adjudicate the constitutionality, under the Equal Protection Clause and other federal constitutional and statutory provisions, of a state statute establishing the respective districts for the State's election of Representatives to the Congress. Two opinions were written by the four Justices who composed the majority of the seven sitting members of the Court. Both opinions joining in the result in Colegrove v. Green agreed that considerations were controlling which dictated denial of jurisdiction though not in the strict sense of want of power. While the two opinions show a divergence of view regarding some of these considerations, there are important points of concurrence. Both opinions demonstrate a predominant concern, first, with avoiding federal judicial involvement in matters traditionally left to legislative policy making; second, with respect to the difficulty - in view of the nature of the problems of apportionment and its history in this country - of drawing on or devising judicial standards for judgment, as opposed to legislative determinations, of the part which mere numerical equality among voters should play as a criterion for the allocation of \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 278]\n\u00a0\n political power; and, third, with problems of finding appropriate modes of relief - particularly, the problem of resolving the essentially political issue of the relative merits of at-large elections and elections held in districts of unequal population.\n\nThe broad applicability of these considerations - summarized in the loose shorthand phrase, \"political question\" - in cases involving a State's apportionment of voting power among its numerous localities has led the Court, since 1946, to recognize their controlling effect in a variety of situations. (In all these cases decision was by a full Court.) The \"political question\" principle as applied in Colegrove has found wide application commensurate with its function as \"one of the rules basic to the federal system and this Court's appropriate place within that structure.\" Rescue Army v. Municipal Court, \n331 \nU.S. 549, 570\n. In Colegrove v. Barrett, \n330 \nU.S. 804\n, litigants brought suit in a Federal District Court challenging as offensive to the Equal Protection Clause Illinois' state legislative-apportionment laws. They pointed to state constitutional provisions requiring decennial reapportionment and allocation of seats in proportion to population, alleged a failure to reapportion for more than forty-five years - during which time extensive population shifts had rendered the legislative districts grossly unequal - and sought declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to all elections to be held thereafter. After the complaint was dismissed by the District Court, this Court dismissed an appeal for want of a substantial federal question. A similar District Court decision was affirmed here in Radford v. Gary, \n352 \nU.S. 991\n. And cf. Remmey v. Smith, \n342 \nU.S. 916\n. In Tedesco v. Board of Supervisors, \n339 \nU.S. 940\n, the Court declined to hear, for want of a substantial federal question, the claim that the division of a municipality into voting districts of unequal population for the selection for councilmen fell \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 279]\n\u00a0\n afoul of the Fourteenth Amendment, and in Cox v. Peters, \n342 \nU.S. 936\n, rehearing denied, \n343 \nU.S. 921\n, it found no substantial federal question raised by a state court's dismissal of a claim for damages for \"devaluation\" of plaintiff's vote by application of Georgia's county-unit system in a primary election for the Democratic gubernatorial candidate. The same Georgia system was subsequently attacked in a complaint for declaratory judgment and an injunction; the federal district judge declined to take the requisite steps for the convening of a statutory three-judge court; and this Court, in Hartsfield v. Sloan, \n357 \nU.S. 916\n, denied a motion for leave to file a petition for a writ of mandamus to compel the district judge to act. In MacDougall v. Green, \n335 \nU.S. 281, 283\n, the Court noted that \"To assume that political power is a function exclusively of numbers is to disregard the practicalities of government,\" and, citing the Colegrove cases, declined to find in \"such broad constitutional concepts as due process and equal protection of the laws,\" id., at 284, a warrant for federal judicial invalidation of an Illinois statute requiring as a condition for the formation of a new political party the securing of at least two hundred signatures from each of fifty counties. And in South v. Peters, \n339 \nU.S. 276\n, another suit attacking Georgia's county-unit law, it affirmed a District Court dismissal, saying\n\n\"Federal courts consistently refuse to exercise their equity powers in cases posing political issues arising from a state's geographical distribution of electoral strength among its political subdivisions.\" Id., at 277.\n\n\n Of course it is important to recognize particular, relevant diversities among comprehensively similar situations. Appellants seek to distinguish several of this Court's prior decisions on one or another ground - Colegrove v. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 280]\n\u00a0\n Green on the ground that federal, not state, legislative apportionment was involved; Remmey v. Smith on the ground that state judicial remedies had not been tried; Radford v. Gary on the ground that Oklahoma has the initiative, whereas Tennessee does not. It would only darken counsel to discuss the relevance and significance of each of these assertedly distinguishing factors here and in the context of this entire line of cases. Suffice it that they do not serve to distinguish Colegrove v. Barrett, supra, which is on all fours with the present case, or to distinguish Kidd v. McCanless, \n352 \nU.S. 920\n, in which the full Court without dissent, only five years ago, dismissed on authority of Colegrove v. Green and Anderson v. Jordan, \n343 \nU.S. 912\n, an appeal from the Supreme Court of Tennessee in which a precisely similar attack was made upon the very statute now challenged. If the weight and momentum of an unvarying course of carefully considered decisions are to be respected, appellants' claims are foreclosed not only by precedents governing the exact facts of the present case but are themselves supported by authority the more persuasive in that it gives effect to the Colegrove principle in distinctly varying circumstances in which state arrangements allocating relative degrees of political influence among geographic groups of voters were challenged under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\nII.\n\n\nThe Colegrove doctrine, in the form in which repeated decisions have settled it, was not an innovation. It represents long judicial thought and experience. From its earliest opinions this Court has consistently recognized a class of controversies which do not lend themselves to judicial standards and judicial remedies. To classify the various instances as \"political questions\" is rather a form \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 281]\n\u00a0\n of stating this conclusion than revealing of analysis.\n10\n Some of the cases so labelled have no relevance here. But from others emerge unifying considerations that are compelling.\n\n1. The cases concerning war or foreign affairs, for example, are usually explained by the necessity of the country's speaking with one voice in such matters. While this concern alone undoubtedly accounts for many of the decisions,\n11\n others do not fit the pattern. It would hardly embarrass the conduct of war were this Court to determine, in connection with private transactions between litigants, the date upon which war is to be deemed terminated. But the Court has refused to do so. See, e. g., The Protector, 12 Wall. 700; Brown v. Hiatts, 15 wall. 177; Adger v. Alston, 15 Wall. 555; Williams v. Bruffy, \n96 \nU.S. 176, 192\n-193. It does not suffice to explain such cases as Ludecke v. Watkins, \n335 \nU.S. 160\n - deferring to political determination the question of the duration of war for purposes of the Presidential power to deport alien enemies - that judicial intrusion would seriously \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 282]\n\u00a0\n impede the President's power effectively to protect the country's interests in time of war. Of course, this is true; but the precise issue presented is the duration of the time of war which demands the power. Cf. Martin v. Mott, 12 Wheat. 19; Lamar v. Browne, \n92 \nU.S. 187, 193\n; Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries & Warehouse Co., \n251 \nU.S. 146\n; Kahn v. Anderson, \n255 \nU.S. 1\n. And even for the purpose of determining the extent of congressional regulatory power over the tribes and dependent communities of Indians, it is ordinarily for Congress, not the Court, to determine whether or not a particular Indian group retains the characteristics constitutionally requisite to confer the power.\n12\n E. g., United States v. Holliday, 3 Wall. 407; Tiger v. Western Investment Co., \n221 \nU.S. 286\n; United States v. Sandoval, \n231 \nU.S. 28\n. A controlling factor in such cases is that, decision respecting these kinds of complex matters of policy being traditionally committed not to courts but to the political agencies of government for determination by criteria of political expediency, there exists no standard ascertainable by settled judicial experience or process by reference to which a political decision affecting the question at issue between the parties can be judged. Where the question arises in the course of a litigation involving primarily the adjudication of other issues between the litigants, the Court accepts as a basis for adjudication the political departments' decision of it. But where its determination is the sole function to be served by the exercise of the judicial power, the Court will not entertain the action. See Chicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc., v. Waterman S. S. Corp., \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 283]\n\u00a0\n \n333 \nU.S. 103\n. The dominant consideration is \"the lack of satisfactory criteria for a judicial determination . . . .\" Mr. Chief Justice Hughes, for the Court, in Coleman v. Miller, \n307 \nU.S. 433, 454\n-455. Compare United States v. Rogers, 4 How. 567, 572, with Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515.\n13\n\u00a0\n\nThis may be, like so many questions of law, a matter of degree. Questions have arisen under the Constitution to which adjudication gives answer although the criteria for decision are less than unwavering bright lines. Often in these cases illumination was found in the federal structures established by, or the underlying presuppositions of, the Constitution. With respect to such questions, the Court has recognized that, concerning a particular power of Congress put in issue, \". . . effective restraints on its exercise must proceed from political rather than from judicial processes.\" Wickard v. Filburn, \n317 \nU.S. 111, 120\n. It is also true that even regarding the duration of war and the status of Indian tribes, referred to above as subjects ordinarily committed exclusively to the non-judicial branches, the Court has suggested that some limitations exist upon the range within which the decisions of those branches will be permitted to go unreviewed. See United States v. Sandoval, supra, at 46; cf. Chastleton Corp. v. Sinclair, \n264 \nU.S. 543\n. But this is merely to acknowledge that particular circumstances may differ so greatly in degree as to differ thereby in kind, and that, although within a certain range of cases on a continuum, no standard of distinction can be found to tell between them, other cases will fall above or below the range. The doctrine of political questions, like any other, is not to \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 284]\n\u00a0\n be applied beyond the limits of its own logic, with all the quiddities and abstract disharmonies it may manifest. See the disposition of contentions based on logically distorting views of Colegrove v. Green and Hunter v. Pittsburgh, \n207 \nU.S. 161\n, in Gomillion v. Lightfoot, \n364 \nU.S. 339\n.\n\n2. The Court has been particularly unwilling to intervene in matters concerning the structure and organization of the political institutions of the States. The abstention from judicial entry into such areas has been greater even than that which marks the Court's ordinary approach to issues of state power challenged under broad federal guarantees. \"We should be very reluctant to decide that we had jurisdiction in such a case, and thus in an action of this nature to supervise and review the political administration of a state government by its own officials and through its own courts. The jurisdiction of this court would only exist in case there had been . . . such a plain and substantial departure from the fundamental principles upon which our government is based that it could with truth and propriety be said that if the judgment were suffered to remain, the party aggrieved would be deprived of his life, liberty or property in violation of the provisions of the Federal Constitution.\" Wilson v. North Carolina, \n169 \nU.S. 586, 596\n. See Taylor and Marshall v. Beckham (No. 1), \n178 \nU.S. 548\n; Walton v. House of Representatives, \n265 \nU.S. 487\n; Snowden v. Hughes, \n321 \nU.S. 1\n. Cf. In re Sawyer, \n124 \nU.S. 200, 220\n-221.\n\nWhere, however, state law has made particular federal questions determinative of relations within the structure of state government, not in challenge of it, the Court has resolved such narrow, legally defined questions in proper proceedings. See Boyd v. Nebraska ex rel. Thayer, \n143 \nU.S. 135\n. In such instances there is no conflict between state policy and the exercise of federal judicial \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 285]\n\u00a0\n power. This distinction explains the decisions in Smiley v. Holm, \n285 \nU.S. 355\n; Koenig v. Flynn, \n285 \nU.S. 375\n; and Carroll v. Becker, \n285 \nU.S. 380\n, in which the Court released state constitutional provisions prescribing local lawmaking procedures from misconceived restriction of superior federal requirements. Adjudication of the federal claim involved in those cases was not one demanding the accommodation of conflicting interests for which no readily accessible judicial standards could be found. See McPherson v. Blacker, \n146 \nU.S. 1\n, in which, in a case coming here on writ of error from the judgment of a state court which had entertained it on the merits, the Court treated as justiciable the claim that a State could not constitutionally select its presidential electors by districts, but held that Art. II, 1, cl. 2, of the Constitution left the mode of choosing electors in the absolute discretion of the States. Cf. Pope v. Williams, \n193 \nU.S. 621\n; Breedlove v. Suttles, \n302 \nU.S. 277\n. To read with literalness the abstracted jurisdictional discussion in the McPherson opinion reveals the danger of conceptions of \"justiciability\" derived from talk and not from the effective decision in a case. In probing beneath the surface of cases in which the Court has declined to interfere with the actions of political organs of government, of decisive significance is whether in each situation the ultimate decision has been to intervene or not to intervene. Compare the reliance in South v. Peters, \n339 \nU.S. 276\n, on MacDougall v. Green, \n335 \nU.S. 281\n, and the \"jurisdictional\" form of the opinion in Wilson v. North Carolina, \n169 \nU.S. 586, 596\n, supra.\n\n3. The cases involving Negro disfranchisement are no exception to the principle of avoiding federal judicial intervention into matters of state government in the absence of an explicit and clear constitutional imperative. For here the controlling command of Supreme Law is plain and unequivocal. An end of discrimination against \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 286]\n\u00a0\n the Negro was the compelling motive of the Civil War Amendments. The Fifteenth expresses this in terms, and it is no less true of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth. Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 67-72; Strauder v. West Virginia, \n100 \nU.S. 303, 306\n-307; Nixon v. Herndon, \n273 \nU.S. 536, 541\n. Thus the Court, in cases involving discrimination against the Negro's right to vote, has recognized not only the action at law for damages,\n14\n but, in appropriate circumstances, the extraordinary remedy of declaratory or injunctive relief.\n15\n Schnell v. Davis, \n336 \nU.S. 933\n; Terry v. Adams, \n345 \nU.S. 461\n.\n16\n Injunctions in these cases, it should be noted, would not have restrained state-wide general elections. Compare Giles v. Harris, \n189 \nU.S. 475\n.\n\n4. The Court has refused to exercise its jurisdiction to pass on \"abstract questions of political power, of sovereignty, of government.\" Massachusetts v. Mellon, \n262 \nU.S. 447, 485\n. See Texas v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n258 \nU.S. 158, 162\n; New Jersey v. Sargent, \n269 \nU.S. 328, 337\n. The \"political question\" doctrine, in this aspect, reflects the policies underlying the requirement of \"standing\": that the litigant who would challenge official \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 287]\n\u00a0\n action must claim infringement of an interest particular and personal to himself, as distinguished from a cause of dissatisfaction with the general frame and functioning of government - a complaint that the political institutions are awry. See Stearns v. Wood, \n236 \nU.S. 75\n; Fairchild v. Hughes, \n258 \nU.S. 126\n; United Public Workers v. Mitchell, \n330 \nU.S. 75, 89\n-91. What renders cases of this kind non-justiciable is not necessarily the nature of the parties to them, for the Court has resolved other issues between similar parties;\n17\n nor is it the nature of the legal question involved, for the same type of question has been adjudicated when presented in other forms of controversy.\n18\n The crux of the matter is that courts are not fit instruments of decision where what is essentially at stake is the composition of those large contests of policy traditionally fought out in non-judicial forums, by which governments and the actions of governments are made and unmade. See Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700; White v. Hart, 13 Wall. 646; Phillips v. Payne, \n92 \nU.S. 130\n; Marsh v. Burroughs, 1 Woods 463, 471-472 (Bradley, Circuit Justice); cf. Wilson v. Shaw, \n204 \nU.S. 24\n; but see Coyle v. Smith, \n221 \nU.S. 559\n. Thus, where the Cherokee Nation sought by an original motion to restrain the State of Georgia from the enforcement of laws which assimilated Cherokee territory to the State's counties, abrogated Cherokee law, and abolished Cherokee government, the Court held that such a claim was not judicially cognizable. Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1.\n19\n And in Georgia \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 288]\n\u00a0\n v. Stanton, 6 Wall. 50, the Court dismissed for want of jurisdiction a bill by the State of Georgia seeking to enjoin enforcement of the Reconstruction Acts on the ground that the command by military districts which they established extinguished existing state government and replaced it with a form of government unauthorized by the Constitution:\n20\n\u00a0\n\n \"That these matters, both as stated in the body of the bill; and, in the prayers for relief, call for the judgment of the court upon political questions, and, upon rights, not of persons or property, but of a political character, will hardly be denied. For the rights for the protection of which our authority is invoked, are the rights of sovereignty, of political jurisdiction, of government, of corporate existence as a State, with all its constitutional powers and privileges. No case of private rights or private property infringed, or in danger of actual or threatened infringement, is presented by the bill, in a judicial form, for the judgment of the court.\" Id., at 77.\n21\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 289]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n5. \nThe influence of these converging considerations - the caution not to undertake decision where standards meet for judicial judgment are lacking, the reluctance to interfere with matters of state government in the absence of an unquestionable and effectively enforceable mandate, the unwillingness to make courts arbiters of the broad issues of political organization historically committed to other institutions and for whose adjustment the judicial process is ill-adapted - has been decisive of the settled line of cases, reaching back more than a century, which holds that Art. IV, 4, of the Constitution, guaranteeing to the States \"a Republican Form of Government,\"\n22\n is not enforceable through the courts. E. g., O'Neill v. Leamer, \n239 \nU.S. 244\n; Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, \n243 \nU.S. 219\n; Cochran v. Board of Education, \n281 \nU.S. 370\n; Highland Farms Dairy, Inc., v. Agnew, \n300 \nU.S. 608\n.\n23\n Claims resting on this specific \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 290]\n\u00a0\n guarantee of the Constitution have been held nonjusticiable which challenged state distribution of powers between the legislative and judicial branches, Ohio ex rel. Bryant v. Akron Metropolitan Park District, \n281 \nU.S. 74\n, state delegation of power to municipalities, Kiernan v. Portland, Oregon, \n223 \nU.S. 151\n, state adoption of the referendum as a legislative institution, Ohio ex rel. Davis v. Hildebrant, \n241 \nU.S. 565, 569\n, and state restriction upon the power of state constitutional amendment, Marshall v. Dye, \n231 \nU.S. 250, 256\n-257. The subject was fully considered in Pacific States Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Oregon, \n223 \nU.S. 118\n, in which the Court dismissed for want of jurisdiction a writ of error attacking a state license-tax statute enacted by the initiative, on the claim that this mode of legislation was inconsistent with a Republican Form of Government and violated the Equal Protection Clause and other federal guarantees. After nothing \". . . the ruinous destruction of legislative authority in matters purely political which would necessarily be occasioned by giving sanction \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 291]\n\u00a0\n to the doctrine which underlies and would be necessarily involved in sustaining the propositions contended for,\"\n24\n the Court said:\n\n \". . . [The] essentially political nature [of this claim] is at once made manifest by understanding that the assault which the contention here advanced makes it [sic] not on the tax as a tax, but on the State as a State. It is addressed to the framework and political character of the government by which the statute levying the tax was passed. It is the government, the political entity, which (reducing the case to its essence) is called to the bar of this court, not for the purpose of testing judicially some exercise of power assailed, on the ground that its exertion \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 292]\n\u00a0\n has injuriously affected the rights of an individual because of repugnancy to some constitutional limitation, but to demand of the State that it establish its right to exist as a State, republican in form.\" Id., at 150-151.\n\n\n The starting point of the doctrine applied in these cases is, of course, Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1. The case arose out of the Dorr Rebellion in Rhode Island in 1841-1842. Rhode Island, at the time of the separation from England, had not adopted a new constitution but had continued, in its existence as an independent State, under its original royal Charter, with certain statutory alterations. This frame of government provided no means for amendment of the fundamental law; the right of suffrage was to be prescribed by legislation, which limited it to freeholders. In the 1830's, largely because of the growth of towns in which there developed a propertied class whose means were not represented by freehold estates, dissatisfaction arose with the suffrage qualifications of the charter government. In addition, population shifts had caused a dated apportionment of seats in the lower house to yield substantial numerical inequality of political influence, even among qualified voters. The towns felt themselves underrepresented, and agitation began for electoral reform. When the charter government failed to respond, popular meetings of those who favored the broader suffrage were held and delegates elected to a convention which met and drafted a state constitution. This constitution provided for universal manhood suffrage (with certain qualifications); and it was to be adopted by vote of the people at elections at which a similarly expansive franchise obtained. This new scheme of government was ratified at the polls and declared effective by the convention, but the government elected and organized under it, with Dorr at its head, never came to power. The \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 293]\n\u00a0\n charter government denied the validity of the convention, the constitution and its government and, after an insignificant skirmish, routed Dorr and his followers. It meanwhile provided for the calling of its own convention, which drafted a constitution that went peacefully into effect in 1843.\n25\n\u00a0\n\nLuther v. Borden was a trespass action brought by one of Dorr's supporters in a United States Circuit Court to recover damages for the breaking and entering of his house. The defendants justified under military orders pursuant to martial law declared by the charter government, and plaintiff, by his reply, joined issue on the legality of the charter government subsequent to the adoption of the Dorr constitution. Evidence offered by the plaintiff tending to establish that the Dorr government was the rightful government of Rhode Island was rejected by the Circuit Court; the court charged the jury that the charter government was lawful; and on a verdict for defendants, plaintiff brought a writ of error to this Court.\n\nThe Court, through Mr. Chief Justice Taney, affirmed. After noting that the issue of the charter government's legality had been resolved in that government's favor by the state courts of Rhode Island - that the state courts, deeming the matter a political one unfit for judicial determination, had declined to entertain attacks upon the existence and authority of the charter government - the Chief Justice held that the courts of the United States must follow those of the State in this regard. Id., at 39-40. It was recognized that the compulsion to follow \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 294]\n\u00a0\n state law would not apply in a federal court in the face of a superior command found in the Federal Constitution, ibid., but no such command was found. The Constitution, the Court said - referring to the Guarantee Clause of the Fourth Article - \". . . as far as it has provided for an emergency of this kind, and authorized the general government to interfere in the domestic concerns of a State, has treated the subject as political in its nature, and placed the power in the hands of that department.\" Id., at 42.\n\n \"Under this article of the Constitution it rests with Congress to decide what government is the established one in a State. For as the United States guarantee to each State a republican government, Congress must necessarily decide what government is established in the State before it can determine whether it is republican or not. And when the senators and representatives of a State are admitted into the councils of the Union, the authority of the government under which they are appointed, as well as its republican character, is recognized by the proper constitutional authority. And its decision is binding on every other department of the government, and could not be questioned in a judicial tribunal. It is true that the contest in this case did not last long enough to bring the matter to this issue; and as no senators or representatives were elected under the authority of the government of which Mr. Dorr was the head, Congress was not called upon to decide the controversy. Yet the right to decide is placed there, and not in the courts.\" Ibid.\n26\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 295]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n In determining this issue non-justiciable, the Court was sensitive to the same considerations to which its later decisions have given the varied applications already discussed. It adverted to the delicacy of judicial intervention into the very structure of government.\n27\n It acknowledged that tradition had long entrusted questions of this nature to non-judicial processes,\n28\n and that judicial processes were unsuited to their decision.\n29\n The absence of guiding standards for judgment was critical, for the question whether the Dorr constitution had been rightfully adopted depended, in part, upon the extent of the franchise to be recognized - the very point of contention over which rebellion had been fought.\n\n \". . . [I]f the Circuit Court had entered upon this inquiry, by what rule could it have determined the qualification of voters upon the adoption or rejection of the proposed constitution, unless there was some previous law of the State to guide it? It is the province of a court to expound the law, not to make it. And certainly it is no part of the judicial functions of any court of the United States to prescribe the qualification of voters in a State, giving the right to those to whom it is denied by the written and established constitution and laws of the State, or taking it away from those to whom it is given; nor has it the right to determine what political privileges \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 296]\n\u00a0\n the citizens of a State are entitled to, unless there is an established constitution or law to govern its decision.\" Id., at 41.\n\n\n Mr. Justice Woodbury (who dissented with respect to the effect of martial law) agreed with the Court regarding the inappropriateness of judicial inquiry into the issues:\n\n \"But, fortunately for our freedom from political excitements in judicial duties, this court can never with propriety be called on officially to be the umpire in questions merely political. The adjustment of these questions belongs to the people and their political representatives, either in the State or general government. These questions relate to matters not to be settled on strict legal principles. They are adjusted rather by inclination, - or prejudice or compromise, often. Some of them succeed or are defeated even by public policy alone, or mere naked power, rather than intrinsic right. . . .\n\n\n \"Another evil, alarming and little foreseen, involved in regarding these as questions for the final arbitrament of judges would be, that in such an event all political privileges and rights would, in a dispute among the people, depend on our decision finally. . . . [D]isputed points in making constitutions, depending often, as before shown, on policy, inclination, popular resolves, and popular will, . . . if the people, in the distribution of powers under the constitution, should ever think of making judges supreme arbiters in political controversies, when not selected by nor, frequently, amenable to them, nor at liberty to follow such various considerations in their judgments as belong to mere political questions, they will dethrone themselves and lose one of their own invaluable birthrights; building up in this way - slowly, but surely - a new sovereign power in the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 297]\n\u00a0\n republic, in most respects irresponsible and unchangeable for life, and one more dangerous, in theory at least, than the worst elective oligarchy in the worst of times. . . .\" Id., at 51-53.\n30\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nThe present case involves all of the elements that have made the Guarantee Clause cases non-justiciable. It is, in effect, a Guarantee Clause claim masquerading under a different label. But it cannot make the case more fit for judicial action that appellants invoke the Fourteenth Amendment rather than Art. IV, 4, where, in fact, the gist of their complaint is the same - unless it can be found that the Fourteenth Amendment speaks with greater particularity to their situation. We have been admonished to avoid \"the tyranny of labels.\" Snyder v. Massachusetts, \n291 \nU.S. 97, 114\n. Art. IV, 4, is not committed by express constitutional terms to Congress. It is the nature of the controversies arising under it, nothing else, which has made it judicially unenforceable. Of course, if a controversy falls within judicial power, it depends \"on how he [the plaintiff] casts his action,\" Pan American Petroleum Corp. v. Superior Court, \n366 \nU.S. 656, 662\n, whether he brings himself within a jurisdictional statute. But where judicial competence is wanting, it cannot be created by invoking one clause of the Constitution rather than another. When what was essentially a Guarantee Clause claim was sought to be laid, as well, under the Equal Protection Clause in Pacific States Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Oregon, supra, the Court had no difficulty in \"dispelling \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 298]\n\u00a0\n any mere confusion resulting from forms of expression and considering the substance of things . . . .\" \n223 \nU.S., at 140\n.\n\nHere appellants attack \"the State as a State,\" precisely as it was perceived to be attacked in the Pacific States case, id., at 150. Their complaint is that the basis of representation of the Tennessee Legislature hurts them. They assert that \"a minority now rules in Tennessee,\" that the apportionment statute results in a \"distortion of the constitutional system,\" that the General Assembly is no longer \"a body representative of the people of the State of Tennessee,\" all \"contrary to the basic principle of representative government . . . .\" Accepting appellants' own formulation of the issue, one can know this handsaw from a hawk. Such a claim would be non-justiciable not merely under Art. IV, 4, but under any clause of the Constitution, by virtue of the very fact that a federal court is not a forum for political debate. Massachusetts v. Mellon, supra.\n\nBut appellants, of course, do not rest on this claim simpliciter. In invoking the Equal Protection Clause, they assert that the distortion of representative government complained of is produced by systematic discrimination against them, by way of \"a debasement of their votes . . . .\" Does this characterization, with due regard for the facts from which it is derived, add anything to appellants' case?\n31\n\u00a0\n\nAt first blush, this charge of discrimination based on legislative underrepresentation is given the appearance of \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 299]\n\u00a0\n a more private, less impersonal claim, than the assertion that the frame of government is askew. Appellants appear as representatives of a class that is prejudiced as a class, in contradistinction to the polity in its entirety. However, the discrimination relied on is the deprivation of what appellants conceive to be their proportionate share of political influence. This, of course, is the practical effect of any allocation of power within the institutions of government. Hardly any distribution of political authority that could be assailed as rendering government non-republican would fail similarly to operate to the prejudice of some groups, and to the advantage of others, within the body politic. It would be ingenuous not to see, or consciously blind to deny, that the real battle over the initiative and referendum, or over a delegation of power to local rather than state-wide authority, is the battle between forces whose influence is disparate among the various organs of government to whom power may be given. No shift of power but works a corresponding shift in political influence among the groups composing a society.\n\nWhat, then, is this question of legislative apportionment? Appellants invoke the right to vote and to have their votes counted.\n32\n But they are permitted to vote and their votes are counted. They go to the polls, they cast their ballots, they send their representatives to the state \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 300]\n\u00a0\n councils. Their complaint is simply that the representatives are not sufficiently numerous or powerful - in short, that Tennessee has adopted a basis of representation with which they are dissatisfied. Talk of \"debasement\" or \"dilution\" is circular talk. One cannot speak of \"debasement\" or \"dilution\" of the value of a vote until there is first defined a standard of reference as to what a vote should be worth. What is actually asked of the Court in this case is to choose among competing bases of representation - ultimately, really, among competing theories of political philosophy - in order to establish an appropriate frame of government for the State of Tennessee and thereby for all the States of the Union.\n\nIn such a matter, abstract analogies which ignore the facts of history deal in unrealities; they betray reason. This is not a case in which a State has, through a device however oblique and sophisticated, denied Negroes or Jews or redheaded persons a vote, or given them only a third or a sixth of a vote. That was Gomillion v. Lightfoot, \n364 \nU.S. 339\n. What Tennessee illustrates is an old and still widespread method of representation - representation by local geographical division, only in part respective of population - in preference to others, others, forsooth, more appealing. Appellants contest this choice and seek to make this Court the arbiter of the disagreement. They would make the Equal Protection Clause the charter of adjudication, asserting that the equality which it guarantees comports, if not the assurance of equal weight to every voter's vote, at least the basic conception that representation ought to be proportionate to population, a standard by reference to which the reasonableness of apportionment plans may be judged.\n\nTo find such a political conception legally enforceable in the broad and unspecific guarantee of equal protection is to rewrite the Constitution. See Luther v. Borden, supra. Certainly, \"equal protection\" is no more secure \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 301]\n\u00a0\n a foundation for judicial judgment of the permissibility of varying forms of representative government than is \"Republican Form.\" Indeed since \"equal protection of the laws\" can only mean an equality of persons standing in the same relation to whatever governmental action is challenged, the determination whether treatment is equal presupposes a determination concerning the nature of the relationship. This, with respect to apportionment, means an inquiry into the theoretic base of representation in an acceptably republican state. For a court could not determine the equal-protection issue without in fact first determining the Republican-Form issue, simply because what is reasonable for equal-protection purposes will depend upon what frame of government, basically, is allowed. To divorce \"equal protection\" from \"Republican Form\" is to talk about half a question.\n\nThe notion that representation proportioned to the geographic spread of population is so universally accepted as a necessary element of equality between man and man that it must be taken to be the standard of a political equality preserved by the Fourteenth Amendment - that it is, in appellants' words \"the basic principle of representative government\" - is, to put it bluntly, not true. However desirable and however desired by some among the great political thinkers and framers of our government, it has never been generally practiced, today or in the past. It was not the English system, it was not the colonial system, it was not the system chosen for the national government by the Constitution, it was not the system exclusively or even predominantly practiced by the States at the time of adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, it is not predominantly practiced by the States today. Unless judges, the judges of this Court, are to make their private views of political wisdom the measure of the Constitution - views which in all honesty cannot but give the appearance, if not reflect the reality, of \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 302]\n\u00a0\n involvement with the business of partisan politics so inescapably a part of apportionment controversies - the Fourteenth Amendment, \"itself a historical product,\" Jackman v. Rosenbaum Co., \n260 \nU.S. 22, 31\n, provides no guide for judicial oversight of the representation problem.\n\n1. Great Britain. Writing in 1958, Professor W. J. M. Mackenzie aptly summarized the British history of the principle of representation proportioned to population: \"`Equal electoral districts' formed part of the programme of radical reform in England in the 1830s, the only part of that programme which has not been realised.\"\n33\n Until the late nineteenth century, the sole base of representation (with certain exceptions not now relevant) was the local geographical unit: each county or borough returned its fixed number of members, usually two for the English units, regardless of population.\n34\n Prior to the Reform Act of 1832, this system was marked by the almost total disfranchisement of the populous northern industrial centers, which had grown to significant size at the advent of the Industrial Revolution and had not been granted borough representation, and by the existence of the rotten borough, playing its substantial part in the Crown's struggle for continued control of the Commons.\n35\n In 1831, ten southernmost English counties, numbering three and a quarter million people, had two hundred and thirty-five parliamentary representatives, while the six northernmost counties, with more than three and a half million people, had sixty-eight.\n36\n It was said that one hundred and eighty persons appointed three hundred and \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 303]\n\u00a0\n fifty members in the Commons.\n37\n Less than a half century earlier, Madison in the Federalist had remarked that half the House was returned by less than six thousand of the eight million people of England and Scotland.\n38\n\u00a0\n\nThe Act of 1832, the product of a fierce partisan political struggle and the occasion of charges of gerrymandering not without foundation,\n39\n effected eradication of only the most extreme numerical inequalities of the unreformed system. It did not adopt the principle of representation based on population, but merely disfranchised certain among the rotten borough and enfranchised most of the urban centers - still quite without regard to their relative numbers.\n40\n In the wake of the Act there remained substantial electoral inequality: the boroughs of Cornwall were represented sixteen times as weightily, judged by population, as the county's eastern division; the average ratio of seats to population in ten agricultural counties was four and a half times that in ten manufacturing divisions; Honiton, with about three thousand inhabitants, was equally represented with Liverpool, which had four hundred thousand.\n41\n In 1866 apportionment by population began to be advocated generally in the House, but was not made the basis of the redistribution of 1867, although the act of that year did apportion representation more evenly, gauged by the population standard.\n42\n Population shifts increased the surviving inequalities; by 1884 the representation ratio \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 304]\n\u00a0\n in many small boroughs was more than twenty-two times that of Birmingham or Manchester, forty-to-one disparities could be found elsewhere, and, in sum, in the 1870's and 1880's, a fourth of the electorate returned two-thirds of the members of the House.\n43\n\u00a0\n\nThe first systematic English attempt to distribute seats by population was the Redistribution Act of 1885.\n44\n The statute still left ratios of inequality of as much as seven to one,\n45\n which had increased to fifteen to one by 1912.\n46\n In 1918 Parliament again responded to \"shockingly bad\" conditions of inequality,\n47\n and to partisan political inspiration,\n48\n by redistribution.\n49\n In 1944, redistribution was put on a periodic footing by the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act of that year,\n50\n which committed a continuing primary responsibility for reapportioning the Commons to administrative agencies (Boundary Commissions for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, respectively).\n51\n The Commissions, having regard to certain rules prescribed for their guidance, are to prepare at designated intervals reports for the Home Secretary's submission to Parliament, along with the draft of an Order in Council to give effect to the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 305]\n\u00a0\n Commissions' recommendations. The districting rules adopt the basic principle of representation by population, although the principle is significantly modified by directions to respect local geographic boundaries as far as practicable, and by discretion to take account of special geographical conditions, including the size, shape and accessibility of constituencies. Under the original 1944 Act, the rules provided that (subject to the exercise of the discretion respecting special geographical conditions and to regard for the total size of the House of Commons as prescribed by the Act) so far as practicable, the single-member districts should not deviate more than twenty-five percent from the electoral quota (population divided by number of constituencies). However, apparently at the recommendation of the Boundary Commission for England, the twenty-five percent standard was eliminated as too restrictive in 1947, and replaced by the flexible provision that constituencies are to be as near the electoral quota as practicable, a rule which is expressly subordinated both to the consideration of special geographic conditions and to that of preserving local boundaries.\n52\n Free of the twenty-five percent rule, the Commissions drew up plans of distribution in which inequalities among the districts run, in ordinary cases, as high as two to one and, in the case of a few extraordinary constituencies, three to one.\n53\n The action of the Boundary Commission for England was twice challenged in the courts in 1954 - the claim being that the Commission had violated statutory rules \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 306]\n\u00a0\n prescribing the standards for its judgment - and in both cases the Judges declined to intervene. In Hammersmith Borough Council v. Boundary Commission for England,\n54\n Harman, J., was of opinion that the nature of the controversy and the scheme of the Acts made the matter inappropriate for judicial interference, and in Harper v. Home Secretary,\n55\n the Court of Appeal, per Evershed, M. R., quoting Harman, J., with approval, adverting to the wide range of discretion entrusted to the Commission under the Acts, and remarking the delicate character of the parliamentary issues in which it was sought to engage the court, reached the same conclusion.\n56\n\u00a0\n\nThe House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1958,\n57\n made two further amendments to the law. Responsive to the recommendation of the Boundary Commission for England,\n58\n the interval permitted between Commission reports was more than doubled, to a new maximum of fifteen years.\n59\n And at the suggestion of the same Commission that \"It would ease the future labours of the Commission and remove much local irritation if Rule 5 [requiring that the electorate of each constituency be as near the electoral quota as practicable] were to be so amended as to allow us to make recommendations preserving the status quo in any area where such a course appeared to be desirable and not inconsistent \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 307]\n\u00a0\n with the broad intention of the Rules,\"\n60\n the Commissions were directed to consider the inconvenience attendant upon the alteration of constituencies, and the local ties which such alteration might break. The Home Secretary's view of this amendment was that it worked to erect \"a presumption against making changes unless there is a very strong case for them.\"\n61\n\u00a0\n\n2. The Colonies and the Union. For the guiding political theorists of the Revolutionary generation, the English system of representation, in its most salient aspects of numerical inequality, was a model to be avoided, not followed.\n62\n Nevertheless, the basic English principle of apportioning representatives among the local governmental entities, towns or counties, rather than among units of approximately equal population, had early taken root in the colonies.\n63\n In some, as in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, numbers of electors were taken into account, in a rough fashion, by allotting increasing fixed quotas of representatives to several towns or classes of towns graduated by population, but in most of the colonies delegates were allowed to the local units without respect to numbers.\n64\n This resulted in grossly unequal electoral units.\n65\n The representation ratio in one North Carolina county was more than eight times that in another.\n66\n Moreover, American rotten boroughs had appeared,\n67\n and apportionment was made an instrument first in the political \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 308]\n\u00a0\n struggles between the King or the royal governors and the colonial legislatures,\n68\n and, later, between the older tidewater regions in the colonies and the growing interior.\n69\n Madison in the Philadelphia Convention adverted to the \"inequality of the Representation in the Legislatures of particular States, . . .\"\n70\n arguing that it was necessary to confer on Congress the power ultimately to regulate the times, places and manner of selecting Representatives,\n71\n in order to forestall the overrepresented counties' securing themselves a similar overrepresentation in the national councils. The example of South Carolina, where Charleston's overrepresentation was a continuing bone of contention between the tidewater and the back country, was cited by Madison in the Virginia Convention and by King in the Massachusetts Convention, in support of the same power, and King also spoke of the extreme numerical inequality arising from Connecticut's town-representation system.\n72\n\u00a0\n\nSuch inequalities survived the constitutional period. The United States Constitution itself did not largely adopt the principle of numbers. Apportionment of the national legislature among the States was one of the most difficult problems for the Convention;\n73\n its solution - involving State representation in the Senate\n74\n and the three-fifths compromise in the House\n75\n - left neither chamber apportioned proportionately to population. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 309]\n\u00a0\n Within the States, electoral power continued to be allotted to favor the tidewater.\n76\n Jefferson, in his Notes on Virginia, recorded the \"very unequal\" representation there: individual counties differing in population by a ratio of more than seventeen to one elected the same number of representatives, and those nineteen thousand of Virginia's fifty thousand men who lived between the falls of the rivers and the seacoast returned half the State's senators and almost half its delegates.\n77\n In South Carolina in 1790, the three lower districts, with a white population of less than twenty-nine thousand elected twenty senators and seventy assembly members; while in the uplands more than one hundred and eleven thousand white persons elected seventeen senators and fifty-four assemblymen.\n78\n\u00a0\n\nIn the early nineteenth century, the demands of the interior became more insistent. The apportionment quarrel in Virginia was a major factor in precipitating the calling of a constitutional convention in 1829. Bitter animosities racked the convention, threatening the State with disunion. At last a compromise which gave the three hundred and twenty thousand people of the west thirteen senators, as against the nineteen senators returned by the three hundred sixty-three thousand people of the east, commanded agreement. It was adopted at the polls but left the western counties so dissatisfied that there were threats of revolt and realignment with the State of Maryland.\n79\n\u00a0\n\nMaryland, however, had her own numerical disproportions. In 1820, one representative vote in Calvert County \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 310]\n\u00a0\n was worth five in Frederick County, and almost two hundred thousand people were represented by eighteen members, while fifty thousand others elected twenty.\n80\n This was the result of the county-representation system of allotment. And, except for Massachusetts which, after a long struggle, did adopt representation by population at the mid-century, a similar town-representation principle continued to prevail in various forms throughout New England, with all its attendant, often gross inequalities.\n81\n\u00a0\n\n3. The States at the time of ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, and those later admitted. The several state conventions throughout the first half of the nineteenth century were the scenes of fierce sectional and party strifes respecting the geographic allocation of representation.\n82\n Their product was a wide variety of apportionment methods which recognized the element of population in differing ways and degrees. Particularly pertinent to appraisal of the contention that the Fourteenth Amendment embodied a standard limiting the freedom of the States with regard to the principles and bases of local legislative apportionment is an examination of the apportionment provisions of the thirty-three States which ratified the Amendment between 1866 and 1870, at their respective times of ratification. These may be considered in two groups: (A) the ratifying States other than the ten Southern States whose constitutions, at the time of ratification or shortly thereafter, were the work of the Reconstruction Act conventions;\n83\n and \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 311]\n\u00a0\n (B) the ten Reconstruction-Act States. All thirty-three are significant, because they demonstrate how unfounded is the assumption that the ratifying States could have agreed on a standard apportionment theory or practice, and how baseless the suggestion that by voting for the Equal Protection Clause they sought to establish a test mold for apportionment which - if appellants' argument is sound - struck down sub silentio not a few of their own state constitutional provisions. But the constitutions of the ten Reconstruction-Act States have an added importance, for it is scarcely to be thought that the Congress which was so solicitous for the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment as to make the readmission of the late rebel States to Congress turn on their respective ratifications of it, would have approved constitutions which - again, under appellants' theory - contemporaneously offended the Amendment.\n\nA. Of the twenty-three ratifying States of the first group, seven or eight had constitutions which demanded or allowed apportionment of both houses on the basis of population,\n84\n unqualifiedly or with only qualifications respecting the preservation of local boundaries.\n85\n Three \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 312]\n\u00a0\n more apportioned on what was essentially a population base, but provided that in one house counties having a specified fraction of a ratio - a moiety or two-thirds - should have a representative.\n86\n Since each of these three States limited the size of their chambers, the fractional rule could operate - and, at least in Michigan, has in fact operated\n87\n - to produce substantial numerical inequalities \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 313]\n\u00a0\n in favor of the sparsely populated counties.\n88\n Iowa favored her small counties by the rule that no more than four counties might be combined in a representative district,\n89\n and New York and Kansas compromised population and county-representation principles by assuring every county, regardless of the number of its inhabitants, at least one seat in their respective Houses.\n90\n\u00a0\n\nOhio and Maine recognized the factor of numbers by a different device. The former gave a House representative to each county having half a ratio, two representatives for a ratio and three-quarters, three representatives for three ratios, and a single additional representative for each additional ratio.\n91\n The latter, after apportioning among counties on a population base, gave each town of fifteen hundred inhabitants one representative, each town of three thousand, seven hundred and fifty inhabitants two representatives, and so on in increasing intervals to twenty-six thousand, two hundred and fifty inhabitants - towns of that size or larger receiving the maximum permitted number of representatives: seven.\n92\n The departure from numerical equality under these systems is apparent: in Maine, assuming the incidence of towns in \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 314]\n\u00a0\n all categories, representative ratios would differ by factors of two and a half to one, at a minimum. Similarly, Missouri gave each of its counties, however small, one representative, two representatives for three ratios, three representatives for six ratios, and one additional representative for each three ratios above six.\n93\n New Hampshire allotted a representative to each town of one hundred and fifty ratable male polls of voting age and one more representative for each increment of three hundred above that figure;\n94\n its Senate was not apportioned by population but among districts based on the proportion of direct taxes paid.\n95\n In Pennsylvania, the basis of apportionment in both houses was taxable inhabitants; and in the House every county of at least thirty-five hundred taxables had a representative, nor could more than three counties be joined in forming a representative district; while in the Senate no city or county could have more than four of the State's twenty-five to thirty-three senators.\n96\n\u00a0\n\nFinally, four States apportioned at least one House with no regard whatever to population. In Connecticut\n97\n and Vermont\n98\n representation in the House was on a town basis; Rhode Island gave one senator to each of its towns or cities,\n99\n and New Jersey, one to each of its counties.\n100\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 315]\n\u00a0\n Nor, in any of these States, was the other House apportioned on a strict principle of equal numbers: Connecticut gave each of its counties a minimum of two senators\n101\n and Vermont, one;\n102\n New Jersey assured each county a representative;\n103\n and in Rhode Island, which gave at least one representative to each town or city, no town or city could have more than one-sixth of the total number in the House.\n104\n\u00a0\n\nB. Among the ten late Confederate States affected by the Reconstruction Acts, in only four did it appear that apportionment of both state legislative houses would or might be based strictly on population.\n105\n In North Carolina,\n106\n South Carolina,\n107\n Louisiana,\n108\n and Alabama,\n109\n each county (in the case of Louisiana, each parish) was assured at least one seat in the lower House irrespective of numbers - a distribution which exhausted, respectively, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 316]\n\u00a0\n on the basis of the number of then-existing counties, three-quarters, one-quarter, two-fifths and three-fifths of the maximum possible number of representatives, before a single seat was available for assignment on a population basis; and in South Carolina, moreover, the Senate was composed of one member elected from each county, except that Charleston sent two.\n110\n In Florida's House, each county had one seat guaranteed and an additional seat for every thousand registered voters up to a maximum of four representatives;\n111\n while Georgia, whose Senate seats were distributed among forty-four single-member districts each composed of three contiguous counties,\n112\n assigned representation in its House as follows: three seats to each of the six most populous counties, two to each of the thirty-one next most populous, one to each of the remaining ninety-five.\n113\n As might be expected, the one-representative-per-county minimum pattern has proved incompatible with numerical equality,\n114\n and Georgia's \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 317]\n\u00a0\n county-clustering system has produced representative-ratio disparities, between the largest and smallest counties, of more than sixty to one.\n115\n\u00a0\n\nC. The constitutions\n116\n of the thirteen States which Congress admitted to the Union after the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment showed a similar pattern. Six of them required or permitted apportionment of both Houses by population, subject only to qualifications concerning local boundaries.\n117\n Wyoming, apportioning by population, guaranteed to each of its counties at least one seat in each House,\n118\n and Idaho, which prescribed (after the first legislative session) that apportionment should be \"as may be provided by law,\" gave each county at least one representative.\n119\n In Oklahoma, House members were apportioned among counties so as to give one \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 318]\n\u00a0\n seat for half a ratio, two for a ratio and three-quarters, and one for each additional ratio up to a maximum of seven representatives per county.\n120\n Montana required reapportionment of its House on the basis of periodic enumerations according to ratios to be fixed by law\n121\n but its counties were represented as counties in the Senate, each county having one senator.\n122\n Alaska\n123\n and Hawaii\n124\n each apportioned a number of senators among constitutionally fixed districts; their respective Houses were to be periodically reapportioned by population, subject to a moiety rule in Alaska\n125\n and to Hawaii's guarantee of one representative to each of four constitutionally designated areas.\n126\n The Arizona Constitution assigned representation to each county in each house, giving one or two senators and from one to seven representatives to each, and making no provision for reapportionment.\n127\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 319]\n\u00a0\n\n\n4. Contemporary apportionment. Detailed recent studies are available to describe the present-day constitutional and statutory status of apportionment in the fifty States.\n128\n They demonstrate a decided twentieth-century trend away from population as the exclusive base of representation. Today, only a dozen state constitutions provide for periodic legislative reapportionment of both houses by a substantially unqualified application of the population standard,\n129\n and only about a dozen more prescribe such reapportionment for even a single chamber. \"Specific provision for county representation in at least one house of the state legislature has been increasingly adopted since the end of the 19th century. . . .\"\n130\n More than twenty States now guarantee each county at least one seat in one of their houses regardless of population, and in nine others county or town units are given equal representation in one legislative branch, whatever the number of each unit's inhabitants. Of course, numerically considered, \"These provisions invariably result in over-representation of the least populated areas. . . .\"\n131\n And in an effort to curb the political dominance of metropolitan regions, at least ten States now limit the maximum entitlement of any single county (or, in some cases, city) \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 320]\n\u00a0\n in one legislative house - another source of substantial numerical disproportion.\n132\n\u00a0\n\nMoreover, it is common knowledge that the legislatures have not kept reapportionment up to date, even where state constitutions in terms require it.\n133\n In particular, the pattern of according greater per capita representation to rural, relatively sparsely populated areas - the same pattern which finds expression in various state constitutional provisions,\n134\n and which has been given effect in England and elsewhere\n135\n - has, in some of the States, been made the law by legislative inaction in the face of \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 321]\n\u00a0\n population shifts.\n136\n Throughout the country, urban and suburban areas tend to be given higher representation ratios than do rural areas.\n137\n\u00a0\n\nThe stark fact is that if among the numerous widely varying principles and practices that control state legislative apportionment today there is any generally prevailing feature, that feature is geographic inequality in relation to the population standard.\n138\n Examples could be endlessly multiplied. In New Jersey, counties of \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 322]\n\u00a0\n thirty-five thousand and of more than nine hundred and five thousand inhabitants respectively each have a single senator.\n139\n Representative districts in Minnesota range from 7,290 inhabitants to 107,246 inhabitants.\n140\n Ratios of senatorial representation in California vary as much as two hundred and ninety-seven to one.\n141\n In Oklahoma, the range is ten to one for House constituencies and roughly sixteen to one for Senate constituencies.\n142\n Colebrook, Connecticut - population 592 - elects two House representatives; Hartford - population 177,397 - also elects two.\n143\n The first, third and fifth of these examples are the products of constitutional provisions which subordinate population to regional considerations in apportionment; the second is the result of legislative inaction; the fourth derives from both constitutional and legislative sources. A survey made in 1955, in sum, reveals that less than thirty percent of the population inhabit districts sufficient to elect a House majority in thirteen States and a Senate majority in nineteen States.\n144\n These figures show more than individual variations from a generally accepted standard of electoral equality. They show that there is not - as there has never been - a standard by \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 323]\n\u00a0\n which the place of equality as a factor in apportionment can be measured.\n\nManifestly, the Equal Protection Clause supplies no clearer guide for judicial examination of apportionment methods than would the Guarantee Clause itself. Apportionment, by its character, is a subject of extraordinary complexity, involving - even after the fundamental theoretical issues concerning what is to be represented in a representative legislature have been fought out or compromised - considerations of geography, demography, electoral convenience, economic and social cohesions or divergencies among particular local groups, communications, the practical effects of political institutions like the lobby and the city machine, ancient traditions and ties of settled usage, respect for proven incumbents of long experience and senior status, mathematical mechanics, censuses compiling relevant data, and a host of others.\n145\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 324]\n\u00a0\n Legislative responses throughout the country to the reapportionment demands of the 1960 Census have glaringly confirmed that these are not factors that lend themselves to evaluations of a nature that are the staple of judicial determinations or for which judges are equipped to adjudicate by legal training or experience or native wit. And this is the more so true because in every strand of this complicated, intricate web of values meet the contending forces of partisan politics.\n146\n The practical significance of apportionment is that the next election results may differ because of it. Apportionment battles are overwhelmingly party or intra-party contests.\n147\n It will add a virulent source of friction and tension in federal-state relations to embroil the federal judiciary in them.\n148\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 325]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\nAppellants, however, contend that the federal courts may provide the standard which the Fourteenth Amendment lacks by reference to the provisions of the constitution of Tennessee. The argument is that although the same or greater disparities of electoral strength may be suffered to exist immune from federal judicial review in States where they result from apportionment legislation consistent with state constitutions, the Tennessee Legislature may not abridge the rights which, on its face, its own constitution appears to give, without by that act denying equal protection of the laws. It is said that the law of Tennessee, as expressed by the words of its written constitution, has made the basic choice among policies in favor of representation proportioned to population, and that it is no longer open to the State to allot its voting power on other principles.\n\nThis reasoning does not bear analysis. Like claims invoking state constitutional requirement have been rejected here and for good reason. It is settled that whatever federal consequences may derive from a discrimination worked by a state statute must be the same as if the same discrimination were written into the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 326]\n\u00a0\n State's fundamental law. Nashville, C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Browning, \n310 \nU.S. 362\n. And see Castillo v. McConnico, \n168 \nU.S. 674\n; Coulter v. Louisville & N. R. Co., \n196 \nU.S. 599, 608\n-609; Owensboro Waterworks Co. v. Owensboro, \n200 \nU.S. 38\n; Hebert v. Louisiana, \n272 \nU.S. 312, 316\n-317; Snowden v. Hughes, \n321 \nU.S. 1, 11\n. Appellants complain of a practice which, by their own allegations, has been the law of Tennessee for sixty years. They allege that the Apportionment Act of 1901 created unequal districts when passed and still maintains unequal districts. They allege that the Legislature has since 1901 purposefully retained unequal districts. And the Supreme Court of Tennessee has refused to invalidate the law establishing these unequal districts. Kidd v. McCanless, 200 Tenn. 273, 292 S. W. 2d 40; appeal dismissed here in \n352 \nU.S. 920\n. In these circumstances, what was said in the Browning case, supra, at 369, clearly governs this case:\n\n\". . . Here, according to petitioner's own claim, all the organs of the state are conforming to a practice, systematic, unbroken for more than forty years, and now questioned for the first time. It would be a narrow conception of jurisprudence to confine the notion of `laws' to what is found written on the statute books, and to disregard the gloss which life has written upon it. Settled state practice cannot supplant constitutional guarantees, but it can establish what is state law. The Equal Protection Clause did not write an empty formalism into the Constitution. Deeply embedded traditional ways of carrying out state policy, such as those of which petitioner complains, are often tougher and truer law than the dead words of the written text. . . . [T]he Equal Protection Clause is not a command of candor. . . .\" \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 327]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Tennessee's law and its policy respecting apportionment are what 60 years of practice show them to be, not what appellants cull from the unenforced and, according to its own judiciary, unenforceable words of its Constitution. The statute comes here on the same footing, therefore, as would the apportionment laws of New Jersey, California or Connecticut,\n149\n and is unaffected by its supposed repugnance to the state constitutional language on which appellants rely.\n150\n\u00a0\n\nIn another aspect, however, the Kidd v. McCanless case, supra, introduces a factor peculiar to this litigation, which only emphasizes the duty of declining the exercise of federal judicial jurisdiction. In all of the apportionment cases which have come before the Court, a consideration which has been weighty in determining their non-justiciability has been the difficulty or impossibility of devising effective judicial remedies in this class of case. An injunction restraining a general election unless the legislature reapportions would paralyze the critical centers of a State's political system and threaten political dislocation whose consequences are not foreseeable. A declaration devoid \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 328]\n\u00a0\n of implied compulsion of injunctive or other relief would be an idle threat.\n151\n Surely a Federal District Court could not itself remap the State: the same complexities which impede effective judicial review of apportionment a fortiori make impossible a court's consideration of these imponderables as an original matter. And the choice of elections at large as opposed to elections by district, however unequal the districts, is a matter of sweeping political judgment having enormous political implications, the nature and reach of which are certainly beyond the informed understanding of, and capacity for appraisal by, courts.\n\nIn Tennessee, moreover, the McCanless case has closed off several among even these unsatisfactory and dangerous modes of relief. That case was a suit in the state courts attacking the 1901 Reapportionment Act and seeking a declaration and an injunction of the Act's enforcement or, alternatively, a writ of mandamus compelling state election officials to hold the elections at large, or, again alternatively, a decree of the court reapportioning the State. The Chancellor denied all coercive relief, but entertained the suit for the purpose of rendering a declaratory judgment. It was his view that despite an invalidation of the statute under which the present legislature was elected, that body would continue to possess de facto authority to reapportion, and that therefore the maintaining of the suit did not threaten the disruption of the government. The Tennessee Supreme Court agreed that no coercive relief could be granted; in particular, it said, \"There is no provision of law for election of our General Assembly by an election at large over the State.\" 200 Tenn., at 277, 292 S. W. 2d, at 42. Thus, a legislature elected at \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 329]\n\u00a0\n large would not be the legally constituted legislative authority of the State. The court reversed, however, the Chancellor's determination to give declaratory relief, holding that the ground of demurrer which asserted that a striking down of the statute would disrupt the orderly process of government should have been sustained:\n\n \"(4) It seems obvious and we therefore hold that if the Act of 1901 is to be declared unconstitutional, then the de facto doctrine cannot be applied to maintain the present members of the General Assembly in office. If the Chancellor is correct in holding that this statute has expired by the passage of the decade following its enactment then for the same reason all prior apportionment acts have expired by a like lapse of time and are non-existent. Therefore we would not only not have any existing members of the General Assembly but we would have no apportionment act whatever under which a new election could be held for the election of members to the General Assembly.\n\n\n  .  .  .  . .\n\n\n \"The ultimate result of holding this Act unconstitutional by reason of the lapse of time would be to deprive us of the present Legislature and the means of electing a new one and ultimately bring about the destruction of the State itself.\" 200 Tenn., at 281-282, 292 S. W. 2d, at 44.\n\n\n A federal court enforcing the Federal Constitution is not, to be sure, bound by the remedial doctrines of the state courts. But it must consider as pertinent to the propriety or impropriety of exercising its jurisdiction those state-law effects of its decree which it cannot itself control. A federal court cannot provide the authority requisite to make a legislature the proper governing body of the State of Tennessee. And it cannot be doubted that the striking \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 330]\n\u00a0\n down of the statute here challenged on equal protection grounds, no less than on grounds of failure to reapportion decennially, would deprive the State of all valid apportionment legislation and - under the ruling in McCanless - deprive the State of an effective law-based legislative branch. Just such considerations, among others here present, were determinative in Luther v. Borden and the Oregon initiative cases.\n152\n\u00a0\n\nAlthough the District Court had jurisdiction in the very restricted sense of power to determine whether it could adjudicate the claim, the case is of that class of political controversy which, by the nature of its subject, is unfit for federal judicial action. The judgment of the District Court, in dismissing the complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted, should therefore be affirmed.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] It is worth reminding that the problem of legislative apportionment is not one dividing North and South. Indeed, in the present House of Representatives, for example, Michigan's congressional districts are far less representative of the numbers of inhabitants, according to the 1960 census, than are Louisiana's. Michigan's Sixteenth District, which is 93.1% urban, contains 802,994 persons and its Twelfth, which is 47.6% urban, contains 177,431 - one-fifth as many persons. Louisiana's most populous district, the Sixth, is 53.6% urban and contains 536,029 persons, and its least populous, the Eighth, 36.7% urban, contains 263,850 - nearly half. Gross disregard of any assumption that our political system implies even approximation to the notion that individual votes in the various districts within a State should have equal weight is as true, e. g., of California, Illinois, and Ohio as it is of Georgia. See United States Department of Commerce, Census Release, February 24, 1962, CB62-23.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Wood v. Broom, \n287 \nU.S. 1\n; Colegrove v.

A. 7th Cir.).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Although the motion to intervene by the Mayor of Nashville asserted an interest in the litigation in only a representative capacity, the complaint which he subsequently filed set forth that he was a qualified voter who also sued in his own behalf. The municipalities of Knoxville and Chattanooga purport to represent their residents. Since the claims of the municipal intervenors do not differ materially from those of the parties who sue as individual voters, the Court need not now determine whether the municipalities are proper parties to this proceeding. See, e. g., Stewart v. Kansas City, \n239 \nU.S. 14\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The original complaint named as defendants Tennessee's Secretary of State, Attorney General, Coordinator of Elections, and the three members of the State Board of Elections, seeking to make the Board members representatives of all the State's County Election Commissioners. The prayer in an intervening complaint by the City of Knoxville, that the Commissioners of Elections of Knox County be added as parties defendant seems not to have been acted on by the court below. Defendants moved to dismiss, inter alia, on the ground \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 272]\n\u00a0\n of failure to join indispensable parties, and they argue in this Court that only the County Election Commissioners of the ninety-five counties are the effective administrators of Tennessee's elections laws, and that none of the defendants have substantial duties in connection therewith. The District Court deferred ruling on this ground of the motion. Inasmuch as it involves questions of local law more appropriately decided by judges sitting in Tennessee than by this Court, and since in any event the failure to join County Election Commissioners in this action looking to prospective relief could be corrected, if necessary, by amendment of the complaints, the issue does not concern the Court on this appeal.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Jurisdiction is predicated upon R. S. 1979, 42 U.S.C. 1983, and 28 U.S.C. 1343 (3).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] However, counties having two-thirds of the ratio required for a Representative are entitled to seat one member in the House, and there are certain geographical restrictions upon the formation of Senate districts. The applicable provisions of Article II of the Tennessee Constitution are:\n\n\"Sec. 4. Census. - An enumeration of the qualified voters, and an apportionment of the Representatives in the General Assembly, shall be made in the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy-one, and within every subsequent term of ten years.\"\n\n\n\"Sec. 5. Apportionment of representatives. - The number of Representatives shall, at the several periods of making the enumeration, be apportioned among the several counties or districts, according to the number of qualified voters in each; and shall not exceed seventy-five, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 273]\n\u00a0\n until the population of the State shall be one million and a half, and shall never exceed ninety-nine; Provided that any county having two-thirds of the ratio shall be entitled to one member.\"\n\n\n\"Sec. 6. Apportionment of senators. - The number of Senators shall, at the several periods of making the enumeration, be apportioned among the several counties or districts according to the number of qualified electors in each, and shall not exceed one-third the number of representatives. In apportioning the Senators among the different counties, the fraction that may be lost by any county or counties, in the apportionment of members to the House of Representatives, shall be made up to such county or counties in the Senate, as near as may be practicable. When a district is composed of two or more counties, they shall be adjoining; and no county shall be divided in forming a district.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] It is alleged that certain amendments to the Act of 1901 made only minor modifications of that Act, adjusting the boundaries of individual districts in a manner not material to plaintiffs' claims.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The exhibits do not reveal the source of the population figures which they set forth, but it appears that the figures were taken from the United States Census of Population, 1950, Volume II, Part 42 (Tennessee), Table 41, at 76-91. These census figures represent the total population over twenty-one years of age in each Tennessee county; they do not purport to enumerate \"qualified voters\" or \"qualified electors,\" the measure of apportionment prescribed by the Tennessee Constitution. See note 5, supra. To qualify to vote in Tennessee, in addition to fulfilling the age requirement, an individual must be a citizen of the United States, a resident of the State for twelve months and of the county where he offers his vote for six months next preceding the election, and must not be under the disqualification \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 275]\n\u00a0\n attaching to conviction for certain offenses. Tenn. Code Ann., 1955, 2-201, 2-205. The statistics found in the United States Census of Population, 1950, Volume II, Part 42 (Tennessee), Table 42, at 92-97, suggest that the residence requirement, in particular, may be an unknown variable of considerable significance. Appellants do not suggest a means by which a court, on the basis of the federal census figures, can determine the number of qualified voters in the various Tennessee counties.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] The \"county aid funds\" derived from a portion of a state gasoline privilege tax, for example, are distributed among the counties as follows: one-half equally among the ninety-five counties, one-quarter on the basis of area, one-quarter on the basis of population, to be used by county authorities in the building, repairing and improving of county roads and bridges. Tenn. Code Ann., 1955, 54-403. Appellants urge that this distribution is discriminatory.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Plaintiffs also suggested, as an alternative to at-large elections, that the District Court might itself redistrict the State. They did not, however, expressly pray such relief.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] See Bickel, Foreword: The Passive Virtues, 75 Harv. L. Rev. 40, 45 et seq. (1961).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] See, e. g., United States v. Palmer, 3 Wheat. 610, 634, 635; The Divina Pastora, 4 Wheat. 52; Williams v. Suffolk Ins. Co., 13 Pet. 415; Kennett v.

Arredondo, 6 Pet. 691. Of course, judgment concerning the \"political\" nature of even a controversy affecting the Nation's foreign affairs is not a simple mechanical matter, and certain of the Court's decisions have accorded scant weight to the consideration of unity of action in the conduct of external relations. Compare Vermilya-Brown Co. v. Connell, \n335 \nU.S. 377\n, with United States v. Pink, \n315 \nU.S. 203\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] Obviously, this is the equivalent of saying that the characteristics are not \"constitutionally requisite\" in a judicially enforceable sense. The recognition of their necessity as a condition of legislation is left, as is observance of certain other constitutional commands, to the conscience of the non-judicial organs. Cf. Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] Also compare the Coleman case and United States v. Sprague, \n282 \nU.S. 716\n, with Hawke v. Smith (No. 1), \n253 \nU.S. 221\n. See the National Prohibition Cases, \n253 \nU.S. 350\n; and consider the Court's treatment of the several contentions in Leser v. Garnett, \n258 \nU.S. 130\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] E. g., Myers v.

The action for damages for improperly rejecting an elector's vote had been given by the English law since the time of Ashby v. White, 1 Brown's Cases in Parliament 62; 2 Ld. Raym. 938; 3 Ld. Raym. 320, a case which in its own day precipitated an intra-parliamentary war of major dimensions. See 6 Hansard, Parliamentary History of England (1810), 225-324, 376-436. Prior to the racial-discrimination cases, this Court had recognized the action, by implication, in dictum in Swafford v. Templeton, \n185 \nU.S. 487\n, and Wiley v. Sinkler, \n179 \nU.S. 58\n, both respecting federal elections.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] Cf. Gomillion v.

Georgia, 5 Pet. 1, 20, 28 (Mr. Justice Johnson, concurring), 51 and 75 (Mr. Justice Thompson, dissenting).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] This was an alternative ground of Chief Justice Marshall's opinion for the Court. Id., at 20. The question which Marshall reserved as \"unnecessary to decide,\" ibid., was not the justiciability of the bill \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 288]\n\u00a0\n in this aspect, but the \"more doubtful\" question whether that \"part of the bill which respects the land occupied by the Indians, and prays the aid of the court to protect their possession,\" might be entertained. Ibid. Mr. Justice Johnson, concurring, found the controversy non-justiciable and would have put the ruling solely on this ground, id., at 28, and Mr. Justice Thompson, in dissent, agreed that much of the matter in the bill was not fit for judicial determination. Id., at 51, 75.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] Cf. Mississippi v. Johnson, 4 Wall. 475.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 21\n] Considerations similar to those which determined the Cherokee Nation case and Georgia v. Stanton no doubt explain the celebrated decision in Nabob of the Carnatic v. East India Co., 1 Ves. jun. *371; 2 Ves. jun. *56, rather than any attribution of a portion of British sovereignty, in respect of Indian affairs, to the company. The reluctance of the English Judges to involve themselves in contests of factional political power is of ancient standing. In The Duke \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 289]\n\u00a0\n of York's Claim to the Crown, 5 Rotuli Parl. 375, printed in Wambaugh, Cases on Constitutional Law (1915), 1, the role which the Judges were asked to play appears to have been rather that of advocates than of judges, but the answer which they returned to the Lords relied on reasons equally applicable to either role.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 22\n] \"The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against Invasion; and on Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened) against domestic Violence.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 23\n] Cf. the cases holding that the Fourteenth Amendment imposes no such restriction upon the form of a State's governmental organization as will permit persons affected by government action to complain that in its organization principles of separation of powers have been violated. E. g., Dreyer v. Illinois, \n187 \nU.S. 71\n; Soliah v. Heskin, \n222 \nU.S. 522\n; Houck v. Little River Drainage District, \n239 \nU.S. 254\n. The same consistent refusal of this Court to find that the Federal Constitution restricts state power to design the structure of state political institutions is reflected in the cases rejecting claims arising out of the States' creation, alteration, or destruction of local \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 290]\n\u00a0\n subdivisions or their powers, insofar as these claims are made by the subdivisions themselves, see Laramie County v. Albany County, \n92 \nU.S. 307\n; Pawhuska v. Pawhuska Oil & Gas Co., \n250 \nU.S. 394\n; Trenton v. New Jersey, \n262 \nU.S. 182\n; Risty v. Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 378, 389\n-390; Williams v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, \n289 \nU.S. 36\n, or by the whole body of their residents who share only a general, undifferentiated interest in their preservation. See Hunter v. Pittsburgh, \n207 \nU.S. 161\n. The policy is also given effect by the denial of \"standing\" to persons seeking to challenge state action as infringing the interest of some separate unit within the State's administrative structure - a denial which precludes the arbitrament by federal courts of what are only disputes over the local allocation of government functions and powers. See, e. g., Smith v. Indiana, \n191 \nU.S. 138\n; Braxton County Court v. West Virginia, \n208 \nU.S. 192\n; Marshall v. Dye, \n231 \nU.S. 250\n; Stewart v.

[T]he contention, if held to be sound, would necessarily affect the validity, not only of the particular statute which is before us, but of every other statute passed in Oregon since the adoption of the initiative and referendum. And indeed the propositions go further than this, since in their essence they assert that there is no governmental function, legislative or judicial, in Oregon, because it cannot be assumed, if the proposition be well founded, that there is at one and the same time one and the same government which is republican in form and not of that character.\" Compare Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1, 38-39:\n\n\". . . For, if this court is authorized to enter upon this inquiry as proposed by the plaintiff, and it should be decided that the charter government had no legal existence during the period of time above mentioned, - if it had been annulled by the adoption of the opposing government, - then the laws passed by its legislature during that time were nullities; its taxes wrongfully collected; its salaries and compensation to its officers illegally paid; its public accounts improperly settled; and the judgments and sentences of its courts in civil and criminal cases null and void, and the officers who carried their decisions into operation answerable as trespassers, if not in some cases as criminals.\n\n\n\"When the decision of this court might lead to such results, it becomes its duty to examine very carefully its own powers before it undertakes to exercise jurisdiction.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 25\n] See Bowen, The Recent Contest in Rhode Island (1844); Frieze, A Concise History of the Efforts to Obtain an Extension of Suffrage in Rhode Island; From the Year 1811 to 1842 (2d ed. 1842); Mowry, The Dorr War (1901); Wayland, The Affairs of Rhode Island (2d ed. 1842).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 26\n] The Court reasoned, with respect to the guarantee against domestic violence also contained in Art. IV, 4, that this, too, was an authority committed solely to Congress; that Congress had empowered the President, not the courts, to enforce it; and that it \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 295]\n\u00a0\n was inconceivable that the courts should assume a power to make determinations in the premises which might conflict with those of the Executive. It noted further that, in fact, the President had recognized the governor of the charter government as the lawful authority in Rhode Island, although it had been unnecessary to call out the militia in his support.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 27\n] See note 24, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 28\n] Id., at 39, 46-47.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 29\n] Id., at 41-42.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 30\n] In evaluating the Court's determination not to inquire into the authority of the charter government, it must be remembered that, throughout the country, Dorr \"had received the sympathy of the Democratic press. His cause, therefore, became distinctly a party issue.\" 2 Warren, The Supreme Court in United States History (Rev. ed. 1937), 186.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 31\n] Appellants also allege discrimination in the legislature's allocation of certain tax burdens and benefits. Whether or not such discrimination would violate the Equal Protection Clause if the tax statutes were challenged in a proper proceeding, see Dane v. Jackson, \n256 \nU.S. 589\n; cf. Nashville, C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Wallace, \n288 \nU.S. 249, 268\n, these recitative allegations do not affect the nature of the controversy which appellants' complaints present.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 32\n] Appellants would find a \"right\" to have one's ballot counted on authority of United States v. Mosley, \n238 \nU.S. 383\n; United States v. Classic, \n313 \nU.S. 299\n; United States v. Saylor, \n322 \nU.S. 385\n. All that these cases hold is that conspiracies to commit certain sharp election practices which, in a federal election, cause ballots not to receive the weight which the law has in fact given them, may amount to deprivations of the constitutionally secured right to vote for federal officers. But see United States v. Bathgate, \n246 \nU.S. 220\n. The cases do not so much as suggest that there exists a constitutional limitation upon the relative weight to which the law might properly entitle respective ballots, even in federal elections.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 33\n] Mackenzie, Free Elections (1958) (hereafter, Mackenzie), 108.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 34\n] Ogg, English Government and Politics (2d ed. 1936) (hereafter, Ogg), 248-250, 257; Seymour, Electoral Reform in England and Wales (1915) (hereafter, Seymour), 46-47.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 35\n] Ogg 257-259; Seymour 45-52; Carpenter, The Development of American Political Thought (1930) (hereafter, Carpenter), 45-46.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 36\n] Ogg 258.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 37\n] Seymour 51.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 38\n] The Federalist, No. 56 (Wright ed. 1961), at 382.

XV, 13, provided that the federal censuses and interim state decennial enumerations should serve as the bases of representation for both houses, but did not expressly require either numerical equality or reapportionment at fixed intervals.\n\nSeveral of these constitutions contain provisions which forbid splitting counties or which otherwise require recognition of local boundaries. See, e. g., the severe restriction in Ill. Const., 1848, Art. III, 9. Such provisions will almost inevitably produce numerical inequalities. See, for example, University of Oklahoma, Bureau of Government Research, Legislative Apportionment in Oklahoma (1956), 21-23. However, because their effect in this regard will turn on idiosyncratic local factors, and because other constitutional provisions are a more significant source of inequality, these provisions are here disregarded.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 86\n] Tenn. Const., 1834, Art. II, 4 to 6 (two-thirds of a ratio entitles a county to one representative in the House); W. Va. Const., 1861-1863, Art.

IV, 2 to 4 (one-half of a ratio entitles each county thereafter organized to one representative in the House). In Oregon and Iowa a major-fraction rule applied which gave a House seat not only to counties having a moiety of a single ratio, but to all counties having more than half a ratio in excess of the multiple of a ratio.

State-court adjudication does not involve the delicate problems of federal-state relations which would inhere in the exercise of federal judicial power to impose restrictions upon the States' shaping of their own governmental institutions. Moreover, state constitutions generally speak with a specificity totally lacking in attempted utilization of the generalities of the Fourteenth Amendment to apportionment matters. Some expressly commit apportionment to state judicial review, see, e. g., N. Y. Const., 1938, Art. III, 5, and even where they do not, they do precisely fix the criteria for judicial judgment respecting the allocation of representative strength within the electorate. See, e. g., Asbury Park Press. Inc., v. Woolley. 33 N. J. 1, 161 A. 2d 705.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 151\n] Appellants' suggestion that, although no relief may need be given, jurisdiction ought to be retained as a \"spur\" to legislative action does not merit discussion.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 152\n] See note 24, supra.\n\nDissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER joins.\n\nThe dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, in which I join, demonstrates the abrupt departure the majority makes from judicial history by putting the federal courts into this area of state concerns - an area which, in this instance, the Tennessee state courts themselves have refused to enter.\n\nIt does not detract from his opinion to say that the panorama of judicial history it unfolds, though evincing a steadfast underlying principle of keeping the federal courts out of these domains, has a tendency, because of variants in expression, to becloud analysis in a given case. With due respect to the majority, I think that has happened here.\n\nOnce one cuts through the thicket of discussion devoted to \"jurisdiction,\" \"standing,\" \"justiciability,\" and \"political \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 331]\n\u00a0\n question,\" there emerges a straightforward issue which, in my view, is determinative of this case. Does the complaint disclose a violation of a federal constitutional right, in other words, a claim over which a United States District Court would have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1343 (3) and 42 U.S.C. 1983? The majority opinion does not actually discuss this basic question, but, as one concurring Justice observes, seems to decide it \"sub silentio.\" Ante, p. 261. However, in my opinion, appellants' allegations, accepting all of them as true, do not, parsed down or as a whole, show an infringement by Tennessee of any rights assured by the Fourteenth Amendment. Accordingly, I believe the complaint should have been dismissed for \"failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" Fed. Rules Civ. Proc., Rule 12 (b) (6).\n\nIt is at once essential to recognize this case for what it is. The issue here relates not to a method of state electoral apportionment by which seats in the federal House of Representatives are allocated, but solely to the right of a State to fix the basis of representation in its own legislature. Until it is first decided to what extent that right is limited by the Federal Constitution, and whether what Tennessee has done or failed to do in this instance runs afoul of any such limitation, we need not reach the issues of \"justiciability\" or \"political question\" or any of the other considerations which in such cases as Colegrove v. Green, \n328 \nU.S. 549\n, led the Court to decline to adjudicate a challenge to a state apportionment affecting seats in the federal House of Representatives, in the absence of a controlling Act of Congress. See also Wood v. Broom, \n287 \nU.S. 1\n.\n\nThe appellants' claim in this case ultimately rests entirely on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It is asserted that Tennessee has violated the Equal Protection Clause by maintaining in effect a \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 332]\n\u00a0\n system of apportionment that grossly favors in legislative representation the rural sections of the State as against its urban communities. Stripped to its essentials the complaint purports to set forth three constitutional claims of varying breadth:\n\n  (1) The Equal Protection Clause requires that each vote cast in state legislative elections be given approximately equal weight.\n\n\n  (2) Short of this, the existing apportionment of state legislators is so unreasonable as to amount to an arbitrary and capricious act of classification on the part of the Tennessee Legislature, which is offensive to the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n\n  (3) In any event, the existing apportionment is rendered invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment because it flies in the face of the Tennessee Constitution.\n\n\n For reasons given in MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER'S opinion, ante, pp. 325-327, the last of these propositions is manifestly untenable, and need not be dealt with further. I turn to the other two.\n\n\nI.\n\n\nI can find nothing in the Equal Protection Clause or elsewhere in the Federal Constitution which expressly or impliedly supports the view that state legislatures must be so structured as to reflect with approximate equality the voice of every voter. Not only is that proposition refuted by history, as shown by my Brother FRANKFURTER, but it strikes deep into the heart of our federal system. Its acceptance would require us to turn our backs on the regard which this Court has always shown for the judgment of state legislatures and courts on matters of basically local concern. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 333]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the last analysis, what lies at the core of this controversy is a difference of opinion as to the function of representative government. It is surely beyond argument that those who have the responsibility for devising a system of representation may permissibly consider that factors other than bare numbers should be taken into account. The existence of the United States Senate is proof enough of that. To consider that we may ignore the Tennessee Legislature's judgment in this instance because that body was the product of an asymmetrical electoral apportionment would in effect be to assume the very conclusion here disputed. Hence we must accept the present form of the Tennessee Legislature as the embodiment of the State's choice, or, more realistically, its compromise, between competing political philosophies. The federal courts have not been empowered by the Equal Protection Clause to judge whether this resolution of the State's internal political conflict is desirable or undesirable, wise or unwise.\n\nWith respect to state tax statutes and regulatory measures, for example, it has been said that the \"day is gone when this Court uses the . . . Fourteenth Amendment to strike down state laws . . . because they may be unwise, improvident, or out of harmony with a particular school of thought.\" Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., \n348 \nU.S. 483, 488\n. I would think it all the more compelling for us to follow this principle of self-restraint when what is involved is the freedom of a State to deal with so intimate a concern as the structure of its own legislative branch. The Federal Constitution imposes no limitation on the form which a state government may take other than generally committing to the United States the duty to guarantee to every State \"a Republican Form of Government.\" And, as my Brother FRANKFURTER so conclusively proves (ante, pp. 308-317), no intention to fix immutably the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 334]\n\u00a0\n means of selecting representatives for state governments could have been in the minds of either the Founders or the draftsmen of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nIn short, there is nothing in the Federal Constitution to prevent a State, acting not irrationally, from choosing any electoral legislative structure it thinks best suited to the interests, temper, and customs of its people. I would have thought this proposition settled by MacDougall v. Green, \n335 \nU.S. 281\n, in which the Court observed (at p. 283) that to \"assume that political power is a function exclusively of numbers is to disregard the practicalities of government,\" and reaffirmed by South v. Peters, \n339 \nU.S. 276\n. A State's choice to distribute electoral strength among geographical units, rather than according to a census of population, is certainly no less a rational decision of policy than would be its choice to levy a tax on property rather than a tax on income. Both are legislative judgments entitled to equal respect from this Court.\n\n\nII.\n\n\nThe claim that Tennessee's system of apportionment is so unreasonable as to amount to a capricious classification of voting strength stands up no better under dispassionate analysis.\n\nThe Court has said time and again that the Equal Protection Clause does not demand of state enactments either mathematical identity or rigid equality. E. g., Allied Stores of Ohio v. Bowers, \n358 \nU.S. 522, 527\n-528, and authorities there cited; McGowan v. Maryland, \n366 \nU.S. 420, 425\n-426. All that is prohibited is \"invidious discrimination\" bearing no rational relation to any permissible policy of the State. Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., supra, at 489. And in deciding whether such discrimination has been practiced by a State, it must be borne in mind that a \"statutory discrimination will not be set aside if any state of facts reasonably may be conceived \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 335]\n\u00a0\n to justify it.\" McGowan v. Maryland, supra. It is not inequality alone that calls for a holding of unconstitutionality; only if the inequality is based on an impermissible standard may this Court condemn it.\n\nWhat then is the basis for the claim made in this case that the distribution of state senators and representatives is the product of capriciousness or of some constitutionally prohibited policy? It is not that Tennessee has arranged its electoral districts with a deliberate purpose to dilute the voting strength of one race, cf. Gomillion v. Lightfoot, \n364 \nU.S. 339\n, or that some religious group is intentionally underrepresented. Nor is it a charge that the legislature has indulged in sheer caprice by allotting representatives to each county on the basis of a throw of the dice, or of some other determinant bearing no rational relation to the question of apportionment. Rather, the claim is that the State Legislature has unreasonably retained substantially the same allocation of senators and representatives as was established by statute in 1901, refusing to recognize the great shift in the population balance between urban and rural communities that has occurred in the meantime.\n\nIt is further alleged that even as of 1901 the apportionment was invalid, in that it did not allocate state legislators among the counties in accordance with the formula set out in Art. II, 5, of the Tennessee Constitution. In support of this the appellants have furnished a Table which indicates that as of 1901 six counties were overrepresented and 11 were underrepresented. But that Table in fact shows nothing in the way of significant discrepancy; in the instance of each county it is only one representative who is either lacking or added. And it is further perfectly evident that the variations are attributable to nothing more than the circumstance that the then enumeration of voters resulted in fractional remainders with respect to which the precise formula of the Tennessee Constitution was in some \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 336]\n\u00a0\n instances slightly disregarded. Unless such de minimis departures are to be deemed of significance, these statistics certainly provide no substantiation for the charge that the 1901 apportionment was arbitrary and capricious. Indeed, they show the contrary.\n\nThus reduced to its essentials, the charge of arbitrariness and capriciousness rests entirely on the consistent refusal of the Tennessee Legislature over the past 60 years to alter a pattern of apportionment that was reasonable when conceived.\n\nA Federal District Court is asked to say that the passage of time has rendered the 1901 apportionment obsolete to the point where its continuance becomes vulnerable under the Fourteenth Amendment. But is not this matter one that involves a classic legislative judgment? Surely it lies within the province of a state legislature to conclude that an existing allocation of senators and representatives constitutes a desirable balance of geographical and demographical representation, or that in the interest of stability of government it would be best to defer for some further time the redistribution of seats in the state legislature.\n\nIndeed, I would hardly think it unconstitutional if a state legislature's expressed reason for establishing or maintaining an electoral imbalance between its rural and urban population were to protect the State's agricultural interests from the sheer weight of numbers of those residing in its cities. A State may, after all, take account of the interests of its rural population in the distribution of tax burdens, e. g., American Sugar Rfg. Co. v. Louisiana, \n179 \nU.S. 89\n, and recognition of the special problems of agricultural interests has repeatedly been reflected in federal legislation, e. g., Capper-Volstead Act, 42 Stat. 388; Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 31. Even the exemption of agricultural activities from state criminal statutes of otherwise general application has not been deemed offensive to the Equal Protection Clause. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 337]\n\u00a0\n Tigner v. Texas, \n310 \nU.S. 141\n. Does the Fourteenth Amendment impose a stricter limitation upon a State's apportionment of political representatives to its central government? I think not. These are matters of local policy, on the wisdom of which the federal judiciary is neither permitted nor qualified to sit in judgment.\n\nThe suggestion of my Brother FRANKFURTER that courts lack standards by which to decide such cases as this, is relevant not only to the question of \"justiciability,\" but also, and perhaps more fundamentally, to the determination whether any cognizable constitutional claim has been asserted in this case. Courts are unable to decide when it is that an apportionment originally valid becomes void because the factors entering into such a decision are basically matters appropriate only for legislative judgment. And so long as there exists a possible rational legislative policy for retaining an existing apportionment, such a legislative decision cannot be said to breach the bulwark against arbitrariness and caprice that the Fourteenth Amendment affords. Certainly, with all due respect, the facile arithmetical argument contained in Part II of my Brother CLARK'S separate opinion (ante, pp. 253-258) provides no tenable basis for considering that there has been such a breach in this instance. (See the Appendix to this opinion.)\n\nThese conclusions can hardly be escaped by suggesting that capricious state action might be found were it to appear that a majority of the Tennessee legislators, in refusing to consider reapportionment, had been actuated by self-interest in perpetuating their own political offices or by other unworthy or improper motives. Since Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, was decided many years ago, it has repeatedly been pointed out that it is not the business of the federal courts to inquire into the personal motives of legislators. E. g., Arizona v. California, \n283 \nU.S. 423, 455\n & n. 7. The function of the federal judiciary ends in \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 338]\n\u00a0\n matters of this kind once it appears, as I think it does here on the undisputed facts, that the state action complained of could have rested on some rational basis. (See the Appendix to this opinion.)\n\nIt is my view that the majority opinion has failed to point to any recognizable constitutional claim alleged in this complaint. Indeed, it is interesting to note that my Brother STEWART is at pains to disclaim for himself, and to point out that the majority opinion does not suggest, that the Federal Constitution requires of the States any particular kind of electoral apportionment, still less that they must accord to each voter approximately equal voting strength. Concurring opinion, ante, p. 265. But that being so, what, may it be asked, is left of this complaint? Surely the bare allegations that the existing Tennessee apportionment is \"incorrect,\" \"arbitrary,\" \"obsolete\" and \"unconstitutional\" - amounting to nothing more than legal conclusions - do not themselves save the complaint from dismissal. See Snowden v. Hughes, \n321 \nU.S. 1\n; Collins v. Hardyman, \n341 \nU.S. 651\n. Nor do those allegations shift to the appellees the burden of proving the constitutionality of this state statute; as is so correctly emphasized by my Brother STEWART (ante, p. 266), this Court has consistently held in cases arising under the Equal Protection Clause that \"`the burden of establishing the unconstitutionality of a statute rests on him who assails it.' Metropolitan Casualty Ins. Co. v. Brownell, \n294 \nU.S. 580, 584\n.\" (Emphasis added.) Moreover, the appellants do not suggest that they could show at a trial anything beyond the matters previously discussed in this opinion, which add up to nothing in the way of a supportable constitutional challenge against this statute. And finally, the majority's failure to come to grips with the question whether the complaint states a claim cognizable under the Federal Constitution - an issue necessarily presented by appellees' motion to dismiss - \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 339]\n\u00a0\n does not of course furnish any ground for permitting this action to go to trial.\n\nFrom a reading of the majority and concurring opinions one will not find it difficult to catch the premises that underlie this decision. The fact that the appellants have been unable to obtain political redress of their asserted grievances appears to be regarded as a matter which should lead the Court to stretch to find some basis for judicial intervention. While the Equal Protection Clause is invoked, the opinion for the Court notably eschews explaining how, consonant with past decisions, the undisputed facts in this case can be considered to show a violation of that constitutional provision. The majority seems to have accepted the argument, pressed at the bar, that if this Court merely asserts authority in this field, Tennessee and other \"malapportioning\" States will quickly respond with appropriate political action, so that this Court need not be greatly concerned about the federal courts becoming further involved in these matters. At the same time the majority has wholly failed to reckon with what the future may hold in store if this optimistic prediction is not fulfilled. Thus, what the Court is doing reflects more an adventure in judicial experimentation than a solid piece of constitutional adjudication. Whether dismissal of this case should have been for want of jurisdiction or, as is suggested in Bell v. Hood, \n327 \nU.S. 678, 682\n-683, for failure of the complaint to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, the judgment of the District Court was correct.\n\nIn conclusion, it is appropriate to say that one need not agree, as a citizen, with what Tennessee has done or failed to do, in order to deprecate, as a judge, what the majority is doing today. Those observers of the Court who see it primarily as the last refuge for the correction of all inequality or injustice, no matter what its nature or source, will no doubt applaud this decision and its break \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 340]\n\u00a0\n with the past. Those who consider that continuing national respect for the Court's authority depends in large measure upon its wise exercise of self-restraint and discipline in constitutional adjudication, will view the decision with deep concern.\n\nI would affirm.\n\n  APPENDIX TO OPINION OF MR. JUSTICE\n\nHARLAN.\n\n\n\n\n THE INADEQUACY OF ARITHMETICAL FORMULAS AS MEASURES  OF THE RATIONALITY OF TENNESSEE'S    APPORTIONMENT.\n\n\n Two of the three separate concurring opinions appear to concede that the Equal Protection Clause does not guarantee to each state voter a vote of approximately equal weight for the State Legislature. Whether the existing Tennessee apportionment is constitutional is recognized to depend only on whether it can find \"any possible justification in rationality\" (ante, p. 265); it is to be struck down only if \"the discrimination here does not fit any pattern\" (ante, p. 258).\n\nOne of the concurring opinions, that of my Brother STEWART, suggests no reasons which would justify a finding that the present distribution of state legislators is unconstitutionally arbitrary. The same is true of the majority opinion. My Brother CLARK, on the other hand, concludes that \"the apportionment picture in Tennessee is a topsy-turvical of gigantic proportions\" (ante, p. 254), solely on the basis of certain statistics presented in the text of his separate opinion and included in a more extensive Table appended thereto. In my view, that analysis is defective not only because the \"total representation\" formula set out in footnote 7 of the opinion (ante, p. 255), rests on faulty mathematical foundations, but, more basically, because the approach taken wholly \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 341]\n\u00a0\n ignores all other factors justifying a legislative determination of the sort involved in devising a proper apportionment for a State Legislature.\n\nIn failing to take any of such other matters into account and in focusing on a particular mathematical formula which, as will be shown, is patently unsound, my Brother CLARK'S opinion has, I submit, unwittingly served to bring into bas-relief the very reasons that support the view that this complaint does not state a claim on which relief could be granted. For in order to warrant holding a state electoral apportionment invalid under the Equal Protection Clause, a court, in line with well-established constitutional doctrine, must find that none of the permissible policies and none of the possible formulas on which it might have been based could rationally justify particular inequalities.\n\n\nI.\n\n\nAt the outset, it cannot be denied that the apportionment rules explicitly set out in the Tennessee Constitution are rational. These rules are based on the following obviously permissible policy determinations: (1) to utilize counties as electoral units; (2) to prohibit the division of any county in the composition of electoral districts; (3) to allot to each county that has a substantial voting population - at least two-thirds of the average voting population per county - a separate \"direct representative\"; (4) to create \"floterial\" districts (multicounty representative districts) made up of more than one county; and (5) to require that such districts be composed of adjoining counties.\n1\n Such a framework unavoidably \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 342]\n\u00a0\n leads to unreliable arithmetic inequalities under any mathematical formula whereby the counties' \"total representation\" is sought to be measured. It particularly results in egregiously deceptive disparities if the formula proposed in my Brother CLARK'S opinion is applied.\n\nThat formula computes a county's \"total representation\" by adding (1) the number of \"direct representatives\" the county is entitled to elect; (2) a fraction of any other seats in the Tennessee House which are allocated to that county jointly with one or more others in a \"floterial district\"; (3) triple the number of senators the county is entitled to elect alone; and (4) triple a fraction of any seats in the Tennessee Senate which are allocated to that county jointly with one or more others in a multicounty senatorial district. The fractions used for items (2) and (4) are computed by allotting to each county in a combined district an equal share of the House or Senate seat, regardless of the voting population of each of the counties that make up the election district.\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 343]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThis formula is patently deficient in that it eliminates from consideration the relative voting power of the counties that are joined together in a single election district. As a result, the formula unrealistically assigns to Moore County one-third of a senator, in addition to its direct representative (ante, p. 255), although it must be obvious that Moore's voting strength in the Eighteenth Senatorial District is almost negligible. Since Moore County could cast only 2,340 votes of a total eligible vote of 30,478 in the senatorial district, it should in truth be considered as represented by one-fifteenth of a senator. Assuming, arguendo, that any \"total representation\" figure is of significance, Moore's \"total representation\" should be 1.23, not 2.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nThe formula suggested by my Brother CLARK must be adjusted regardless whether one thinks, as I assuredly do not, that the Federal Constitution requires that each vote be given equal weight. The correction is necessary simply to reflect the real facts of political life. It may, of course, be true that the floterial representative's \"function \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 344]\n\u00a0\n is to represent the whole district\" (ante, p. 256). But can it be gainsaid that so long as elections within the district are decided not by a county-unit system, in which each county casts one vote, but by adding the total number of individual votes cast for each candidate, the concern of the elected representatives will primarily be with the most populous counties in the district?\n\n\nII.\n\n\nI do not mean to suggest that any mathematical formula, albeit an \"adjusted\" one, would be a proper touchstone to measure the rationality of the present or of appellants' proposed apportionment plan. For, as the Table appended to my Brother CLARK'S opinion so conclusively shows, whether one applies the formula he suggests or one that is adjusted to reflect proportional voting strength within an election district, no plan of apportionment consistent with the principal policies of the Tennessee Constitution could provide proportionately equal \"total representation\" for each of Tennessee's 95 counties.\n\nThe pattern suggested by the appellants in Exhibits \"A\" and \"B\" attached to their complaint is said to be a \"fair distribution\" which accords with the Tennessee Constitution, and under which each of the election districts represents approximately equal voting population. But even when tested by the \"adjusted\" formula, the plan reveals gross \"total representation\" disparities that would make it appear to be a \"crazy quilt.\" For example, Loudon County, with twice the voting population of Humphreys County would have less representation than Humphreys, and about one-third the representation of Warren County, which has only 73 more voters. Among the more populous counties, similar discrepancies would appear. Although Anderson County has only somewhat over 10% more voters than Blount County, it would have \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 345]\n\u00a0\n approximately 75% more representation. And Blount would have approximately two-thirds the representation of Montgomery County, which has about 13% less voters.\n4\n\u00a0\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nThe fault with a purely statistical approach to the case at hand lies not with the particular mathematical formula used, but in the failure to take account of the fact that a multitude of legitimate legislative policies, along with circumstances of geography and demography, could account for the seeming electoral disparities among counties. The principles set out in the Tennessee Constitution are just some of those that were deemed significant. Others may have been considered and accepted by those entrusted with the responsibility for Tennessee's apportionment. And for the purposes of judging constitutionality under the Equal Protection Clause it must be remembered that what is controlling on the issue of \"rationality\" is not what the State Legislature may actually have considered but what it may be deemed to have considered.\n\nFor example, in the list of \"horribles\" cited by my Brother CLARK (ante, p. 255), all the \"underrepresented\" counties are semiurban: all contain municipalities of over 10,000 population.\n5\n This is not to say, however, that the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 346]\n\u00a0\n presence of any such municipality within a county necessarily demands that its proportional representation be reduced in order to render it consistent with an \"urban versus rural\" plan of apportionment. Other considerations may intervene and outweigh the Legislature's desire to distribute seats so as to achieve a proper balance between urban and rural interests. The size of a county, in terms of its total area, may be a factor.\n6\n Or the location within a county of some major industry may be thought to call for dilution of voting strength.\n7\n Again, the combination of certain smaller counties with their more heavily populated neighbors in senatorial or \"floterial\" districts may result in apparent arithmetic inequalities.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nMore broadly, the disparities in electoral strength among the various counties in Tennessee, both those relied upon by my Brother CLARK and others, may be \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 347]\n\u00a0\n accounted for by various economic,\n9\n political,\n10\n and geographic\n11\n considerations. No allegation is made by the appellants that the existing apportionment is the result of any other forces than are always at work in any legislative process; and the record, briefs, and arguments in this Court themselves attest to the fact that the appellants could put forward nothing further at a trial.\n\nBy disregarding the wide variety of permissible legislative considerations that may enter into a state electoral apportionment my Brother CLARK has turned a highly complex process into an elementary arithmetical puzzle. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 348]\n\u00a0\n It is only by blinking reality that such an analysis can stand and that the essentially legislative determination can be made the subject of judicial inquiry.\n\n\nIV.\n\n\nApart from such policies as those suggested which would suffice to justify particular inequalities, there is a further consideration which could rationally have led the Tennessee Legislature, in the exercise of a deliberate choice, to maintain the status quo. Rigidity of an apportionment pattern may be as much a legislative policy decision as is a provision for periodic reapportionment. In the interest of stability, a State may write into its fundamental law a permanent distribution of legislators among its various election districts, thus forever ignoring shifts in population. Indeed, several States have achieved this result by providing for minimum and maximum representation from various political subdivisions such as counties, districts, cities, or towns. See Harvey, Reapportionments of State Legislatures - Legal Requirements, 17 Law & Contemp. Probs. (1952), 364, 368-372.\n\nIt is said that one cannot find any rational standard in what the Tennessee Legislature has failed to do over the past 60 years. But surely one need not search far to find rationality in the Legislature's continued refusal to recognize the growth of the urban population that has accompanied the development of industry over the past half decade. The existence of slight disparities between rural areas does not overcome the fact that the foremost apparent legislative motivation has been to preserve the electoral strength of the rural interests notwithstanding shifts in population. And I understand it to be conceded by at least some of the majority that this policy is not \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 349]\n\u00a0\n rendered unconstitutional merely because it favors rural voters.\n\nOnce the electoral apportionment process is recognized for what it is - the product of legislative give-and-take and of compromise among policies that often conflict - the relevant constitutional principles at once put these appellants out of the federal courts.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The relevant provisions of the Tennessee Constitution are Art. II, 5 and 6:\n\n\"Sec. 5. Apportionment of representatives. - The number of Representatives shall, at the several periods of making the enumeration, be apportioned among the several counties or districts, according to the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 342]\n\u00a0\n number of qualified voters in each; and shall not exceed seventy-five, until the population of the State shall be one million and a half, and shall never exceed ninety-nine; Provided, that any county having two-thirds of the ratio shall be entitled to one member.\n\n\n\"Sec. 6. Apportionment of senators. - The number of Senators shall, at the several periods of making the enumeration, be apportioned among the several counties or districts according to the number of qualified electors in each, and shall not exceed one-third the number of representatives. In apportioning the Senators among the different counties, the fraction that may be lost by any county or counties, in the apportionment of members to the House of Representatives, shall be made up to such county or counties in the Senate, as near as may be practicable. When a district is composed of two or more counties, they shall be adjoining; and no counties shall be divided in forming a district.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] This formula is not clearly spelled out in the opinion, but it is necessarily inferred from the figures that are presented. Knox County, for example, is said to have a \"total representation\" of 7.25. It \n\n[369 \nU.S. 186, 343]\n\u00a0\n elects (1) three direct representatives (value 3.00); (2) one representative from a two-county district (value .50); (3) one direct senator (value 3.00); and (4) one senator in a four-county district (value .75). See Appendix to opinion of MR. JUSTICE CLARK, ante, pp. 262-264.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] If this \"adjusted\" formula for measuring \"total representation\" is applied to the other \"horribles\" cited in the concurring opinion (ante, p. 255), it reveals that these counties - which purportedly have equal \"total representation\" but distinctly unequal voting population - do not have the same \"total representation\" at all. Rather than having the same representation as Rutherford County, Moore County has only about 40% of what Rutherford has. Decatur County has only 55% of the representation of Carter County. While Loudon and Anderson Counties are substantially underrepresented, this is because of their proximity to Knox County, which outweighs their votes in the Sixth Senatorial District and in the Eighth Floterial District.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] These disparities are as serious, if not more so, when my Brother CLARK'S formula is applied to the appellants' proposal. For example, if the seven counties chosen by him as illustrative are examined as they would be represented under the appellants' distribution, Moore County, with a voting population of 2,340, is given more electoral strength than Decatur County, with a voting population of 5,563. Carter County (voting population 23,302) has 20% more \"total representation\" than Anderson County (voting population 33,990), and 33% more than Rutherford County (voting population 25,316).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Murfreesboro, Rutherford County (pop. 16,017); Elizabethton, Carter County (pop. 10,754); Oak Ridge, Anderson County (pop. 27,387). Tennessee Blue Book, 1960, pp. 143-149.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] For example, Carter and Washington Counties are each approximately 60% as large as Maury and Madison Counties in terms of square miles, and this may explain the disparity between their \"total representation\" figures.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] For example, in addition to being \"semi-urban,\" Blount County is the location of the City of Alcoa, where the Aluminum Company of America has located a large aluminum smelting and rolling plant. This may explain the difference between its \"total representation\" and that of Gibson County, which has no such large industry and contains no municipality as large as Maryville.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] For example, Chester County (voting population 6,391) is one of those that is presently said to be overrepresented. But under the appellants' proposal, Chester would be combined with populous Madison County in a \"floterial district\" and with four others, including Shelby County, in a senatorial district. Consequently, its total representation according to the Appendix to my Brother CLARK'S opinion would be .19. (Ante, p. 262.) This would have the effect of disenfranchising all the county's voters. Similarly, Rhea County's almost 9,000 voters would find their voting strength so diluted as to be practically nonexistent.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] For example, it is primarily the eastern portion of the State that is complaining of malapportionment (along with the Cities of Memphis and Nashville). But the eastern section is where industry is principally located and where population density, even outside the large urban areas, is highest. Consequently, if Tennessee is apportioning in favor of its agricultural interests, as constitutionally it was entitled to do, it would necessarily reduce representation from the east.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] For example, sound political reasons surely justify limiting the legislative chambers to workable numbers; in Tennessee, the House is set at 99 and the Senate at 33. It might have been deemed desirable, therefore, to set a ceiling on representation from any single county so as not to deprive others of individual representation. The proportional discrepancies among the four counties with large urban centers may be attributable to a conscious policy of limiting representation in this manner.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] For example, Moore County is surrounded by four counties each of which has sufficient voting population to exceed two-thirds of the average voting population per county (which is the standard prescribed by the Tennessee Constitution for the assignment of a direct representative), thus qualifying for direct representatives. Consequently Moore County must be assigned a representative of its own despite its small voting population because it cannot be joined with any of its neighbors in a multicounty district, and the Tennessee Constitution prohibits combining it with nonadjacent counties.

STAHR(1962)\nNo. 648\nArgued: Decided: May 28, 1962\n\n\n\n\n After administrative proceedings by an Army Board of Inquiry and a Board of Review under 10 U.S.C. (Supp. II) 3792 and 3793 had resulted in a recommendation that the Secretary of the Army remove appellant, a commissioned officer in the Regular Army, from the active list and award him a general discharge, but before the Secretary had taken any action under 3794, appellant sued in a Federal District Court to enjoin the Secretary from determining whether he should be removed. He claimed that the administrative proceedings were unconstitutional because they deprived him of his office and retirement benefits without due process of law. The District Court sustained the constitutionality of the statute and the administrative proceedings and dismissed the complaint. Held: The judgment is vacated with directions to dismiss the complaint as premature. Application for a stay is denied. Pp. 41-42.\n\n Reported below: 200 F. Supp. 766.\n\nFrederick Bernays Wiener for appellant.\n\nSolicitor General Cox, Assistant Attorney General Orrick and John G. Laughlin, Jr. for appellees.\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\nThe judgment of the District Court is vacated and the cause is remanded with directions to dismiss the complaint. The action is premature. The appellant will not be removed from the active list of the Regular Army unless the Secretary of the Army exercise the discretionary authority to remove him conferred by 10 U.S.C. 3794. The Secretary has not stated that he will so exercise his discretion as to remove appellant. If the Secretary does not remove the appellant it will be unnecessary \n\n[370 \nU.S. 41, 42]\n\u00a0\n to pass on the constitutional objections which have been urged. If appellant is removed, the Court is satisfied that adequate procedures for seeking redress will be open to him. Compare Aircraft & Diesel Corp. v. Hirsch, \n331 \nU.S. 752, 772\n-773. Accordingly, the application for a stay is denied.\n\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE is of the opinion that further consideration of the question of jurisdiction should be postponed to the hearing of the case on the merits and would grant the application for a stay.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the decision of this case.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK concurs, dissenting.\n\nAppellant is a Major in the Regular Army and has the temporary rank of Lieutenant Colonel. He served in World War II and received the Bronze Star Medal. He at present has had over 19 years of active federal service and will be eligible for retirement in November 1962. But for the present charge against him his military record reflects exemplary conduct and high efficiency ratings.\n\nThese years of faithful service have now gone largely for naught under a decision of an Army Board of Review recommending that he be given a general discharge. Whatever the merits may be, I believe that the procedure used at his hearing violated our standards of fairness.\n\nUnder the statute here in question, 10 U.S.C. 3792 (c), an officer faced with a charge carries the burden of proof that \"he should be retained on the active list.\"\n\nThe District Court held that there was no constitutional objection to placing this burden of proof on the officer. 200 F. Supp. 766, 775. It reasoned that since \n\n[370 \nU.S. 41, 43]\n\u00a0\n the President could dismiss an officer summarily,\n*\n Congress could place on the one removed \"the onus of convincing his superiors that he should not be eliminated.\" Ibid. Dismissal is one thing; dismissal with stigma, as here, is quite another. Dismissal with stigma is a severe penalty. In comparable situations, the Government has been required to carry the burden of proof. Kwong Hai Chew v. Rogers, 103 U.S. App. D.C. 228, 257 F.2d 606; Wood v. Hoy, 266 F.2d 825, 830. Unless this burden is meticulously maintained, discharge for race, for religion, for political opinion, or for beliefs may masquerade under unproved charges. This right, like the right to be heard, is basic to our society. Cf. Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath, \n341 \nU.S. 123, 168\n (concurring opinion); Beilan v. Board of Education, \n357 \nU.S. 399, 421\n-423 (dissenting opinion); Wieman v. Updegraff, \n344 \nU.S. 183, 191\n.\n\nThere is a second reason why we should remand this case for a new hearing. The one witness whose testimony was critical to the case was not called. Confrontation and cross-examination are, as I understand the law, vital when one's employment rights are involved (see Greene v. McElroy, \n360 \nU.S. 474, 496\n) - the factor that distinguishes Cafeteria Workers v. McElroy, \n367 \nU.S. 886\n, where the only question was access to a military base. Perhaps the missing accuser - whose activities were described in uncomplimentary terms in Rittenour v. District of Columbia, 163 A. 2d 558 - would have made such an unbecoming witness that the Board would have dismissed the charges. Faceless informers are often effective if they need not take the stand. A fair hearing requires the production of the accuser so that cross-examination can test his character and reliability. That question is very close \n\n[370 \nU.S. 41, 44]\n\u00a0\n to the one involved in No. 1123, Misc., Williams v. Zuckert, in which we granted certiorari only the other day. \n369 \nU.S. 884\n. This case should be heard with that one.\n\nI think the present case is ripe for review. Once the Secretary of the Army approves the decision now challenged, appellant will be severed from military service with less than an honorable discharge. If a wrong was committed, I assume that he could recover a judgment that restores any loss of salary or pension. More than dollars, however, are involved: at stake is a man's professional standing, his character, and his claim to an honorable discharge. Where the Army departs from the statutory standard which prescribes the basis on which discharges will be issued, the federal courts can intervene. See Harmon v. Brucker, \n355 \nU.S. 579\n. Though the Court's opinion may be read as indicating that a collateral proceeding to set aside one discharge and to direct that an honorable one be granted may lie, we should nonetheless halt this irregular procedure in limine. For we are dealing here with the charge of \"conduct unbecoming an officer,\" a charge that carries a heavy stigma. As Winthrop said: \"Though it need not amount to a crime, it must offend so seriously against law, justice, morality or decorum as to expose to disgrace, socially or as a man, the offender, and at the same time must be of such a nature or committed under such circumstances as to bring dishonor or disrepute upon the military profession which he represents.\" Military Law and Precedents (2d ed. 1896) 1104.\n\nIf declaratory relief will be accorded, as it certainly could be (Bland v. Connally, 110 U.S. App. D.C. 375, 293 F.2d 852), this action for an injunction is timely to prevent an injustice. As recently stated: \"We think it must be conceded that any discharge characterized as less than honorable will result in serious injury. It not only means \n\n[370 \nU.S. 41, 45]\n\u00a0\n the loss of numerous benefits in both the federal and state systems, but it also results in an unmistakable social stigma which greatly limits the opportunities for both public and private civilian employment.\" 110 U.S. App. D.C. 375, 381, 293 F.2d 852, 858.\n\nI would reverse the judgment below and direct that appellant be accorded a hearing that comports with the requirements of due process.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Which of course, is a mistaken premise. See Wiener v. United States, \n357 \nU.S. 349\n; Blake v. United States, \n103 \nU.S. 227, 231\n. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 41, 46]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","10":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBECK v.

Specifically he claimed that the grand jury which indicted him was biased, that it was unfairly impaneled and instructed, and that the prosecutor acted improperly before it.

JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner David D. Beck contends that his conviction of grand larceny in the Superior Court of the State of Washington for King County is invalid under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. This contention is based primarily on what is characterized as voluminous and continuous adverse publicity circulated by news media in the vicinity of Seattle, Washington, where he was indicted and tried. Specifically he claims, inter alia, that the grand jury was unfairly impaneled and instructed, that the prosecutor acted improperly before the grand jury, and that his motions for a change of venue and for continuances were erroneously denied. The judges of the Supreme Court of Washington divided equally in review, 56 Wash. 2d 474, 349 P.2d 387, 353 P.2d 429, leaving petitioner's conviction undisturbed. We granted certiorari limited to the above contentions, \n365 \nU.S. 866\n, and we now affirm the conviction.\n\n  I. THE PUBLICITY OF WHICH PETITIONER     COMPLAINS.\n\n\n In addition to challenges to the grand and petit juries, petitioner prior to the selection of the petit jury made five motions on the ground of bias and prejudice arising \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 543]\n\u00a0\n from the publicity, viz., one to quash the indictment, three for continuances ranging from one month to an indefinite period, and one for a change of venue to Snohomish or Whatcom County. Petitioner's counsel supported his factual contentions in regard to these various motions by his personal affidavits as well as by photostats of stories appearing in local newspapers and national magazines. We shall now summarize the highlights of the publicity set forth by the petitioner in his moving papers and exhibits.\n\nThe Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor or Management Field of the United States Senate began its investigation on February 26, 1957. In early March the Chairman of the Committee announced that the Committee had \"produced `rather conclusive' evidence of a tie-up between West Coast Teamsters and under-world bosses to monopolize vice in Portland, Ore.\" The announcement also stated that \"Teamsters' President Dave Beck and Brewster [also a Teamster leader] will be summoned for questioning on a charge that they schemed to control Oregon's law enforcement machinery from a local level on up to the governor's chair.\"\n\nOn March 22 the Committee was quoted in the newspapers as stating \"$250,000 had been taken from Teamster funds . . . and used for Beck's personal benefit.\" Petitioner appeared before the Committee on March 26, and the newspapers reported: \"BECK TAKES 5TH AMENDMENT President of Teamsters `Very Definitely' Thinks Records Might Incriminate Him.\" Television cameras were permitted at the hearings. One Seattle TV station ran an 8 3\/4-hour \"live\" broadcast of the session on March 27, and films of this session were shown by various TV stations in the Seattle-Tacoma area. The April 12 issue of the U.S. News & World Report ran a caption: \"Take a look around Seattle these days, and you find what a Senate inquiry can do to a top labor leader \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 544]\n\u00a0\n in his own home town.\" On April 26 the county prosecutor announced that a special grand jury would be impaneled in Seattle \"to investigate possible misuse of Teamsters Union funds by international president Dave Beck . . . .\" It was later announced that former Mayor Devin of Seattle was to be appointed Chief Special Prosecutor. On May 3 petitioner was indicted by a federal grand jury at Tacoma for income tax evasion. The announcement of this action was of course in front-page headlines. Five days later the petitioner was again called as a witness before the Committee in Washington. News stories on his appearance concentrated on his pleading of the Fifth Amendment 60 times during the hearings. Other stories emanating from the Committee hearings were featured intermittently, and on May 20, the day of the convening of the special grand jury, the Chairman of the Senate Committee announced that \"the Committee has not convicted Mr. Beck of any crime, although it is my belief that he has committed many criminal offenses.\" The publicity continued to some degree after the grand jury had been convened and during the three-week period in which the prosecutors were gathering up documentary evidence through the use of grand jury subpoenas. Among other stories that appeared was one of June 4 stating that at the Committee hearings \"Beck, Jr., who even refused to say whether he knew his father, took shelter behind the [fifth] amendment 130 times, following the example of Beck, Sr., who refused to answer 210 times in three appearances before the committee.\" The indictment in this case was returned by the special grand jury on July 12 and of course received banner headlines. Intermittent publicity continued, some from Washington, D.C., until August 28 when a federal grand jury indicted petitioner and others on additional income tax evasion counts. The co-conspirators named in this latter indictment were then called before the Committee in Washington, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 545]\n\u00a0\n and these hearings, which were held on November 5, brought on additional publicity. On November 12 Dave Beck, Jr., went to trial on other larceny charges and was convicted on November 23, a Saturday. The state papers gave that event considerable coverage. The trial of petitioner in this case began on December 2 and continued until his conviction on December 14.\n\n  II. THE OBJECTIONS TO THE GRAND JURY    PROCEEDINGS.\n\n\n Ever since Hurtado v. California, \n110 \nU.S. 516\n (1884), this Court has consistently held that there is no federal constitutional impediment to dispensing entirely with the grand jury in state prosecutions. The State of Washington abandoned its mandatory grand jury practice some 50 years ago.\n1\n Since that time prosecutions have been instituted on informations filed by the prosecutor, on many occasions without even a prior judicial determination of \"probable cause\" - a procedure which has likewise had approval here in such cases as Ocampo v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 91\n (1914), and Lem Woon v. Oregon, \n229 \nU.S. 586\n (1913). Grand juries in Washington are convened only on special occasions and for specific purposes. The grand jury in this case, the eighth called in King County in 40 years, was summoned primarily to investigate circumstances which had been the subject of the Senate Committee hearings.\n\nIn his attempts before trial to have the indictment set aside petitioner did not contend that any particular grand juror was prejudiced or biased. Rather, he asserted that the judge impaneling the grand jury had breached his duty to ascertain on voir dire whether any prospective juror had been influenced by the adverse publicity and that this error had been compounded by his failure to adequately \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 546]\n\u00a0\n instruct the grand jury concerning bias and prejudice. It may be that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires the State, having once resorted to a grand jury procedure, to furnish an unbiased grand jury. Compare Lawn v. United States, \n355 \nU.S. 339, 349\n-350 (1958); Costello v. United States, \n350 \nU.S. 359, 363\n (1956); Hoffman v. United States, \n341 \nU.S. 479, 485\n (1951). But we find that it is not necessary for us to determine this question; for even if due process would require a State to furnish an unbiased body once it resorted to grand jury procedure - a question upon which we do not remotely intimate any view - we have concluded that Washington, so far as is shown by the record, did so in this case.\n\nPetitioner's appearance before the Senate Committee was current news of high national interest and quite normally was widely publicized throughout the Nation, including his home city of Seattle and the State of Washington. His answers to and conduct before the Committee disclosed the possibility that he had committed local offenses within the jurisdiction of King County, Washington, against the laws of that State. In the light of those disclosures the King County authorities were duty-bound to investigate and, if the State's laws had been violated, to prosecute the offenders. It appears that documentary evidence - in the hands of petitioner's union - was necessary to a complete investigation. The only method available to secure such documents was by grand jury process, and it was decided therefore to impanel a grand jury. This Washington was free to do.\n\nTwenty-three prospective grand jurors were called. The trial judge explained, as is customary in such matters, that they had been called primarily to investigate possible crimes committed in King County by officers of the Teamsters Union which had been the subject of the Senate Committee hearings. In impaneling the grand jury the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 547]\n\u00a0\n judge, after determining their statutory qualifications, businesses, union affiliations and the like, asked each of the prospective jurors: \"Is there anything about sitting on this grand jury that might embarrass you at all?\" In answer to this or the question of whether they were conscious of any prejudice or bias, which was asked whenever previous answers suggested a need for further inquiry, two admitted they were prejudiced by the publicity and were excused. Another stated that whether he was prejudiced was \"pretty hard to answer,\" and he, too, was excused. In addition three persons who were or had been members of unions that were affiliated with petitioner's union were excused. The remaining 17 were accepted and sworn as grand jurors and as a part of the oath swore that they would not \"present [any] person through envy, hatred or malice.\" Among them were a retired city employee who had been a Teamsters, the manager of a real estate office, a bookkeeper, an engineer, an airplane manufacturer's employee, a seamstress whose husband was a union member, a material inspector, a gravel company superintendent who was a former Teamsters Union member, a civil engineer with the State Department of Fisheries, and an engineer for a gyroscope manufacturer.\n\nIn his charge to the grand jury the trial judge explained that its \"function is to inquire into the commission of crime in the county,\" that ordinarily this was done \"by the regularly established law enforcement agencies,\" but that this was impossible here because further investigation was necessary requiring the attendance of witnesses and the examination of books and records which a prosecutor had no power to compel. As to the purpose for which it was called, he explained that \"disclosures\" by the Senate Investigating Committee indicated \"hundreds of thousands of dollars of the funds\" of the Teamsters Union had been \"embezzled or stolen\" by its officers. He also stated that the president of the Teamsters had \"publicly \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 548]\n\u00a0\n declared\" that the money he had received was a loan. \"This presents a question of fact,\" he added, \"the truth of which is for you to ascertain.\" After mentioning other accusations he concluded, \"I urge you to do all that you can within practical limitations to ascertain the truth or falsity of these charges. . . . You have a most serious task to perform . . . . It is a tremendous responsibility, and I wish you well in your work.\"\n\nIt is true that the judge did not admonish the grand jurors to disregard or disbelieve news reports and publicity concerning petitioner. Nor did he mention or explain the effect of the invocation of the Fifth Amendment by petitioner before the Committee or inquire as to the politics of any panel member. Discussion along such lines might well have added fuel to the flames which some see here. Apparently sensing this dilemma the judge admonished the grand jury that its function was to inquire into the commission of crime in the county and that it was to conduct an examination of witnesses as well as books and records. Twice in his short statement he said that it was for the grand jury to determine whether the charges were true or false. Taking the instructions as a whole, they made manifest that the jurors were to sift the charges by careful investigation, interrogation of witnesses, and examination of records, not by newspaper stories.\n\nIn the light of these facts and on the attack made we cannot say that the grand jury was biased. It was chosen from the regular jury list. Some six months thereafter a petit jury to try this case was selected from the same community and, as will hereafter be shown, was not found to be prejudiced. Indeed, every judge who passed on the issue in the State's courts, including its highest court, has so held. A look at the grand jury through the record reveals that it was composed of people from all walks of life, some of whom were former union members. The judge immediately and in the presence of all of the panel \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 549]\n\u00a0\n eliminated six prospective grand jurors when indications of prejudice appeared. No grand juror personally knew petitioner or was shown to be adverse to the institutions with which petitioner is generally identified. Every person who was selected on the grand jury took an oath that he would not indict any person through \"hatred or malice.\" Moreover, the grand jury sat for six weeks before any indictment was returned against petitioner. The record also indicates that it heard voluminous testimony on the charges that had been made against petitioner and others and that it gave the matter most meticulous and careful consideration. We therefore conclude that petitioner has failed to show that the body which indicted him was biased or prejudiced against him.\n\nIn addition to the above due process contention three equal protection arguments are made by petitioner or suggested on his behalf. First, petitioner argues he is a member of a class (Teamsters) that was not accorded equal treatment in grand jury proceedings. The contention is based on references to the Teamsters by the judge impaneling the grand jury as he conducted the voir dire and explained the scope of the investigation. The complete answer to petitioner's argument is that references to the Teamsters were necessary in the voir dire to eliminate persons who might be prejudiced for or against petitioner and in the instructions to explain the purpose and scope of this special body. Petitioner has totally failed to establish that non-Teamsters who are members of groups under investigation are given any different treatment.\n\nSecondly, it is said that the Washington statute permitting persons in custody to challenge grand jurors, Revised Code of Washington 10.28.030, denies equal protection to persons not in custody who are investigated by grand juries. This point is not properly before this Court. Although both opinions of the Washington Supreme Court discuss the interpretation of 10.28.030, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 550]\n\u00a0\n neither considered that question in light of the equal protection argument for that argument was never properly presented to the court in relation to this statute. The Washington Supreme Court has unfailingly refused to consider constitutional attacks upon statutes not made in the trial court, even where the constitutional claims arise from the trial court's interpretation of the challenged statute. E. g., Johnson v. Seattle, 50 Wash. 2d 543, 313 P.2d 676 (1957).\n2\n Petitioner's formal attack at the trial court level did not even mention 10.28.030, much less argue that a restrictive interpretation would be unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause.\n3\n That the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 551]\n\u00a0\n prosecution and the court viewed petitioner as outside the scope of 10.28.030 was brought home to him in the course of the trial court proceedings on his grand jury attack. But even then petitioner did not suggest that constitutional \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 552]\n\u00a0\n considerations might compel a different result. The failure to inject the equal protection contention into the case was carried forward to the proceedings before the Washington Supreme Court when petitioner failed to comply with that court's rule prescribing the manner in which contentions are to be brought to its attention. Rule 43 of the Rules on Appeal, Revised Code of Washington, provides that \"[n]o alleged error of the superior court will be considered by this court unless the same be definitely pointed out in the `assignments of error' in appellant's brief.\" Mere generalized attacks upon the validity of the holding below as petitioner made in his \"assignments of error\"\n4\n are not considered by reason of \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 553]\n\u00a0\n this rule sufficient to invoke review of the underlying contentions. See, e. g., Washington v. Tanzymore, 54 Wash. 2d 290, 292, 340 P.2d 178, 179 (1959); Fowles v. Sweeney, 41 Wash. 2d 182, 188, 248 P.2d 400, 403, (1952). Nor will the Washington Supreme Court search through the brief proper to find specific contentions which should have been listed within the \"assignments of error.\" See Washington ex rel. Linden v. Bunge, 192 Wash. 245, 251, 73 P.2d 516, 518-519 (1937). Moreover, the failure of petitioner to argue the constitutional contention in his brief, as opposed to merely setting it forth as he did in one sentence of his 125-page brief, is considered by the Washington Supreme Court to be an abandonment or waiver of such contention. E. g., Martin v. J. C. Penney Co., 50 Wash. 2d 560, 565, 313 P.2d 689, 693 (1957); Washington v. Williams, 49 Wash. 2d 354, 356-357, 301 P.2d 769, 770 (1956). Nor was the equal protection contention made at all in the petitions for rehearing filed after the Supreme Court had agreed with the lower court's interpretation of the statute to exclude petitioner. Assuming arguendo that for the purposes of our jurisdiction the question would have been timely if raised in a petition for rehearing, not having been raised there or elsewhere or actually decided by the Washington Supreme Court, the argument cannot be entertained here under an unbroken line of precedent. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 554]\n\u00a0\n E. g., Ferguson v. Georgia, \n365 \nU.S. 570, 572\n (1961); Capital City Dairy Co. v. Ohio, \n183 \nU.S. 238, 248\n (1902). Furthermore, it was not within the scope of the questions to which the writ of certiorari in this case was specifically limited, \n365 \nU.S. 866\n, and for this additional reason cannot now be presented.\n\nThe final argument under the Equal Protection Clause is that Washington has singled out petitioner for special treatment by denying him the procedural safeguards the law affords others to insure an unbiased grand jury. But this reasoning proceeds on the wholly unsupported assumption that such procedures have been required in Washington in all other cases.\n5\n Moreover, it is contrary to the underlying finding of the Superior Court, in denying the motion to dismiss the indictment, that the grand jurors were lawfully selected and instructed. And even if we were to assume that Washington law requires such procedural safeguards, the petitioner's argument here comes down to a contention that Washington law was misapplied. Such misapplication cannot be shown to be an invidious discrimination. We have said time and again that the Fourteenth Amendment does not \"assure uniformity of judicial decisions . . . [or] immunity from \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 555]\n\u00a0\n judicial error . . . .\" Milwaukee Electric Ry. & Light Co. v. Wisconsin ex rel. Milwaukee, \n252 \nU.S. 100, 106\n (1920). Were it otherwise, every alleged misapplication of state law would constitute a federal constitutional question. Finally, were we to vacate this conviction because of a failure to follow certain procedures although it has not been shown that their ultimate end - a fair grand jury proceeding - was not obtained, we would be exalting form over substance contrary to our previous application of the Equal Protection Clause, e. g., Graham v. West Virginia, \n224 \nU.S. 616, 630\n (1912).\n\nPetitioner also contends that a witness before the grand jury was improperly interrogated in a manner which prejudiced his case before that body. It appears that an employee of petitioner's union was called before the grand jury to testify in reference to activities within his employment. During his first appearance he made statements which he subsequently changed on a voluntary reappearance before the grand jury some two days before the indictment was returned. On the second appearance the prosecutor attacked the witness' changed story as incredible and warned him that he was under oath, that he might be prosecuted for perjury, and that there was no occasion for him to go to jail for petitioner. The record indicates that the prosecutor became incensed over the witness' new story; and though some of his threats were out of bounds, it appears that they had no effect upon the witness whatsoever for he stuck to his story. We can find no irregularity of constitutional proportions, and we therefore reject this contention.\n\n  III. THE OBJECTIONS AS TO THE PETIT JURY.\n\n\n As in his grand jury attack, petitioner makes no claim that any particular petit juror was biased. Instead, he states the publicity which prevented the selection of a fair grand jury also precluded a fair petit jury. He argues \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 556]\n\u00a0\n that such a strong case of adverse publicity has been proved that any jury selected in Seattle at the time he was tried must be held to be presumptively biased and that the trial court's adverse rulings on his motions for a change of venue and for continuances were therefore in error. Of course there could be no constitutional infirmity in these rulings if petitioner actually received a trial by an impartial jury. Hence, our inquiry is addressed to that subject.\n\nPetitioner's trial began early in December. This was nine and one-half months after he was first called before the Senate Committee and almost five months after his indictment. Although there was some adverse publicity during the latter period which stemmed from the second tax indictment and later Senate hearings as well as from the trial of petitioner's son, it was neither intensive nor extensive. The news value of the original \"disclosures\" was diminished, and the items were often relegated to the inner pages. Even the occasional front-page items were straight news stories rather than invidious articles which would tend to arouse ill will and vindictiveness. If there was a campaign against him as petitioner infers, it was sidetracked by the appearance of other \"labor bosses\" on the scene who shared the spotlight.\n\nThe process of selecting a jury began with the exclusion from the panel of all persons summoned as prospective jurors in the November 12 trial of Dave Beck, Jr. In addition, all persons were excused who were in the courtroom at any time during the trial of that case. Next, the members were examined by the court and counsel at length. Of the 52 so examined, only eight admitted bias or a preformed opinion as to petitioner's guilt and six others suggested they might be biased or might have formed an opinion - all of whom were excused. Every juror challenged for cause by petitioner's counsel was \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 557]\n\u00a0\n excused; in addition petitioner was given six peremptory challenges, all of which were exercised. Although most of the persons thus selected for the trial jury had been exposed to some of the publicity related above, each indicated that he was not biased, that he had formed no opinion as to petitioner's guilt which would require evidence to remove, and that he would enter the trial with an open mind disregarding anything he had read on the case.\n\nA study of the voir dire indicates clearly that each juror's qualifications as to impartiality far exceeded the minimum standards this Court established in its earlier cases as well as in Irvin v. Dowd, \n366 \nU.S. 717\n (1961), on which petitioner depends. There we stated:\n\n\"To hold that the mere existence of any preconceived notion as to the guilt or innocence of an accused, without more, is sufficient to rebut the presumption of a prospective juror's impartiality would be to establish an impossible standard. It is sufficient if the juror can lay aside his impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.\" Id., at 723.\n\n\n We cannot say the pretrial publicity was so intensive and extensive or the examination of the entire panel revealed such prejudice that a court could not believe the answers of the jurors and would be compelled to find bias or preformed opinion as a matter of law. Compare Irvin v. Dowd, supra, at 723-728, where sensational publicity adverse to the accused permeated the small town in which he was tried, the voir dire examination indicated that 90% of 370 prospective jurors and two-thirds of those seated on the jury had an opinion as to guilt, and the accused unsuccessfully challenged for cause several persons accepted on the jury. The fact that petitioner did \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 558]\n\u00a0\n not challenge for cause any of the jurors so selected is strong evidence that he was convinced the jurors were not biased and had not formed any opinions as to his guilt. In addition, we note that while the Washington Supreme Court was divided on the question of the right of an accused to an impartial grand jury, the denial of the petitioner's motions based on the bias and prejudice of the petit jury did not raise a single dissenting voice.\n\n\"While this Court stands ready to correct violations of constitutional rights, it also holds that `it is not asking too much that the burden of showing essential unfairness be sustained by him who claims such injustice and seeks to have the result set aside, and that it be sustained not as a matter of speculation but as a demonstrable reality.'\" United States ex rel. Darcy v. Handy, \n351 \nU.S. 454, 462\n (1956). This burden has not been met.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the decision of this case.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Washington Laws 1909, c. 87.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Washington v. Griffith, 52 Wash. 2d 721, 328 P.2d 897 (1958), does not detract from this principle. In Griffith the Washington Supreme Court, while recognizing the general rule that constitutional arguments cannot be presented for the first time in the Supreme Court, found an exception to this general rule when the accused in a capital case asserts his court-appointed attorney incompetently conducted his trial. The reasons for such an exception are obvious, and it is just as obvious that such reasons are not applicable to the present case.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Petitioner made the following attacks upon the grand jury:\n\n\"MOTION TO SET ASIDE AND DISMISS INDICTMENT - Filed   October 18, 1957\n\n\n\n\n\"Comes Now David D. Beck, also known as Dave Beck, defendant herein, by and through his attorneys of record herein, and respectfully moves to set aside and dismiss the indictment on the following grounds:\n\n\n\"1. That the grand jurors were not selected, drawn, summoned, impaneled or sworn as prescribed by law.\n\n\n\"2. That unauthorized persons, not required or permitted by law to attend sessions of the grand jury were present before the grand jury during the investigation of the allegations of the indictment.\n\n\n\"3. That persons other than the grand jurors were present before the grand jury during consideration of the matters and things charged in the indictment.\n\n\n\"4. That the proceedings of the grand jury which returned the indictment were conducted in an atmosphere of extreme bias, prejudice and hostility toward this defendant, and that said atmosphere \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 551]\n\u00a0\n was in part created by the Prosecuting Attorney and by persons acting or claiming to act upon his behalf; all of which was prejudicial to this defendant and which has denied and will continue to deny him rights guaranteed under the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, Amendment 10 of the Constitution of the State of Washington, and Article I, 3 of the Constitution of the State of Washington.\n\n\n\"5. That by reason of extreme bias, prejudice and hostility toward the defendant herein, contributed to in part by the conduct of the Prosecuting Attorney and persons acting or claiming to act upon his behalf, it is and will be impossible for the defendant to secure and obtain a fair and impartial trial in the jurisdiction of this Court, all of which is and will be prejudicial to this defendant and which will constitute a denial of his rights guaranteed under the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, Amendment 10 of the Constitution of the State of Washington, and Article I, 3 of the Constitution of the State of Washington.\n\n\n\"6. That the Court erred in its instructions and directions to the Grand Jury to the prejudice of the defendant and in denial of rights guaranteed under the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, Amendment 10 of the Constitution of the State of Washington, and Article I, 3 of the Constitution of the State of Washington.\n\n\n\"7. That there were excluded from the Grand Jury persons of defendant's financial, social and business class and occupation, contrary to the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and contrary to Article I, 3 of the Constitution of the State of Washington.\n\n\n\"8. That the defendant herein was required and compelled to give evidence against himself, contrary to the provisions of Article I, 9 of the Constitution of the State of Washington and the 5th and 14th Amendments of the Constitution of the United States.\n\n\n\"9. That the Grand Jury committed misconduct in violation of RCW 10.28.085 and RCW 10.28.100.\n\n\n\"This motion is based upon all of the files, records, transcripts, exhibits and affidavits herein.\" \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 552]\n\u00a0\n\n\n \"CHALLENGE TO GRAND JURY - Filed October 18, 1957\n\n\n\n\"Comes Now the defendant herein and challenges each and all of the members of the grand jury which returned the indictment herein for the reason and on the grounds that the Court which impaneled said grand jury made no determination as to whether a state of mind existed on the part of any juror such as would render him unable to act impartially and without prejudice.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Petitioner's 29 \"assignments of error\" included the following:\n\n\"6. The lower court erred in denying appellant's motion to set aside and dismiss the indictment.\n\n\n\"7. The lower court erred in denying appellant's challenge to grand jury.\n\n .  .   .  .   .\n\n\n\n\"25. The court denied appellant's rights to a fair and impartial grand jury.\"\n\n\n However, when petitioner did attempt to conform to the rule of the Washington Supreme Court by pointing out \"definitely\" the errors committed in denying his attacks upon the grand jury, he limited the review to violations of the Due Process Clause as set out below.\n\n\"29. The appellant was denied due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America and under the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution of the State of Washington, as follows:\n\n\n\"a. by denying appellant his right to challenge the grand jury or to dismiss the indictment for bias and prejudice of the grand jury members. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 553]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"b. by denying his motions for continuance and change of venue thereby forcing appellant to go to trial in an atmosphere of extreme hostility and prejudice.\n\n\n\"c. by misconduct of the prosecutor\n\n\n\"1. during and after the grand jury proceedings, and\n\n\n\"2. at the trial.\n\n\n\"d. by denying appellant an opportunity to examine or inspect transcripts of proceedings before the grand jury after the State had introduced evidence of particular statements made before the grand jury by cross-examination or secondary evidence.\n\n\n\"e. the means used to accuse and convict appellant were not compatible with reasonable standards of fair play.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] There are no reported Washington cases so holding. The two cases on which this claim is predicated, Washington v. Guthrie, 185 Wash. 464, 56 P.2d 160 (1936), and Washington ex rel. Murphy v. Superior Court, 82 Wash. 284, 144 P. 32 (1914), were concerned only with whether the members of the grand jury had been selected by chance as the law requires. Quotations from these cases when read in context clearly have reference only to the desirability of selecting grand jurors by chance. Petitioner in his rehearing petition before the Washington Supreme Court quoted from two unnamed, unreported Washington grand jury proceedings in which some prospective jurors were questioned as to bias. Even if it were clear that all the jurors in those cases were so questioned (which it is not), such isolated, unreviewable instances would not establish that Washington law requires the claimed procedures.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE concurs, dissenting.\n\nI dissent from the Court's holding because I think that the failure of the Washington courts to follow their own state law by taking affirmative action to protect the petitioner Beck from being indicted by a biased and prejudiced grand jury was a denial to him of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 559]\n\u00a0\n\n\nSince 1854, when Washington was a Territory, that State has had a statute comprehensively governing the use of grand juries in criminal trials which provides in part:\n\n\"Challenges to individual grand jurors may be made by . . . [any person in custody or held to answer for an offense] for reason of want of qualification to sit as such juror; and when, in the opinion of the court, a state of mind exists in the juror, such as would render him unable to act impartially and without prejudice.\"\n1\n\u00a0\n\n\n In State ex rel. Murphy v. Superior Court,\n2\n the Washington Supreme Court held in construing this statute that in order to preserve the right of defendants to fair and impartial grand jurors, Washington State judges must select grand jurors by chance, explaining:\n\n \"That it was the policy of the legislature to preserve the right to have an unbiased and unprejudiced jury and grand jury, and that no suspicion should attach to the manner of its selection in all cases, cannot be questioned.\"\n\n\n Some years later in State v. Guthrie\n3\n the Washington Supreme Court held that it was not only within the power of Washington State judges but it was also their duty to insure unbiased grand juries, even if so doing meant changing the composition of the grand juries selected by the rules of chance. That court in this latter case reiterated the statute's policy to preserve impartial grand \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 560]\n\u00a0\n juries and made it crystal clear that juries biased because of judicial inaction are as offensive to the policy of the Washington statute as juries biased because of deliberate judicial selection:\n\n \"While this section may be said to relate to challenges made by interested persons, it is not to be construed as denying to the court the right, upon its own motion, to excuse a juror deemed to be disqualified or incompetent. To deny this right would be out of harmony with the policy of the law, which charges the court with the responsibility of insuring that qualified and impartial grand jurors are secured.\"\n\n\n That this state policy for impartial grand juries has been generally accepted as the settled law of Washington is demonstrated, not only by the statements of the four judges who voted to reverse this conviction,\n4\n but also by the current practice cited to us of other Washington trial courts.\n5\n Indeed, the presiding judge who impaneled the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 561]\n\u00a0\n Beck grand jury made sufficient inquiries to insure that grand jurors would not be biased against the State in its investigation of Beck.\n\nThe Court, however, finds that the Murphy and Guthrie cases have no relation to the guarantee of a fair and impartial grand jury but are \"concerned only with whether the members of the grand jury had been selected by chance.\" But even the State has taken no such position, either before the Washington Supreme Court or here. In its brief before the Washington Supreme Court the State acknowledged that the Washington statute as interpreted by the Murphy and Guthrie cases set out a \"well-recognized rule\" that state \"grand juries should be impartial and unprejudiced.\"\n6\n And even in this Court the State \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 562]\n\u00a0\n does not repudiate this acknowledgment but says only that because the Washington Supreme Court was equally divided \"the meaning of Washington statutes in regard to grand juries cannot be determined at this point.\" But of course we must decide what the Washington law is in order to pass upon Beck's claim that Washington has denied him the equal protection of the law.\n\nThe Washington statute as authoritatively interpreted by its Supreme Court in the Murphy and Guthrie cases means not only that defendants are entitled under Washington law to have indictments against them returned by impartial grand jurors but also that Washington State judges are specifically charged with the duty and responsibility of making all inquiries necessary to insure defendants against being tried on indictments returned by prejudiced grand jurors. Neither the legislature nor the State Supreme Court has ever changed that statute or its interpretation. Certainly, the equal division of judges in the Washington Supreme Court which left Beck's conviction standing did not impair the old statute or its previously established interpretation. Even Washington's own counsel tell us that \"since the reasons for the Washington court being equally divided are signed by no more than four judges each, those reasons are not a decision of that court,\" and \"are of no significance whatsoever as far as the decisional law of the state of Washington is concerned.\" Since the legislature has not changed its statute and the Supreme Court of Washington has not changed its interpretation of that statute, the law of Washington remains the same as it was before Beck's \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 563]\n\u00a0\n conviction was left standing by the equally divided Washington court. And as it was before, it required Washington judges to protect persons from being indicted by prejudiced and biased grand juries. If Beck has been denied that protection without the law's having been changed, then he has been singled out by the State as the sole person to be so treated. Such a singling out would be a classic invidious discrimination and would amount to a denial of equal protection of the law. We must determine, therefore, whether the grand jury that indicted Beck was impaneled in a way that violated the state law.\n\nThis question is not that which the Court treats as crucial, whether there is proof in the record that some individual grand juror was actually prejudiced against Beck, but rather the quite different question of whether the judge who impaneled the grand jury took the precautions required by the statute and its controlling judicial interpretation to insure a grand jury that would not be tainted by prejudice against Beck. I think that the record in this case shows beyond doubt that the presiding judge failed to do what the state law required him to do - try to keep prejudiced persons off the grand jury. This failure was particularly serious here because of the extraordinary opportunity for prejudgment and prejudice created by the saturation of the Seattle area with publicity hostile and adverse to Beck in the months preceding and during the grand jury hearing.\n\nPetitioner Beck is a long-time resident of Seattle, well known to the community as president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and as a former president of the Western Conference of Teamsters. Beginning in March 1957, he became the target of a number of extremely serious charges of crime and corruption by the Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor or Management Field and its staff. These charges were \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 564]\n\u00a0\n given unprecedented circulation in the Seattle area.\n7\n On March 22-23, banner headlines proclaimed the Committee's charge that Beck had used $270,000 in Teamsters funds for his own benefit. When Beck appeared before the Committee several days later and refused to answer questions regarding the charges, he again drew headline coverage in the Seattle press: \"BECK TAKES 5TH AMENDMENT.\" One television station went so far as to run a 9 3\/4-hour telecast of the proceedings. On May 3, the headlines announced the fact that Beck had been indicted for federal tax evasion and that a former mayor of Seattle had received a special appointment to prosecute further charges before a state grand jury. On May 9, 15 and 16, other front-page, page-wide headlines appeared, the last charging that Beck had misused his position of union trust no less than 52 different times. On May 17, a three-column front-page story recounted the fact that Beck had pleaded the Fifth Amendment 60 times to questions from the Senate Committee. And on May 20, the day the grand jury was impaneled, headlines announced Beck's expulsion from his AFL-CIO post on the ground that \"Dave Beck was found `guilty as charged' by the A. F. of L.-C. I. O. executive council,\" and that same paper also carried a charge by Senator McClellan that Beck \"has committed many criminal offenses.\" All the while radio, television, the national news magazines and the press in lesser front-page and backup stories published charges of a similar nature. This flood of intense public accusation of crime and breach of trust by prominent and highly placed persons, coupled with publicity resulting from Beck's refusal on grounds of possible self-incrimination to answer questions \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 565]\n\u00a0\n before the Senate Committee as to the charges made, imposed a very heavy duty on the presiding judge under Washington law to protect Beck from a biased and prejudiced grand jury.\n\nFar from discharging that duty, however, the judge actually increased the probability that persons biased against Beck would be left on the grand jury. For while he asked a number of questions directed toward excluding from the jury union members who might be sympathetic to Beck, he made no effective effort at all to protect Beck. Thus, he managed to ask almost every juror whether he had any connection with the Teamsters or any affiliated union, whether he knew any of the Teamsters officers, or whether he had ever been a union officer himself. But, despite his knowledge of the widespread prejudice-breeding publicity against Beck, the judge failed to ask a single juror a single question regarding whether he had read about, heard about or discussed the charges against Beck. Moreover, he failed to ask a single juror who actually sat on the jury whether he was prejudiced against Beck or had already made up his mind about the many public charges.\n8\n Indeed as to those jurors the most searching question which even the Court has managed to pull from the record was the sterile query: \"Is there anything about sitting on this grand jury that might embarrass you at all?\" Even the most tenuous logic could not equate that search for embarrassment with a search for bias and prejudice. That a search for bias and prejudice would have shown its existence hardly seems questionable, particularly in view of the fact that six months later when the publicity adverse to Beck was, according to the Court, \"neither intensive nor extensive,\" 15 of 43 prospective petit jurors \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 566]\n\u00a0\n subjected to voir dire questioning expressed some degree of bias or prejudice in the case.\n9\n\u00a0\n\nAfter such a restrained effort toward affording Beck the protection of the unbiased grand jury assured by Washington law, it would be expected that the presiding judge would have given careful and detailed instructions to the grand jury in order to dispel any possible prejudice in their minds. Not so here, however. In fact the instructions given not only failed to cure, they made the situation worse. For instead of instructing that the testimony and charges before the Senate Committee were not evidence before the grand jury and that it would be highly improper for the grand jury to consider them at all, the presiding judge called the jury's attention to the charges of theft and embezzlement against Beck before the Committee and told the jury that it was under a duty to determine whether these charges were refuted by an explanation attributed by the press to Beck:\n\n \"It seems unnecessary to review the recent testimony before a Senate Investigating Committee except to say that disclosures have been made indicating that officers of the Teamsters Union have, through trick and device, embezzled or stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars of the funds of that union - money which had come to the union from the dues of its members. . . .\n\n\n \"The president of the Teamsters Union has publicly declared that the money he received from the union was a loan which he has repaid. This presents a question of fact, the truth of which is for you to ascertain.\" \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 567]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Together with the additional facts set out by MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS in his dissent, what I have said above seems clearly to show that the presiding judge took none of the steps, either in interrogation or in instruction, that in the atmosphere of the day would have fulfilled his state statutory duty to insure a grand jury unbiased against Beck.\n\nThis failure of the judge denies petitioner a protection which Washington has provided to similarly situated defendants over the years and which, so far as now foreseeable, Washington will continue to provide to all Washington defendants in the future. This failure would be cast in a different light if the Washington Legislature had repealed its law or if its Supreme Court had altered its interpretation and set out a general rule abrogating the right to have judges take affirmative action to insure an unbiased grand jury. But without any change in the prior law or any sure indication that Beck's \"law\" is the law of the future, the State of Washington in convicting Beck applies special and unfair treatment to him. For only Beck, a single individual out of all the people charged with crime by indictment in Washington, is denied his clearly defined right under the law to have the state judicial system insure his indictment by \"impartial grand jurors.\" Through the device of an equally divided vote in the Washington Supreme Court he goes to prison for 15 years. I think that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids such an invidious picking out of one individual to bear legal burdens that are not imposed upon others similarly situated.\n10\n I cannot agree with the Court that such a gross discrimination against a single individual with such disastrous consequences \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 568]\n\u00a0\n can be treated as a mere trial error. For a judicial decision which sends a man to prison by refusing to apply settled law which always has been and so far as appears will continue to be applied to all other defendants similarly situated is far more than a mere misapplication of state law.\n11\n It is a denial of equal protection of the law and a State should no more be allowed to deny a defendant protection of its laws through its judicial branch than through its legislative or executive branch.\n\nI think that petitioner was denied equal protection of the law for still another reason. The four Washington judges who voted to affirm the conviction below, and whose views have therefore determined the outcome of Beck's case, agreed that those \"in custody or held [on bail] to answer for an offense,\" the \"[p]ersons for whose benefit that statute was enacted,\" are entitled to grand jurors without bias or prejudice.\n12\n This divides all persons suspected of larceny by embezzlement, as petitioner was, into two classes: (1) those persons in custody or on bail, and (2) those persons who are only under investigation by grand jury. The first class is entitled to have an impartial and unbiased grand jury; the second is not. The four judges who wanted to reverse this conviction could see no reason, nor can I, for saying that one charged with crime and in jail or on bail should be entitled to an unprejudiced grand jury but one who happened not to be already held for grand jury action could validly be indicted by a biased and prejudiced grand jury. So far as \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 569]\n\u00a0\n the need to be free from prosecution by a prejudiced grand jury is concerned, there can be no rational distinction between the need of the man who is not yet in custody and the need of the man who is in jail or on bail,\n13\n particularly where as here the grand jury was called for the specific purpose of examining into petitioner's activities and was so instructed. No doubt the clearest evidence of the lack of rationality in such a distinction is the fact that for 108 years the State of Washington has itself made no such distinction. For even though the statute on its face applies only to those in custody or on bail, it has always been interpreted to guarantee an impartial grand jury to all.\n\nA fair trial under fair procedure is a basic element in our Government. Zealous partisans filled with bias and \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 570]\n\u00a0\n prejudice have no place among those whom government selects to play important parts in trials designed to lead to fair determinations of guilt or innocence. Whether the due process provisions of the Federal Constitution require, however, that every procedural step in a trial, including the impaneling of a grand jury, be absolutely fair and impartial, I need not determine here. But in considering whether people charged with the same crimes under the same circumstances, subject to the same penalties in the same place may be divided up into classes, some of whom are given the benefit of fair grand jurors and some of whom are not, we must keep in mind the high standard of fair and equal treatment imposed by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as the important part that grand juries play in trial procedures when they are used. For me the need for fair grand juries as between those who have not yet been formally arrested and those who have is too much the same to be treated as though it were different. I would not permit the State of Washington to lay its hands so unequally upon groups whose interests, whose needs and whose dangers are so similar.\n14\n\u00a0\n\nNot surprisingly the Court attempts to shrug off both of Beck's equal protection claims without reaching them on the merits. As to his first claim, that he was denied equal protection by the failure of the Washington courts to accord him the benefit of the state law guaranteeing an impartial grand jury, this Court asserts that even if Beck was, unlike everyone else, denied the benefit of a grand jury which had been questioned by the presiding judge to protect against bias, the error was harmless because he presented no proof to show that the grand jury selected in violation of Washington law was actually \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 571]\n\u00a0\n biased or prejudiced against him. But the Washington law puts the duty on the judge to insure against bias not on the defendant to show bias. The court cites absolutely no authority and I have been unable to find any that when a Washington State judge neglects his duty to assure an impartial grand jury his error is cured by the failure of the defendant to show actual bias on the part of one or more grand jurors. On the contrary, the Washington Supreme Court said in State ex rel. Murphy v. Superior Court:\n\n \"Granting, for the sake of argument, that no real injustice has been done in this particular case, and that a fair jury was selected, to approve the method adopted by the court would be to permit a judge, if he so willed, to provide a grand jury of his own choosing in every case under color of law.\"\n15\n\u00a0\n\n\n Moreover, even if it were possible under Washington law so cavalierly to fritter away important rights of criminal procedure designed to achieve fairness, this record should satisfy the most doubting Thomas that the failure to insure a proper grand jury here was in fact not harmless. While the trial court made no determination as to whether the grand jury was prejudiced against Beck, four of the eight Washington Supreme Court judges who ruled on the question felt that a conclusive showing of prejudice had been made. Judge Donworth, speaking for those four judges, after an exhaustive review of the facts concluded:\n\n\"I think it would be unrealistic to believe that a very substantial number of the citizens of the community had not adopted, consciously or unconsciously, an attitude of bias and prejudice toward appellant at the time the grand jury was convened. If ever there \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 572]\n\u00a0\n was a case which required the most stringent observance of every safeguard known to the law to protect a citizen against bias and prejudice, this was it.\"\n16\n\u00a0\n\n\n The other four judges did say: \"There is no showing of bias or prejudice,\" but gave not the slightest evidentiary or even argumentative support to show the correctness of this offhand statement.\n17\n In these circumstances where there has been no finding by the trial court and where the highest court of the State has divided evenly so that there is no finding there either, our ordinary \"solemn duty to make independent inquiry and determination of the disputed facts\"\n18\n upon which the question of denial of equal protection of the law turns becomes particularly pointed. Considering the overwhelming evidence to support the four judges who thought that petitioner had made a showing of prejudice, it seems inconceivable to me that it can fairly be said that no showing of prejudice was made.\n\nAs to Beck's second claim, that it is a denial of equal protection of the law to afford those in jail or on bail the judicial assurance of an impartial grand jury while denying such protection to those not in jail or on bail like Beck, the Court apparently does not claim that the error was harmless but discovers yet another way to avoid having to pass on the plain merits of his constitutional claim. It concludes on a number of grounds that petitioner's claim was not properly presented to the Washington Supreme Court. I do not think any one of the Court's grounds or all of them together justify its avoidance of determining Beck's constitutional contention on its merits.\n\n(a) It is said that this contention was not properly before the State Supreme Court because \"Petitioner's \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 573]\n\u00a0\n formal attack at the trial court level did not even mention 10.28.030 . . . .\" But Beck did claim that that section had not been complied with both in his \"Challenge to Grand Jury\" and in his separate motion to set aside the indictment, both of which are set out in note 3 of the Court's opinion. In fact his challenge to the grand jury was specifically cast in the terms of 10.28.030. And Beck's reliance on 10.28.030 and related sections of Washington's grand jury statute was emphasized time and time again by his counsel's arguments to the trial court, both oral and written, on the challenge and on his separate motion to dismiss the indictment. For example, trial counsel said:\n\n \". . . [T]he decisions which we have been able to find all indicate the same thing. That is, that the Grand Jury just like the trial jury, must be unbiased and unprejudiced, and indeed in a couple of the decisions they referred to this 10.28.030 in the same manner I have done to indicate the intent of the Legislature.\"\n19\n\u00a0\n\n\n (b) The Court says: \"That the prosecution and the court viewed petitioner as outside the scope of 10.28.030 was brought home to him in the course of the trial court proceedings on his grand jury attack.\" I cannot agree that the trial court construed 10.28.030 as denying Beck the right to an impartial and unprejudiced grand jury or informed him to that effect. While it is true that the State's counsel argued and the trial court agreed that petitioner could not question the method of impaneling the grand jury by a \"Challenge to Grand Jury,\" the trial court never even intimated that 10.28.030 limited its assurance of an impartial and unprejudiced grand jury \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 574]\n\u00a0\n only to those who were indicted while they were in jail or out on bond. On the contrary, the trial court admitted, even though it ultimately denied petitioner's motion without further comment, that petitioner could attack the grand jury - \"incidentally on a motion to set aside the indictment\" - precisely the kind of motion the petitioner actually made under 10.40.070, which motion is set out in note 3 of the Court's opinion.\n\n(c) The Court says that the State Supreme Court was not required to pass on petitioner's claim of denial of equal protection because it was not \"definitely pointed out in the `assignments of error' in appellant's brief,\" as required by Rule 43 of the State Rules on Appeal. But as just pointed out the trial court had not construed the statute as denying Beck who was not in custody or on bail the benefit of an impartial grand jury while insuring such a grand jury for defendants who were in custody or on bail. Since the trial court had made no such ruling, Beck could not of course assign as error a ruling that had not been made. He did, however, properly assign errors which, as shown in the Court's note 4, were sufficiently broad to challenge the trial court's failure to comply with state law in insuring an impartial grand jury. That was all that he could do at that time.\n\n(d) Another ground for this Court's refusal to rule on Beck's claim is that: \"The Washington Supreme Court has unfailingly refused to consider constitutional attacks upon statutes not made in the trial court . . . .\" But even a casual investigation of the opinions of that court shows that it has not \"unfailingly\" followed any such practice.\n20\n Moreover, no Washington case or any other \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 575]\n\u00a0\n has been cited to prove that a question of equal protection of the law must be raised in the trial court even though that court does not itself ever make a ruling which denies equal protection of the law. And I would think that this Court would not tolerate use of such a state device to bar correction of constitutional violations.\n\n(e) Finally while I disagree that Beck's claim has not been properly presented to the Washington Supreme Court, I find that wholly immaterial here. For as we said in Raley v. Ohio: \"There can be no question as to the proper presentation of a federal claim when the highest state court passes on it.\"\n21\n And here although undoubtedly familiar with the state rule and the state cases dug up here by this Court for the first time to show that Beck's claim was not properly presented, the fact is that the eight judges of the Washington Supreme Court who sat in this case did actually pass on Beck's claim in his brief before them that to take away his right to an impartial grand jury because he was not in custody or on bail would deny him the equal protection of the laws. That claim in Beck's State Supreme Court brief was:\n\n\"In fact, to permit one who has already been arrested to challenge the mental qualifications of a grand juror, while denying this right to one who has not been arrested, would amount to a denial of equal protection of the law. This is particularly true . . . in the state of Washington . . . .\"\n22\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 576]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n In response to Beck's claim Judge Donworth, speaking for the four judges who voted to reverse the conviction, fully agreed with his contention, saying:\n\n \"I do not understand how it can be said, under the facts shown in this record, that the reason entitling a person in custody or held to answer for an offense to be investigated by an impartial and unprejudiced grand jury, does not apply equally well to appellant. It is axiomatic that all men are equal before the law and are entitled to the same rights under the same or similar circumstances.\n\n\n .   .  .  .   .\n\n\n\"Until the legislature amends or repeals the statutory law, . . . it must be applied with equal effect to every person whose conduct is under investigation by a grand jury pursuant to the court's charge to it.\"\n23\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 577]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The other four judges, obviously disagreeing with their brethren and rejecting Beck's equal protection claim, held that \"There was a reason\" for the statutory guarantee of an impartial grand jury for one \"in custody or held to answer for an offense,\" although denying it to one not in custody or on bail.\n24\n\u00a0\n\n(f) The Court also goes so far as to say that Beck's constitutional question was not included among those questions presented which our writ of certiorari was granted to review. I disagree. In the questions presented in the petition for certiorari and in the brief supporting that petition, counsel for Beck repeatedly asserted that in the manner of selecting this grand jury Beck had been denied the equal protection of the law. The core of all these claims is discrimination growing out of the manner of the selection of the grand jury. The particular classification claim which the Court seeks to avoid passing on is also a claimed discrimination with reference to the manner of selection of the grand jury. Since all these contentions are inextricably intertwined, under our decision of last term in Boynton v. Virginia\n25\n I see no more reason for refusing to pass on one than another. That case held a statutory claim of discrimination to have been sufficiently raised where discrimination generally was \"the core of the . . . broad constitutional questions presented.\" Moreover, I agree with MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS that under Rule 23 which prohibits \"unnecessary detail\" and which deems a question presented \"to include every subsidiary question fairly comprised therein\" even the most general claim of equal protection would have been sufficient to raise petitioner's claim.\n\nThe petitioner here, however, has no need to rely on either the Boynton case or on the broad mandate of Rule 23, for his claims are clearly encompassed among the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 578]\n\u00a0\n specific questions as to which the writ of certiorari was granted. Two of those questions read in part:\n\n \". . . [D]oes a person . . . have a right under the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to have the charges and evidence considered by a grand jury which was fair and impartial or, at least, which was instructed and directed to act fairly and impartially?\"\n\n\n \". . . [D]id he [petitioner] have a right under the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to have the grand jury impaneled in a manner which would prevent or at least tend to prevent the selection of biased and prejudiced grand jurors?\"\n\n\n Since petitioner's claim is that he was denied equal protection of the law by the failure of the presiding judge to provide the protection, guaranteed to others, of a grand jury impaneled in a manner that would insure against biased and prejudiced grand jurors, it seems inconceivable that this conviction should be sustained on the basis that the claim was not included in the petition for certiorari.\n\nThe net result of what has taken place in the Washington Supreme Court and here is to leave Beck in this predicament: the State Supreme Court considered his contention, tried to decide it but could not because it was equally divided; this Court on the contrary refuses to decide it at all on the ground that Beck has never raised such a question anywhere. The practical consequence of this predicament is to accept the argument of the State that if Beck's constitutional rights are to be protected he must depend upon \"the Washington legislature and not the United States Supreme Court.\"\n26\n For this Court to \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 579]\n\u00a0\n accept such a consequence seems to me to be an abandonment of its solemn responsibility to protect the constitutional rights of the people.\n\nThe rules of practice which Congress and this Court have adopted over the course of years to crystallize and define the issues properly before the Court were designed to assist the Court in the fair and impartial administration of justice. I cannot believe that this end has been achieved here.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Revised Code of Washington 10.28.030.

[Beck], as a matter of law, was entitled to an impartial and unprejudiced grand jury,\" and that the \"failure of the court to interrogate the jurors for the existence of possible bias and prejudice against the officers of the teamsters' union constituted prejudicial error.\" State v. Beck, 56 Wash. 2d 474, 519, 520, 349 P.2d 387, 412, 413.

Among the cases cited in appellant's state court brief to support his contention that the grand jury was not organized in accordance with state law were Watts v. Washington Territory, 1 Wash.

Two of these were excused.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Although 52 prospective jurors were admitted to voir dire, nine of these were excused for personal reasons of health or convenience and were not therefore questioned by either counsel.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] See Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe R.

Thus in United States v. Blodgett, 30 Fed. Cas. 1157, 1159 (No. 18312), the court said:\n\n\"True, he was not arrested and imprisoned on any criminal charge, and now brought hither by order of the court, nor is he under bail or recognizance; but because he is not in any of these constrained positions, is he any the less entitled to a grand jury of his country, legally qualified under its laws? Surely not.\"\n\n\n And in McQuillen v. State, 16 Miss. 587, 597, the Mississippi court said as to a purported distinction between the right of persons in court at the time of indictment to challenge grand jurors for cause and the right of those not in court to challenge such jurors:\n\n\"[T]he law works unequally by allowing one class of persons to object to the competency of the grand jury, whilst another class has no such privilege. This cannot be.

I must also take issue with the Court's view that this particular constitutional contention was stated in only one sentence. As I read the briefs before me petitioner took up almost two whole \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 576]\n\u00a0\n pages in presenting this argument and cites eight cases and other authorities. Moreover, the four State Supreme Court judges who voted to affirm and who had petitioner's brief before them referred to that part of the brief devoted to the \"Grand Jury Proceedings\" as \"the longest section of appellant's brief.\" 56 Wash. 2d, at 475, 349 P.2d, at 387. Since they had to read this section to refer to it in this way and to discuss it, I am at a complete loss to understand the Court's further statement that petitioner's argument on this point was \"considered by the Washington Supreme Court to be an abandonment or waiver of such contention.\" I can only consider the abandonment found by this Court to be an ex post facto abandonment as far as the Washington Supreme Court is concerned because as pointed out above that court actually considered and passed on the point.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 23\n] 56 Wash. 2d, at 528, 530, 349 P.2d, at 418, 419. (Emphasis supplied by Judge Donworth.) To suggest, as the Court does, that this discussion involves \"interpretation\" of the statute but does not relate to equal protection of the laws is to draw a distinction that simply does not exist. What the four judges who wanted to reverse this conviction said in the plainest words possible was that the interpretation of the statute adopted by the four who voted to affirm is one that is wrong because, among other reasons, it denies equal protection of the law.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 24\n] 56 Wash. 2d, at 479, 349 P.2d, at 390.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 25\n] \n364 \nU.S. 454, 457\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 26\n] That argument was fully set out in the State's Opposition to the Petition for certiorari: \"The effect of the Washington court decision in the instant case is that the meaning of Washington statutes in \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 579]\n\u00a0\n regard to grand juries cannot be determined at this point. It would follow that this determination also is binding on the United States Supreme Court.\n\n\"Since there is neither a Federal nor a Washington state Constitutional right to an impartial grand jury, and the Washington Supreme Court cannot determine what the Washington statutes prescribe in that regard, the Washington legislature and not the United States Supreme Court must answer that question.\" (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nAlthough, according to Hurtado v. California, \n110 \nU.S. 516\n, Washington need not use the grand jury in order to bring criminal charges against persons, it occasionally does use one; and a grand jury was impaneled in this case. It is well settled that when either the Federal Government or a State uses a grand jury, the accused is entitled to those procedures which will insure, so far as possible, that the grand jury selected is fair and impartial.\n1\n That \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 580]\n\u00a0\n is the reason why the systematic exclusion of Negroes from grand jury service infects the accusatory process. See Pierre v. Louisiana, \n306 \nU.S. 354\n; Cassell v. Texas, \n339 \nU.S. 282\n. The same principle was applied in Hernandez v. Texas, \n347 \nU.S. 475\n, when Mexicans were systematically excluded from duty as grand and petit jurors. The same principle would also apply \"if a law should be passed excluding all naturalized Celtic Irishmen\" from grand jury duty. Strauder v. West Virginia, \n100 \nU.S. 303, 308\n.\n\nRacial discrimination is only one aspect of the grand jury problem. As stated in Hale v. Henkel, \n201 \nU.S. 43, 59\n, \". . . the most valuable function of the grand jury was not only to examine into the commission of crimes, but to stand between the prosecutor and the accused, and to determine whether the charge was founded upon credible testimony or was dictated by malice or personal ill will.\" We emphasized in Hoffman v. United States, \n341 \nU.S. 479, 485\n, the importance of \"the continuing necessity that prosecutors and courts alike be `alert to repress' any abuses of the investigatory power\" of the grand jury.\n2\n We recently stated in Costello v. United States, \n350 \nU.S. 359, 362\n, that:\n\n\"The grand jury is an English institution, brought to this country by the early colonists and incorporated in the Constitution by the Founders. There is every reason to believe that our constitutional grand jury was intended to operate substantially like its English progenitor. The basic purpose of the English grand jury was to provide a fair method for instituting criminal proceedings against persons believed to have committed crimes.\" (Italics added.) \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 581]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The Washington Supreme Court, which affirmed this judgment of conviction, did so by an equally divided vote. The four voting for affirmance stated that absent a statutory requirement, \"bias or prejudice\" on the part of the grand jury was irrelevant. 56 Wash. 2d 474, 480, 349 P.2d 387, 390.\n\nThe case of Frisbie v. Collins, \n342 \nU.S. 519\n, is offered as justification for the use of an unfair procedure in bringing this charge against petitioner. We there held that forcibly abducting a person and bringing him into the State did not vitiate a state conviction where the trial was fair and pursuant to constitutional procedural requirements. Here, however, a part of the criminal proceeding is itself infected with unfairness. Whether it was necessary to use the grand jury is immaterial. It was used; and the question is whether it was used unfairly. The case is, therefore, like those where procedures, anterior to the trial, are oppressive. A notorious example is an unlawful arrest or the use of detention by the police to obtain a confession. See, e. g., Payne v. Arkansas, \n356 \nU.S. 560\n; Fikes v. Alabama, \n352 \nU.S. 191\n; Watts v. Indiana, \n338 \nU.S. 49\n; Turner v. Pennsylvania, \n338 \nU.S. 62\n; Ward v. Texas, \n316 \nU.S. 547\n. Another example is denial of the right to counsel. As stated in Powell v. Alabama, \n287 \nU.S. 45, 57\n, that right extends to a period anterior to the trial itself \"when consultation, thorough-going investigation and preparation\" are \"vitally important.\" Cf. Spano v. New York, \n360 \nU.S. 315, 324\n (concurring opinion).\n\nCould we possibly sustain a conviction obtained in either a state or federal court where the grand jury that brought the charge was composed of the accused's political enemies? If we did, we would sanction prosecution for private, not public, purposes. Whenever unfairness can be shown to infect any part of a criminal proceeding, we should hold that the requirements of due process are lacking. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 582]\n\u00a0\n\n\nA dissent in Cassell v. Texas, \n339 \nU.S. 282, 298\n, said, \"It hardly lies in the mouth of a defendant whom a fairly chosen trial jury has found guilty beyond reasonable doubt, to say that his indictment is attributable to prejudice.\" Id., at 302. But the Court did not agree. Since a grand jury was used to indict, the Court held the grand jury to constitutional requirements. We should do the same here. As we stated in Hill v. Texas, \n316 \nU.S. 400, 406\n:\n\n\"It is the State's function, not ours, to assess the evidence against a defendant. But it is our duty as well as the State's to see to it that throughout the procedure for bringing him to justice he shall enjoy the protection which the Constitution guarantees. Where, as in this case, timely objection has laid bare a discrimination in the selection of grand jurors, the conviction cannot stand, because the Constitution prohibits the procedure by which it was obtained.\"\n\n\n A grand jury serves a high function. As stated in United States v. Wells, 163 F. 313, 324:\n\n\"It is a familiar historical fact that the system was devised to prevent harassments growing out of malicious, unfounded, or vexatious accusations. That it serves the purpose of allowing prosecutions to be initiated by the people themselves in no way detracts from the fact that it still stands as a safeguard against arbitrary or oppressive action.\"\n\n\n The same view was stated by Mr. Justice Field, sitting as Circuit Justice:\n\n \"In this country, from the popular character of our institutions, there has seldom been any contest between the government and the citizen, which required the existence of the grand jury as a protection against oppressive action of the government. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 583]\n\u00a0\n Yet the institution was adopted in this country, and is continued from considerations similar to those which give to it its chief value in England, and is designed as a means, not only of bringing to trial persons accused of public offenses upon just grounds, but also as a means of protecting the citizen against unfounded accusation, whether it come from government or be prompted by partisan passion or private enmity.\" 30 Fed. Cas. 992, 993, No. 18,255.\n\n\n One who reads this record is left with doubts of the most serious character that the procedure used in the selection of the grand jury was fair in light of the unusual conditions that obtained at the time.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nPetitioner on March 26 and 27, 1957, appeared before a Senate Committee in Washington, D.C., and during his questioning invoked the Fifth Amendment 150 times.\n\nOn May 2, 1957, petitioner was indicted in Tacoma by a federal grand jury for income tax evasion.\n\nOn May 8, 1957, petitioner was recalled to testify before the Senate Committee and during another long interrogation invoked the Fifth Amendment about 60 times.\n\nDuring these hearings the Committee members made various comments concerning petitioner. As Judge Donworth, speaking for himself and three other members of the Supreme Court of Washington, said:\n\n\"These comments, which were extremely derogatory to appellant, were widely circulated by all news media throughout the United States, and particularly in the Seattle area. In these comments, appellant was characterized as a thief, and it was asserted that he was guilty of fraud and other illegal conduct with respect to his management of the affairs of the teamsters' union as its principal officer in the eleven \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 584]\n\u00a0\n western states, and later in his position as its international president.\n\n\n \"These conclusions and opinions (particularly those expressed by Senator McClellan, the chairman of the committee) were displayed by local newspapers on the front page in prominent headlines. The following are a few of the comments which were referred to in such headlines which appeared in Seattle newspapers:\n\n\n \"`TEAMSTERS' CASH KEPT GOING TO BECK AFTER HE BECAME UNION PRESIDENT, SAYS PROBER.' Seattle Times, March 23, 1957.\n\n\n .  . . . .\n\n\n \"`BECK GIVES \"BLACK EYE\" TO LABOR, SAYS SEN. McNAMARA.' Seattle Times, March 27, 1957.\n\n\n \"`SENATE PROBE LIFTS LID ON BECK BEER BUSINESS - USE OF UNION MONEY RELATED.' Seattle Post-Intelligencer, May 9, 1957.\n\n\n \"Substantial portions of the committee proceedings relating to these charges were also reproduced in the course of news broadcasts on local radio and television stations.\n\n\n \"The amount, intensity, and derogatory nature of the publicity received by appellant during this period is without precedent in the state of Washington. A Seattle newspaper carried a news item reporting that the switchboard of a local radio station that had broadcast the committee proceedings on the preceding day was jammed with calls, and that the officials of the station characterized the response to the broadcast on the part of the public as `astounding,' and that such response was greater than that resulting from any other broadcast ever aired by them. The serious accusations made by United States senators in the committee hearings are generally regarded by \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 585]\n\u00a0\n laymen as being officials charges (which appellant had refused to answer), and thus the impression was created among the general public that appellant had been found guilty of a crime.\" 56 Wash. 2d 474, 510-512, 349 P.2d 387, 408.\n\n\n The grand jury which returned the indictment was convened on May 20, 1957.\n\nThe effect of the saturation of Seattle with this adverse publicity was summarized by Judge Donworth:\n\n\"The natural effect of this publicity was that, in the eyes of the average citizen, the character of appellant had been thoroughly discredited in the Seattle area on or before May 20, 1957.\" 56 Wash. 2d, at 512, 349 P.2d, at 408.\n\n\n The trial court at the time of the selection of the petit jury referred to the publicity the case had received in the papers and over the radio and TV and sought to determine whether any jurors had become prejudiced or biased against the accused. The judge who impaneled the grand jury took no such precautions. He excused three who might have been prejudiced because they were or had been members of petitioner's union or of affiliated unions. He excused one employer who in reply to the question \"Are you conscious of any bias, prejudice or sympathy in this case at all?\" said, \"That is pretty hard to answer.\" Of the six he excused, two admitted prejudice. Not once did the judge inquire as to the intensive adverse publicity petitioner had received and its likely effect on each juror. He asked two types of questions. The one already noted, whether the juror was conscious of bias, etc., and the other one, \"Is there anything about sitting on this grand jury that might embarrass you at all?\" It seems to me that the judge was derelict in failing to ascertain whether the amount of adverse \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 586]\n\u00a0\n publicity petitioner had received had prejudiced the jurors toward the case about to be presented. Although he made no such inquiry of any juror, he proceeded upon the assumption that the grand jury had full knowledge of the activities of the Senate Committee:\n\n \"We come now to the purpose of this grand jury and the reasons which the judges of this court thought sufficient to justify the expense to the county, and the inconvenience to and sacrifice by you, which this grand jury session will require.\n\n\n \"It seems unnecessary to review the recent testimony before a Senate Investigating Committee except to say that disclosures have been made indicating that officers of the Teamsters Union have, through trick and device, embezzled or stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars of the funds of that union - money which had come to the union from the dues of its members. It has been alleged that many of these transactions, through which the money was siphoned out of the union treasury, occurred in King County. Such crimes, if committed, cannot be punished under Federal law, or under any law other than that of the State of Washington, and prosecution must take place in King County. The necessary criminal charges can only be brought in this county upon indictment by the grand jury or information filed by the prosecuting attorney.\n\n\n \"The president of the Teamsters Union has publicly declared that the money he received from the union was a loan which he has repaid. This presents a question of fact, the truth of which is for you to ascertain.\n\n\n \"You may find that many of the transactions happened more than three years ago; this would raise the question of the statute of limitations, which ordinarily \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 587]\n\u00a0\n bars a prosecution for larceny after three years. There are some instances, however, where the period is extended. This is a question of law and you should be guided by the advice of the prosecutors on this and similar questions. Your investigation may conceivably result in the adoption of better standards of conduct for union officials.\"\n\n\n No admonition was given that radio, television, and newspaper reports were not the gospel. No warning was made that one who invokes the Fifth Amendment does not admit guilt. No admonition was given that the deliberations should be free of bias or prejudice. The question is not whether one who receives large-scale adverse publicity can escape grand jury investigation nor whether the hue and cry attendant on adverse publicity must have died down before the grand jury can make its investigation. This case shows the need to make as sure as is humanly possible that one after whom the mob and public passion are in full pursuit is treated fairly, that the grand jury stands between him and an aroused public, that the judge uses the necessary procedures to insure dispassionate consideration of the charge.\n\nThe State of Washington uses the grand jury only occasionally, the normal method of accusation being by information. Whether grand jurors in other cases are screened for bias or prejudice does not appear. Yet on the assumption that they are not, Beck's objections should not be in vain. Whether the unfair device is used customarily or only once, it does not comport with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nI think the Court is correct in rejecting the general equal protection question on the merits. But I do think that a narrow phase of equal protection was raised and \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 588]\n\u00a0\n should be decided in petitioner's favor.\n3\n It is conceded that if Beck had been \"in custody or held to answer for an offense\" he would have been entitled to challenge the grand jurors for prejudice. 56 Wash. 2d, at 479, 349 P.2d \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 589]\n\u00a0\n ___, at 390. To grant that class the right to challenge for prejudice and to deny it to those who are merely under investigation is to draw a line not warranted by the requirements of equal protection. I agree with the views of Judge Donworth, with whom Judges Finley, Hunter, and Rosellini concurred:\n\n \"I do not understand how it can be said, under the facts shown in this record, that the reason entitling a person in custody or held to answer for an offense to be investigated by an impartial and unprejudiced grand jury, does not apply equally well to appellant. It is axiomatic that all men are equal before the law and are entitled to the same rights under the same or similar circumstances.\" 56 Wash. 2d, at 528, 349 P.2d, at 418.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Since petitioner was not represented by counsel at the impaneling of the grand jury, his objection at the return of the indictment was timely. As stated in Crowley v. United States, \n194 \nU.S. 461, 469\n-470:\n\n\"Some of the cases have gone so far as to hold that an objection to the personal qualifications of grand jurors is not available for the accused unless made before the indictment is returned in court. Such a rule would, in many cases, operate to deny altogether the right of an accused to question the qualifications of those who found \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 580]\n\u00a0\n the indictment against him; for he may not know, indeed, is not entitled, of right, to know, that his acts are the subject of examination by the grand jury.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See Morse, A Survey of the Grand Jury System, 10 Ore. L. Rev. 217.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] This is not a case where decision is asked on a question not \"formally presented\" by the petition for certiorari, as was true in General Pictures Co. v. Electric Co., \n304 \nU.S. 175, 179\n. It appears from the record that the question of equal protection was a \"definite issue\" decided by the Washington Supreme Court (Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. Duvall, \n225 \nU.S. 477, 487\n); and in at least two places in the questions presented by the petition for certiorari that decision was challenged for denial of equal protection. This was clearly sufficient, as Rule 23 (1) (c), in haec verba, discourages detailed amplification of the questions presented:\n\n\"The questions presented for review, expressed in the terms and circumstances of the case but without unnecessary detail. The statement of a question presented will be deemed to include every subsidiary question fairly comprised therein. . . .\"\n\n\n The petition states, inter alia:\n\n\"1. Where accusation is by a grand jury indictment, does a person (in this case a member and officer of a labor union who at the time of the grand jury proceedings was the subject of continuous, extensive and intensely prejudicial publicity) have a right under the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to have the charges and evidence considered by a grand jury which was fair and impartial or, at least, which was instructed and directed to act fairly and impartially?\n\n\n\"(a) Where petitioner was a member and officer of a labor union, and where prejudicial and inflammatory charges against him were being widely and intensively disseminated by all news media, did he have a right under the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to have the grand jury impaneled in a manner which would prevent or at least tend to prevent the selection of biased and prejudiced grand jurors?\"\n\n\n This is enough to bring the case within our rule that only the questions \"urged in the petition for certiorari and incidental to their determination will be considered on review.\" Rorick v. Devon Syndicate, \n307 \nU.S. 299, 303\n.\n\nAt least four of the judges below thought that the equal protection point treated in this dissent was an issue. For after referring to the Washington statute which gives those in custody or held to answer \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 589]\n\u00a0\n for an offense the right to an impartial and unprejudiced grand jury (56 Wash. 2d, at 527-528, 349 P.2d, at 417) they stated: \"Until the legislature amends or repeals the statutory law, quoted and emphasized above, it must be applied with equal effect to every person whose conduct is under investigation by a grand jury pursuant to the court's charge to it.\" 56 Wash. 2d, at 530, 349 P.2d, at 419. That seems to me sufficient to bring this ruling within the statement in Raley v. Ohio, \n360 \nU.S. 423, 436\n, to the effect that \"There can be no question as to the proper presentation of a federal claim when the highest state court passes on it.\" \n\n[369 \nU.S. 541, 590]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","11":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBEL OIL CORP. v.

LEHMAN(1962)\nNo. 66\nArgued: Decided: January 22, 1962\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner, a stockholder in a corporation with stock registered on a national securities exchange, sued under 16 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to recover on behalf of the corporation from one of its directors and a partnership of which he was a member \"short-swing\" profits realized by them on the purchase and sale by the partnership of stock of the corporation within a period of less than six months. Petitioner alleged that the partnership had \"deputed\" the director to represent its interests on the corporation's board of directors and that, by reason of his inside information, he had caused the partnership to purchase the stock of the corporation. The District Court found that these allegations were not supported by the evidence and that the partnership had bought the stock solely on the basis of the corporation's public announcements and without consulting the director. Accordingly, it denied a judgment against the partnership and the director for the full amount of the resulting profits and awarded a judgment against the director for only his proportionate share of the partnership's profits on these transactions, without interest. The Court of Appeals affirmed in all respects. Held: The judgment is affirmed. Pp. 404-414.\n\n (1) The findings of the courts below on the disputed factual issues were not clearly erroneous; they were not conclusions of law; and they are sustained.

JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe petitioner Blau, a stockholder in Tide Water Associated Oil Company, brought this action in a United States District Court on behalf of the company under 16 (b)\n1\n of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to \n\n[368 \nU.S. 403, 405]\n\u00a0\n recover with interest \"short swing\" profits, that is, profits earned within a six months' period by the purchase and sale of securities, alleged to have been \"realized\" by respondents in Tide Water securities dealings. Respondents are Lehman Brothers, a partnership engaged in investment banking, securities brokerage and in securities trading for its own account, and Joseph A. Thomas, a member of Lehman Brothers and a director of Tide Water. The complaint alleged that Lehman Brothers \"deputed . . . Thomas, to represent its interests as a director on the Tide Water Board of Directors,\" and that within a period of six months in 1954 and 1955 Thomas, while representing the interests of Lehman Brothers as a director of Tide Water and \"by reason of his special and inside knowledge of the affairs of Tide Water, advised and caused the defendants, Lehman Brothers, to purchase and sell 50,000 shares of . . . stock of Tide Water, realizing profits thereon which did not inure to and [were] not recovered by Tide Water.\"\n\nThe case was tried before a district judge without a jury. The evidence showed that Lehman Brothers had in \n\n[368 \nU.S. 403, 406]\n\u00a0\n fact earned profits out of short-swing transactions in Tide Water securities while Thomas was a director of that company. But as to the charges of deputization and wrongful use of \"inside\" information by Lehman Brothers, the evidence was in conflict.\n\nFirst, there was testimony that respondent Thomas had succeeded Hertz, another Lehman partner, on the board of Tide Water; that Hertz had \"joined Tidewater Company thinking it was going to be in the interests of Lehman Brothers\"; and that he had suggested Thomas as his successor partly because it was in the interest of Lehman. There was also testimony, however, that Thomas, aside from having mentioned from time to time to some of his partners and other people that he thought Tide Water was \"an attractive investment\" and under \"good\" management, had never discussed the operating details of Tide Water affairs with any member of Lehman Brothers;\n2\n that Lehman had bought the Tide Water securities without consulting Thomas and wholly on the basis of public announcements by Tide Water that common shareholders could thereafter convert their shares to a new cumulative preferred issue; that Thomas did not know of Lehman's intent to buy Tide Water stock until after the initial purchases had been made; that upon learning about the purchases he immediately notified Lehman that he must be excluded from \"any risk of the purchase or any profit or loss from the subsequent sale\"; and that this disclaimer was accepted by the firm.\n3\n\u00a0\n\n[368 \nU.S. 403, 407]\n\u00a0\n\n\nFrom the foregoing and other testimony the District Court found that \"there was no evidence that the firm of Lehman Brothers deputed Thomas to represent its interests as director on the board of Tide Water\" and that there had been no actual use of inside information, Lehman Brothers having bought its Tide Water stock \"solely on the basis of Tide Water's public announcements and without consulting Thomas.\"\n\nOn the basis of these findings the District Court refused to render a judgment, either against the partnership or against Thomas individually, for the $98,686.77 profits which it determined that Lehman Brothers had realized,\n4\n holding:\n\n \"The law is now well settled that the mere fact that a partner in Lehman Brothers was a director of Tide Water, at the time that Lehman Brothers had this short swing transaction in the stock of Tide Water, is not sufficient to make the partnership liable for the profits thereon, and that Thomas could not be held liable for the profits realized by the other partners from the firm's short swing transactions. Rattner v. Lehman, 2 Cir., 1952, 193 F.2d 564, 565, 567. This precise question was passed upon in the Rattner decision.\" 173 F. Supp. 590, 593.\n\n\n Despite its recognition that Thomas had specifically waived his share of the Tide Water transaction profits, the trial court nevertheless held that within the meaning of 16 (b) Thomas had \"realized\" $3,893.41, his proportionate share of the profits of Lehman Brothers. The court consequently entered judgment against Thomas for that amount but refused to allow interest against him. \n\n[368 \nU.S. 403, 408]\n\u00a0\n On appeal, taken by both sides, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit adhered to the view it had taken in Rattner v. Lehman, 193 F.2d 564, and affirmed the District Court's judgment in all respects, Judge Clark dissenting. 286 F.2d 786. The Securities and Exchange Commission then sought leave from the Court of Appeals en banc to file an amicus curiae petition for rehearing urging the overruling of the Rattner case. The Commission's motion was denied, Judges Clark and Smith dissenting. We granted certiorari on the petition of Blau, filed on behalf of himself, other stockholders and Tide Water, and supported by the Commission. \n366 \nU.S. 902\n. The questions presented by the petition are whether the courts below erred: (1) in refusing to render a judgment against the Lehman partnership for the $98,686.77 profits they were found to have \"realized\" from their \"short-swing\" transactions in Tide Water stock, (2) in refusing to render judgment against Thomas for the full $98,686.77 profits, and (3) in refusing to allow interest on the $3,893.41 recovery allowed against Thomas.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nPetitioner apparently seeks to have us decide the questions presented as though he had proven the allegations of his complaint that Lehman Brothers actually deputized Thomas to represent its interests as a director of Tide Water, and that it was his advice and counsel based on his special and inside knowledge of Tide Water's affairs that caused Lehman Brothers to buy and sell Tide Water's stock. But the trial court found otherwise and the Court of Appeals affirmed these findings. Inferences could perhaps \n\n[368 \nU.S. 403, 409]\n\u00a0\n have been drawn from the evidence to support petitioner's charges, but examination of the record makes it clear to us that the findings of the two courts below were not clearly erroneous. Moreover, we cannot agree with the Commission that the courts' determinations of the disputed factual issues were conclusions of law rather than findings of fact. We must therefore decide whether Lehman Brothers, Thomas or both have an absolute liability under 16 (b) to pay over all profits made on Lehman's Tide Water stock dealings even though Thomas was not sitting on Tide Water's board to represent Lehman and even though the profits made by the partnership were on its own initiative, independently of any advice or \"inside\" knowledge given it by director Thomas.\n\nFirst. The language of 16 does not purport to impose its extraordinary liability on any \"person,\" \"fiduciary\" or not, unless he or it is a \"director,\" \"officer\" or \"beneficial owner of more than 10 percentum of any class of any equity security . . . which is registered on a national securities exchange.\"\n6\n Lehman Brothers was neither an officer nor a 10% stockholder of Tide Water, but petitioner and the Commission contend that the Lehman partnership is or should be treated as a director under 16 (b).\n\n(a) Although admittedly not \"literally designated\" as one, it is contended that Lehman is a director. No doubt Lehman Brothers, though a partnership, could for purposes of 16 be a \"director\" of Tide Water and function through a deputy, since 3 (a) (9) of the Act\n7\n provides that \" `person' means . . . partnership\" and 3 (a) (7)\n8\n that \" `director' means any director of a corporation or any person performing similar functions with respect to any organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated.\" \n\n[368 \nU.S. 403, 410]\n\u00a0\n Consequently, Lehman Brothers would be a \"director\" of Tide Water, if as petitioner's complaint charged Lehman actually functioned as a director through Thomas, who had been deputized by Lehman to perform a director's duties not for himself but for Lehman. But the findings of the two courts below, which we have accepted, preclude such a holding. It was Thomas, not Lehman Brothers as an entity, that was the director of Tide Water.\n\n(b) It is next argued that the intent of 3 (a) (9) in defining \"person\" as including a partnership is to treat a partnership as an inseparable entity.\n9\n Because Thomas, one member of this inseparable entity, is an \"insider,\"\n10\n it is contended that the whole partnership should be considered the \"insider.\" But the obvious intent of 3 (a) (9), as the Commission apparently realizes, is merely to make it clear that a partnership can be treated as an entity under the statute, not that it must be. This affords no reason at all for construing the word \"director\" in 16 (b) as though it read \"partnership of which the director is a member.\" And the fact that Congress provided in 3 (a) (9) for a partnership to be treated as an entity in its own right likewise offers no support for the argument that Congress wanted a partnership to be subject to all the responsibilities and financial burdens of its members in carrying on their other individual business activities.\n\n(c) Both the petitioner and the Commission contend on policy grounds that the Lehman partnership should be held liable even though it is neither a director, officer, nor \n\n[368 \nU.S. 403, 411]\n\u00a0\n a 10% stockholder. Conceding that such an interpretation is not justified by the literal language of 16 (b) which plainly limits liability to directors, officers, and 10% stockholders, it is argued that we should expand 16 (b) to cover partnerships of which a director is a member in order to carry out the congressionally declared purpose \"of preventing the unfair use of information which may have been obtained by such beneficial owner, director, or officer by reason of his relationship to the issuer. . . .\" Failure to do so, it is argued, will leave a large and unintended loop-hole in the statute - one \"substantially eliminating the great Wall Street trading firms from the statute's operation.\" 286 F.2d, at 799. These firms it is claimed will be able to evade the Act and take advantage of the \"inside\" information available to their members as insiders of countless corporations merely by trading \"inside\" information among the various partners.\n\nThe argument of petitioner and the Commission seems to go so far as to suggest that 16 (b)'s forfeiture of profits should be extended to include all persons realizing \"short swing\" profits who either act on the basis of \"inside\" information or have the possibility of \"inside\" information. One may agree that petitioner and the Commission present persuasive policy arguments that the Act should be broadened in this way to prevent \"the unfair use of information\" more effectively than can be accomplished by leaving the Act so as to require forfeiture of profits only by those specifically designated by Congress to suffer those losses.\n11\n But this very broadening of the categories of persons on whom these liabilities are imposed by the \n\n[368 \nU.S. 403, 412]\n\u00a0\n language of 16 (b) was considered and rejected by Congress when it passed the Act. Drafts of provisions that eventually became 16 (b) not only would have made it unlawful for any director, officer or 10% stockholder to disclose any confidential information regarding registered securities, but also would have made all profits received by anyone, \"insider\" or not, \"to whom such unlawful disclosure\" had been made recoverable by the company.\n12\n\u00a0\n\nNot only did Congress refuse to give 16 (b) the content we are now urged to put into it by interpretation, but with knowledge that in 1952 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals refused, in the Rattner case, to apply 16 (b) to Lehman Brothers in circumstances substantially like \n\n[368 \nU.S. 403, 413]\n\u00a0\n those here, Congress has left the Act as it was.\n13\n And so far as the record shows this interpretation of 16 (b) was the view of the Commission until it intervened last year in this case. Indeed in the Rattner case the Court of Appeals relied in part on Commission Rule X-16A-3 (b) which required insider-partners to report only the amount of their own holdings and not the amount of holdings by the partnership. While the Commission has since changed this rule to require disclosure of partnership holdings too, its official release explaining the change stated that the new rule was \"not intended as a modification of the principles governing liability for short-swing transactions under Section 16 (b) as set forth in the case of Rattner v. Lehman . . . .\"\n14\n Congress can and might amend 16 (b) if the Commission would present to it the policy arguments it has presented to us, but we think that Congress is the proper agency to change an interpretation of the Act unbroken since its passage, if the change is to be made.\n\nSecond. The petitioner and the Commission contend that Thomas should be required individually to pay to Tide Water the entire $98,686.77 profit Lehman Brothers realized on the ground that under partnership law he is co-owner of the entire undivided amount and has therefore \"realized\" it all. \"[O]nly by holding the partner-director liable for the entire short-swing profits realized by his firm,\" it is urged, can \"an effective prophylactic to the stated statutory policy . . . be fully enforced.\" But \n\n[368 \nU.S. 403, 414]\n\u00a0\n liability under 16 (b) is to be determined neither by general partnership law nor by adding to the \"prophylactic\" effect Congress itself clearly prescribed in 16 (b). That section leaves no room for judicial doubt that a director is to pay to his company only \"any profit realized by him\" from short-swing transactions. (Emphasis added.) It would be nothing but a fiction to say that Thomas \"realized\" all the profits earned by the partnership of which he was a member. It was not error to refuse to hold Thomas liable for profits he did not make.\n\nThird. It is contended that both courts below erred in failing to allow interest on the recovery of Thomas' share of the partnership profits. Section 16 (b) says nothing about interest one way or the other. This Court has said in a kindred situation that \"interest is not recovered according to a rigid theory of compensation for money withheld, but is given in response to considerations of fairness. It is denied when its exaction would be inequitable.\" Board of Commissioners v. United States, \n308 \nU.S. 343, 352\n. Both courts below denied interest here and we cannot say that the denial was either so unfair or so inequitable as to require us to upset it.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE STEWART took no part in the disposition of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"For the purpose of preventing the unfair use of information which may have been obtained by such beneficial owner, director, or officer by reason of his relationship to the issuer, any profit realized by him from any purchase and sale, or any sale and purchase, of any equity security of such issuer (other than an exempted security) within any period of less than six months, unless such security was acquired in good faith in connection with a debt previously contracted, \n\n[368 \nU.S. 403, 405]\n\u00a0\n shall inure to and be recoverable by the issuer, irrespective of any intention on the part of such beneficial owner, director, or officer in entering into such transaction of holding the security purchased or of not repurchasing the security sold for a period exceeding six months. Suit to recover such profit may be instituted at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction by the issuer, or by the owner of any security of the issuer in the name and in behalf of the issuer if the issuer shall fail or refuse to bring such suit within sixty days after request or shall fail diligently to prosecute the same thereafter; but no such suit shall be brought more than two years after the date such profit was realized. This subsection shall not be construed to cover any transaction where such beneficial owner was not such both at the time of the purchase and sale, or the sale and purchase, of the security involved, or any transaction or transactions which the Commission by rules and regulations may exempt as not comprehended within the purpose of this subsection.\" 48 Stat. 896, 15 U.S.C. 78p (b).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] In 1956, after the purchase and sale in question, Lehman Brothers participated in the underwriting of some Tide Water bonds. Thomas handled this for Lehman and during the course of the matter discussed Tide Water affairs with the other members of Lehman.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] In compliance with 16 (a) and the rules and forms thereunder, see note 14, infra, Thomas filed with the SEC reports of the Lehman transactions in Tide Water stock and his disclaimer of those transactions.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] In both courts below defendants claimed that Lehman's profits should have been found to be much less than they were. Since the determination below has not been complained of here, it is not necessary to pass on those contentions.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] In the two courts below it was contended both that Thomas, because of his disclaimer of all participation in these partnership transactions, had realized no profits at all, and also that, even if he did realize some profits the amount was less than that found. See the opinion of Judge Swan dissenting in part below. 286 F.2d, at 793. We express no view on these questions since the Thomas judgment is not challenged here.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] See 16 (a), 48 Stat. 896, 15 U.S.C. 78p (a).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] 48 Stat. 883, 15 U.S.C. 78c (a) (9).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] 48 Stat. 883, 15 U.S.C. 78c (a) (7).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] The Commission's brief says: \"Therefore, when a member of a partnership holds a directorship with the knowledge and consent of his firm, it is entirely reasonable to consider the partnership as the `director' for the purposes of Section 16 (b).\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] An \"insider\" for purposes of 16 is an officer, director or 10% stockholder. See Cook and Feldman, Insider Trading Under the Securities Exchange Act, 66 Harv. L. Rev. 385, 399-404.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] Mosser v. Darrow, \n341 \nU.S. 267\n, and Lehman v. Civil Aeronautics Board, 93 U.S. App. D.C. 81, 209 F.2d 289, cited by the Commission as comparable situations throw little if any light on the issues in this case. Those cases involved different facts and different statutes, statutes which themselves have different language, purpose and history from the statute here.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] Thus, 15 (b) of both H. R. 7852, and S. 2693, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. provided:\n\n\"(b) It shall be unlawful for any director, officer, or owner of securities, owning as of record and\/or beneficially more than 5 per centum of any class of stock of any issuer, and security of which is registered on a national securities exchange . . . (3) To disclose, directly or indirectly, any confidential information regarding or affecting any such registered security not necessary or proper to be disclosed as a part of his corporate duties. Any profit made by any person, to whom such unlawful disclosure shall have been made, in respect of any transaction or transactions in such registered security within a period not exceeding six months after such disclosure shall inure to and be recoverable by the issuer unless such person shall have had no reasonable ground to believe that the disclosure was confidential or was made not in the performance of corporate duties. . . .\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n As to the meaning ascribed to this provision, see Hearings before the Committee on Banking and Currency on S. Res. No. 84, 72d Cong., 2d Sess., and S. Res. Nos. 56 and 97, 73d Cong., 1st and 2d Sess. 6555, 6558, 6560-6561; Hearings before Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce on H. R. 7852 and H. R. 8720, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. 135-137. These hearings seem to indicate that the provision was omitted from the final act because of anticipated problems of administration. See also Smolowe v. Delendo Corp., 136 F.2d 231, 236; Rattner v. Lehman, 193 F.2d 564.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] See Seventeenth Annual Report of the Securities and Exchange Commission, p. 62 (1952); Eighteenth Annual Report, p. 79 (1953). These reports were submitted to Congress.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] Securities and Exchange Commission Release No. 4754 (September 24, 1952). Rule X-16A-3 was again amended, effective March 9, 1961, to delete any requirements that a partner report the amount of the issuer's securities held by the partnership but the substance of the rule is still contained in the Commission's instructions to its Forms 3 and 4 which are used for making the reports required under 16 (a).\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE concurs, dissenting.\n\nWhat the Court does today is substantially to eliminate \"the great Wall Street trading firms\" from the operation of 16 (b), as Judge Clark stated in his dissent in the Court of Appeals. 286 F.2d 786, 799. This result follows because of the wide dispersion of partners of investment banking firms among our major corporations. Lehman Bros. has partners on 100 boards. Under today's \n\n[368 \nU.S. 403, 415]\n\u00a0\n ruling that firm can make a rich harvest on the \"inside information\" which 16 of the Act covers because each partner need account only for his distributive share of the firm's profits on \"inside information,\" the other partners keeping the balance. This is a mutilation of the Act.\n\nIf a partnership can be a \"director\" within the meaning of 16 (a), then \"any profit realized by him,\" as those words are used in 16 (b), includes all the profits, not merely a portion of them, which the partnership realized on the \"inside information.\" There is no basis in reason for saying a partnership cannot be a \"director\" for purposes of the Act. In Rattner v. Lehman, 193 F.2d 564, 567,\n1\n Judge Learned Hand said he was \"not prepared to say\" that a partnership could not be considered a \"director,\" adding \"for some purposes the common law does treat a firm as a jural person.\" In his view a partnership might be a \"director\" within the meaning of 16 if it \"deputed a partner\" to represent its interests. Yet formal designation is no more significant than informal approval. Everyone knows that the investment banking-corporation alliances are consciously constructed so as to increase the profits of the bankers. In partnership law a debate has long raged over whether a partnership is an \n\n[368 \nU.S. 403, 416]\n\u00a0\n entity or an aggregate. Pursuit of that will-o'-the-wisp is not profitable. For even New York with its aggregate theory recognizes that a partnership is or may be considered an entity for some purposes.\n2\n It is easier to make this partnership a \"director\" for purposes of 16 than to hold the opposite. Section 16 (a) speaks of every \"person\" who is a \"director.\" In 3 (a) (9) \"person\" is defined to include, inter alia, \"a partnership.\"\n3\n Thus, the purpose to subject a partnership to the provisions of 16 need not turn on a strained reading of that section.\n\nAt the root of the present problem are the scope and degree of liability arising out of fiduciary relations. In modern times that liability has been strictly construed. The New York Court of Appeals, speaking through Chief Judge Cardozo in Meinhard v. Salmon, 249 N. Y. 458, 164 N. E. 545, held a joint adventurer to a higher standard than we insist upon today:\n\n\"Many forms of conduct permissible in a workaday world for those acting at arm's length, are forbidden to those bound by fiduciary ties. A trustee \n\n[368 \nU.S. 403, 417]\n\u00a0\n is held to something stricter than the morals of the market place. Not honesty alone, but the punctilio of an honor the most sensitive, is then the standard of behavior. As to this there has developed a tradition that is unbending and inveterate. Uncompromising rigidity has been the attitude of courts of equity when petitioned to undermine the rule of undivided loyalty by the `disintegrating erosion' of particular exceptions (Wendt v. Fischer, 243 N. Y. 439, 444). Only thus has the level of conduct for fiduciaries been kept at a level higher than that trodden by the crowd. It will not consciously be lowered by any judgment of this court.\" 249 N. Y., at 464, 164 N. E., at 546.\n\n\n In Mosser v. Darrow, \n341 \nU.S. 267\n, we allowed a reorganization trustee to be surcharged $43,447.46 for profits made by his employees through trading in securities of subsidiaries of a bankrupt company. We made this ruling even though there was \"no hint or proof that he has been corrupt or that he has any interest, present or future, in the profits he has permitted these employees to make.\" Id., at 275. We said:\n\n \"These strict prohibitions would serve little purpose if the trustee were free to authorize others to do what he is forbidden. While there is no charge of it here, it is obvious that this would open up opportunities for devious dealings in the name of others that the trustee could not conduct in his own. The motives of man are too complex for equity to separate in the case of its trustees the motive of acquiring efficient help from motives of favoring help, for any reason at all or from anticipation of counterfavors later to come. We think that which the trustee had no right to do he had no right to authorize, and that \n\n[368 \nU.S. 403, 418]\n\u00a0\n the transactions were as forbidden for benefit of others as they would have been on behalf of the trustee himself.\n\n\n .   .  .  .   .\n\n\n \". . . equity has sought to limit difficult and delicate fact-finding tasks concerning its own trustee by precluding such transactions for the reason that their effect is often difficult to trace, and the prohibition is not merely against injuring the estate - it is against profiting out of the position of trust. That this has occurred, so far as the employees are concerned, is undenied.\" Id., at 271-273.\n\n\n It is said that the failure of Congress to take action to remedy the consequences of the Rattner case somehow or other shows a purpose on the part of Congress to infuse 16 with the meaning that Rattner gave it. We took that course in Toolson v. New York Yankees, \n346 \nU.S. 356\n, and adhered to a ruling the Court made in 1922 that baseball was not within the scope of the antitrust laws, because the business had been \"left for thirty years to develop, on the understanding that it was not subject to\" those laws. Id., p. 357. Even then we had qualms and two Justices dissented. For what we said in Girouard v. United States, \n328 \nU.S. 61, 69\n, represents our usual attitude: \"It is at best treacherous to find in congressional silence alone the adoption of a controlling rule of law.\"\n4\n\u00a0\n\n[368 \nU.S. 403, 419]\n\u00a0\n It is ironic to apply the Toolson principle here and thus sanction, as vested, a practice so notoriously unethical as profiting on inside information.\n\nWe forget much history when we give 16 a strict and narrow construction. Brandeis in Other People's Money spoke of the office of \"director\" as \"a happy hunting ground\" for investment bankers. He said that \"The goose that lays golden eggs has been considered a most valuable possession. But even more profitable is the privilege of taking the golden eggs laid by somebody else's goose. The investment bankers and their associates now enjoy that privilege.\" Id., at 12.\n\nThe hearings that led to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are replete with episodes showing how insiders exploited for their personal gain \"inside information\" which came to them as fiduciaries and was therefore an asset of the entire body of security holders. The Senate Report labeled those practices as \"predatory operations.\" S. Rep. No. 1455, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 68. It said:\n\n \"Among the most vicious practices unearthed at the hearings before the subcommittee was the flagrant betrayal of their fiduciary duties by directors and officers of corporations who used their positions of trust and the confidential information which came to them in such positions, to aid them in their market activities. Closely allied to this type of abuse was the unscrupulous employment of inside information by large stockholders who, while not \n\n[368 \nU.S. 403, 420]\n\u00a0\n directors and officers, exercised sufficient control over the destinies of their companies to enable them to acquire and profit by information not available to others.\" Id., at 55. See also S. Rep. No. 792, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 9.\n\n\n The theory embodied in 16 was the one Brandeis espoused. It was stated by Sam Rayburn as follows: \"Men charged with the administration of other people's money must not use inside information for their own advantage.\" H. R. Rep. No. 1383, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. 13.\n\nWhat we do today allows all but one partner to share in the feast which the one places on the partnership table. They in turn can offer feasts to him in the 99 other companies of which they are directors.\n5\n 14 Stan. L. Rev. 192, 198. This result is a dilution of the fiduciary principle that Congress wrote into 16 of the Act. It is, with all respect, a dilution that is possible only by a strained reading of the law. Until now, the courts have given this fiduciary principle a cordial reception. We should not leave to Congress the task of restoring the edifice that it erected and that we tear down. \n\n[368 \nU.S. 403, 421]\n\u00a0\n\n\n  APPENDIX TO OPINION OF    MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS.\n\n\n Lehman v. Civil Aeronautics Board, supra, 93 U.S. App.  D.C., at 85-87, 209 F.2d, at 292-294.\n\n\"Petitioner Lehman is a director of Pan American; petitioner Joseph A. Thomas is a director of National Airlines, Inc., and of American Export Lines, Inc.; petitioner Frederick L. Ehrman is a director of Continental Air Lines, Inc., and Mr. John D. Hertz is a director of Consolidated Vultee Aircraft Corporation. All the companies referred to are in the aeronautic field and so must have Board approval of the kind of interlocking relationships which are made unlawful unless approved. Messrs. Lehman, Thomas, Ehrman, Hertz, and others, are also members of Lehman Brothers, a partnership which, as previously pointed out, conducts an investment banking business.\n\n\n\"The Board held that an individual Lehman Brothers partner who is a director of a Section 409 (a) company is a representative of another partner who is a director of another such company. The relationships thus found to exist were disapproved as to those involving Pan American and National; Pan American and American Export Lines; Pan American and Consolidated Vultee; National and Pan American; National and Consolidated Vultee; and Continental Air Lines and Consolidated Vultee. . . .\n\n\n\"More precisely the Board concluded that a Lehman Brothers partner who is director of an air carrier has a representative `who represents such . . . director as . . . a director' in another Section 409 (a) company if another Lehman Brothers partner is a director of the latter, coupled with the circumstances that he seeks on behalf of Lehman Brothers the security underwriting and merger negotiation services used by the company of which he is director. The underwriting of security issues and the \n\n[368 \nU.S. 403, 422]\n\u00a0\n conduct of merger negotiations constitute a substantial part of the business of Lehman Brothers, who have been employed for these purposes not infrequently by Section 409 (a) companies. The partners feel free to solicit this business for their firm.\n\n\n\". . . But we must consider the facts of the case in the light of the purpose of Congress to keep the developing aviation industry free of unhealthy interlocking relationships, though this purpose must be carried out only as the statute provides. The relevant findings which point up the problem are not in dispute. The underwriting activities of Lehman Brothers is a substantial part of its business; substantial fees are also obtained by Lehman Brothers from merger negotiations. Profits from the fees are shared by the partners. Section 409 (a) companies, with Lehman Brothers partners as directors, need and use both types of services, and the partner directors seek such business for the partnership. In doing so they act as representatives of the partnership. It follows that they act as representatives of fellow partners, some of whom are directors of air carriers. Is this representation within the meaning of the statute? Does Mr. Thomas, to use his case as illustrative, who is a Lehman Brothers partner and also a director of National Airlines, represent, as director of National Airlines, Mr. Lehman, another Lehman Brothers partner and director of Pan American? We think that the affirmative answer of the Board should not be disturbed. For the situation comes to more than some community of interest and some sharing of common benefits as partners. The particular common interest and benefits are among directors of the regulated industry with respect to industry matters. The partnership link does not extend merely to a type of business remote from the aeronautical industry in which the partners are directors; it is with respect to business activities of air carriers and other aeronautical companies enumerated in \n\n[368 \nU.S. 403, 423]\n\u00a0\n Section 409 (a). In these activities there is not only literal representation by one partner of another in partnership business but the particular partnership business is as well the business of aeronautical enterprises of which the partners are directors. When Mr. Thomas, again to illustrate, as director of National seeks to guide that company's underwriting business to Lehman Brothers he acts in the interest of and for the benefit of Mr. Lehman who is not only his underwriting partner but is also a director of an air carrier, Pan American. Mr. Lehman the partner is the same Mr. Lehman the director. The Board is not required to separate him into two personalities, as it were, and to say that Mr. Thomas represents him as a partner but not as a director, if, as is the case here, the representation is in regard to the carrying on of the affairs of Section 409 (a) companies. The undoubted representation which grows out of the partnership we think follows into the directorships when the transactions engaged in are not only by the partners but concern companies regulated by the statute, of which the partners are directors. This is representation within not only the language but the meaning of the statute.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Rattner decision was rendered at a time when the Securities and Exchange Commission, pursuant to its regulatory power, provided a reporting requirement for 16 (a) which allowed a partner-director to disclose only that amount of the equity securities of the corporation in question held by his partnership and representing his proportionate interest in the partnership. Rule X-16A-3. After the Rattner decision that Rule was amended to read:\n\n\"A partner who is required under 240.16a-1 to report in respect of any equity security owned by the partnership shall include in his report the entire amount of such equity security owned by the partnership. He may, if he so elects, disclose the extent of his interest in the partnership and the partnership transactions.\" 17 CFR, 1961 Cum. Supp., 240.16a-3 (b).

This is not a situation where Congress has failed to act after having been requested to act or where the circumstances \n\n[368 \nU.S. 403, 419]\n\u00a0\n are such that Congress would ordinarily be expected to act.

UNITED STATES(1962)\nNo. 1191\nArgued: December 6, 1961Decided: June 25, 1962\n\n\n\n\n The Government brought suit to enjoin consummation of a merger of two corporations, on the ground that its effect might be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in the production, distribution and sale of shoes, in violation of 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended in 1950. The District Court found that the merger would increase concentration in the shoe industry, both in manufacturing and retailing, eliminate one of the corporations as a substantial competitor in the retail field, and establish a manufacturer-retailer relationship which would deprive all but the top firms in the industry of a fair opportunity to compete, and that, therefore, it probably would result in a further substantial lessening of competition and an increased tendency toward monopoly. It enjoined appellant from having or acquiring any further interest in the business, stock, or assets of the other corporation, required full divestiture by appellant of the other corporation's stock and assets, and ordered appellant to propose in the immediate future a plan for carrying into effect the Court's order of divestiture. Held: The judgment is affirmed. Pp. 296-346.\n\n 1. The District Court's judgment was a \"final\" judgment within the meaning of 2 of the Expediting Act, and this Court has jurisdiction of this direct appeal under that Act. Pp. 304-311.\n\n\n 2. The legislative history of the 1950 amendments to 7 of the Clayton Act indicates that Congress provided no definite quantitative or qualitative tests by which enforcement agencies were to gauge the effects of a given merger, but rather that Congress intended that a variety of economic and other factors be considered in determining whether the merger was consistent with maintaining competition in the industry in which the merging companies operated. Pp. 311-323.\n\n\n 3. The record supports the District Court's findings and its conclusion that the shoe industry is being subjected to a cumulative series of vertical mergers which, if left unchecked, may substantially lessen competition, within the meaning of 7, as amended. Pp. 323-334. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 295]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n  (a) The record in this case supports the District Court's finding that the relevant lines of commerce are men's, women's and children's shoes. Pp. 325-326.\n\n\n  (b) The District Court properly found that the predominantly medium-priced shoes which appellant manufactures do not occupy a product market different from the predominantly low-priced shoes which the other corporation sells. P. 326.\n\n\n  (c) In defining the product market, the District Court was not required to employ finer \"price\/quality\" or \"age\/sex\" distinctions than those recognized by its classifications of \"men's,\" \"women's\" and \"children's\" shoes. Pp. 326-328.\n\n\n  (d) Insofar as the vertical aspect of this merger is concerned, the relevant geographic market is the entire Nation, and the anticompetitive effects of the merger are to be measured within that range of distribution. P. 328.\n\n\n  (e) The trend toward vertical integration in the shoe industry, when combined with appellant's avowed policy of forcing its own shoes upon its retail subsidiaries, seems likely to foreclose competition from a substantial share of the market for men's, women's and children's shoes, without producing any countervailing competitive, economic or social advantages. Pp. 328-334.\n\n\n 4. The District Court was correct in concluding that this merger may tend to lessen competition substantially in the retail sale of men's, women's and children's shoes in the overwhelming majority of the cities and their environs in which both corporations sell through owned or controlled outlets. Pp. 334-346.\n\n\n  (a) The District Court correctly defined men's, women's and children's shoes as the relevant lines of commerce in which to analyze the horizontal aspects of the merger. P. 336.\n\n\n  (b) The District Court properly defined the relevant geographic markets in which to analyze the horizontal aspects of this merger as those cities with populations exceeding 10,000 and their environs in which both corporations retailed shoes through their own or controlled outlets. Pp. 336-339.\n\n\n  (c) The evidence is adequate to support the finding of the District Court that, as a result of the merger, competition in the retailing of men's, women's and children's shoes may be lessened substantially in those cities. Pp. 339-346.\n\n\n 179 F. Supp. 721, affirmed. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 296]\n\u00a0\n\n\nArthur H. Dean argued the cause for appellant. With him on the briefs were Robert H. McRoberts, Henry N. Ess III and Dennis C. Mahoney.\n\nSolicitor General Cox argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were Assistant Attorney General Loevinger, J. William Doolittle, Richard A. Solomon, Philip Marcus and James J. Coyle.\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nThis suit was initiated in November 1955 when the Government filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri alleging that a contemplated merger between the G. R. Kinney Company, Inc. (Kinney), and the Brown Shoe Company, Inc. (Brown), through an exchange of Kinney for Brown stock, would violate 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 18. The Act, as amended, provides in pertinent part:\n\n \"No corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital . . . of another corporation engaged also in commerce, where in any line of commerce in any section of the country, the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.\"\n\n\n The complaint sought injunctive relief under 15 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 25, to restrain consummation of the merger.\n\nA motion by the Government for a preliminary injunction pendente lite was denied, and the companies were permitted to merge provided, however, that their businesses be operated separately and that their assets be kept separately identifiable. The merger was then effected on May 1, 1956. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 297]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the District Court, the Government contended that the effect of the merger of Brown - the third largest seller of shoes by dollar volume in the United States, a leading manufacturer of men's, women's, and children's shoes, and a retailer with over 1,230 owned, operated or controlled retail outlets\n1\n - and Kinney - the eighth largest company, by dollar volume, among those primarily engaged in selling shoes, itself a large manufacturer of shoes, and a retailer with over 350 retail outlets - \"may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly\" by eliminating actual or potential competition in the production of shoes for the national wholesale shoe market and in the sale of shoes at retail in the Nation, by foreclosing competition from \"a market represented by Kinney's retail outlets whose annual sales exceed $42,000,000,\" and by enhancing Brown's competitive advantage over other producers, distributors and sellers of shoes. The Government argued that the \"line of commerce\" affected by this merger is \"footwear,\" or alternatively, that the \"line[s]\" are \"men's,\" \"women's,\" and \"children's\" shoes, separately considered, and that the \"section of the country,\" within which the anticompetitive effect of the merger is to be judged, is the Nation as a whole, or alternatively, each separate city or city and its \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 298]\n\u00a0\n immediate surrounding area in which the parties sell shoes at retail.\n\nIn the District Court, Brown contended that the merger would be shown not to endanger competition if the \"line[s] of commerce\" and the \"section[s] of the country\" were properly determined. Brown urged that not only were the age and sex of the intended customers to be considered in determining the relevant line of commerce, but that differences in grade of material, quality of workmanship, price, and customer use of shoes resulted in establishing different lines of commerce. While agreeing with the Government that, with regard to manufacturing, the relevant geographic market for assessing the effect of the merger upon competition is the country as a whole, Brown contended that with regard to retailing, the market must vary with economic reality from the central business district of a large city to a \"standard metropolitan area\"\n2\n for a smaller community. Brown further contended that, both at the manufacturing level and at the retail level, the shoe industry enjoyed healthy competition and that the vigor of this competition would not, in any event, be diminished by the proposed merger because Kinney manufactured less than 0.5% and retailed less than 2% of the Nation's shoes.\n\nThe District Court rejected the broadest contentions of both parties. The District Court found that \"there is one group of classifications which is understood and recognized \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 299]\n\u00a0\n by the entire industry and the public - the classification into `men's,' `women's' and `children's' shoes separately and independently.\" On the other hand, \"[t]o classify shoes as a whole could be unfair and unjust; to classify them further would be impractical, unwarranted and unrealistic.\"\n\nRealizing that \"the areas of effective competition for retailing purposes cannot be fixed with mathematical precision,\" the District Court found that \"when determined by economic reality, for retailing, a `section of the country' is a city of 10,000 or more population and its immediate and contiguous surrounding area, regardless of name designation, and in which a Kinney store and a Brown (operated, franchise, or plan)\n3\n store are located.\"\n\nThe District Court rejected the Government's contention that the combining of the manufacturing facilities of Brown and Kinney would substantially lessen competition in the production of men's, women's, or children's shoes for the national wholesale market. However, the District Court did find that the likely foreclosure of other manufacturers from the market represented by Kinney's retail outlets may substantially lessen competition in the manufacturers' distribution of \"men's,\" \"women's,\" and \"children's\" shoes, considered separately, throughout the Nation. The District Court also found that the merger may substantially lessen competition in retailing alone in \"men's,\" \"women's,\" and \"children's\" shoes, considered separately, in every city of 10,000 or more population and its immediate surrounding area in which both a Kinney and a Brown store are located.\n\nBrown's contentions here differ only slightly from those made before the District Court. In order fully to understand and appraise these assertions, it is necessary to set \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 300]\n\u00a0\n out in some detail the District Court's findings concerning the nature of the shoe industry and the place of Brown and Kinney within that industry.\n\n The Industry.\n\nThe District Court found that although domestic shoe production was scattered among a large number of manufacturers, a small number of large companies occupied a commanding position. Thus, while the 24 largest manufacturers produced about 35% of the Nation's shoes, the top 4 - International, Endicott-Johnson, Brown (including Kinney) and General Shoe - alone produced approximately 23% of the Nation's shoes or 65% of the production of the top 24.\n\nIn 1955, domestic production of nonrubber shoes was 509.2 million pairs, of which about 103.6 million pairs were men's shoes, about 271 million pairs were women's shoes, and about 134.6 million pairs were children's shoes.\n4\n The District Court found that men's, women's, and children's shoes are normally produced in separate factories.\n\nThe public buys these shoes through about 70,000 retail outlets, only 22,000 of which, however, derive 50% or more of their gross receipts from the sale of shoes and are classified as \"shoe stores\" by the Census Bureau.\n5\n These \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 301]\n\u00a0\n 22,000 shoe stores were found generally to sell (1) men's shoes only, (2) women's shoes only, (3) women's and children's shoes, or (4) men's, women's, and children's shoes.\n\nThe District Court found a \"definite trend\" among shoe manufacturers to acquire retail outlets. For example, International Shoe Company had no retail outlets in 1945, but by 1956 had acquired 130; General Shoe Company had only 80 retail outlets in 1945 but had 526 by 1956; Shoe Corporation of America, in the same period, increased its retail holdings from 301 to 842; Melville Shoe Company from 536 to 947; and Endicott-Johnson from 488 to 540. Brown, itself, with no retail outlets of its own prior to 1951, had acquired 845 such outlets by 1956. Moreover, between 1950 and 1956 nine independent shoe store chains, operating 1,114 retail shoe stores, were found to have become subsidiaries of these large firms and to have ceased their independent operations.\n\nAnd once the manufacturers acquired retail outlets, the District Court found there was a \"definite trend\" for the parent-manufacturers to supply an ever increasing percentage of the retail outlets' needs, thereby foreclosing other manufacturers from effectively competing for the retail accounts. Manufacturer-dominated stores were found to be \"drying up\" the available outlets for independent producers.\n\nAnother \"definite trend\" found to exist in the shoe industry was a decrease in the number of plants manufacturing shoes. And there appears to have been a concomitant decrease in the number of firms manufacturing shoes. In 1947, there were 1,077 independent manufacturers of shoes, but by 1954 their number had decreased about 10% to 970.\n6\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 302]\n\u00a0\n\n\n Brown Shoe.\n\nBrown Shoe was found not only to have been a participant, but also a moving factor, in these industry trends. Although Brown had experimented several times with operating its own retail outlets, by 1945 it had disposed of them all. However, in 1951, Brown again began to seek retail outlets by acquiring the Nation's largest operator of leased shoe departments, Wohl Shoe Company (Wohl), which operated 250 shoe departments in department stores throughout the United States. Between 1952 and 1955 Brown made a number of smaller acquisitions: Wetherby-Kayser Shoe Company (three retail stores), Barnes & Company (two stores), Reilly Shoe Company (two leased shoe departments), Richardson Shoe Store (one store), and Wohl Shoe Company of Dallas (not connected with Wohl) (leased shoe departments in Dallas). In 1954, Brown made another major acquisition: Regal Shoe Corporation which, at the time, operated one manufacturing plant producing men's shoes and 110 retail outlets.\n\nThe acquisition of these corporations was found to lead to increased sales by Brown to the acquired companies. Thus although prior to Brown's acquisition of Wohl in 1951, Wohl bought from Brown only 12.8% of its total purchases of shoes, it subsequently increased its purchases to 21.4% in 1952 and to 32.6% in 1955. Wetherby-Kayser's purchases from Brown increased from 10.4% before acquisition to over 50% after. Regal, which had previously sold no shoes to Wohl and shoes worth only $89,000 to Brown, in 1956 sold shoes worth $265,000 to Wohl and $744,000 to Brown.\n\nDuring the same period of time, Brown also acquired the stock or assets of seven companies engaged solely in shoe manufacturing. As a result, in 1955, Brown was the \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 303]\n\u00a0\n fourth largest shoe manufacturer in the country, producing about 25.6 million pairs of shoes or about 4% of the Nation's total footwear production.\n\n Kinney.\n\nKinney is principally engaged in operating the largest family-style shoe store chain in the United States. At the time of trial, Kinney was found to be operating over 400 such stores in more than 270 cities. These stores were found to make about 1.2% of all national retail shoe sales by dollar volume. Moreover, in 1955 the Kinney stores sold approximately 8 million pairs of nonrubber shoes or about 1.6% of the national pairage sales of such shoes. Of these sales, approximately 1.1 million pairs were of men's shoes or about 1% of the national pairage sales of men's shoes; approximately 4.2 million pairs were of women's shoes or about 1.5% of the national pairage sales of women's shoes; and approximately 2.7 million pairs were of children's shoes or about 2% of the national pairage sales of children's shoes.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nIn addition to this extensive retail activity, Kinney owned and operated four plants which manufactured men's, women's, and children's shoes and whose combined output was 0.5% of the national shoe production in 1955, making Kinney the twelfth largest shoe manufacturer in the United States.\n\nKinney stores were found to obtain about 20% of their shoes from Kinney's own manufacturing plants. At the time of the merger, Kinney bought no shoes from Brown; \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 304]\n\u00a0\n however, in line with Brown's conceded reasons\n8\n for acquiring Kinney, Brown had, by 1957, become the largest outside supplier of Kinney's shoes, supplying 7.9% of all Kinney's needs.\n\nIt is in this setting that the merger was considered and held to violate 7 of the Clayton Act. The District Court ordered Brown to divest itself completely of all stock, share capital, assets or other interests it held in Kinney, to operate Kinney to the greatest degree possible as an independent concern pending complete divestiture, to refrain thereafter from acquiring or having any interest in Kinney's business or assets, and to file with the court within 90 days a plan for carrying into effect the divestiture decreed. The District Court also stated it would retain jurisdiction over the cause to enable the parties to apply for such further relief as might be necessary to enforce and apply the judgment. Prior to its submission of a divestiture plan, Brown filed a notice of appeal in the District Court. It then filed a jurisdictional statement in this Court, seeking review of the judgment below as entered.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\n   JURISDICTION.\n\n\n Appellant's jurisdictional statement cites as the basis of our jurisdiction over this appeal 2 of the Expediting \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 305]\n\u00a0\n Act of February 11, 1903, 32 Stat. 823, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 29. In a civil antitrust action in which the United States is the complainant that Act provides for a direct appeal to this Court from \"the final judgment of the district court.\"\n9\n (Emphasis supplied.) The Government does not contest appellant's claim of jurisdiction; on the contrary, it moved to have the judgment below summarily affirmed, conceding our present jurisdiction to review the merits of that judgment. We deferred ruling on the Government's motion for summary affirmance and noted probable jurisdiction over the appeal. \n363 \nU.S. 825\n.\n10\n\u00a0\n\nIt was suggested from the bench during the oral argument that, since the judgment of the District Court does not include a specific plan for the dissolution of the Brown-Kinney merger, but reserves such a ruling pending the filing of suggested plans for implementing divestiture, the judgment below is not \"final\" as contemplated by the Expediting Act. In response to that suggestion, both parties have filed briefs contending that we do have jurisdiction to dispose of the case on the merits in its present posture. However, the mere consent of the parties to the Court's consideration and decision of the case cannot, by itself, confer jurisdiction on the Court. See American Fire & Casualty Co. v. Finn, \n341 \nU.S. 6, 17\n-18; People's Bank v. Calhoun, \n102 \nU.S. 256, 260\n-261; Capron v. Van Noorden, 2 Cranch 126, 127. Therefore, a review of the sources of the Court's jurisdiction is a threshold \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 306]\n\u00a0\n inquiry appropriate to the disposition of every case that comes before us. Revised Rules of the Supreme Court, 15 (1) (b), 23 (1) (b); Kesler v. Department of Public Safety, \n369 \nU.S. 153\n; Collins v. Miller, \n252 \nU.S. 364\n; United States v. More, 3 Cranch 159.\n\nThe requirement that a final judgment shall have been entered in a case by a lower court before a right of appeal attaches has an ancient history in federal practice, first appearing in the Judiciary Act of 1789.\n11\n With occasional modifications, the requirement has remained a cornerstone of the structure of appeals in the federal courts.\n12\n The Court has adopted essentially practical tests for identifying those judgments which are, and those which are not, to be considered \"final.\" See, e. g., Cobbledick v. United States, \n309 \nU.S. 323, 326\n; Market Street R. Co. v. Railroad Comm'n, \n324 \nU.S. 548, 552\n; Republic Natural Gas Co. v. Oklahoma, \n334 \nU.S. 62, 69\n; Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., \n337 \nU.S. 541, 546\n; DiBella v. United States, \n369 \nU.S. 121, 124\n, 129; cf. Federal Trade Comm'n v. Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator Co., \n344 \nU.S. 206, 212\n; United States v. Schaefer Brewing Co., \n356 \nU.S. 227, 232\n. A pragmatic approach to the question of finality has been considered essential to the achievement of the \"just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action\":\n13\n the touchstones of federal procedure.\n\nIn most cases in which the Expediting Act has been cited as the basis of this Court's jurisdiction, the issue of \"finality\" has not been raised or discussed by the parties or the Court. On but few occasions have particular \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 307]\n\u00a0\n orders in suits to which that Act is applicable been considered in the light of claims that they were insufficiently \"final\" so as to preclude appeal to this Court. Compare Schine Chain Theatres v. United States, \n329 \nU.S. 686\n, with Schine Chain Theatres v. United States, \n334 \nU.S. 110\n. The question has generally been passed over without comment in adjudications on the merits. While we are not bound by previous exercises of jurisdiction in cases in which our power to act was not questioned but was passed sub silentio, United States v. Tucker Truck Lines, \n344 \nU.S. 33, 38\n; United States ex rel. Arant v. Lane, \n245 \nU.S. 166, 170\n, neither should we disregard the implications of an exercise of judicial authority assumed to be proper for over 40 years.\n14\n Cf. Stainback v. Mo \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 308]\n\u00a0\n Hock Ke Lok Po, \n336 \nU.S. 368, 379\n-380; Radio Station WOW v. Johnson, \n326 \nU.S. 120, 125\n-126.\n\nWe think the decree of the District Court in this case had sufficient indicia of finality for us to hold that the judgment is properly appealable at this time. We note, first, that the District Court disposed of the entire complaint filed by the Government. Every prayer for relief was passed upon. Full divestiture by Brown of Kinney's stock and assets was expressly required. Appellant was permanently enjoined from acquiring or having any further interest in the business, stock or assets of the other defendant in the suit. The single provision of the judgment by which its finality may be questioned is the one requiring appellant to propose in the immediate future a plan for carrying into effect the court's order of divestiture. However, when we reach the merits of, and affirm, the judgment below, the sole remaining task for the District Court will be its acceptance of a plan for full divestiture, and the supervision of the plan so accepted. Further rulings of the District Court in administering its decree, facilitated by the fact that the defendants below have been required to maintain separate books pendente lite, are sufficiently independent of, and subordinate to, the issues presented by this appeal to make the case in its present posture a proper one for review now.\n15\n Appellant here does not attack the full divestiture ordered by the District Court as such; it is appellant's contention that \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 309]\n\u00a0\n under the facts of the case, as alleged and proved by the Government, no order of divestiture could have been proper. The propriety of divestiture was considered below and is disputed here on an \"all or nothing\" basis. It is ripe for review now, and will, thereafter, be foreclosed. Repetitive judicial consideration of the same question in a single suit will not occur here. Cf. Radio Station WOW v. Johnson, supra, at 127; Catlin v. United States, \n324 \nU.S. 229, 233\n-234; Cobbledick v. United States, supra, at 325, 330.\n\nA second consideration supporting our view is the character of the decree still to be entered in this suit. It will be an order of full divestiture. Such an order requires careful, and often extended, negotiation and formulation. This process does not take place in a vacuum, but, rather, in a changing market place, in which buyers and bankers must be found to accomplish the order of forced sale. The unsettling influence of uncertainty as to the affirmance of the initial, underlying decision compelling divestiture would only make still more difficult the task of assuring expeditious enforcement of the antitrust laws. The delay in withholding review of any of the issues in the case until the details of a divestiture had been approved by the District Court and reviewed here could well mean a change in market conditions sufficiently pronounced to render impractical or otherwise unenforceable the very plan of asset disposition for which the litigation was held. The public interest, as well as that of the parties, would lose by such procedure.\n\nLastly, holding the decree of the District Court in the instant case less than \"final\" and, thus, not appealable, would require a departure from a settled course of the Court's practice. It has consistently reviewed antitrust decrees contemplating either future divestiture or other comparable remedial action prior to the formulation and \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 310]\n\u00a0\n entry of the precise details of the relief ordered. No instance has been found in which the Court has reviewed a case following a divestiture decree such as the one we are asked to consider here, in which the party subject to that decree has later brought the case back to this Court with claims of error in the details of the divestiture finally approved.\n16\n And only two years ago, we were unanimous in accepting jurisdiction, and in affirming the judgment of a District Court similar to the one entered here, in the only case under amended 7 of the Clayton Act brought before us at a juncture comparable to the instant litigation. See Maryland & Virginia Milk Producers Assn. v. United States, \n362 \nU.S. 458, 472\n-473.\n17\n A fear of piecemeal appeals because of our adherence to existing procedure can find no support in history. Thus, the substantial body \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 311]\n\u00a0\n of precedent for accepting jurisdiction over this case in its present posture supports the practical considerations previously discussed. We believe a contrary result would be inconsistent with the very purposes for which the Expediting Act was passed and that gave it its name.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\n   LEGISLATIVE HISTORY.\n\n\n This case is one of the first to come before us in which the Government's complaint is based upon allegations that the appellant has violated 7 of the Clayton Act, as that section was amended in 1950.\n18\n The amendments adopted in 1950 culminated extensive efforts over a number of years, on the parts of both the Federal Trade Commission and some members of Congress, to secure revision of a section of the antitrust laws considered by many observers to be ineffective in its then existing form. Sixteen bills to amend 7 during the period 1943 to 1949 \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 312]\n\u00a0\n alone were introduced for consideration by the Congress, and full public hearings on proposed amendments were held in three separate sessions.\n19\n In the light of this extensive legislative attention to the measure, and the broad, general language finally selected by Congress for the expression of its will, we think it appropriate to review the history of the amended Act in determining whether the judgment of the court below was consistent with the intent of the legislature. See United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., \n353 \nU.S. 586, 591\n-592; Schwegmann Bros. v. Calvert Distillers Corp., \n341 \nU.S. 384, 390\n-395; Federal Trade Comm'n v. Morton Salt Co., \n334 \nU.S. 37, 43\n-46, 49; Corn Products Refining Co. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, \n324 \nU.S. 726, 734\n-737.\n\nAs enacted in 1914, 7 of the original Clayton Act prohibited the acquisition by one corporation of the stock of another corporation when such acquisition would result in a substantial lessening of competition between the acquiring and the acquired companies, or tend to \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 313]\n\u00a0\n create a monopoly in any line of commerce. The Act did not, by its explicit terms, or as construed by this Court, bar the acquisition by one corporation of the assets of another.\n20\n Nor did it appear to preclude the acquisition of stock in any corporation other than a direct competitor.\n21\n Although proponents of the 1950 amendments to the Act suggested that the terminology employed in these provisions was the result of accident or an unawareness that the acquisition of assets could be as inimical to competition as stock acquisition, a review of the legislative history of the original Clayton Act fails to support such views.\n22\n The possibility of asset acquisition was discussed,\n23\n but was not considered important \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 314]\n\u00a0\n to an Act then conceived to be directed primarily at the development of holding companies and at the secret acquisition of competitors through the purchase of all or parts of such competitors' stock.\n24\n\u00a0\n\nIt was, however, not long before the Federal Trade Commission recognized deficiencies in the Act as first enacted. Its Annual Reports frequently suggested amendments, principally along two lines: first, to \"plug the loophole\" exempting asset acquisitions from coverage under the Act, and second, to require companies proposing a merger to give the Commission prior notification of their plans.\n25\n The Final Report of the Temporary National Economic Committee also recommended changes focusing on these two proposals.\n26\n Hearings were held on some bills incorporating either or both of these changes but, prior to the amendments adopted in 1950, none reached the floor of Congress for plenary consideration. Although the bill that was eventually to become amended 7 was confined to embracing within the Act's terms the \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 315]\n\u00a0\n acquisition of assets as well as stock, in the course of the hearings conducted in both the Eightieth and Eighty-first Congresses, a more far-reaching examination of the purposes and provisions of 7 was undertaken. A review of the legislative history of these amendments provides no unmistakably clear indication of the precise standards the Congress wished the Federal Trade Commission and the courts to apply in judging the legality of particular mergers. However, sufficient expressions of a consistent point of view may be found in the hearings, committee reports of both the House and Senate and in floor debate to provide those charged with enforcing the Act with a usable frame of reference within which to evaluate any given merger.\n\nThe dominant theme pervading congressional consideration of the 1950 amendments was a fear of what was considered to be a rising tide of economic concentration in the American economy. Apprehension in this regard was bolstered by the publication in 1948 of the Federal Trade Commission's study on corporate mergers. Statistics from this and other current studies were cited as evidence of the danger to the American economy in unchecked corporate expansions through mergers.\n27\n Other considerations cited in support of the bill were the desirability \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 316]\n\u00a0\n of retaining \"local control\" over industry and the protection of small businesses.\n28\n Throughout the recorded discussion may be found examples of Congress' fear not only of accelerated concentration of economic power on economic grounds, but also of the threat to other values a trend toward concentration was thought to pose.\n\nWhat were some of the factors, relevant to a judgment as to the validity of a given merger, specifically discussed by Congress in redrafting 7?\n\nFirst, there is no doubt that Congress did wish to \"plug the loophole\" and to include within the coverage of the Act the acquisition of assets no less than the acquisition of stock.\n29\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 317]\n\u00a0\n\n\nSecond, by the deletion of the \"acquiring-acquired\" language in the original text,\n30\n it hoped to make plain that 7 applied not only to mergers between actual competitors, but also to vertical and conglomerate mergers whose effect may tend to lessen competition in any line of commerce in any section of the country.\n31\n\u00a0\n\nThird, it is apparent that a keystone in the erection of a barrier to what Congress saw was the rising tide of economic concentration, was its provision of authority for arresting mergers at a time when the trend to a lessening of competition in a line of commerce was still in its incipiency. Congress saw the process of concentration in American business as a dynamic force; it sought to assure the Federal Trade Commission and the courts the power \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 318]\n\u00a0\n to brake this force at its outset and before it gathered momentum.\n32\n\u00a0\n\nFourth, and closely related to the third, Congress rejected, as inappropriate to the problem it sought to remedy, the application to 7 cases of the standards for judging the legality of business combinations adopted by the courts in dealing with cases arising under the Sherman Act, and which may have been applied to some early cases arising under original 7.\n33\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 319]\n\u00a0\n\n\nFifth, at the same time that it sought to create an effective tool for preventing all mergers having demonstrable anticompetitive effects, Congress recognized the stimulation to competition that might flow from particular mergers. When concern as to the Act's breadth was expressed, supporters of the amendments indicated that it would not impede, for example, a merger between two small companies to enable the combination to compete more effectively with larger corporations dominating the relevant market, nor a merger between a corporation which is financially healthy and a failing one which no longer can be a vital competitive factor in the market.\n34\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 320]\n\u00a0\n The deletion of the word \"community\" in the original Act's description of the relevant geographic market is another illustration of Congress' desire to indicate that its concern was with the adverse effects of a given merger on competition only in an economically significant \"section\" of the country.\n35\n Taken as a whole, the legislative history illuminates congressional concern with the protection of competition, not competitors, and its desire to restrain mergers only to the extent that such combinations may tend to lessen competition.\n\nSixth, Congress neither adopted nor rejected specifically any particular tests for measuring the relevant markets, either as defined in terms of product or in terms of geographic locus of competition, within which the anti-competitive \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 321]\n\u00a0\n effects of a merger were to be judged. Nor did it adopt a definition of the word \"substantially,\" whether in quantitative terms of sales or assets or market shares or in designated qualitative terms, by which a merger's effects on competition were to be measured.\n36\n\u00a0\n\nSeventh, while providing no definite quantitative or qualitative tests by which enforcement agencies could gauge the effects of a given merger to determine whether it may \"substantially\" lessen competition or tend toward monopoly, Congress indicated plainly that a merger had to be functionally viewed, in the context of its particular \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 322]\n\u00a0\n industry.\n37\n That is, whether the consolidation was to take place in an industry that was fragmented rather than concentrated, that had seen a recent trend toward domination by a few leaders or had remained fairly consistent in its distribution of market shares among the participating companies, that had experienced easy access to markets by suppliers and easy access to suppliers by buyers or had witnessed foreclosure of business, that had witnessed the ready entry of new competition or the erection of barriers to prospective entrants, all were aspects, varying in importance with the merger under consideration, which would properly be taken into account.\n38\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 323]\n\u00a0\n\n\nEighth, Congress used the words \"may be substantially to lessen competition\" (emphasis supplied), to indicate that its concern was with probabilities, not certainties.\n39\n Statutes existed for dealing with clear-cut menaces to competition; no statute was sought for dealing with ephemeral possibilities. Mergers with a probable anticompetitive effect were to be proscribed by this Act.\n\nIt is against this background that we return to the case before us.\n\n\nIV.\n\n\n\n  THE VERTICAL ASPECTS OF THE MERGER.\n\n\n Economic arrangements between companies standing in a supplier-customer relationship are characterized as \"vertical.\" The primary vice of a vertical merger or other arrangement tying a customer to a supplier is that, \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 324]\n\u00a0\n by foreclosing the competitors of either party from a segment of the market otherwise open to them, the arrangement may act as a \"clog on competition,\" Standard Oil Co. of California v. United States, \n337 \nU.S. 293, 314\n, which \"deprive[s] . . . rivals of a fair opportunity to compete.\"\n40\n H. R. Rep. No. 1191, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 8. Every extended vertical arrangement by its very nature, for at least a time, denies to competitors of the supplier the opportunity to compete for part or all of the trade of the customer-party to the vertical arrangement. However, the Clayton Act does not render unlawful all such vertical arrangements, but forbids only those whose effect \"may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly\" \"in any line of commerce in any section of the country.\" Thus, as we have previously noted,\n\n \"[d]etermination of the relevant market is a necessary predicate to a finding of a violation of the Clayton Act because the threatened monopoly must be one which will substantially lessen competition `within the area of effective competition.' Substantiality can be determined only in terms of the market affected.\"\n41\n\u00a0\n\n\n The \"area of effective competition\" must be determined by reference to a product market (the \"line of commerce\") and a geographic market (the \"section of the country\"). \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 325]\n\u00a0\n\n\n The Product Market.\n\nThe outer boundaries of a product market are determined by the reasonable interchangeability of use or the cross-elasticity of demand between the product itself and substitutes for it.\n42\n However, within this broad market, well-defined submarkets may exist which, in themselves, constitute product markets for antitrust purposes. United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., \n353 \nU.S. 586, 593\n-595. The boundaries of such a submarket may be determined by examining such practical indicia as industry or public recognition of the submarket as a separate economic entity, the product's peculiar characteristics and uses, unique production facilities, distinct customers, distinct prices, sensitivity to price changes, and specialized vendors.\n43\n Because 7 of the Clayton Act prohibits any merger which may substantially lessen competition \"in any line of commerce\" (emphasis supplied), it is necessary to examine the effects of a merger in each such economically significant submarket to determine if there is a reasonable probability that the merger will substantially lessen competition. If such a probability is found to exist, the merger is proscribed.\n44\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 326]\n\u00a0\n\n\nApplying these considerations to the present case, we conclude that the record supports the District Court's finding that the relevant lines of commerce are men's, women's, and children's shoes. These product lines are recognized by the public; each line is manufactured in separate plants; each has characteristics peculiar to itself rendering it generally noncompetitive with the others; and each is, of course, directed toward a distinct class of customers.\n\nAppellant, however, contends that the District Court's definitions fail to recognize sufficiently \"price\/quality\" and \"age\/sex\" distinctions in shoes. Brown argues that the predominantly medium-priced shoes which it manufactures occupy a product market different from the predominantly low-priced shoes which Kinney sells. But agreement with that argument would be equivalent to holding that medium-priced shoes do not compete with low-priced shoes. We think the District Court properly found the facts to be otherwise. It would be unrealistic to accept Brown's contention that, for example, men's shoes selling below $8.99 are in a different product market from those selling above $9.00.\n\nThis is not to say, however, that \"price\/quality\" differences, where they exist, are unimportant in analyzing a merger; they may be of importance in determining the likely effect of a merger. But the boundaries of the relevant market must be drawn with sufficient breadth to include the competing products of each of the merging companies and to recognize competition where, in fact, competition exists. Thus we agree with the District Court that in this case a further division of product lines based on \"price\/quality\" differences would be \"unrealistic.\" \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 327]\n\u00a0\n\n\nBrown's contention that the District Court's product market definitions should have recognized further \"age\/sex\" distinctions raises a different problem. Brown's sharpest criticism is directed at the District Court's finding that children's shoes constituted a single line of commerce. Brown argues, for example, that \"a little boy does not wear a little girl's black patent leather pump\" and that \"[a] male baby cannot wear a growing boy's shoes.\" Thus Brown argues that \"infants' and babies'\" shoes, \"misses' and children's\" shoes and \"youths' and boys'\" shoes should each have been considered a separate line of commerce. Assuming, arguendo, that little boys' shoes, for example, do have sufficient peculiar characteristics to constitute one of the markets to be used in analyzing the effects of this merger, we do not think that in this case the District Court was required to employ finer \"age\/sex\" distinctions than those recognized by its classifications of \"men's,\" \"women's,\" and \"children's\" shoes. Further division does not aid us in analyzing the effects of this merger. Brown manufactures about the same percentage of the Nation's children's shoes (5.8%) as it does of the Nation's youths' and boys' shoes (6.5%), of the Nation's misses' and children's shoes (6.0%) and of the Nation's infants' and babies' shoes (4.9%). Similarly, Kinney sells about the same percentage of the Nation's children's shoes (2%) as it does of the Nation's youths' and boys' shoes (3.1%), of the Nation's misses' and children's shoes (1.9%), and of the Nation's infants' and babies' shoes (1.5%). Appellant can point to no advantage it would enjoy were finer divisions than those chosen by the District Court employed. Brown manufactures significant, comparable quantities of virtually every type of nonrubber men's, women's, and children's shoes, and Kinney sells such quantities of virtually every type of men's, women's, and children's shoes. Thus, whether considered separately or together, the picture of this \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 328]\n\u00a0\n merger is the same. We, therefore, agree with the District Court's conclusion that in the setting of this case to subdivide the shoe market further on the basis of \"age\/sex\" distinctions would be \"impractical\" and \"unwarranted.\"\n\n The Geographic Market.\n\nWe agree with the parties and the District Court that insofar as the vertical aspect of this merger is concerned, the relevant geographic market is the entire Nation. The relationships of product value, bulk, weight and consumer demand enable manufacturers to distribute their shoes on a nationwide basis, as Brown and Kinney, in fact, do. The anticompetitive effects of the merger are to be measured within this range of distribution.\n\n The Probable Effect of the Merger.\n\nOnce the area of effective competition affected by a vertical arrangement has been defined, an analysis must be made to determine if the effect of the arrangement \"may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly\" in this market.\n\nSince the diminution of the vigor of competition which may stem from a vertical arrangement results primarily from a foreclosure of a share of the market otherwise open to competitors, an important consideration in determining whether the effect of a vertical arrangement \"may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly\" is the size of the share of the market foreclosed. However, this factor will seldom be determinative. If the share of the market foreclosed is so large that it approaches monopoly proportions, the Clayton Act will, of course, have been violated; but the arrangement will also have run afoul of the Sherman Act.\n45\n And the legislative history of 7 indicates clearly that the \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 329]\n\u00a0\n tests for measuring the legality of any particular economic arrangement under the Clayton Act are to be less stringent than those used in applying the Sherman Act.\n46\n On the other hand, foreclosure of a de minimis share of the market will not tend \"substantially to lessen competition.\"\n\nBetween these extremes, in cases such as the one before us, in which the foreclosure is neither of monopoly nor de minimis proportions, the percentage of the market foreclosed by the vertical arrangement cannot itself be decisive. In such cases, it becomes necessary to undertake an examination of various economic and historical factors in order to determine whether the arrangement under review is of the type Congress sought to proscribe.\n47\n\u00a0\n\nA most important such factor to examine is the very nature and purpose of the arrangement.\n48\n Congress not only indicated that \"the tests of illegality [under 7] are intended to be similar to those which the courts have applied in interpreting the same language as used in other sections of the Clayton Act,\"\n49\n but also chose for 7 language virtually identical to that of 3 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 14, which had been interpreted by this Court to require an examination of the interdependence of the market share foreclosed by, and the economic purpose of, the vertical arrangement. Thus, for example, if a particular vertical arrangement, considered under 3, appears to be a limited term exclusive-dealing contract, \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 330]\n\u00a0\n the market foreclosure must generally be significantly greater than if the arrangement is a tying contract before the arrangement will be held to have violated the Act. Compare Tampa Electric Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., \n365 \nU.S. 320\n, and Standard Oil Co. of California v. United States, supra, with International Salt Co. v. United States, \n332 \nU.S. 392\n.\n50\n The reason for this is readily discernible. The usual tying contract forces the customer to take a product or brand he does not necessarily want in order to secure one which he does desire. Because such an arrangement is inherently anticompetitive, we have held that its use by an established company is likely \"substantially to lessen competition\" although only a relatively small amount of commerce is affected. International Salt Co. v. United States, supra. Thus, unless the tying device is employed by a small company in an attempt to break into a market, cf. Harley-Davidson Motor Co., 50 F. T. C. 1047, 1066, the use of a tying device can rarely\n51\n be harmonized with the strictures of the antitrust laws, which are intended primarily to preserve and stimulate competition. See Standard Oil Co. of California v. United States, supra, at 305-306. On the other hand, requirement contracts are frequently negotiated at the behest of the customer who has chosen the particular supplier and his product upon the basis of competitive merit. See, e. g., Tampa Electric Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., supra. Of course, the fact that requirement contracts are not inherently anticompetitive will not save a particular agreement if, in fact, it is likely \"substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.\" E. g., Standard Oil Co. of California v. United States, supra. Yet a requirement contract may escape censure if only a \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 331]\n\u00a0\n small share of the market is involved, if the purpose of the agreement is to insure to the customer a sufficient supply of a commodity vital to the customer's trade or to insure to the supplier a market for his output and if there is no trend toward concentration in the industry. Tampa Electric Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., supra. Similar considerations are pertinent to a judgment under 7 of the Act.\n\nThe importance which Congress attached to economic purpose is further demonstrated by the Senate and House Reports on H. R. 2734, which evince an intention to preserve the \"failing company\" doctrine of International Shoe Co. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, \n280 \nU.S. 291\n.\n52\n Similarly, Congress foresaw that the merger of two large companies or a large and a small company might violate the Clayton Act while the merger of two small companies might not, although the share of the market foreclosed be identical, if the purpose of the small companies is to enable them in combination to compete with larger corporations dominating the market.\n53\n\u00a0\n\nThe present merger involved neither small companies nor failing companies. In 1955, the date of this merger, Brown was the fourth largest manufacturer in the shoe industry with sales of approximately 25 million pairs of shoes and assets of over $72,000,000 while Kinney had sales of about 8 million pairs of shoes and assets of about $18,000,000. Not only was Brown one of the leading manufacturers of men's, women's, and children's shoes, but Kinney, with over 350 retail outlets, owned and operated the largest independent chain of family shoe stores in the Nation. Thus, in this industry, no merger between \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 332]\n\u00a0\n a manufacturer and an independent retailer could involve a larger potential market foreclosure. Moreover, it is apparent both from past behavior of Brown and from the testimony of Brown's President,\n54\n that Brown would use its ownership of Kinney to force Brown shoes into Kinney stores. Thus, in operation this vertical arrangement would be quite analogous to one involving a tying clause.\n55\n\u00a0\n\nAnother important factor to consider is the trend toward concentration in the industry.\n56\n It is true, of course, that the statute prohibits a given merger only if the effect of that merger may be substantially to lessen competition.\n57\n But the very wording of 7 requires a prognosis of the probable future effect of the merger.\n58\n\u00a0\n\nThe existence of a trend toward vertical integration, which the District Court found, is well substantiated by the record. Moreover, the court found a tendency of the acquiring manufacturers to become increasingly important sources of supply for their acquired outlets. The necessary corollary of these trends is the foreclosure of independent manufacturers from markets otherwise open to them. And because these trends are not the product of accident but are rather the result of deliberate policies of Brown and other leading shoe manufacturers, account must be taken of these facts in order to predict the probable \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 333]\n\u00a0\n future consequences of this merger. It is against this background of continuing concentration that the present merger must be viewed.\n\nBrown argues, however, that the shoe industry is at present composed of a large number of manufacturers and retailers, and that the industry is dynamically competitive. But remaining vigor cannot immunize a merger if the trend in that industry is toward oligopoly. See Pillsbury Mills, Inc., 50 F. T. C. 555, 573. It is the probable effect of the merger upon the future as well as the present which the Clayton Act commands the courts and the Commission to examine.\n59\n\u00a0\n\nMoreover, as we have remarked above, not only must we consider the probable effects of the merger upon the economics of the particular markets affected but also we must consider its probable effects upon the economic way of life sought to be preserved by Congress.\n60\n Congress was desirous of preventing the formation of further oligopolies with their attendant adverse effects upon local control of industry and upon small business. Where an industry was composed of numerous independent units, Congress appeared anxious to preserve this structure. The Senate Report, quoting with approval from the Federal Trade Commission's 1948 report on the merger movement, states explicitly that amended 7 is addressed, inter alia, to the following problem:\n\n  \"Under the Sherman Act, an acquisition is unlawful if it creates a monopoly or constitutes an attempt to monopolize. Imminent monopoly may appear when one large concern acquires another, but it is unlikely to be perceived in a small acquisition by a large enterprise. As a large concern grows through a series of such small acquisitions, its accretions of \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 334]\n\u00a0\n power are individually so minute as to make it difficult to use the Sherman Act test against them. . . .\n\n\n \"Where several large enterprises are extending their power by successive small acquisitions, the cumulative effect of their purchases may be to convert an industry from one of intense competition among many enterprises to one in which three or four large concerns produce the entire supply.\" S. Rep. No. 1775, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 5.\n61\n And see H. R. Rep. No. 1191, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 8.\n\n\n The District Court's findings, and the record facts, many of them set forth in Part I of this opinion, convince us that the shoe industry is being subjected to just such a cumulative series of vertical mergers which, if left unchecked, will be likely \"substantially to lessen competition.\"\n\nWe reach this conclusion because the trend toward vertical integration in the shoe industry, when combined with Brown's avowed policy of forcing its own shoes upon its retail subsidiaries, may foreclose competition from a substantial share of the markets for men's, women's, and children's shoes, without producing any countervailing competitive, economic, or social advantages.\n\n\nV.\n\n\n\n  THE HORIZONTAL ASPECTS OF THE MERGER.\n\n\n An economic arrangement between companies performing similar functions in the production or sale of comparable goods or services is characterized as \"horizontal.\" The effect on competition of such an arrangement depends, of course, upon its character and scope. Thus, its validity in the face of the antitrust laws will depend upon such factors as: the relative size and number of the \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 335]\n\u00a0\n parties to the arrangement; whether it allocates shares of the market among the parties; whether it fixes prices at which the parties will sell their product; or whether it absorbs or insulates competitors.\n62\n Where the arrangement effects a horizontal merger between companies occupying the same product and geographic market, whatever competition previously may have existed in that market between the parties to the merger is eliminated. Section 7 of the Clayton Act, prior to its amendment, focused upon this aspect of horizontal combinations by proscribing acquisitions which might result in a lessening of competition between the acquiring and the acquired companies.\n63\n The 1950 amendments made plain Congress' intent that the validity of such combinations was to be gauged on a broader scale: their effect on competition generally in an economically significant market.\n\nThus, again, the proper definition of the market is a \"necessary predicate\" to an examination of the competition that may be affected by the horizontal aspects of the merger. The acquisition of Kinney by Brown resulted in a horizontal combination at both the manufacturing and retailing levels of their businesses. Although the District Court found that the merger of Brown's and Kinney's manufacturing facilities was economically too insignificant to come within the prohibitions of the Clayton Act, the Government has not appealed from this portion of the lower court's decision. Therefore, we have no occasion to express our views with respect to that finding. On the other hand, appellant does contest the District Court's finding that the merger of the companies' retail outlets may tend substantially to lessen competition. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 336]\n\u00a0\n\n\n The Product Market.\n\nShoes are sold in the United States in retail shoe stores and in shoe departments of general stores. These outlets sell: (1) men's shoes, (2) women's shoes, (3) women's or children's shoes, or (4) men's, women's or children's shoes. Prior to the merger, both Brown and Kinney sold their shoes in competition with one another through the enumerated kinds of outlets characteristic of the industry.\n\nIn Part IV of this opinion we hold that the District Court correctly defined men's, women's, and children's shoes as the relevant lines of commerce in which to analyze the vertical aspects of the merger. For the reasons there stated we also hold that the same lines of commerce are appropriate for considering the horizontal aspects of the merger.\n\n The Geographic Market.\n\nThe criteria to be used in determining the appropriate geographic market are essentially similar to those used to determine the relevant product market. See S. Rep. No. 1775, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 5-6; United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., \n353 \nU.S. 586, 593\n. Moreover, just as a product submarket may have 7 significance as the proper \"line of commerce,\" so may a geographic submarket be considered the appropriate \"section of the country.\" Erie Sand & Gravel Co. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 291 F.2d 279, 283 (C. A. 3d Cir.); United States v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., 168 F. Supp. 576, 595-603 (D.C. S. D. N. Y.). Congress prescribed a pragmatic, factual approach to the definition of the relevant market and not a formal, legalistic one. The geographic market selected must, therefore, both \"correspond to the commercial realities\"\n64\n of the industry and be economically \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 337]\n\u00a0\n significant. Thus, although the geographic market in some instances may encompass the entire Nation, under other circumstances it may be as small as a single metropolitan area. United States v. Columbia Pictures Corp., 189 F. Supp. 153, 193-194 (D.C. S. D. N. Y.); United States v. Maryland & Virginia Milk Producers Assn., 167 F. Supp. 799 (D.C. D.C.), affirmed, \n362 \nU.S. 458\n. The fact that two merging firms have competed directly on the horizontal level in but a fraction of the geographic markets in which either has operated, does not, in itself, place their merger outside the scope of 7. That section speaks of \"any . . . section of the country,\" and if anticompetitive effects of a merger are probable in \"any\" significant market, the merger - at least to that extent - is proscribed.\n65\n\u00a0\n\nThe parties do not dispute the findings of the District Court that the Nation as a whole is the relevant geographic market for measuring the anticompetitive effects of the merger viewed vertically or of the horizontal merger of Brown's and Kinney's manufacturing facilities. As to the retail level, however, they disagree.\n\nThe District Court found that the effects of this aspect of the merger must be analyzed in every city with a population exceeding 10,000 and its immediate contiguous surrounding territory in which both Brown and Kinney sold shoes at retail through stores they either owned or controlled.\n66\n By this definition of the geographic market, \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 338]\n\u00a0\n less than one-half of all the cities in which either Brown or Kinney sold shoes through such outlets are represented. The appellant recognizes that if the District Court's characterization of the relevant market is proper, the number of markets in which both Brown and Kinney have outlets is sufficiently numerous so that the validity of the entire merger is properly judged by testing its effects in those markets. However, it is appellant's contention that the areas of effective competition in shoe retailing were improperly defined by the District Court. It claims that such areas should, in some cases, be defined so as to include only the central business districts of large cities, and in others, so as to encompass the \"standard metropolitan areas\" within which smaller communities are found. It argues that any test failing to distinguish between these competitive situations is improper.\n\nWe believe, however, that the record fully supports the District Court's findings that shoe stores in the outskirts of cities compete effectively with stores in central \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 339]\n\u00a0\n downtown areas, and that while there is undoubtedly some commercial intercourse between smaller communities within a single \"standard metropolitan area,\" the most intense and important competition in retail sales will be confined to stores within the particular communities in such an area and their immediate environs.\n67\n\u00a0\n\nWe therefore agree that the District Court properly defined the relevant geographic markets in which to analyze this merger as those cities with a population exceeding 10,000 and their environs in which both Brown and Kinney retailed shoes through their own outlets. Such markets are large enough to include the downtown shops and suburban shopping centers in areas contiguous to the city, which are the important competitive factors, and yet are small enough to exclude stores beyond the immediate environs of the city, which are of little competitive significance.\n\n The Probable Effect of the Merger.\n\nHaving delineated the product and geographic markets within which the effects of this merger are to be measured, we turn to an examination of the District Court's finding that as a result of the merger competition in the retailing of men's, women's and children's shoes may be lessened substantially in those cities in which both Brown and Kinney stores are located. We note, initially, that appellant challenges this finding on a number of grounds other than those discussed above and on grounds independent of the critical question of whether competition may, in fact, be lessened. Thus, Brown objects that the District Court did not examine the competitive picture in each line of commerce and each section of the country it had defined as appropriate. It says the Court erred in failing to enter findings with respect to each relevant city assessing \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 340]\n\u00a0\n the anticompetitive effect of the merger on the retail sale of, for example, men's shoes in Council Bluffs, men's shoes in Texas City, women's shoes in Texas City and children's shoes in St. Paul. Even assuming a representative sample could properly be used, Brown also objects that the District Court's detailed analysis of competition in shoe retailing was limited to a single city - St. Louis - a city in which Kinney did not operate. The appellant says this analysis could not be sufficiently representative to establish a standard image of the shoe trade which could be applied to each of the more than 100 cities in which Brown and Kinney sold shoes, particularly as some of those cities were much smaller than St. Louis, others were larger, some were in different climates and others were in areas having different median per capita incomes.\n\nHowever, we believe the record is adequate to support the findings of the District Court. While it is true that the court concentrated its attention on the structure of competition in the city in which it sat and as to which detailed evidence was most readily available, it also heard witnesses from no less than 40 other cities in which the parties to the merger operated. The court was careful to point out that it was on the basis of all the evidence that it reached its conclusions concerning the boundaries of the relevant markets and the merger's effects on competition within them. We recognize that variations of size, climate and wealth as enumerated by Brown exist in the relevant markets. However, we agree with the court below that the markets with respect to which evidence was received provide a fair sampling of all the areas in which the impact of this merger is to be measured. The appellant has not shown how the variables it has mentioned could affect the structure of competition within any particular market so as to require a change in the conclusions drawn by the District Court. Each competitor within a given market is equally affected by these factors, even though the city in which he does business \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 341]\n\u00a0\n may differ from St. Louis in size, climate or wealth. Thus, we believe the District Court properly reached its conclusions on the basis of the evidence available to it. There is no reason to protract already complex antitrust litigation by detailed analyses of peripheral economic facts, if the basic issues of the case may be determined through study of a fair sample.\n68\n\u00a0\n\nIn the case before us, not only was a fair sample used to demonstrate the soundness of the District Court's conclusions, but evidence of record fully substantiates those findings as to each relevant market. An analysis of undisputed statistics of sales of shoes in the cities in which both Brown and Kinney sell shoes at retail, separated into the appropriate lines of commerce, provides a persuasive factual foundation upon which the required prognosis of the merger's effects may be built. Although Brown objects to some details in the Government's computations used in drafting these exhibits, appellant cannot deny the correctness of the more general picture they reveal.\n69\n We have appended the exhibits to this opinion. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 342]\n\u00a0\n They show, for example, that during 1955 in 32 separate cities, ranging in size and location from Topeka, Kansas, to Batavia, New York, and Hobbs, New Mexico, the combined \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 343]\n\u00a0\n share of Brown and Kinney sales of women's shoes (by unit volume) exceeded 20%.\n70\n In 31 cities - some the same as those used in measuring the effect of the merger in the women's line - the combined share of children's shoes sales exceeded 20%; in 6 cities their share exceeded 40%. In Dodge City, Kansas, their combined share of the market for women's shoes was over 57%; their share of the children's shoe market in that city was 49%. In the 7 cities in which Brown's and Kinney's combined shares of the market for women's shoes were greatest (ranging from 33% to 57%) each of the parties alone, prior to the merger, had captured substantial portions of those markets (ranging from 13% to 34%); the merger intensified this existing concentration. In 118 separate cities the combined shares of the market of Brown and Kinney in the sale of one of the relevant lines of commerce exceeded 5%. In 47 cities, their share exceeded 5% in all three lines.\n\nThe market share which companies may control by merging is one of the most important factors to be considered when determining the probable effects of the combination on effective competition in the relevant market.\n71\n In an industry as fragmented as shoe retailing, the control of substantial shares of the trade in a city may have important effects on competition. If a merger achieving \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 344]\n\u00a0\n 5% control were now approved, we might be required to approve future merger efforts by Brown's competitors seeking similar market shares. The oligopoly Congress sought to avoid would then be furthered and it would be difficult to dissolve the combinations previously approved. Furthermore, in this fragmented industry, even if the combination controls but a small share of a particular market, the fact that this share is held by a large national chain can adversely affect competition. Testimony in the record from numerous independent retailers, based on their actual experience in the market, demonstrates that a strong, national chain of stores can insulate selected outlets from the vagaries of competition in particular locations and that the large chains can set and alter styles in footwear to an extent that renders the independents unable to maintain competitive inventories. A third significant aspect of this merger is that it creates a large national chain which is integrated with a manufacturing operation. The retail outlets of integrated companies, by eliminating wholesalers and by increasing the volume of purchases from the manufacturing division of the enterprise, can market their own brands at prices below those of competing independent retailers. Of course, some of the results of large integrated or chain operations are beneficial to consumers. Their expansion is not rendered unlawful by the mere fact that small independent stores may be adversely affected. It is competition, not competitors, which the Act protects. But we cannot fail to recognize Congress' desire to promote competition through the protection of viable, small, locally owned businesses. Congress appreciated that occasional higher costs and prices might result from the maintenance of fragmented industries and markets. It resolved these competing considerations in favor of decentralization. We must give effect to that decision.\n\nOther factors to be considered in evaluating the probable effects of a merger in the relevant market lend additional \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 345]\n\u00a0\n support to the District Court's conclusion that this merger may substantially lessen competition. One such factor is the history of tendency toward concentration in the industry.\n72\n As we have previously pointed out, the shoe industry has, in recent years, been a prime example of such a trend. Most combinations have been between manufacturers and retailers, as each of the larger producers has sought to capture an increasing number of assured outlets for its wares. Although these mergers have been primarily vertical in their aim and effect, to the extent that they have brought ever greater numbers of retail outlets within fewer and fewer hands, they have had an additional important impact on the horizontal plane. By the merger in this case, the largest single group of retail stores still independent of one of the large manufacturers was absorbed into an already substantial aggregation of more or less controlled retail outlets. As a result of this merger, Brown moved into second place nationally in terms of retail stores directly owned. Including the stores on its franchise plan, the merger placed under Brown's control almost 1,600 shoe outlets, or about 7.2% of the Nation's retail \"shoe stores\" as defined by the Census Bureau,\n73\n and 2.3% of the Nation's total retail \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 346]\n\u00a0\n shoe outlets.\n74\n We cannot avoid the mandate of Congress that tendencies toward concentration in industry are to be curbed in their incipiency, particularly when those tendencies are being accelerated through giant steps striding across a hundred cities at a time. In the light of the trends in this industry we agree with the Government and the court below that this is an appropriate place at which to call a halt.\n\nAt the same time appellant has presented no mitigating factors, such as the business failure or the inadequate resources of one of the parties that may have prevented it from maintaining its competitive position, nor a demonstrated need for combination to enable small companies to enter into a more meaningful competition with those dominating the relevant markets. On the basis of the record before us, we believe the Government sustained its burden of proof. We hold that the District Court was correct in concluding that this merger may tend to lessen competition substantially in the retail sale of men's, women's, and children's shoes in the overwhelming majority of those cities and their environs in which both Brown and Kinney sell through owned or controlled outlets.\n\nThe judgment is\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the decision of this case.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 347]\n\u00a0\n\n\n    APPENDIX A\n\n\n Sales of women's shoes by Brown and Kinney as a share of the total city  sales in selected areas (1955) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------        Brown Combined    Total sales  Kinney  owned or Brown-Kinney  Area   (pairs) Shoe Store  controlled  share      (%) outlets (%)\n*a\n       (%)\n*a\n ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dodge City, Kans _______ 31,400  23.3   34.4  57.7 Texas City, Tex ________ 32,300  27.8   20.7  48.5 Council Bluffs, Iowa ___ 68,200  27.3   15.4  42.7 Marshalltown, Iowa _____ 72,600  21.8   13.4  35.2 Uniontown, Pa __________  144,900  16.3   18.8  35.1 Ardmore, Okla __________ 62,600  14.4   20.3  34.7 Keokuk, Iowa ___________ 34,600  18.4   14.8  33.2 Ottumwa, Iowa __________ 67,200  28.2  4.3  32.5 Pine Bluff, Ark ________ 63,100  21.6  9.4  31.0 Lawton, Okla ___________ 95,200  20.2  9.8  30.0 Borger, Tex ____________ 50,100  15.5   13.8  29.3 Roswell, N.

See note 66, infra. In addition, Brown shoes were sold through numerous retailers operating entirely independently of Brown.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] \"The general concept adopted in defining a standard metropolitan area [is] that of an integrated economic area with a large volume of daily travel and communication between a central city of 50,000 inhabitants or more and the outlying parts of the area. . . . Each area (except in New England) consists of one or more entire counties. In New England, metropolitan areas have been defined on a town basis rather than a county basis.\" II U.S. Bureau of the Census, United States Census of Business: 1954, p. 3.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See note 1, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] U.S. Bureau of Census, Facts for Industry, Production, by Kind of Footwear: 1956 and 1955, Table 1, Production Series M31A-06, introduced as Defendant's Exhibit MM. The term \"nonrubber shoes\" includes leather shoes, sandals and play shoes, but excludes canvas-upper, rubber-soled shoes, athletic shoes and slippers. Ibid.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] These figures are based on the 1954 Census of Business. For that enumeration, the Census Bureau classification \"shoe stores\" included separately operated leased shoe departments of general stores, as distinguished from the shoe departments of general stores operated only as sections of the latter's general business. U.S. Bureau of Census, Retail Trade, Single Units and Multiunits, BC58-RS3, p. I. As described, infra, Brown operated numerous leased shoe departments in general stores which would be included in the Census Bureau's total of \"shoe stores.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1958 Census of Manufacturers, MC 58 (2)-31A-6. By 1958, the number of independent manufacturers had decreased by another 10% to 872. Ibid.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Kinney's pairage sales of men's, women's, and children's shoes were extracted from exhibits submitted to the Government in response to its interrogatories. See GX 6, R. 48-53. These statistics are virtually identical to those cited in appellant's brief, with but one exception. In its internal operations, appellant classifies certain shoes as \"growing girls'\" shoes while the cited figures follow the Census Bureau's treatment of such shoes as \"women's\" shoes.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] As stated in the testimony of Clark R. Gamble, President of Brown Shoe Company:\n\n\"It was our feeling, in addition to getting a distribution into the field of prices which we were not covering, it was also the feeling that as Kinney moved into the shopping centers in these free standing stores, they were going into a higher income neighborhood and they would probably find the necessity of up-grading and adding additional lines to their very successful operation that they had been doing and it would give us an opportunity we hoped to be able to sell them in that category. Besides that, it was a very successful operation and would give us a good diversified investment to stabilize our earnings.\" T. 1323.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Congress thus limited the right of review in such cases to an appeal from a decree which disposed of all matters, and it precluded the possibility of an appeal either to this Court or to a Court of Appeals from an interlocutory decree.

The Court has also approved the practice of District Courts of retaining jurisdiction in such cases for future modifications of their decrees, a practice which has also not been considered inconsistent with the finality of the original decrees. See Associated Press v. United States, \n326 \nU.S. 1, 22\n-23; Lorain Journal Co. v. United States, \n342 \nU.S. 143, 157\n. But cf. United States v. Schine Chain Theatres, 63 F.

The details of the divestiture which the District Court will approve cannot affect the outcome of the basic litigation in this case, as the details of an eminent domain settlement might moot the claims of the condemnee in that type of suit. See Republic Natural Gas Co. v. Oklahoma, \n334 \nU.S. 62\n; Grays Harbor Logging Co. v. Coats-Fordney Co., \n243 \nU.S. 251\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] The Court has, of course, occasionally reviewed varying facets of single antitrust cases on separate appeals. However, such cases are distinguishable from the situation at bar. Thus, one group includes cases in which the Government first sought appellate review from dismissals of its complaints, whereafter the Court considered the orders entered on remand. E. g., United States v. Terminal R. Assn. of St. Louis, \n224 \nU.S. 383\n; \n236 \nU.S. 194\n; United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., \n353 \nU.S. 586\n; \n366 \nU.S. 316\n. Another group includes cases in which the Government appealed from what it considered to be inadequate decrees, in which the Court later considered the further relief ordered on remand. E. g., United States v. Reading Co., \n253 \nU.S. 26\n, later considered sub nom. Continental Insurance Co. v. United States, \n259 \nU.S. 156\n; United States v. Paramount Pictures, \n334 \nU.S. 131\n, later considered sub nom. Loew's, Inc., v. United States, \n339 \nU.S. 974\n. And appeals in which the details of a divestiture were made a primary issue have followed the entry of such orders upon the filing of consent decrees, in which the underlying requirements of divestiture were never previously presented. E. g., Swift & Co. v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 311\n; United States v. Swift & Co., \n286 \nU.S. 106\n; Chrysler Corp. v. United States, \n316 \nU.S. 556\n; Ford Motor Co. v. United States, \n335 \nU.S. 303\n. Cf. International Harvester Co. v. United States, \n248 \nU.S. 587\n; \n274 \nU.S. 693\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] Cf. Jerrold Electronics Corp. v. United States, \n365 \nU.S. 567\n, affirming 187 F. Supp. 545, 563-567 (D.C. E. D. Pa.).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] Material in italics was added by the amendments; material in brackets was deleted. \"No corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital and no corporation subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission shall acquire the whole or any part of the assets of another corporation engaged also in commerce, where in any line of commerce in any section of the country, the effect of such acquisition may be [to] substantially to lessen competition [between the corporation whose stock is so acquired and the corporation making the acquisition, or to restrain such commerce in any section or community], or to tend to create a monopoly [of any line of commerce].\" Other paragraphs of 7 were also amended in details not relevant to this case. The only other cases to reach this Court, in which the Government's complaints were based, in part, on amended 7, were Maryland & Virginia Milk Producers Assn. v. United States, \n362 \nU.S. 458\n, and Jerrold Electronics Corp. v. United States, \n365 \nU.S. 567\n.

The House Report on the amendments summarized its view of the situation:\n\n\"That the current merger movement [during the years 1940-1947] has had a significant effect on the economy is clearly revealed by the fact that the asset value of the companies which have disappeared through mergers amounts to 5.2 billion dollars, or no less than 5.5 percent of the total assets of all manufacturing corporations - a significant segment of the economy to be swallowed up in such a short period of time.\" H.

The Senate Report on the measure finally adopted summarized the \"Purpose\" of the amendment with this single paragraph:\n\n\"The purpose of the proposed legislation is to prevent corporations from acquiring another corporation by means of the acquisition of its assets, whereunder [sic] the present law it is prohibited from acquiring the stock of said corporation. Since the acquisition of stock is significant chiefly because it is likely to result in control of the underlying assets, failure to prohibit direct purchase of the same assets has been inconsistent and paradoxical as to the over-all effect of existing law.\" S. Rep. No. 1775, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 2.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 30\n] The deletion of the \"acquiring-acquired\" test was the direct result of an amendment offered by the Federal Trade Commission. In presenting the proposed change, Commission Counsel Kelley made the following points: this Court's decisions had implied that the effect on competition between the parties to the merger was not the only test of the illegality of a stock merger; the Court had applied Sherman Act tests to Clayton Act cases and thus judged the effect of a merger on the industry as a whole; this incorporation of Sherman Act tests, with the accompanying \"rule of reason,\" was inadequate for reaching some mergers which the Commission felt were not in the public interest: and the new amendment proposed a middle ground between what appeared to be an overly restrictive test insofar as mergers between competitors were concerned, and what appeared to the Commission to be an overly lenient test insofar as all other mergers were concerned. Congressman Kefauver supported this amendment and the Commission's proposal was then incorporated into the bill which was eventually adopted by the Congress. See Hearings on H. R. 515, at 23, 117-119, 238-240, 259; Hearings before a Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee on H. R. 2734, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. (hereinafter cited as S. Hearings on H. R. 2734) 147.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 31\n] That 7 was intended to apply to all mergers - horizontal, vertical or conglomerate - was specifically reiterated by the House Report on the final bill. H. R. Rep. No. 1191, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 11. And see note 21, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 32\n] That 7 of the Clayton Act was intended to reach incipient monopolies and trade restraints outside the scope of the Sherman Act was explicitly stated in the Senate Report on the original Act. S. Rep. No. 698, 63d Cong., 2d Sess. 1. See United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., \n353 \nU.S. 586, 589\n. This theme was reiterated in congressional consideration of the amendments adopted in 1950, and found expression in the final House and Senate Reports on the measure. H. R. Rep. No. 1191, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 8 (\"Acquisitions of stock or assets have a cumulative effect, and control of the market . . . may be achieved not in a single acquisition but as the result of a series of acquisitions. The bill is intended to permit intervention in such a cumulative process when the effect of an acquisition may be a significant reduction in the vigor of competition.\"); S. Rep. No. 1775, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 4-5 (\"The intent here . . . is to cope with monopolistic tendencies in their incipiency and well before they have attained such effects as would justify a Sherman Act proceeding.\"). And see F. T. C., The Merger Movement: A Summary Report 6-7.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 33\n] The Report of the House Judiciary Committee on H. R. 515 recommended the adoption of tests more stringent than those in the Sherman Act. H. R. Rep. No. 596, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 7. A vigorous minority thought no new legislation was needed. Id., at 11-18. Between the issuance of this Report and the Committee's subsequent consideration of H. R. 2734, this Court had decided United States v. Columbia Steel Co., \n334 \nU.S. 495\n, which some understood to indicate that existing law might be inadequate to prevent mergers that had substantially lessened competition in a section of the country, but which, nevertheless, had not risen to the level of those restraints of trade or monopoly prohibited by the Sherman Act. See 96 Cong. Rec. 16502 (remarks of Senator Kefauver); \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 319]\n\u00a0\n H. R. Rep. No. 1191, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 10-11. Numerous other statements by Congressmen and Senators and by representatives of the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice and the President's Council of Economic Advisors were made to the Congress suggesting that a standard of illegality stricter than that imposed by the Sherman Act was needed. See, e. g., H. R. Hearings on H. R. 2734, at 13, 29, 41, 117; S. Hearings on H. R. 2734, at 22, 23, 47, 66, 319. The House Judiciary Committee's 1949 Report supported this concept unanimously although five of the nine members who had dissented two years earlier in H. R. Rep. No. 596 were still serving on the Committee. H. R. Rep. No. 1191, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 7-8. The Senate Report was explicit: \"The committee wish to make it clear that the bill is not intended to revert to the Sherman Act test. The intent here . . . is to cope with monopolistic tendencies in their incipiency and well before they have attained such effects as would justify a Sherman Act proceeding. . . . [The] various additions and deletions - some strengthening and others weakening the bill - are not conflicting in purpose and effect. They merely are different steps toward the same objective, namely, that of framing a bill which, though dropping portions of the so-called Clayton Act test that have no economic significance [the reference would appear to be primarily to the \"acquiring-acquired\" standard of the original Act], reaches far beyond the Sherman Act.\" S. Rep. No. 1775, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 4-5.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 34\n] As to small company mergers, see H. R. Hearings on H. R. 2734, at 41, 117; S. Hearings on H. R. 2734, at 6, 51; 95 Cong. Rec. 11486, 11488, 11506; 96 Cong. Rec. 16436; H. R. Rep. No. 1191, 81st Cong., \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 320]\n\u00a0\n 1st Sess. 6-8; S. Rep. No. 1775, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 4. As to mergers with failing companies, see S. Hearings on H. R. 2734, at 115, 134-135, 198; 96 Cong. Rec. 16435, 16444; H. R. Rep. No. 1191, supra, at 6; S. Rep. No. 1775, supra, at 7.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 35\n] The Federal Trade Commission's amendment, see note 30, supra, included the phrase \"where . . . in any section, community, or trade area, there is reasonable probability that the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition.\" Congressman Kefauver urged deletion of the word \"community\" on the ground that it might suggest, for example, that a merger between two small filling stations in a section of a city was proscribed. Hearings on H. R. 515, at 260. And see also 96 Cong. Rec. 16453. The fear of literal prohibition of all but de minimis mergers through the use of the word \"community\" was also cited by the Senate Report as the basis for its retention solely of the word \"section.\" S. Rep. No. 1775, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 4. The reference to \"trade area\" was deleted as redundant, when it became clear that the \"section\" of the country to which the Act was to apply, referred not to a definite geographic area of the country, but rather the geographic area of effective competition in the relevant line of commerce. See S. Hearings on H. R. 2734, at 38-52, 66-84, 101-102, 132, 133, 144, 145; H. R. Rep. No. 1191, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 8; S. Rep. No. 1775, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 4, 5-6. The Senate Report cited with approval the definition of the market employed by the Court in Standard Oil Co. of California v. United States, \n337 \nU.S. 293, 299\n n. 5.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 36\n] The House Report on H. R. 2734 stated that two tests of illegality were included in the proposed Act: whether the merger substantially lessened competition or tended to create a monopoly. It stated that such effects could be perceived through findings, for example, that a whole or material part of the competitive activity of an enterprise, which had been a substantial factor in competition, had been eliminated; that the relative size of the acquiring corporation had increased to such a point that its advantage over competitors threatened to be \"decisive\"; that an \"undue\" number of competing enterprises had been eliminated; or that buyers and sellers in the relevant market had established relationships depriving their rivals of a fair opportunity to compete. H. R. Rep. No. 1191, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 8. Each of these standards, couched in general language, reflects a conscious avoidance of exclusively mathematical tests even though the case of Standard Oil Co. of California v. United States, \n337 \nU.S. 293\n, said to have created a \"quantitative substantiality\" test for suits arising under 3 of the Clayton Act, was decided while Congress was considering H. R. 2734. Some discussion of the applicability of this test to 7 cases ensued, see, e. g., S. Hearings on H. R. 2734, at 31-32, 169-172; S. Rep. No. 1775, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 21: 96 Cong. Rec. 16443, but this aspect of the Standard Oil decision was neither specifically endorsed nor impugned by the bill's supporters. However, the House Judiciary Committee's Report, issued two months after Standard Oil had been decided, remarked that the tests of illegality under the new Act were intended to be \"similar to those which the courts have applied in interpreting the same language as used in other sections of the Clayton Act.\" H. R. Rep. No. 1191, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 8.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 37\n] A number of the supporters of the amendments voiced their concern that passage of the bill would amount to locking the barn door after most of the horses had been stolen, but urged approval of the measure to prevent the theft of those still in the barn. Which was to say that, if particular industries had not yet been subject to the congressionally perceived trend toward concentration, adoption of the amendments was urged as a way of preventing the trend from reaching those industries as yet unaffected. See, e. g., 95 Cong. Rec. 11489, 11494, 11498 (remarks of Representatives Keating, Yates, Patman); 96 Cong. Rec. 16444 (remarks of Senators O'Mahoney, Murray).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 38\n] Subsequent to the adoption of the 1950 amendments, both the Federal Trade Commission and the courts have, in the light of Congress' expressed intent, recognized the relevance and importance of economic data that places any given merger under consideration within an industry framework almost inevitably unique in every case. Statistics reflecting the shares of the market controlled by the industry leaders and the parties to the merger are, of course, the primary index of market power; but only a further examination of the particular market - its structure, history and probable future - can provide the appropriate setting for judging the probable anticompetitive effect of the merger. See, e. g., Pillsbury Mills, Inc., 50 F. T. C. 555: United States v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., 168 F. Supp. 576 (D.C. S. D. N. Y.); United States v. Jerrold Electronics Corp., 187 F. Supp. 545 (D.C. E. D. Pa.), aff'd, \n365 \nU.S. 567\n. And see U.S. Atty. Gen. Nat. Comm. to Study the Antitrust Laws, Report 126 (1955).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 39\n] In the course of both the Committee hearings and floor debate, attention was occasionally focused on the issue of whether \"possible,\" \"probable\" or \"certain\" anticompetitive effects of a proposed merger would have to be proven to establish a violation of the Act. Language was quoted from prior decisions of the Court in antitrust cases in which each of these interpretations of the word \"may\" was suggested as appropriate. H. R. Hearings on H. R. 2734, at 74; S. Hearings on H. R. 2734, at 32, 33, 160-168; 96 Cong. Rec. 16453, 16502. The final Senate Report on the question was explicit on the point:\n\n\"The use of these words [\"may be\"] means that the bill, if enacted, would not apply to the mere possibility but only to the reasonable probability of the prescribed [sic] effect . . . . The words `may be' have been in section 7 of the Clayton Act since 1914. The concept of reasonable probability conveyed by these words is a necessary element in any statute which seeks to arrest restraints of trade in their incipiency and before they develop into full-fledged restraints violative of the Sherman Act. A requirement of certainty and actuality of injury to competition is incompatible with any effort to supplement the Sherman Act by reaching incipient restraints.\" S. Rep. No. 1775, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 6. See also 51 Cong. Rec. 14464 (remarks of Senator Reed).\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 40\n] In addition, a vertical merger may disrupt and injure competition when those independent customers of the supplier who are in competition with the merging customer, are forced either to stop handling the supplier's lines, thereby jeopardizing the goodwill they have developed, or to retain the supplier's lines, thereby forcing them into competition with their own supplier. See United States v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., 168 F. Supp. 576, 613 (D.C. S. D. N. Y.). See also GX 13, R. 215, a letter from Sam Sullivan, an independent shoe retailer, to Clark Gamble, President of Brown Shoe Co.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 41\n] United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., \n353 \nU.S. 586, 593\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 42\n] The cross-elasticity of production facilities may also be an important factor in defining a product market within which a vertical merger is to be viewed. Cf. United States v. Columbia Steel Co., \n334 \nU.S. 495, 510\n-511; United States v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., 168 F. Supp. 576, 592 (D.C. S. D. N. Y.). However, the District Court made but limited findings concerning the feasibility of interchanging equipment in the manufacture of nonrubber footwear. At the same time, the record supports the court's conclusion that individual plants generally produced shoes in only one of the product lines the court found relevant.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 43\n] See generally Bock, Mergers and Markets, An Economic Analysis of Case Law 25-35 (1960).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 44\n] United States v.

No. 1775, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 5-6.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 65\n] To illustrate: If two retailers, one operating primarily in the eastern half of the Nation, and the other operating largely in the West, competed in but two mid-Western cities, the fact that the latter outlets represented but a small share of each company's business would not immunize the merger in those markets in which competition might be adversely affected. On the other hand, that fact would, of course, be properly considered in determining the equitable relief to be decreed. Cf. United States v. Jerrold Electronics Corp., 187 F. Supp. 545 (D.C. E. D. Pa.), aff'd, \n365 \nU.S. 567\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 66\n] In describing the geographic market in which Brown and Kinney competed, the District Court included cities in which Brown \"Franchise \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 338]\n\u00a0\n Plan\" and \"Wohl Plan\" stores were located. Although such stores were not owned or directly controlled by Brown, did not sell Brown products exclusively and did not finance inventory through Brown, we believe there was adequate evidence before the District Court to support its finding that such stores were \"Brown stores.\" To such stores Brown provided substantial assistance in the form of merchandising and advertising aids, reports on market and management research, loans, group life and fire insurance and centralized purchase of rubber footwear from manufacturers on Brown's credit. For these services, Brown required the retailer to deal almost exclusively in Brown's products in the price scale at which Brown shoes sold. Further, Brown reserved the power to terminate such franchise agreements on 30 days' notice. Since the retailer was required, under this plan, to invest his own resources and develop his good will to a substantial extent in the sale of Brown products, the flow of which Brown could readily terminate, Brown was able to exercise sufficient control over these stores and departments to warrant their characterization as \"Brown\" outlets for the purpose of measuring the share and effect of Brown's competition at the retail level. Cf. Standard Oil Co. of California v. United States, \n337 \nU.S. 293\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 67\n] The District Court limited its findings to cities having a population of at least 10,000 persons, since Kinney operated only in such areas.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 68\n] See Standard Oil Co. of California v. United States, \n337 \nU.S. 293, 313\n; U.S. Atty. Gen. Nat. Comm. to Study the Antitrust Laws, Report 126 (1955): \"While sufficient data to support a conclusion is required, sufficient data to give the enforcement agencies, the courts and business certainty as to competitive consequences would nullify the words `Where the effect may be' in the Clayton Act and convert them into `Where the effect is.'\" And the Committee of the Judicial Conference of the United States on Procedure in Antitrust and Other Protracted Cases has also emphasized the need for limiting the mass of possibly relevant evidence in cases of this type in order to avoid confusion and its concomitant increased possibility of error. 13 F. R. D. 62, 64.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 69\n] Brown objects, for example, to the fact that these exhibits are drafted on the basis of the cities concerning which census information was available, rather than on the basis of the cities and their environs - as the relevant markets were defined by the District Court. However, the record shows that the statistics of shoe sales in cities by and large conform to statistics of shoe sales in counties in which those cities are the principal metropolitan area. See Appendix D, \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 342]\n\u00a0\n infra. Thus, we find no error in a conclusion drawn as to a slightly larger market from the available record of sales in cities alone. Brown also objects to the use of pairage sales, rather than dollar volume, as the basis for defining the size, and measuring Brown's shares, of the market. However, since Brown and Kinney sold shoes primarily in the low and medium price ranges, and in the light of the conceded spread in shoe prices, we agree that sales measured by pairage provide a more accurate picture of the Brown-Kinney shares of the market than do sales measured in dollars. Detailed statistics of shoe sales were available only in terms of dollar volume, however, and Brown objects to the method by which the Government has converted those figures into those reflecting sales in terms of pairage. The Government's conversion was, with some exceptions, based on national median income and national averages of shoe prices and the ratio of men, women and children in the population. The District Court accepted expert testimony offered by the Government to the effect that shoe price and population age, sex and income variations in the relevant cities produced, at most, a 6% error in the converted statistics, and that this error was as likely to favor Brown (by increasing the universe of sales against which Brown's shares were to be measured) as it was to disfavor it. We find no error in the District Court's acceptance of the Government's evidence as to the propriety of the accounting methods its experts employed. Lastly, Brown objects that the statistics concerning its own pairage sales were improperly derived since they included sales by its wholesale distributors to the retail outlets on its franchise plans in the same category as sales to ultimate consumers by its owned retail stores. Again, while recognizing a possible margin of error in statistics combining sales at two levels of distribution, we believe they provide an adequate basis upon which to gauge Brown sales through outlets it controlled. Particularly as the franchise stores were required to finance their own inventory, does it seem reasonable to conclude that most of their purchases from Brown's distributors were eventually resold. In summary, although appellant may point to technical flaws in the compilation of these statistics, we recognize that in cases of this type precision in detail is less important than the accuracy of the broad picture presented. We believe the picture as presented by the Government in this case is adequate for making the determination required by 7: whether this merger may tend to lessen competition substantially in the relevant markets.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 70\n] Although the sum of the parties' pre-existing shares of the market will normally equal their combined share of the immediate post-merger market, we recognize that this share need not remain stable in the future. Nevertheless, such statistics provide a graphic picture of the immediate impact of a merger, and, as such, also provide a meaningful base upon which to build conclusions of the probable future effects of the merger.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 71\n] See United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., \n353 \nU.S. 586, 595\n-596; A. G. Spaulding & Bros. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 301 F.2d 585, 612-615 (C. A. 3d Cir.); United States v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., 168 F. Supp. 576, 603-611 (D.C. S. D. N. Y.). Cf. Bok, Section 7 of the Clayton Act and the Merging of Law and Economics, 74 Harv. L. Rev. 226, 279, 308-311 (1960).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 72\n] See note 38, supra. A company's history of expansion through mergers presents a different economic picture than a history of expansion through unilateral growth. Internal expansion is more likely to be the result of increased demand for the company's products and is more likely to provide increased investment in plants, more jobs and greater output. Conversely, expansion through merger is more likely to reduce available consumer choice while providing no increase in industry capacity, jobs or output. It was for these reasons, among others, Congress expressed its disapproval of successive acquisitions. Section 7 was enacted to prevent even small mergers that added to concentration in an industry. See S. Rep. No. 1775, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 5. Cf. United States v. Jerrold Electronics Corp., 187 F. Supp. 545, 566 (D.C. E. D. Pa.) aff'd, \n365 \nU.S. 567\n; United States v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., 168 F. Supp. 576, 606 (D.C. S. D. N. Y.).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 73\n] See note 5, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 74\n] Although statistics concerning the degree of concentration and the rank of Brown-Kinney in terms of controlled retail stores in each of the relevant product and geographic markets would have been more helpful in analyzing the results of this merger, neither side has presented such statistics. The figures in the record, based on national rank, are, nevertheless, useful in depicting the trends in the industry. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 355]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK, concurring.\n\nI agree that so long as the Expediting Act, 15 U.S.C. 29, is on the books we have no alternative but to accept jurisdiction in this case. The Act declares that appeals in civil antitrust cases in which the United States is complainant lie only to this Court. It thus deprives the parties of an intermediate appeal and this Court of the benefit of consideration by a Court of Appeals. Under our system a party should be entitled to at least one appellate review, and since the sole opportunity in cases under the Expediting Act is in this Court we usually note jurisdiction. A fair consideration of the issues requires us to carry out the function of a Court of Appeals by examining the whole record and resolving all questions, whether or not they are substantial. This is a great burden on the Court and seldom results in much expedition, as in this case where 2 1\/2 years have passed since the District Court's decision.\n\nOn the merits the case presents the question of whether, under 7 of the Clayton Act, the acquisition by Brown of the Kinney retail stores may substantially lessen competition in shoes on a national basis or in any section of the country.\n*\n To me 7 is definite and clear. It prohibits acquisitions, either of stock or assets, where competition in any line of commerce in any section of the country may be substantially lessened. The test as stated in the Senate Report on the bill is whether there is \"a reasonable probability\" that competition may be lessened.\n\nAn analysis of the record indicates (1) that Brown, which makes all types of shoes, is the fourth largest manufacturer in the country; (2) that Kinney likewise manufactures some shoes but deals primarily in retailing, having almost 400 stores that handle a substantial volume \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 356]\n\u00a0\n of sales; (3) that its acquisition would give Brown a total of some 1,600 retail outlets, making it the second largest retailer in the Nation; (4) that Kinney's stores are on both a national and local basis strategically placed from a retail market standpoint in suburban areas or towns of over 10,000 population; (5) that Kinney's suppliers are small shoe manufacturers; (6) that Brown's earlier acquisitions, seven in number in five years, indicate a pattern to increase the sale of Brown shoes through the acquisition of independent outlets, resulting in the loss of sales by small competing manufacturers; (7) that statistics on these outlets indicate that Brown, after acquisition, has materially increased its shipments of Brown shoes to them, some as much as 50%; and (8) that the acquisition would have a direct effect on the small manufacturers who previously enjoyed the Kinney requirements market.\n\nIt would appear that the relevant line of commerce would be shoes of all types. This is emphasized by the nature of Brown's manufacturing activity and its plan to integrate the Kinney stores into its operations. The competition affected thereby would be in the line handled by these stores which is the full line of shoes manufactured by Brown. This conclusion is more in keeping with the record as I read it and at the same time avoids the charge of splintering the product line. Likewise, the location of the Kinney stores points more to a national market in shoes than a number of regional markets staked by artificial municipal boundaries. Brown's business is on a national scale and its policy of integration of manufacturing and retailing is on that basis. I would conclude, therefore, that it would be more reasonable to define the line of commerce as shoes - those sold in the ordinary retail store - and the market as the entire country. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 357]\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn this record but one conclusion can follow, i. e., that the acquisition by Brown of the 400 Kinney stores for the purposes of integrating their operation into its manufacturing activity created a \"reasonable probability\" that competition in the manufacture and sale of shoes on a national basis might be substantially lessened. I would therefore affirm.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Since the judgment below can be supported on this theory, there is no need to inquire into any tendency to create a monopoly.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, dissenting in part and concurring in part.\n\nI would dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction, believing that the case in its present posture is prematurely here because the judgment sought to be reviewed is not yet final. Since the Court, however, holds that the case is properly before us, I consider it appropriate, after noting my dissent to this holding, to express my views on the merits because the issues are of great importance. On that aspect, I concur in the judgment of the Court but do not join its opinion, which I consider to go far beyond what is necessary to decide the case.\n\n   JURISDICTION.\n\n\n The Court's authority to entertain this appeal depends on 2 of the Expediting Act of 1903. That statute, in its present form, provides (15 U.S.C. 29):\n\n \"In every civil action brought in any district court of the United States under any of said [antitrust] Acts, wherein the United States is complainant, an appeal from the final judgment of the district court will lie only to the Supreme Court.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n The Act was passed by a Congress which thereby \"sought . . . to ensure speedy disposition of suits in equity brought by the United States under the Anti-Trust \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 358]\n\u00a0\n Act.\" United States v. California Cooperative Canneries, \n279 \nU.S. 553, 558\n. This major policy consideration emerges clearly from the otherwise meager legislative history of the Act. See H. R. Rep. No. 3020, 57th Cong., 2d Sess. (1903); 36 Cong. Rec. 1679, 1744, 1747. It was in keeping with this purpose that \"Congress limited the right of review to an appeal from the decree which disposed of all matters . . . and . . . precluded the possibility of an appeal to either [the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals] . . . from an interlocutory decree.\" United States v. California Cooperative Canneries, supra. For it was entirely consistent with its desire to expedite these cases for Congress to have eliminated the time-consuming delays occasioned by interlocutory appeals either to intermediate courts or to this Court.\n\nBy taking jurisdiction over this appeal at the present time, despite the fact that, even if affirmed, this case would doubtless reappear on the Court's docket if the terms of the District Court's divestiture decree are unsatisfactory to the appellant or to the Government, the Court is paving the way for dual appeals in all government antitrust cases where intricate divestiture judgments are involved. Whether or not such a procedure is advisable from the standpoint of judicial administration or practical business considerations - and I think such questions by no means free from doubt - I believe that it is contrary to the provisions and purposes of the Expediting Act, and that the construction now given the Act does violence to the accepted meaning of \"final judgment\" in the federal judicial system.\n\nThe judgment from which this appeal is taken directs the appellant to \"relinquish and dispose of the stock, share capital and assets\" of the G. R. Kinney Company and enjoins further interlocking interests between the two corporations. It does not specify how the divestiture is to be carried out, but directs appellant to file \"a proposed \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 359]\n\u00a0\n plan to carry into effect the divestiture order\" and grants the Government 30 days following such filing in which to submit \"opposition or suggestions thereto.\" When considered in light of the District Court's opinion, this reservation emerges as much more than a mere retention of jurisdiction for the purpose of ministerially executing a definite and precise final judgment. See e. g., Ray v. Law, 3 Cranch 179; French v. Shoemaker, 12 Wall. 86, 98. In light of this Court's remarks in United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., \n353 \nU.S. 586, 607\n-608, the District Court concluded that the particular form which the divestiture order was to take was a matter which \"could have far-reaching effects and consequences,\" 179 F. Supp., at 741, and that it would be appropriate for the court to conduct hearings on the manner in which the Kinney stock ought to be disposed of by the appellant. Hence it is not farfetched to assume that particular terms of the remedy ordered by the District Court will be contested, and that this Court may well be asked to examine the details relating to the anticipated divestiture. E. g., United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., \n366 \nU.S. 316\n.\n\nThe exacting obligation with respect to the terms of antitrust decrees cast upon this Court by the Expediting Act was commented upon only last Term. In United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., \n366 \nU.S. 316\n, it was noted that it was the Court's practice, \"particularly in cases of a direct appeal from the decree of a single judge, . . . to examine the District Court's action closely to satisfy ourselves that the relief is effective to redress the antitrust violation proved.\" \n366 \nU.S., at 323\n; see International Boxing Club, Inc., v. United States, \n358 \nU.S. 242, 253\n. In the present case the Court and the parties know nothing more of \"this most significant phase of the case,\" United States v. United States Gypsum Co., \n340 \nU.S. 76, 89\n, than that Brown will generally be \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 360]\n\u00a0\n required to divest itself of any interest in Kinney. Exactly how this separation is to be accomplished has not yet been determined, and there is no way of knowing now whether both parties to the suit will find the decree satisfactory or whether one or both will seek further review in this Court.\n\nDespite the opportunity thus created for separate reviews of these kinds of cases at their \"merits\" and \"relief\" stages, the Court holds that the judgment now in effect has \"sufficient indicia of finality\" (ante, p. 308) to render it appealable now, notwithstanding that the terms of the ordered divestiture have not yet been fixed. This conclusion is based upon three discrete considerations, none of which, in my opinion, serves to overcome the \"final judgment\" requirement of the Expediting Act, as that term has hitherto been understood in federal law.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nFirst. The Court suggests that any further proceedings to be conducted in the District Court are \"sufficiently independent of, and subordinate to, the issues presented by this appeal\" to permit them to be considered and reviewed separately. But this judicially created exception to the embracing principle of finality has never heretofore been utilized by this Court to permit separate review of a District Court's decision on the underlying merits of a claim when the details of the relief that is to be awarded are yet uncertain. The present case does not present the possibility, as did Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., \n337 \nU.S. 541\n, and Forgay v. Conrad, 6 How. 201, that a delay in appellate review would result in irreparable \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 361]\n\u00a0\n harm, equivalent in effect to a denial of any review on the point at issue. See \n337 \nU.S., at 546\n; 6 How., at 204. Nor is this a case in which the complaint's prayers for relief are so diversified that the resolution of one branch of the case \"is independent of, and unaffected by, another litigation with which it happens to be entangled.\" Radio Station WOW, Inc., v. Johnson, \n326 \nU.S. 120, 126\n; see Carondelet Canal Co. v. Louisiana, \n233 \nU.S. 362, 372\n-373; Forgay v. Conrad, supra.\n\nIf the appellant were compelled to await the entry of a particularized divestiture order before being granted appellate review, it would suffer no irremediable loss; indeed, in this case the merger was allowed to proceed pendente lite, so any delay, to the extent that it could affect the parties, would benefit the appellant. Nor can it well be suggested that the particular conditions under which the divestiture is to be executed are matters that are only fortuitously \"entangled\" with the merits of the complaint. Despite the seemingly mandatory tone of the \"divestiture\" judgment now before us, the plain fact remains that it is by its own terms inoperative to a substantial extent until further proceedings are held in the District Court. Unlike the cases relied upon by the Court, therefore, this case comes up on appeal before the appellant knows exactly what it has been ordered to do or not to do. This is surely not the type of judgment \"which ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.\" Catlin v. United States, \n324 \nU.S. 229, 233\n; see Covington v. Covington First National Bank, \n185 \nU.S. 270, 277\n.\n\nSecond. The Court finds significant the \"character of the decree still to be entered in this suit.\" Ante, p. 309. Since the order of full divestiture requires \"careful, and often extended, negotiation and formulation,\" ante, p. 309, it is suggested that a delay in carrying out its terms might render them impractical or unenforceable. Apart \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 362]\n\u00a0\n from the fact that this policy consideration is more appropriately addressed to the Congress than to this Court, it appears to me to call for a result directly contrary to that reached by the Court. For if the terms of the divestiture are indeed so difficult to formulate and so interrelated with market conditions, it is most unlikely that the decree to be issued by the District Court will turn out to be satisfactory to both parties. Consequently, on the Court's own reasoning, a second appearance of this case on our docket is not an imaginative possibility but a reasonable likelihood. In stating that the divestiture portion of this judgment \"is disputed here on an `all or nothing' basis,\" and that \"it is ripe for review now, and will, thereafter, be foreclosed,\" ante, p. 309, the Court can hardly mean that either the appellant or the Government will be precluded from seeking review of the divestiture terms if it deems them unsatisfactory. Indeed, neither side on this appeal has addressed itself to the propriety of the divestiture remedy, as such, that is independently of the question whether the merger itself runs afoul of the Clayton Act.\n\nMoreover, if it is delay between formulation of the decree and its execution that is thought to be damaging, what reason is there to believe that this delay or its hazards will be any greater if the entire case is brought up here once than if review is separately sought from the divestiture decree once its terms have been settled? Nor can it be maintained that if the merits are now affirmed then an appeal on the question of relief is improbable. For insofar as complex \"negotiation and formulation\" is a factor, the probability of an appeal is equally likely in either instance.\n\nThird. The Court's final reason for holding this judgment appealable is that similar judgments have often been reviewed here in the past with no issue ever having been raised regarding jurisdiction. But the cases are \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 363]\n\u00a0\n legion which have echoed the answer given by Chief Justice Marshall to a contention that the Court was bound on a jurisdictional point by its consideration on the merits of a case in which the jurisdictional question had gone unnoticed: \"No question was made, in that case, as to the jurisdiction. It passed sub silentio, and the court does not consider itself as bound by that case.\" United States v. More, 3 Cranch 159, 172; see Snow v. United States, \n118 \nU.S. 346, 354\n; Cross v. Burke, \n146 \nU.S. 82, 87\n; Louisville Trust Co. v. Knott, \n191 \nU.S. 225, 236\n; New v. Oklahoma, \n195 \nU.S. 252, 256\n; United States ex rel. Arant v. Lane, \n245 \nU.S. 166, 170\n; Stainback v. Mo Hock Ke Lok Po, \n336 \nU.S. 368, 379\n; United States v. L. A. Tucker Truck Lines, \n344 \nU.S. 33, 38\n. The fact that the Court may, in the past, have overlooked the lack of finality in some of the judgments that came here for review in similar posture to this one does not now free it from the requirements of the Expediting Act. Nor does the fact that none of the cases reviewed in what now appears to have been an interlocutory stage was ever appealed again justify disregard of the statute. This history might point to the desirability of an amendment to the Expediting Act, but it does not make into a \"final judgment\" a decree which reserves for future determination the terms of the precise relief to be afforded.\n\nThe Court suggests that a \"pragmatic approach\" to finality is called for in light of the policies of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which direct the \"just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action.\" Ante, p. 306. But this misconceives the nature of the issue that is presented. Whether this judgment is final and appealable is not a question turning on the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or on any balance of policies by this Court. Congress has seen fit to make this Court, for reasons which are less than obvious, the sole appellate tribunal for civil antitrust suits instituted by the United \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 364]\n\u00a0\n States. In so doing, it has chosen to limit this Court's reviewing power to \"final judgments.\" Whether the first of these legislative determinations, made in 1903, when appeal as of right to this Court was the rule rather than the exception, should survive the expansion in the Court's docket and the development, pursuant to the Judiciary Act of 1925, of this Court's discretionary certiorari jurisdiction, may never have been given adequate consideration by the Congress.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nAt this period of mounting dockets there is certainly much to be said in favor of relieving this Court of the often arduous task of searching through voluminous trial testimony and exhibits to determine whether a single district judge's findings of fact are supportable. The legal issues in most civil antitrust cases are no longer so novel or unsettled as to make them especially appropriate for initial appellate consideration by this Court, as compared with those in a variety of other areas of federal law. And under modern conditions it may well be doubted whether direct review of such cases by this Court truly serves the purpose of expedition which underlay the original passage of the Expediting Act. I venture to predict that a critical reappraisal of the problem would lead to the conclusion that \"expedition\" and also, over-all, more satisfactory appellate review would be achieved in \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 365]\n\u00a0\n these cases were primary appellate jurisdiction returned to the Court of Appeals, leaving this Court free to exercise its certiorari power with respect to particular cases deemed deserving of further review. As things now stand this Court must deal with all government civil antitrust cases, often either at the unnecessary expenditure of its own time or at the risk of inadequate appellate review if a summary disposition of the appeal is made. Further, such a jurisdictional change would bid fair to satisfy the very \"policy\" arguments suggested by the Court in this case. For the Courts of Appeals, whose dockets are generally less crowded than those of this Court, would then be authorized to hear appeals from orders such as the one here in question. Since this order grants an injunction against interlocking interests between Brown and Kinney, it would come within 28 U.S.C. 1292 (a) (1) were this not a case \"where a direct review may be had in the Supreme Court.\"\n\nSo long, however, as the present Expediting Act continues to commend itself to Congress this Court is bound by its limitations, and since for the reasons already given the decree appealed cannot, in my opinion, be properly considered a \"final judgment,\" I think the appeal, at this juncture, should have been dismissed.\n\n    THE MERITS.\n\n\n Since the Court nonetheless holds that the judgment is appealable in its present form, and since the underlying questions are far-reaching, I consider it a duty to express my view on the merits. On this aspect of the case I join the disposition which affirms the judgment of the District Court, though I am not prepared to subscribe to all that is said or implied in the opinion of this Court.\n\nThe question presented by this case can be stated in narrow and concise terms: Are the District Court's conclusions that the effect of the Brown-Kinney merger may \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 366]\n\u00a0\n be, in the language of 7 of the Clayton Act, \"substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly\" in \"any line of commerce in any section of the country\" sustainable? In other words, does the indefinite and general language in 7 manifest a congressional purpose to proscribe a combination of this sort? Brown contends that in finding the merger illegal the District Court lumped together what are in fact discrete \"lines of commerce,\" that it failed to define an appropriate \"section of the country,\" and that when the case is properly viewed any lessening of competition that may be caused by the merger is not \"substantial.\" For reasons stated below, I think that each of these contentions is untenable.\n\nThe dispositive considerations are, I think, found in the \"vertical\" effects of the merger, that is, the effects reasonably to be foreseen from combining Brown's manufacturing facilities with Kinney's retail outlets. In my opinion the District Court's conclusions as to such effects are supported by the record, and suffice to condemn the merger under 7, without regard to what might be deemed to be the \"horizontal\" effects of the transaction.\n\n1. \"Line of Commerce.\" - In considering both the horizontal and vertical aspects of this merger, the District Court analyzed the probable impact on competition in terms of three relevant \"lines of commerce\" - men's shoes, women's shoes, and children's shoes. It rejected Brown's claim that shoes of different construction or of different price range constituted distinct lines of commerce. Whatever merit there might be to Brown's contention that the product market should be more narrowly defined when it is viewed from the vantage point of the ultimate consumer (whose pocketbook, for example, may limit his purchase to a definite price range), the same is surely not true of the shoe manufacturer. Although the record contains evidence tending to prove that a shoe manufacturing \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 367]\n\u00a0\n plant may be managed more economically if its production is limited to only one type and grade of shoe, the history of Brown's own factories reveals that a single plant may be used in successive years, or even at the same time, for the manufacture of varying grades of shoes and may, without undue difficulty, be shifted from the production of children's shoes to men's or women's shoes, or vice versa.\n\nBecause of this flexibility of manufacture, the product market with respect to the merger between Brown's manufacturing facilities and Kinney's retail outlets might more accurately be defined as the complete wearing-apparel shoe market, combining in one the three components which the District Court treated as separate lines of commerce. Such an analysis, taking into account the interchangeability of production, would seem a more realistic gauge of the possible anticompetitive effects in the shoe manufacturing industry of a merger between a shoe manufacturer and a retailer than the District Court's compartmentalization in terms of the buying public. For if a manufacturer of women's shoes is able, albeit at some expense, to convert his plant to the production of men's shoes, the possibility of such a shift should be considered in deciding whether the market for either men's shoes or women's shoes can be monopolized or whether a particular merger substantially lessens competition among manufacturers of either product. See Adelman, Economic Aspects of the Bethlehem Opinion, 45 Va. L. Rev. 684, 689-691; cf. United States v. Columbia Steel Co., \n334 \nU.S. 495, 510\n-511; but see United States v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., 168 F. Supp. 576, 592.\n\nThe fact that 7 speaks of the lessening of competition \"in any line of commerce\" (emphasis added) does not, of course, mean that the product market on which the effect of the merger is considered may be defined as narrowly \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 368]\n\u00a0\n or as broadly as the Government chooses to define it.\n3\n The duty rests with the District Court, and ultimately with this Court, to determine what is the appropriate market on an appraisal of the relevant economic considerations. Discovering the product market is \"a necessary predicate to a finding of a violation of the Clayton Act,\" United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., \n353 \nU.S. 586, 593\n, and the breadth of the statutory language provides no license for an abdication of this necessary function. In light of the production flexibility demonstrated by the undisputed facts in this case, I think the line of commerce by which the vertical aspects of the Brown-Kinney merger should be judged is the wearing-apparel shoe industry generally.\n\n2. \"Section of the Country.\" - This merger involves nationwide concerns which sell and purchase shoes in various localities throughout the country, so that it appears that the most suitable geographical market for appraising the alleged anticompetitive effects of the vertical combination is the Nation as a whole. This finding of the District Court (limited to the vertical aspect of the merger) is not contested by Brown and is properly accepted here. One caveat is in order, however. In judging the anticompetitive effect of the merger on the national market, it must be recognized that any decline in competition that might result need not have a uniform effect throughout the entire country. It is sufficient if \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 369]\n\u00a0\n the record proves that as a result of the merger competition will generally be lessened, though its most serious impact may be felt in certain localities.\n\n3. \"Substantially to Lessen Competition.\" - The remaining question is whether the merger of Brown's manufacturing facilities with Kinney's retail outlets \"may . . . substantially lessen competition\" or \"tend to create a monopoly\" in the nationwide market in which shoe manufacturers sell to shoe retailers. The findings of the District Court, supported by the evidence, when taken together with undisputed facts appearing in the record, justify the conclusion that a substantial lessening of competition in the relevant market is a \"reasonable probability.\" S. Rep. No. 1775, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 6 (1950).\n\nOn the date of the merger Kinney's retail stores numbered 352, and this figure had increased to more than 400 by the time of the trial. Nearly all these stores sell men's, women's, and children's shoes and are located in the downtown areas of cities of at least 10,000 population. In 116 of these cities, Kinney's combined pairage sale of shoes for 1955 exceeded 10% of all shoes sold in the city during the year. Its total retail shoe sales during the year constituted 1.2% of the national total in terms of dollar volume and 1.6% in terms of pairage. Of these shoes, only 20% were supplied by the Kinney manufacturing plants, the remainder coming from some 197 other sources.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nPrior to 1955 Kinney had bought none of its outside source shoes from Brown, and its records for 1955 reveal that the year's purchases were made from a diverse number of independent shoe manufacturers. There were 66 suppliers (including Brown) in that year each of whose total sales to Kinney exceeded $50,000, and only three of \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 370]\n\u00a0\n these (Brown, Endicott-Johnson Co., and Georgia Shoe Manufacturing Co.) were large companies whose output placed them among the 25 most productive nonrubber shoe manufacturers in the United States. Consequently, it appears that Kinney was a substantial purchaser of the shoes produced by many small independent shoe manufacturers throughout the country. In fact, the record affirmatively shows that at least five of Kinney's suppliers, three of which are located in the State of New York, one in Pennsylvania, and one in New Hampshire, each relied upon Kinney to purchase more than 40% of its total production in 1955.\n\nThat the merger between Brown's shoe production plants and Kinney's retail outlets will tend to foreclose some of the large market which smaller shoe manufacturers found in sales to Kinney hardly seems open to doubt. This conclusion is supported by the following facts which emerge indisputably from the record: (1) In the shoe industry, as in many others, the purchase of a retail chain by a manufacturer results in an increased flow of the purchasing manufacturer's shoes to the retail store. Hence independent shoe manufacturers find it more difficult to sell their shoes to an acquired retail chain than to an independent one. (2) The result of Brown's earlier acquisition of two retail chains was, in each instance, a substantial increase in the quantity of Brown shoe purchases by the previously independent chains.\n5\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 371]\n\u00a0\n (3) The history of many of Brown's plants proves that they may be readily adapted to the production of the grade and style of shoes customarily sold in Kinney stores.\n6\n (4) Although Brown supplied none of Kinney's requirements before the merger, it was supplying almost 8% of these requirements just two years thereafter.\n\nThe dollar volume of Kinney's outside shoe purchases in 1955 was between 16 and 17 million dollars, and this amount had increased to 19.4 million by 1957. While Kinney was making only about 1.2% of the total retail dollar sales in the United States in 1955, that percentage can hardly be deemed an accurate reflection of its proportion of nationwide shoe purchases by retailers since the retail-sales figure is based on a computation that includes all retail stores, whether or not they were vertically integrated or otherwise affiliated. In terms of available markets for independent shoe manufacturers, the percentage of Kinney's purchases must have been substantially larger - though the precise figure is unavailable on the record before us.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nIf the controlling test were, as it may be under the similar language of 3 of the Clayton Act, one of \"quantitative \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 372]\n\u00a0\n substantiality,\" compare Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n337 \nU.S. 293\n, with Tampa Electric Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., \n365 \nU.S. 320\n, the probable foreclosure of independent manufacturers from this substantial share of the available retail shoe market would be enough to render the vertical aspect of this merger unlawful under 7. But since the merger can be shown to have an injurious effect on competition among manufacturers and among retailers, it is unnecessary to consider whether the Standard Stations formula is applicable.\n\nThe vertical affiliation between this shoe manufacturer and a primarily retail organization is surely not, as the dissenters thought the contractual tie in Standard Stations to be, \"a device for waging competition\" rather than \"a device for suppressing competition.\" \n337 \nU.S., at 323\n. Since Brown is able by reason of this merger to turn an independent purchaser into a captive market for its shoes it inevitably diminishes the available market for which shoe manufacturers compete. If Brown shoes replace those which had been previously produced by others, the displaced manufacturers have no choice but to enter some other market or go out of business. Since all manufacturers, including Brown, had competed for Kinney's patronage when it was unaffiliated, Brown's merger with Kinney potentially withdraws a share of the market previously available to the independent shoe manufacturers.\n\nNot only may this merger, judged from a vertical standpoint, affect manufacturers who compete with Brown; it may also adversely affect competition on the retailing level. With a large manufacturer such as Brown behind it, the Kinney chain would have a great competitive advantage over the retail stores with which it vies for consumer patronage. As a manufacturer-owned outlet, the Kinney store would doubtless be able to sell its shoes at a \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 373]\n\u00a0\n lower profit margin and outlast an independent competitor. The merger would also effectively prevent the retail competitor from dealing in Brown shoes, since these might be offered at lower prices in Kinney stores than elsewhere.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nBrown contends that even if these anticompetitive effects are probable, they touch upon an insignificant share of the market and are not, therefore, \"substantial\" within the meaning of 7. Our decision in Tampa Electric Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., \n365 \nU.S. 320\n, is cited as authority for the proposition that a foreclosure of about 1% of the relevant market is necessarily insubstantial. But the opinion in Tampa Electric carefully noted that \"substantiality in a given case\" depends on a variety of factors. \n365 \nU.S., at 329\n. Two of the considerations that were mentioned were \"the relative strength of the parties\" and \"the probable immediate and future effects which pre-emption of that share of the market might have on effective competition therein.\" Ibid. When, as here, the foreclosure of what may be considered a small percentage of retailers' purchases may be caused by the combination of the country's third largest seller of shoes with the country's largest family-style shoe store chain, and when the volume of the latter's purchases from independent manufacturers in various parts of the country is large enough to render it probable that these suppliers, if displaced, will have to fall by the wayside, it cannot, in my opinion, be said that the effect on the shoe industry is \"remote\" or \"insubstantial.\"\n\nI reach this result without considering the findings of the District Court respecting the trend in the shoe industry towards \"oligopoly\" and vertical integration. The \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 374]\n\u00a0\n statistics in the record fall short of convincing me that any such trend exists.\n9\n I consider the District Court's judgment warranted apart from these findings.\n\nAccordingly, bowing to the Court's decision that the case is properly before us, I join the judgment of affirmance.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"A final judgment is one which disposes of the whole subject, gives all the relief that was contemplated, provides with reasonable completeness, for giving effect to the judgment and leaves nothing to be done in the cause save to superintend, ministerially, the execution of the decree.\" City of Louisa v. Levi, 140 F.2d 512, 514. See, e. g., Grant v. Phoenix Ins. Co., \n106 \nU.S. 429\n; Taylor v. Board of Education, 288 F.2d 600.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] For example, the report which accompanied the 1925 Act to the floor of the Senate said of the cases in which direct appeal from a District Court to the Supreme Court was retained: \"As is well known, there are certain cases which, under the present law, may be taken directly from the district court to the Supreme Court. Without entering into a description of these four classes of cases, it is sufficient to say that under the existing law these are cases which must be heard by three judges, one of whom is a circuit judge.\" S. Rep. No. 362, 68th Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1924). (Emphasis added.) This generalization was obviously erroneous since the Expediting Act provided for direct review in this Court of government antitrust cases decided by a single district judge.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] As the Court noted in United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., \n351 \nU.S. 377, 393\n, \"one can theorize that we have monopolistic competition in every nonstandardized commodity with each manufacturer having power over the price and production of his own product.\" If the Government were permitted to choose its \"line of commerce\" it could presumably draw the market narrowly in a case that turns on the existence vel non of monopoly power and draw it broadly when the question is whether both parties to a merger are within the same competitive market.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The schedule in the record of Kinney's outside shoe suppliers for the calendar year 1955 lists 319 vendors, but 122 of these supplied less than $1,000 worth of goods during the year.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] In 1951 Brown purchased the Wohl Shoe Company, which operated leased shoe departments in department stores throughout the country. Before its acquisition of Wohl, Brown had supplied 12.8% of Wohl's shoe requirements; by 1957, it was supplying 33.6% of Wohl's needs.\n\nIn 1953, Brown purchased a partial interest in a small chain of retail stores in Los Angeles known as Wetherby-Kayser. Before this purchase, Brown had supplied 10.4% of Wetherby's shoes; within one year this percentage increased to almost 50%.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] In addition, it appears from the record that shortly after the merger was effected, Kinney abandoned its earlier policy of selling only Kinney-brand shoes (80% of which were \"made up\" for it by its manufacturers) and began selling a considerable number of Brown's branded and advertised shoes. Along with the indications in the record that Kinney was beginning also to sell higher-priced shoes in its suburban outlets, this suggests that Brown could supply much of Kinney's needs with only a minimal additional capital investment.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The existence of such gaps in the record make a fair assessment of the effects of this merger more difficult than it would otherwise be. One of the reasons why I would not consider the horizontal aspect of this merger is my conviction that the data supplied by the Government is entirely inadequate for a proper evaluation of the impact of the horizontal merger on competition.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] The change in Kinney policy whereby it now carries shoes bearing the Brown brand (see note 6, supra) tends to make retailer competition still more difficult.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] In terms of bare numbers, the quantity of retail outlets owned or controlled by the major manufacturers has undoubtedly been increasing since 1947. But much of the data in the record is incomplete in this regard because it is based on varying standards. Thus, while the Government argues that the increase in percentage of national retail sales by shoe chains owning 101 or more outlets from 20.9% in 1948 to 25.5% in 1954 proves the trend toward \"oligopoly,\" the appellant's statistics, founded upon retail sales by all outlets (including general merchandise and clothing stores), show that retail sales by chains of 11 or more stood at a constant 19.5% of national dollar volume in both 1948 and 1954. Moreover, the apparent decline in the proportional share of the country's shoe needs supplied by the largest manufacturers between 1947 and 1955 belies any claim that shoe production is becoming \"oligopolistic.\" Whereas the largest four manufacturers supplied 25.9% of the Nation's needs in 1947, the largest eight supplied 31.4%, and the largest 15 supplied 36.2%, in 1955 the equivalent percentages were 22%, 27%, and 32.5%.\n\nThere is no suggestion in the record as to whether earlier purchases of retail chains by shoe manufacturers reduced the number of independent manufacturers or otherwise harmed competition. Consequently, while the record does establish that manufacturers have been increasing the number of their retail outlets, it is entirely silent on the effects of this vertical expansion. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 294, 375]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","21":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBROWN v.

United States et al., also on appeal from the same Court.\n\n Because of a labor dispute, arrangements between nonunionized shortline motor carriers in Nebraska for the interchange of traffic with unionized trunk-line motor carriers for movement to and from points beyond Nebraska were disrupted by a union-induced boycott of such traffic under \"hot cargo\" clauses in contracts between the unions and the trunk-line carriers which protected the employees' right to refuse to handle \"unfair goods.\" To meet this situation, the short-line carriers organized a corporation which applied to the Interstate Commerce Commission under 207 (a) of the Interstate Commerce Act for authority to act as an interstate motor carrier. The Commission found that the union-induced boycott of the short-line carriers by the trunk-line carriers had resulted in serious inadequacies in the services available to a large section of the public, and it granted the applicant part of the operating authority requested. It made no findings to justify the choice of this remedy instead of other forms of relief under other sections of the Act. Four months later, Congress enacted the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, which at least raised serious questions as to the validity of the union-induced boycott. Subsequently, the District Court sustained the Commission's order as within the scope of its authority, based on adequate findings and supported by substantial evidence. Held: The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the District Court with instructions to set aside the Commission's order and remand the case to the Commission for further proceedings. Pp. 158-174.\n\n 1. The Commission's order must be set aside as an improvident exercise of its discretion as to the choice of remedies. Pp. 165-170. \n\n[371 \nU.S. 156, 157]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n  (a) When, as here, the particular deviations from an otherwise completely adequate service (which has economic need for the traffic) consist solely of illegal and discriminatory refusals to accept or deliver traffic from or to particular carriers or shippers, the powers of the Commission under 204, 212 and 216 bear heavily on the propriety of relief under 207. Pp. 165-166.\n\n\n  (b) In such a case, the choice of the certification remedy may not be automatic; it must be rational and based upon conscious choice that, in the circumstances, the public interest in \"adequate, economical, and efficient service\" outbalances whatever public interest there is in protecting the revenues of existing carriers, in order to \"foster sound economic conditions in transportation and among the several carriers,\" and the other opposing interests. Pp. 166-167.\n\n\n  (c) The Commission made no findings or analysis to justify its choice of remedies and gave no indication of the basis on which it exercised its expert discretion. Such adjudicatory practice is not acceptable to this Court nor permissible under the Administrative Procedure Act. Pp. 167-168.\n\n\n  (d) The Commission erred in disregarding the suggestion that the refusals of the trunk-line carriers to serve could be terminated through complaint procedures, thus obviating the need for additional service; and that error cannot now be justified on the ground that a cease-and-desist order would have been ineffective, since the Commission made no findings to support such a conclusion.

In view of the enactment of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, four months after the Commission's decision and over a year before the District Court handed down its decision, the District Court should not have affirmed the Commission's order; in the exercise of its discretion, it should have vacated the order and remanded the case to the Commission for further consideration in the light of changed circumstances.

JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThese are direct appeals under 28 U.S.C. 1253 from the judgment of a three-judge District Court, 194 F. Supp. 31 (S. D. Ill.), which upheld an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission, 79 M. C. C. 599, granting a motor common carrier application. This Court noted probable jurisdiction because of important questions raised as to the relationship and interplay between remedies available under the Interstate Commerce Act and under the National Labor Relations Act, as amended by the Labor Management Relations Act. \n368 \nU.S. 951\n.\n\nAppellee Nebraska Short Line Carriers, Inc., is a Nebraska corporation, organized in June 1956. All of its stock is owned by 12 motor carriers serving eastern and central Nebraska and interchanging interstate traffic at \n\n[371 \nU.S. 156, 159]\n\u00a0\n Omaha and other gateway points with over 20 larger trunk-line carriers, among whom are the appellant carriers, with whom through-route, joint-rate, interline arrangements have been established. Some of the stockholder carriers serve Nebraska communities without other motor carrier or rail service.\n\nFor some time prior to May 1956, the stockholder carriers had resisted efforts by the Teamsters Union to unionize their operations. Eventually, the union sought to bring economic pressure to bear upon the stockholder carriers by a secondary boycott against their traffic through the larger, unionized, trunk-line carriers upon whom the stockholder carriers were dependent for interchanging traffic to and from points beyond Nebraska. The collective bargaining contract between the trunk-line carriers and the union contained protection of rights or so-called \"hot cargo\" clauses which reserved to the union and its members \"the right to refuse to handle goods from or to any firm or truck\" involved in any controversy with the union and provided that it should not be a cause for discharge if an employee of the carrier refused to handle \"unfair\" goods.\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[371 \nU.S. 156, 160]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn May 1956, some of the stockholder carriers began experiencing difficulties in receiving and delivering freight from and to many of their normal and logical connections at Omaha and, to some extent, at Sioux City, Lincoln, and Grand Island. The difficulty consisted primarily of the refusal on the part of many of the larger carriers to accept interline traffic tendered to them by the stockholder carriers and the refusal to turn over to them inbound traffic routed over their lines or normally turned over to them for delivery to ultimate destinations in Nebraska. The stockholder carriers, shippers, and consignees thus experienced considerable delay, inconvenience, and unforeseen expense in the movement of traffic to and from interior Nebraska points. At the same time, however, some of the larger interlining carriers, particularly appellants Burlington Truck Lines, Inc., and Santa Fe Trail Transportation Company, generally maintained normal interline relationships with the stockholder carriers.\n\nThe stockholder carriers thereupon organized Short Line and on June 22, 1956, Short Line filed an application with the Interstate Commerce Commission for common carrier authority to transport commodities on a regularly scheduled basis between certain Nebraska and Iowa points and points in other States. A further application for \n\n[371 \nU.S. 156, 161]\n\u00a0\n operating authority over irregular routes between Omaha and points in 32 different States was filed six months later. The applications were assigned to two different examiners, each of whom recommended that the application before him be denied. The Commission stated that \"the pertinent facts are accurately and adequately stated\" in the examiners' reports and adopted the statements as its own (79 M. C. C., at 605, 608), but it concluded that the first application should be granted in part.\n2\n The Commission found that although service in the area was satisfactory before May 1956, after that date the union-induced boycott of the stockholder carriers caused \"a substantial disruption\" and \"serious inadequacies in the service available.\" 79 M. C. C., at 612, 613. Accordingly, it found that grant of Short Line's application was required by \"the present and future public convenience and necessity.\" Id., at 613. The Commission declared that it was not attempting to adjudicate a labor dispute or trench upon the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board, and it conceded its lack of jurisdiction to look beyond the duties of carriers to the public under the terms of the Interstate Commerce Act. Id., at 611. It strongly criticized the carrier appellants for yielding to union secondary boycott demands, however, and it declared that the carriers' failure to fulfill their duties as common carriers was particularly inexcusable since there had been no violence or imminent threats of danger to property or person. The Commission expressed the opinion that alleged \"apprehensions of certain of the organized carriers that any opposition to the demands of the union would have resulted in reprisals against them\" were \"greatly exaggerated,\" and it noted that some of the interlining \n\n[371 \nU.S. 156, 162]\n\u00a0\n carriers had successfully continued to deal with the stockholder carriers, with at least one of them encountering no difficulties with its employee when it changed its policy and carried out its statutory duties as a common carrier and interlined with the Short Line carriers.\n3\n Id., at 612.\n\nFinally, the Commission considered the remedy appropriate to the situation. Short Line had applied for operating authority under 207 (certificates of public convenience and necessity). As the Commission noted, the Act provides other means of correcting deficiencies of service. Section 204 (c) empowers the Commission to order carriers to comply with the transportation laws, and the Commission may act upon complaint or upon its own motion without complaint, in each case after notice and hearing, and sanctions are available to enforce its orders;\n4\n 212 (a) empowers the Commission to suspend certificates for failure to comply with duties under the Act. The Commission proceeded to dispose of the remedy problem in the following manner:\n\n\"We do not agree with those of the parties who insist that the procedure here adopted; namely, the filing of the instant applications under the provisions of section 207 of the act, is in any manner inappropriate. Regardless of the injection of the labor situation into the matter, the instant applications are based upon claimed deficiencies in the motor service \n\n[371 \nU.S. 156, 163]\n\u00a0\n available to the shipping public of Nebraska. Where, as here, the existing carriers are shown to have so conducted their operations as to result in serious inadequacies in the service available to a large section of the public, one effective method of correcting the situation is by the granting of authority for sufficient additional service, and, in fact, we are charged with the duty of procuring such additional facilities as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of the national transportation policy. The fact that other remedies are available, such as the suggested filing of complaints by the aggrieved carriers and shippers does not alter the situation or deprive any carrier of the right to follow the course here chosen.\" Id., at 613.\n\n\n The Commission therefore granted the application.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nThe protesting carriers and the affected union sought judicial review before a three-judge District Court (28 U.S.C. 1336, 1398, 2321-2325), which upheld the order as within the scope of the Commission's statutory \n\n[371 \nU.S. 156, 164]\n\u00a0\n authority, based on adequate findings, and supported by substantial evidence. 194 F. Supp. 31. The court reviewed the evidence and concluded that although there was \"no doubt that their [the protesting carriers'] ability to perform service prior to May 1956. was adequate,\" the record showed that union pressure made it inadequate thereafter. 194 F. Supp., at 45. The court recognized that a cease-and-desist order might have been utilized, but stated that additional certification was also a permissible remedy which was not made unavailable merely because the reason for inadequacy of service was that \"existing carriers [were] subordinating their public service obligations to their collective bargaining agreements.\" Id., at 54.\n\nIn regard to the choice of remedy, the court rejected the contention that the passage of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, which added 8 (e) to the National Labor Relations Act, as amended by the Labor Management Relations Act, 73 Stat. 543, 29 U.S.C. (Supp. III) 158 (e), some four months after the entry of the order, mooted the case by making the union activities in inducing the organized carriers to boycott the Short Line stockholder carriers illegal and therefore unlikely to be resumed. The District Court expressed doubts as to whether 8 (e) \"effectively outlaws `hot cargo' clauses,\" and maintained that, even if it did, the Commission's order should still stand. Id., at 58. To the union's contention that grant of a certificate here injected the Interstate Commerce Commission into the province of the National Labor Relations Board, or at least undercut to some extent the policies of 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, the court replied that the union's failure to organize the employees of the Short Line carriers \"effectively destroyed any jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board under the Act of its creation.\" \n\n[371 \nU.S. 156, 165]\n\u00a0\n Id., at 59.\n6\n The case is now before us on direct appeals from this judgment.\n\nWe have concluded that the judgment of the District Court must be reversed and the Commission's order set aside as an improvident exercise of its discretion. The Commission found from the facts of record that the refusals to handle interchange traffic and to accept freight from certain shippers\n7\n caused a substantial disruption in motor service and serious inadequacies in the service available, despite the efforts of some of the larger trunk-line carriers to maintain normal interline relationships. There was ample evidence to support these findings and we do not disturb them.\n\nThe difficulty with the order arises in connection with the findings and conclusions relevant to the choice of remedy. The assumption of the Commission was that the deficiencies of service made either of two remedies available - additional certification or entry of a cease-and-desist order - and that it had unlimited discretion to apply either remedy simply because either might be effective. It is unmistakably clear from the opinion of the Commission and from the fact-findings it made or adopted,\n8\n that the disruption in service resulted solely from refusals to serve, which in turn arose from union pressure applied to obtain union objectives. It is equally clear that absent union pressure there would have been no refusals to serve and that in such normal circumstances \n\n[371 \nU.S. 156, 166]\n\u00a0\n the facilities and the services of the existing carriers were adequate.\n9\n Moreover, the trunk-line carriers were operating below capacity,\n10\n were in a position and anxious to transport additional traffic,\n11\n and had been enjoying the previously interlined traffic which the grant would divert to Short Line.\n12\n In this factual context we may put aside at the outset the authority which the appellees rely upon that holds that additional certification is the normal and permissible way to deal with generalized inadequacy in service. See, e. g., Davidson Transfer Co. v. United States, 42 F. Supp. 215, 219-220 (E. D. Pa.), aff'd, \n317 \nU.S. 587\n.\n13\n When, as here, the particular deviations from an otherwise completely adequate service (which has economic need for the traffic) consist solely of illegal and discriminatory refusals to accept or deliver traffic from or to particular carriers or shippers, the powers of the Commission under 204, 212, and 216 bear heavily on the propriety of 207 relief. And in such a case the choice of the certification remedy may not be automatic; \n\n[371 \nU.S. 156, 167]\n\u00a0\n it must be rational and based upon conscious choice that in the circumstances the public interest in \"adequate, economical, and efficient service\" outbalances whatever public interest there is in protecting existing carriers' revenues in order to \"foster sound economic conditions in transportation and among the several carriers\" (National Transportation Policy, 49 U.S.C. preceding 1, 301, 901, 1001),\n14\n and the other opposing interests.\n\nThere are no findings and no analysis here to justify the choice made, no indication of the basis on which the Commission exercised its expert discretion. We are not prepared to and the Administrative Procedure Act\n15\n will not permit us to accept such adjudicatory practice. See Siegel Co. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, \n327 \nU.S. 608, 613\n-614. Expert discretion is the lifeblood of the administrative process, but \"unless we make the requirements for administrative action strict and demanding, expertise, the strength of modern government, can become a monster which rules with no practical limits on its discretion.\" New York v. United States, \n342 \nU.S. 882, 884\n (dissenting opinion). \"Congress did not purport to transfer its legislative power to the unbounded discretion of the regulatory body.\" Federal Communications Comm'n v. RCA Communications, Inc., \n346 \nU.S. 86, 90\n. The Commission must exercise its discretion under 207 (a) within the bounds expressed by the standard of \"public convenience and necessity.\" Compare id., at 91. And for the courts \n\n[371 \nU.S. 156, 168]\n\u00a0\n to determine whether the agency has done so, it must \"disclose the basis of its order\" and \"give clear indication that it has exercised the discretion with which Congress has empowered it.\" Phelps Dodge Corp. v. Labor Board, \n313 \nU.S. 177, 197\n. The agency must make findings that support its decision, and those findings must be supported by substantial evidence. Interstate Commerce Comm'n v. J-T Transport Co., \n368 \nU.S. 81, 93\n, United States v. Carolina Carriers Corp., \n315 \nU.S. 475, 488\n-489; United States v. Chicago, M., St. P. & P. R. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 499, 511\n. Here the Commission made no findings specifically directed to the choice between two vastly different remedies with vastly different consequences to the carriers and the public. Nor did it articulate any rational connection between the facts found and the choice made. The Commission addressed itself neither to the possible shortcomings of 204 procedures, to the advantages of certification, nor to the serious objections to the latter. As we shall presently show, these objections are particularly important in the present context and they should have been taken into account.\n\nAppellants' position is and was that the refusals to serve could be terminated through complaint procedures and thus the need for additional service obviated. The Commission was, as indicated, unresponsive to these arguments in its order, deeming that the availability of the other remedy \"[did] not alter the situation.\" This was error. Commission counsel now attempt to justify the Commission's \"choice\" of remedy on the ground that a cease-and-desist order would have been ineffective. The short answer to this attempted justification is that the Commission did not so find. Securities & Exchange Comm'n v. Chenery Corp., \n332 \nU.S. 194, 196\n. The court may not accept appellate counsel's post hoc rationalizations for agency action; Chenery requires that \n\n[371 \nU.S. 156, 169]\n\u00a0\n an agency's discretionary order be upheld, if at all, on the same basis articulated in the order by the agency itself:\n\n\"[A] simple but fundamental rule of administrative law . . . is . . . that a reviewing court, in dealing with a determination or judgment which an administrative agency alone is authorized to make, must judge the propriety of such action solely by the grounds invoked by the agency. If those grounds are inadequate or improper, the court is powerless to affirm the administrative action . . . .\" Ibid.\n\n\n For the courts to substitute their or counsel's discretion for that of the Commission is incompatible with the orderly functioning of the process of judicial review. This is not to deprecate, but to vindicate (see Phelps Dodge Corp. v. Labor Board, \n313 \nU.S. 177, 197\n), the administrative process, for the purpose of the rule is to avoid \"propel[ling] the court into the domain which Congress has set aside exclusively for the administrative agency.\" \n332 \nU.S., at 196\n.\n\nThe second and longer answer to the attempted justification is that there is not substantial evidence of record upon which to base a finding that a cease-and-desist order would have been ineffective. There was every indication at the time that a cease-and-desist order would render the deficiencies in service purely temporary phenomena and would thus be effective in promoting adequate, economical, and efficient service and in fostering sound economic conditions among the carriers affected.\n\nIt is said that attempted compliance by the unionized carriers might in some way \"so aggravate their labor difficulties as to cause a complete cessation of operations.\" But this ignores the Commission's conclusion that carrier apprehensions of teamster reprisals were exaggerated and unwarranted. It further ignores the fact that, as the Commission was aware, the National Labor Relations Board \n\n[371 \nU.S. 156, 170]\n\u00a0\n had ordered the union to cease boycotting any of the stockholder carriers by appeals to the employees of any other carrier. International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local 554, 116 N. L. R. B. 1891. To be sure, the Board had not ordered the union not to make appeals directly to the trunk-line carriers. The union was free to make such appeals, absent inducement of employees, and, as far as the labor laws and the collective agreement\n16\n were concerned, the employer was free to reject or accede to such requests. But it was precisely at this point that the Sand Door case (Local 1976 v. Labor Board, \n357 \nU.S. 93\n) recognized the power of the Commission to enter cease-and-desist orders against the carriers' violating the transportation law and their tariffs.\n17\n Thus, as the appellant union argues,\n18\n there was no reason to have assumed that the ordinary processes of the law\n19\n were incapable of remedying the situation.\n20\n\u00a0\n\n[371 \nU.S. 156, 171]\n\u00a0\n\n\nBut discussion of the effectiveness of cease-and-desist orders in terms of the June 1959 status of hot cargo arrangements is now largely academic: Congress added 8 (e) to the Act four months after the Commission's decision in this case and over a year before the District Court sustained the Commission. Under this section Congress declared it to \"be an unfair labor practice for any labor organization and any employer to enter into any contract or agreement, express or implied, whereby such employer ceases or refrains or agrees to cease or refrain from handling, using, selling, transporting or otherwise dealing in any of the products of any other employer, or to cease doing business with any other person, and any contract or agreement entered into heretofore or hereafter containing such an agreement shall be to such extent unenforcible and void. . . .\" In the absence of authoritative judicial interpretation of 8 (e), however, the District Court was unwilling to attach any significance to the new law in the present case. In this the District Court erred. The plain words of the statute at the very least raised serious questions about the legality of direct union-employer agreements to boycott another employer. Not only would the delinquent interlining carriers in this case be subject to the injunctive and other processes of the National Labor Relations Board if their conduct violated \n\n[371 \nU.S. 156, 172]\n\u00a0\n 8 (e), but the unions themselves would be vulnerable\n21\n and the pressures which generated the refusals to serve might well be effectively removed. These intervening facts so changed the complexion of the case that (even putting aside the considerations discussed above) the reviewing equity court, in the exercise of its sound discretion, should not have affirmed the order, as it did, but should have vacated it and remanded it to the Commission for further consideration in the light of the changed conditions. See Ford Motor Co. v. Labor Board, \n305 \nU.S. 364, 373\n-374; Wabash R. Co. v. Public Serv. Comm'n, \n273 \nU.S. 126, 130\n-131; Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co. v. Dennis, \n224 \nU.S. 503, 506\n-509.\n22\n\u00a0\n\nFinally, although we do not wish to fetter the Commission's expert, discretionary powers by specifically prescribing that cease-and-desist order relief be granted (if, indeed, any relief is still needed) rather than additional certification, nevertheless the Commission should be particularly careful in its choice of remedy, and should have been particularly careful, because of the possible effects of its decision on the functioning of the national labor relations policy. The Commission acts in a most delicate area here, because whatever it does affirmatively (whether it grants a certificate or enters a cease-and-desist order) may have important consequences upon the collective bargaining processes between the union and the employer. The policies of the Interstate Commerce Act and the labor act necessarily must be accommodated, one to the other. \n\n[371 \nU.S. 156, 173]\n\u00a0\n Writing before the 1959 amendments to the labor law, this Court said in the Sand Door case:\n\n \"But it is said that the Board is not enforcing the Interstate Commerce Act or interfering with the Commission's administration of that statute, but simply interpreting the prohibitions of its own statute in a way consistent with the carrier's obligations under the Interstate Commerce Act. Because of that Act a carrier cannot effectively consent not to handle the goods of a shipper. . . . But the fact that the carrier's consent is not effective to relieve him from certain obligations under the Interstate Commerce Act does not necessarily mean that it is ineffective for all purposes, nor should a determination under one statute be mechanically carried over in the interpretation of another statute involving significantly different considerations and legislative purposes.\" \n357 \nU.S., at 110\n.\n\n\n The Court concluded that although \"common factors may emerge in the adjudication of these questions\" under the two Acts by the two different agencies, nevertheless independent consideration and resolution were possible, the National Labor Relations Board directing itself to consideration of whether the employees violated their duties under 8 (b) and the Interstate Commerce Commission directing its attention to whether the carrier \"may have failed in his obligations under the Interstate Commerce Act.\"\n\nImplicit in this analysis is a recognition that if either agency is not careful it may trench upon the other's jurisdiction, and, because of lack of expert competence, contravene the national policy as to transportation or labor relations. In such a context, choice of the sweeping relief of certification rather than the more precise and narrowly \n\n[371 \nU.S. 156, 174]\n\u00a0\n drawn cease-and-desist order remedy was improvident, absent a compelling justification. And the fact that 8 (e) of the Act now exposes the employer as well as the union to Labor Board injunctive processes only underlines the necessity for careful analysis in fashioning a remedy to terminate unlawful action by delinquent carriers. This is not to say that circumstances can never permit the Commission to authorize additional service to remedy refusals to serve, but the Commission must act with a discriminating awareness of the consequences of its action. It has not done so here.\n\nThe judgment of the District Court is reversed. The case is remanded to it with instructions to enter an order enjoining, annulling, and setting aside the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission, and remanding the case to the Commission for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n    It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The hot cargo clause provided, in pertinent part: \"It shall not be a violation of this Agreement and it shall not be cause for discharge if any employee or employees refuse to go through the picket line of a Union or refuse to handle unfair goods. Nor shall the exercise of any rights permitted by law be a violation of this Agreement. The Union and its members, individually and collectively, reserve the right to refuse to handle goods from or to any firm or truck which is engaged or involved in any controversy with this or any other Union; and reserve the right to refuse to accept freight from or to make pickups from, or deliveries to establishments where picket lines, strikes, walk-outs or lockouts exist. \"The term `unfair goods' as used in this Article includes, but is not limited to, any goods or equipment transported, interchanged, handled, or used by any carrier, whether party to this Agreement or not, at any of whose terminals or places of business there is a \n\n[371 \nU.S. 156, 160]\n\u00a0\n controversy between such carrier or its employees on the one hand, and a labor union on the other hand; and such goods or equipment shall continue to be `unfair' while being transported, handled or used by interchanging or succeeding carriers, whether parties to this Agreement or not, until such controversy is settled. .   .   .   .   . \"The insistence by any Employer that his employee[s] handle unfair goods or go through a picket line after they have elected not to, and if such refusal has been approved in writing by the responsible officials of the Central States Drivers Council, shall be sufficient cause for an immediate strike of all such Employer's operations without any need of the Union to go through the grievance procedure herein.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The grant was limited to an Omaha-Chicago and Omaha-Kansas City-St. Louis route, for traffic originating in or destined to Nebraska points. 79 M. C. C., at 606, 614. No appellate review has been sought for the denial of the second application.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Apparently, in some instances it was necessary to handle interlined traffic by officials or supervisory personnel when employees refused to touch it. See R. 82.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See 212 (a) (revocation), 222 (a) (fine), 222 (b) (injunction). That the inadequacy in service involved here was first brought to the Commission's attention by appellee's application for a certificate in no way, of course, limited the agency's power to invoke 204 (c), 212, 222.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] In this connection the Commission noted that it had refused a grant in a similar case decided concurrently with the present application (Galveston Truck Line Corporation Extension, 79 M. C. C. 619). The Commission stated that the circumstances there were different because the labor difficulties which had led to Commission issuance of a cease-and-desist order against carrier obedience to hot cargo clauses (Galveston Truck Line Corp. v. Ada Motor Lines, Inc., 73 M. C. C. 617; see note 17, infra) had \"ceased to exist for some time prior to the hearing, whereas in the instant proceeding such difficulties were of more recent origin and were continuing to be experienced up to and including the time of the hearing.\" 79 M. C. C., at 613. But approximately 21 months intervened between the examiner's report and the Commission's order, and over two years between hearings and order. During at least 18 months of this time the case appears to have been argued to the Commission, remaining on the docket pending decision. See 73 M. C. C., at 617, n. 1.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Compare Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, \n254 \nU.S. 443, 471\n-472. But see National Labor Relations Act, 2 (3), 9: Norris-LaGuardia Act, 13 (c).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] There were findings that secondary boycotts were imposed not only against the stockholder carriers but against certain shippers who were engaged in their own labor disputes.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] The Commission adopted the statements of facts in both recommended reports. 79 M. C. C., at 605, 608.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] R. 87-89, 95.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] R. 54.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] Ibid., R. 95.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] R. 68-69.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] And see Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. Reddish, \n368 \nU.S. 81, 91\n, where the Court rejected the argument that complaint proceedings must be resorted to before additional operating authority could be had to replace a common carrier service inadequate for the shippers' particularized physical or economic needs. This case, like the many cases appellees cite in which the Commission granted through-route certification to overcome inadequacy of existing jointline service (e. g., Penn Ohio New York Exp. Corp. Ext. - N. Y., 27 M. C. C. 269; Malone Freight Lines, Inc., Ext. - Textiles, 61 M. C. C. 501; Dallas & Mavis Fwdg. Co. Ext. - Mont., 64 M. C. C. 511; Braswell Ext. - Calif., 68 M. C. C. 664; Kenosha Corp. Ext. - Kenosha, 72 M. C. C. 289), is clearly inapposite here, where there is nothing inherently wrong with the appellant carriers' service, either because of its particular nature or because of lack of capacity, infrequency of pickups, delays in delivery, or the like.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] In this connection it should be noted that certification of Short Line would divert traffic both from delinquent trunk-line carriers and from carriers who did not violate their duties by acceding to the secondary boycott, e. g., Burlington and Santa Fe. See 79 M. C. C., at 603.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] Section 8 (b), 5 U.S.C. 1007 (b), provides that all decisions shall \"include a statement of . . . findings and conclusions, as well as the reasons or basis therefor, upon all the material issues of fact, law, or discretion presented on the record.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] See note 1, supra, setting forth the relevant provisions, under which the employees reserved the right to refuse to handle hot cargo, but under which the employer was left to his own devices. Cf. note 3, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] The Court cited with approval the first Galveston case (Galveston Truck Line Corp. v. Ada Motor Lines, Inc., 73 M. C. C. 617), in which the Commission entered a cease-and-desist order against carrier obedience to hot cargo clauses. \n357 \nU.S., at 109\n-110.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] The union contends in its brief and we agree that the 212 (a) complaint procedure, if followed by the stockholder carriers, \"would have provided a more adequate remedy\" at the time the case was before the Commission in 1956-1959.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] It is further contended, but we need not consider it here, that the efficacy of a cease-and-desist order is severely limited by the agency's self-imposed limitation against ordering carriers to cease from discriminatorily refusing to interline at joint rates. But cf. Dixie Carriers, Inc., v. United States, \n351 \nU.S. 56\n: Interstate Commerce Comm'n v. Mechling, \n330 \nU.S. 567\n. The Commission did not find, nor could it have found on this record, that the protesting carriers were likely to refuse to interline with the stockholder carriers except at discriminatorily higher, combination rates.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] We do not imply that service deficiencies of the kind found in this record could never justify the issuance of permanent operating authority. A totally different case might be presented if other remedial action by the Commission and the Board proved fruitless, hopelessly time-consuming, or otherwise inadequate to terminate the interruptions in service. Nor do we intend to pass upon the Commission's discretion under 210a to provide temporary authority, pending determination of an application for authority or cease-and-desist order, or as an alternative to permanent authority to remedy service deficiencies of the kind present here. See Pan-Atlantic S. S. Corp. v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., \n353 \nU.S. 436\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 21\n] For the view of the National Labor Relations Board, see Amalgamated Lithographers of America (Ind.), 130 N. L. R. B. 985; Amalgamated Lithographers of America, 130 N. L. R. B. 968, aff'd, 301 F.2d 20 (C. A. 5th Cir.); American Feed Co., 129 N. L. R. B. 321.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 22\n] This was, of course, the District Court's, and not the Commission's, error.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\nI concur in the Court's judgment setting aside the Commission's order granting a permanent certificate to a new carrier to compete with existing carriers who but for temporary interruptions caused by lawful labor union activities would adequately meet the needs of commerce. I do not concur, however, in the remand to the Commission for further proceedings. Congress has vested power to regulate the employer-employee relationship in the National Labor Relations Board, not in the Interstate Commerce Commission, and I think the Commission's grant of a permanent certificate here, which stems wholly from temporary transportation delays owing to a labor dispute within the Labor Board's jurisdiction and which in effect punishes carriers for honoring their then lawful \n\n[371 \nU.S. 156, 175]\n\u00a0\n collective bargaining contracts, amounts to an impermissible encroachment on that Board's domain. We are not called upon at this time to decide whether the Commission is wholly without power under any and all circumstances to grant temporary relief from a temporary stoppage of commerce in order to remedy acute emergency situations such, for illustration, as a shortage of food or supplies urgently needed in particular localities. It will be time enough to decide what are the powers of the Commission to meet such situations when they arise; it is conceded that they are not presented in this case.\n\nSince it is my view that under the facts here the Commission has no power to grant a permanent certificate to a competitor, I see no reason to direct that this matter be referred back to the Commission for further proceedings. Such a remand assumes that there is some further action by way of a cease-and-desist order the Commission can or should take. My view is that the facts in this record provide no possible basis for permitting the Commission to order the carriers to cease and desist from carrying out their agreement with the unions. Nothing in the Interstate Commerce Act gives the Commission power to prohibit carriers or unions under the circumstances shown by this record from doing that which the Labor Act permits them to do. Moreover, as the Court points out, four months after the Commission's order Congress outlawed the kind of conduct which here interfered with transportation. Since Congress has, by this enactment, so clearly taken this matter in hand in a way that does not rely for enforcement on the Interstate Commerce Commission, the old Commission proceedings have all the earmarks of mootness, whether technically moot or not. If the union or the truck lines should hereafter violate this new law the Labor Board, backed by the courts, is vested with ample power to force both carriers and unions to obey that law. \n\n[371 \nU.S. 156, 176]\n\u00a0\n The Interstate Commerce Commission has enough to do within its congressionally appointed field without stepping over into the field of labor regulation. The Commission should no more than a State\n*\n invade regulatory territory Congress has preempted for agencies of its own choice.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Cf. San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, \n359 \nU.S. 236\n (1959).\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK, concurring in the result.\n\nFour months after entry of the Commission's order Congress enacted 8 (e) as an amendment to the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. (Supp. III) 158 (e). Since the language of that section raised serious questions as to the legality of the unions' \"hot cargo\" pressures, which in turn raised questions as to any continuation of the \"substantial disruption\" in service, it appears to me that the District Court should have vacated the order and remanded the case to the Commission for reconsideration in light of the likelihood of changed circumstances. The grant of permanent certification to a new carrier in an area where there are existing certifications is a drastic remedy to which resort should not be made except in the most compelling circumstances.\n\nFor this reason I concur in the Court's reversal and remand to the District Court. In view of the lapse of time and the fact that the conduct which caused the disruption of service has been outlawedFn by Congress, however, it appears that the issue has been mooted, and the Commission may determine that further proceedings would serve no purpose.\n\n Fn \n\n[371 \nU.S. 156, 176]\n\u00a0\n Although the effectiveness of the 8 (e) ban on \"hot cargo\" clauses may have been subject to doubt when the District Court adjudicated this case, subsequent cases tend to remove any such doubt. See, e. g., Labor Board v. Local 294, International Brother-hood of Teamsters, 298 F.2d 105 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1961). \n\n[371 \nU.S. 156, 177]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, and MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN join, concurring.\n\nI join in the opinion and add only a few words to state my conviction that the \"discriminating awareness of the consequences of its action\" required of the Commission by the opinion, inevitably must lead, if any relief is now warranted (which I doubt), to a rejection of the remedy of additional certification in favor of an appropriately limited cease-and-desist order.\n\nAs the matter was presented to the Commission and to the District Court, the additional certification, as the facts here plainly demonstrate, involved the Commission in intervention in the underlying labor dispute to a degree unduly trenching upon the Labor Board's jurisdiction and the rights and duties of the affected parties. Most certainly after the 1959 amendments to the labor law, the Commission, had the case then been remanded to it by the District Court as it should have been, could have entered a cease-and-desist order under which no conflict could or would have arisen between the I. C. C. and the N. L. R. B. in the respective exercise of their powers and in the discharge of their responsibilities. Such a cease-and-desist order should have been appropriately limited to requiring the carriers to provide service in a manner and to the extent compatible with their labor agreements and with both the carriers' and the union's rights and duties under federal labor law. That such an order would have been sufficient in practical effect is demonstrated by the fact that both Burlington and Santa Fe, parties to the hot cargo agreements, were able to carry out their duties under the Motor Carrier Act without creating any serious problems under their union agreements or under the National Labor Relations Act. This being so in the absence of a cease-and-desist order, it is difficult to understand why entry of such an order against the carriers would have been ineffective. \n\n[371 \nU.S. 156, 178]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","25":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBUSBY v.

JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nSection 3 (a) of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act provides that compensation shall be paid only for injuries occurring on navigable waters \"and if recovery . . . through workmen's compensation proceedings may not validly be provided by State law.\"\n1\n In each of these cases the petitioner is a Deputy Commissioner who based an award of compensation under the Act on findings that the employee was engaged at the time of his injury in the work of completing the construction of a vessel afloat on navigable waters.\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 114, 116]\n\u00a0\n Before the Longshoremen's Act was passed, this Court had sustained the validity of a state workmen's compensation statute as applied to injuries suffered by an employee engaged in the completion of a launched vessel under construction on navigable waters, Grant Smith-Porter Ship Co. v. Rohde, \n257 \nU.S. 469\n, but had made clear that state compensation statutes could not, constitutionally, be applied to injuries to employees engaged in repair work on completed vessels on navigable waters.\n3\n The court below interpreted 3 (a) as adopting this distinction and so set aside both awards, thus holding that a shipyard worker's right to compensation under the Act, if his injury is incurred on a vessel, depends not only on whether the vessel is on navigable waters, but also on whether the vessel was under repair rather than under construction. Avondale Shipyards, Inc., v. Donovan, 293 F.2d 51; Travelers Insurance Co. v. Calbeck, 293 F.2d 52. We granted certiorari because of the importance of the interpretation of 3 (a) in the administration of the Act. \n368 \nU.S. 946\n. We reverse the judgments of the Court of Appeals and affirm the judgments of the District Courts sustaining the awards.\n\nThe Court of Appeals' interpretation of 3 (a) would, if correct, have the effect of excepting from the Act's coverage not only the injuries suffered by employees while engaged in ship construction but also any other injuries - even though incurred on navigable waters and so within \n\n[370 \nU.S. 114, 117]\n\u00a0\n the reach of Congress - for which a state law could, constitutionally, provide compensation. But the Court of Appeals' interpretation is incorrect. The history of the Act, and of 3 (a) in particular contravenes it; and our decisions construing 3 (a) have rejected it. Our conclusion is that Congress invoked its constitutional power so as to provide compensation for all injuries sustained by employees on navigable waters\n4\n whether or not a particular injury might also have been within the constitutional reach of a state workmen's compensation law.\n\nThe Longshoremen's Act was passed in 1927. The Congress which enacted it would have preferred to leave to state compensation laws the matter of injuries sustained by employees on navigable waters within state boundaries. However, in 1917 this Court had decided in Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, \n244 \nU.S. 205\n, that the New York Compensation Act could not, constitutionally, be applied to an injury sustained on a gangplank between a vessel and a wharf.\n5\n It was held that the matter was outside state cognizance and exclusively within federal maritime jurisdiction, since to hold otherwise would impair the harmony and uniformity which the constitutional grant to the Federal Government of the admiralty power was meant to assure. While the Court acknowledged \n\n[370 \nU.S. 114, 118]\n\u00a0\n that \"it would be difficult, if not impossible, to define with exactness just how far the general maritime law may be changed, modified, or affected by state legislation,\" \n244 \nU.S., at 216\n, the opinion appeared to foreclose the application of a state compensation remedy to any maritime injury.\n\nThe Jensen decision deprived many thousands of employees of the benefits of workmen's compensation. Congress twice attempted to deal with the situation by legislation expressly allowing state compensation statutes to operate. Act of October 6, 1917, 40 Stat. 395; Act of June 10, 1922, 42 Stat. 634. But this Court struck down both statutes as unconstitutional delegations to the States of the legislative power of Congress, and as tending to defeat the purpose of the Constitution to achieve harmony and uniformity in the maritime law. Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart, \n253 \nU.S. 149\n; Washington v. Dawson & Co., \n264 \nU.S. 219\n.\n\nMeanwhile the Court handed down a number of decisions which appeared to modify Jensen by permitting States to apply their statutes to some maritime injuries. But we must candidly acknowledge that the decisions between 1917 and 1926 produced no reliable determinant of valid state law coverage. In Western Fuel Co. v. Garcia, \n257 \nU.S. 233\n, decided in 1921, the Court upheld the jurisdiction of a United States District Court to entertain a libel in admiralty for damages for the death of a longshoreman under a state wrongful death statute. The Court reasoned that while the subject was maritime it was \"local in character\" and that application of the state statute \"will not work material prejudice to the characteristic features of the general maritime law, nor interfere with the proper harmony and uniformity of that law in its international and interstate relations.\" \n257 \nU.S., at 242\n. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 114, 119]\n\u00a0\n\n\nJust a month later the Court decided Grant Smith-Porter Ship Co. v. Rohde, supra, where, as in the cases before us, a shipbuilder's employee was injured while at work on new construction afloat on navigable waters. He recovered a judgment under a libel in admiralty, although Oregon had a state workmen's compensation law which made the remedy thereunder exclusive of all other claims against the employer on account of the injury. This Court reversed that judgment, holding that the accident was among those \"certain local matters regulation of which [by the States] would work no material prejudice to the general maritime law.\" \n257 \nU.S., at 477\n.\n\nNo dependable definition of the area - described as \"maritime but local,\" or \"of local concern\" - where state laws could apply ever emerged from the many cases which dealt with the matter in this and the lower courts. The surest that could be said was that any particular injury might be within the area of \"local concern,\" depending upon its peculiar facts. In numerous situations state acts were considered inapplicable because they were thought to work material prejudice to the characteristic features of the general maritime law, particularly in cases of employees engaged in repair work.\n6\n On the other hand, awards under state compensation acts were sustained in situations wherein the effect on uniformity was often difficult to distinguish from those found to be outside the purview of state laws.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nThus, the problem which confronted Congress in 1927 had two facets. One was that the failure of Congress' \n\n[370 \nU.S. 114, 120]\n\u00a0\n attempts to shelter the employees under state compensation laws rendered it certain that for many maritime injuries no compensation remedy was available. The other was that the course of judicial decision had created substantial working uncertainty in the administration of compensation. Congress turned to a uniform federal compensation law as an instrument for dealing with both facets. Indeed, the Court in Dawson had invited such consideration, saying: \"Without doubt Congress has power to alter, amend or revise the maritime law by statutes of general application embodying its will and judgment. This power, we think, would permit enactment of a general employers' liability law or general provisions for compensating injured employees; but it may not be delegated to the several States.\" \n264 \nU.S., at 227\n.\n\nThe proposal of a uniform federal compensation act had the unqualified support of both employers and employee representatives. Workmen's compensation had gained wide acceptance throughout the country and State after State was enacting it.\n8\n But hard battles were fought in committee and on the floor in both House of Congress over the form of the law. The bill introduced in the Senate, S. 3170, became the basis of the law.\n\nThere emerges from the complete legislative history\n9\n a congressional desire for a statute which would provide federal compensation for all injuries to employees on navigable waters; in every case, that is, where Jensen \n\n[370 \nU.S. 114, 121]\n\u00a0\n might have seemed to preclude state compensation. The statute's framers adopted this scheme in the Act because they meant to assure the existence of a compensation remedy for every such injury,\n10\n without leaving \n\n[370 \nU.S. 114, 122]\n\u00a0\n employees at the mercy of the uncertainty, expense, and delay of fighting out in litigation whether their particular cases fell within or without state acts under the \"local concern\" doctrine.\n\nThe gravity of the problem of uncertainty was emphasized when 3 of S. 3170 in its original form was under discussion at the Senate Hearings. That version of 3 provided: \"This act shall apply to any employment performed on a place within the admiralty jurisdiction of the United States, except employment of local concern and of no direct relation to navigation and commerce; but shall not apply to employment as master or member of the crew of a vessel.\" (Emphasis supplied.) The Chairman of the Senate Committee perceived that to create an exemption for \"employment of local concern\" threatened to perpetuate the very uncertainties of coverage that Congress wished to avoid.\n11\n The danger was \n\n[370 \nU.S. 114, 123]\n\u00a0\n underlined by objections on behalf of two large employer groups. They not only expressed concern about the practical problems created by the line between new construction and repair, Senate Hearings, at 92-93, but also about the broader implications of the wording: \"This provision is indefinite. The exception of `employment of local concern and of no direct relation to navigation and commerce' is vague and will be the subject of continual litigation. Innumerable claims will become legal questions requiring determination by the courts.\" Senate Hearings, at 95.\n\nWe are not privy to the Committee deliberations at which it was decided to drop the \"local concern\" language from 3 and substitute the language now in the statute. We think it a reasonable inference that the Committee concluded that the exemption for \"employment of local \n\n[370 \nU.S. 114, 124]\n\u00a0\n concern\" would defeat the objective of avoiding the uncertainty created by Jensen and its progeny.\n\nThe action of the House Committee, when S. 3170 as revised in the Senate came before it, discloses similar pre-occupations. The House Committee rewrote 3 to omit both the original \"local concern\" language and the Senate substitute.\n12\n A parliamentary obstacle on an unrelated issue led to the House Committee's finally accepting the Senate version.\n13\n\u00a0\n\nIn sum, it appears that the Longshoremen's Act was designed to ensure that a compensation remedy existed for all injuries sustained by employees on navigable waters, and to avoid uncertainty as to the source, state or federal, of that remedy. Section 3 (a) should, then, be construed to achieve these purposes. Plainly, the Court of Appeals' interpretation, fixing the boundaries of federal coverage where the outer limits of state competence had been left by the pre-1927 constitutional decisions, does not achieve them.\n\nIn the first place, the contours of the \"local concern\" concept were and have remained necessarily vague and \n\n[370 \nU.S. 114, 125]\n\u00a0\n uncertain. There has never been any method of staking them out except litigation in particular cases.\n\nIn the second place, to conclude that federal coverage extends to the limits of navigable waters, except in those cases where a state compensation remedy \"may\" constitutionally be provided, would mean that, contrary to the congressional purpose, some injuries to employees on navigable waters might not be compensable under any statute. A vacuum would exist as to any injury which, although occurring within the constitutional domain of \"local concern,\" was in fact not covered by any state statute. A restriction of federal coverage short of the limits of the maritime jurisdiction could have avoided defeating the objective of assuring a compensation remedy for every injury on navigable waters only if Congress had provided that federal compensation would reach any case not actually covered by a state statute. But in order to have accomplished this result, the statute would have had to withdraw federal coverage, not wherever a state compensation remedy \"may be\" validly provided, but only wherever a state compensation remedy \"is\" validly provided. Even if a court could properly read \"may be\" as meaning \"is,\" such a reading would make federal coverage in the \"local concern\" area depend on whether or not a state legislature had taken certain action - an intention plainly not to be imputed to a Congress whose recent efforts to leave the matter entirely to the States had twice been struck down as unconstitutional delegations of congressional power.\n\nFinally, there would have been no imaginable purpose in carving the area of \"local concern\" out of the federal coverage except to leave the greatest possible number of cases exclusively to the States. The price of such an objective would have included the adoption of whatever seemingly anomalous distinctions the courts might have \n\n[370 \nU.S. 114, 126]\n\u00a0\n developed in articulating the contours of \"local concern,\" as well as the risk of a total failure of compensation in cases within the \"local concern\" realm for which no state compensation had been provided. And in any event, a congressional purpose to leave the maximum possible business exclusively to the States would negate the Court of Appeals' reading of the line of demarcation as a static one fixed at pre-1927 constitutional decisions. Such a purpose would require, rather, that federal coverage expand and recede in harness with developments in constitutional interpretation as to the scope of state power to compensate injuries on navigable waters. But that would mean that every litigation raising an issue of federal coverage would raise an issue of constitutional dimension, with all that that implies; and that each and every award of federal compensation would equally be a constitutionally premised denial of state competence in a like situation. We cannot conclude that Congress imposed such a burden on the administration of compensation by thus perpetuating the confusion generated by Jensen. To dispel that confusion was one of the chief purposes of the Longshoremen's Act.\n\nWe conclude that Congress used the phrase \"if recovery . . . may not validly be provided by State law\" in a sense consistent with the delineation of coverage as reaching injuries occurring on navigable waters. By that language Congress reiterated that the Act reached all those cases of injury to employees on navigable waters as to which Jensen, Knickerbocker and Dawson had rendered questionable the availability of a state compensation remedy.\n14\n Congress brought under the coverage of the \n\n[370 \nU.S. 114, 127]\n\u00a0\n Act all such injuries whether or not a particular one was also within the constitutional reach of a state workmen's compensation law.\n15\n\u00a0\n\nOur previous decision under the Act are entirely consistent with our conclusion. In Parker v. Motor Boat Sales, Inc., \n314 \nU.S. 244\n, an employee of a seller of small boats, maritime supplies and outboard motors, hired primarily as a janitor and porter, was drowned when a boat in which he was riding capsized on the James River off Richmond, Virginia. The boat belonged to a customer of his employer and he and a fellow employee were testing one of the employer's outboard motors for which the boatowner was a prospective purchaser. The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit had held that the employee's work was \"so local in character\" that Virginia could validly have included it under a state workmen's compensation act, and so had set aside an award to the employee's dependents under the Longshoremen's Act. This Court reversed. We noted that \"it is not doubted that Congress could constitutionally have provided for recovery under a federal statute in this kind of situation. The question is whether Congress has so provided in this \n\n[370 \nU.S. 114, 128]\n\u00a0\n statute\" in the light of 3 (a). \n314 \nU.S., at 248\n. The Court held that 3 (a) did not exclude coverage under the Act, saying: \"There can be no doubt that the purpose of the Act was to provide for federal compensation in the area which the specific decisions referred to [in the Senate Report - Jensen, Knickerbocker, and Dawson - ] placed beyond the reach of the states. The proviso permitting recovery only where compensation `may not validly be provided by State law' cannot be read in a manner that would defeat this purpose.\" \n314 \nU.S., at 249\n-250. We thus held that whatever may be 3 (a)'s \"subtraction from the scope of the Act,\" id., at 249, the Act's adoption of the Jensen line between admiralty and state jurisdiction as the limit of federal coverage included no exception for matters of \"local concern.\"\n\nIn Davis v. Department of Labor, \n317 \nU.S. 249\n, a structural steel worker engaged in dismantling a bridge across a navigable river was cutting and stowing dismantled steel in a barge when he fell into the river from the barge and was drowned. His dependents sought compensation under the state act and this Court held that it could be applied. The result was not predicated on the ground that the employment was \"maritime but local,\" and so outside the coverage of the Longshoremen's Act. Rather the Court viewed the case as in a \"twilight zone\" where the applicability of state law was \"extremely difficult\" to determine, and resolved the doubt, of course, in favor of the constitutionality of the application of state law. At the same time, the Court indicated that compensation might also have been sought under the Longshoremen's Act and that an award under that Act in the very same circumstances would have been supportable, pointing out that the Act adopts \"the Jensen line of demarcation.\" \n317 \nU.S., at 256\n. The conclusion that the Longshoremen's Act might have applied without regard \n\n[370 \nU.S. 114, 129]\n\u00a0\n to whether the situation might be \"maritime but local\" plainly implies a rejection of any reading of 3 (a) to exclude coverage in such situation.\n\nThe issue in Avondale Marine Ways, Inc., v. Henderson, \n346 \nU.S. 366\n, was whether compensation was available under the Longshoremen's Act for the death of an employee killed while engaged in the repair of a vessel which was then physically located on land, but on a marine railway. Since a marine railway was considered to be a \"dry dock,\" the injury satisfied 3 (a)'s requirement that it occur \"upon . . . navigable waters,\" defined in 3 as \"including any dry dock.\" At the same time, since the injury did, in a physical sense, occur on land, there is little doubt that a state compensation act could validly have been applied to it. See State Commission v. Nordenholt Corp., \n259 \nU.S. 263\n. Nevertheless, this Court affirmed an award of compensation under the Federal Act in a per curiam opinion.\n\nThe legislative history and our decisions had been read consistently with the views expressed herein by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit before the decisions in the present cases. Judge Hutcheson said for the court in De Bardeleben Coal Corp. v. Henderson, 142 F.2d 481. 483-484:\n\n\"Before the Parker case was decided . . . this court, in Continental Casualty Co. v. Lawson, 5 Cir., 64 F.2d 802, 804, announced the view that the federal compensation laws should be liberally construed to cover every case where the injury occurred on navigable waters and where within the rule of [Jensen] . . . the action would have been in admiralty. In that case we said:\n\n\n \"`The question whether jurisdiction over a maritime tort could be asserted under the compensation \n\n[370 \nU.S. 114, 130]\n\u00a0\n laws of the states, or existed exclusively in admiralty, was an important one when the decisions were rendered in the Rohde . . . and other similar cases . . . but since the passage of this act (the Federal Workmen's Compensation Act) the importance of that question has largely disappeared. . . . The elaborate provisions of the Act, viewed in the light of prior Congressional legislation as interpreted by the Supreme Court, leaves no room for doubt, as it appears to us, that Congress intended to exercise to the fullest extent all the power and jurisdiction it had over the subject-matter. . . .'\n\n\n \"The Parker case, supra, substantially adopts this view . . . . As the Parker case pointed out, it is not at all necessary now to redetermine the correctness vel non of the Jensen case or of any of [its] brood . . . . It is sufficient to say that Congress intended the compensation act to have a coverage co-extensive with the limits of its authority and that the provision `if recovery . . . may not validly be provided by State law' was placed in the act not as a relinquishment of any part of the filed which Congress could validly occupy but only to save the act from judicial condemnation, by making it clear that it did not intend to legislate beyond its constitutional powers. . . . In the application of the act, therefore, the broadest ground it permits of should be taken. No ground should be yielded to state jurisdiction in cases falling within the principle of the Jensen case merely because the Supreme Court, before the Federal Compensation Law went into effect, did here a little, there a little, chip and whittle Jensen down in the mass of conflicting and contradictory decisions in which it advanced and applied the `local concern' doctrine to save to employees \n\n[370 \nU.S. 114, 131]\n\u00a0\n injured on navigable waters, and otherwise remediless, the remedies state compensation laws afforded them. . . . This is what we held in the Lawson case, what the Supreme Court held in the Parker case, supra. . . .\"\n\n\n We turn finally to a question raised only in Donovan v. Avondale Shipyards. The employer contends that the employee accepted benefits under the Louisiana State Compensation Act and that this constitutes an election of remedies which bars prosecution of his claim under the Longshoremen's Act. Compensation payments may be made under the Louisiana Compensation Act without a prior administrative proceeding. Before the federal claim was filed Avondale made payments to the employee for some two years and three months at the maximum rate provided by the Louisiana statute. The employee accepted the checks which bore a notation on their face that they were payments of compensation under the state act. In addition Avondale advanced a substantial sum to the employee to be credited against future compensation payments. Avondale also paid medical expenses for the employee's account in excess of the maximum liability imposed by the Louisiana statute. In the compensation order entered by Deputy Commissioner Donovan under the Longshoremen's Act the full amount of all payments made by the employer was credited against the award, and no impermissible double recovery is possible. We hold that the acceptance of the payments does not constitute an election of the remedy under state law precluding recovery under the Longshoremen's Act. Nothing in the statute requires a contrary result. And we agree that the circumstances do not support a finding of a binding election to look solely to the state law for recovery.

Section 3 (a), 33 U.S.C. 903 (a), reads:\n\n\"(a) Compensation shall be payable under this chapter in respect of disability or death of an employee, but only if the disability or death results from an injury occurring upon the navigable waters of the United States (including any dry dock) and if recovery for the disability or death through workmen's compensation proceedings may not validly be provided by State law. No compensation shall be payable in respect of the disability or death of -\n\n\n\"(1) A master or member of a crew of any vessel, nor any person engaged by the master to load or unload or repair any small vessel under eighteen tons net; or\n\n\n\"(2) An officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof or of any State or foreign government, or of any political subdivision thereof.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] In the Calbeck case the employee, Roger McGuyer, was a welder in the employ of the Levingston Shipbuilding Company which owns and operates a shipyard on the navigable Sabine River, between Orange, Texas, and Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana. McGuyer worked both on the repair of completed vessels and on vessels under construction. He was injured while working on an uncompleted drilling barge which had been launched and was floating on the Sabine River while its superstructure was under construction.\n\nIn the Donovan case the employee, Minus Aizen, was also a welder. His employer was Avondale Marine Ways, Inc., which operated two shipyards near New Orleans. Aizen had worked only on new construction \n\n[370 \nU.S. 114, 116]\n\u00a0\n although fellow employees worked both on new construction and on repair work. He was injured while welding on an oil drilling barge which had been launched and was floating on the navigable waters of the Mississippi River while her construction was being completed.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v.

No. 973, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., at 16:\n\n\"The purpose of this bill is to provide for compensation in the stead of liability, for a class of employees commonly known as longshoremen.' These men are mainly employed in loading, unloading, refitting, and repairing ships; but it should be remarked that injuries occurring in loading or unloading are not covered unless they occur on the ship or between the wharf and the ship so as to bring them within the maritime jurisdiction of the United States. There are in the neighborhood of 300,000 men so employed in the entire country.\n\n\n\"The committee deems it unnecessary to comment upon the modern change in the relation between employers and employees establishing systems of compensation as distinguished from liability. Nearly every State in the Union has a compensation law through which employees are compensated for injuries occurring in the course of their employment without regard to negligence on the part of the employer or contributory negligence on the part of the employee. If longshoremen could avail themselves of the benefits of State compensation laws, there would be no occasion for this legislation; but, unfortunately, they are excluded from these laws by reason of the character of their employment; and they are not only excluded but the Supreme Court has more than once held that Federal legislation can not, constitutionally, be enacted that will apply State laws to this occupation. (Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, \n244 \nU.S. 205\n; Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart, \n253 \nU.S. 149\n; Washington v. Dawson & Co., \n264 \nU.S. 219\n.)\n\n\n\"It thus appears that there is no way of giving to these hard-working men, engaged in a somewhat hazardous employment, the justice involved in the modern principle of compensation without enacting a uniform compensation statute.\"\n\n\n To like effect is H. R. Rep. No. 1190, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., at 1, 3:\n\n\"This bill provides compensation for employees injured . . . in certain maritime employments . . . . The principal wage earners provided for are longshoremen . . . . Next in importance are the ship repairmen - carpenters, painters, boiler makers, etc. Congressional action is necessary if these wage earners are to be given the benefits of workmen's compensation owing to the provisions of \n\n[370 \nU.S. 114, 122]\n\u00a0\n the Constitution of the United States and the decisions of the Supreme Court thereunder. . . . The committee . . . recommends that this humanitarian legislation be speedily enacted into law so that this class of workers, practically the only class without the benefit of workmen's compensation, may be afforded this protection, which has come to be almost universally recognized as necessary in the interest of social justice between employer and employee.\"\n\n\nH. \nR. Rep. No. 1767, 69th Cong., 2d Sess., at 20, makes clear that the House was desirous of legislation whereby Congress could \"discharge its obligation to the maritime workers placed under their jurisdiction by the Constitution of the United States by providing for them a law whereby they may receive the benefits of workmen's compensation and thus afford them the same remedies that have been provided by legislation for those killed or injured in the course of their employment in nearly every State in the Union.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] The following colloquy occurred between the Chairman, Senator Cummins, and an employer spokesman who was testifying:\n\n\"The CHAIRMAN. That term [employment of local concern] was used in one of the decisions of the Supreme Court, probably, but, in its application, just what does it mean? \n\n[370 \nU.S. 114, 123]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Mr. BROWN. Unless there is something in connection with admiralty law which qualifies it, I should say it is a very vague thing, and we can not understand what it means. The phrase `of no direct relation to navigation and commerce' is another questionable proposition, whether the coverage of this bill might not apply to a man on the docks. Some of my friends seem to think that it would not apply to the man on the docks, that the State laws now apply, and it was said in the same decision [the witness referred to Rohde, supra, but the quoted language is found in Nordenholt, supra, note 7, at 276]:\n\n\n\"There is no pertinent Federal statute and application of a local law will not work material prejudice to any characteristic feature of the maritime law.\n\n.  .   .   .   .\n\n\n\n\"The CHAIRMAN. We certainly can find some language that will describe these people that we intend to protect, but I am not sure whether this is the most accurate language that can be found.\n\n\n\"Mr. BROWN. I think that is true. I think that you could not only find language that would prescribe the coverage accurately, but I think that language could be devised that would be eminently satisfactory to everybody in [an] act that would incorporate the purposes which are, perhaps, behind this.\" Senate Hearings, at 57.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] Section 3 as redrafted by the House Committee, H.

See id., 5403-5404, 5410, 5412, explaining that the effect was to exclude seamen from coverage.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] The Committee reports, note 10, supra, make no reference to the \"local concern\" doctrine or the cases applying it. They explain \n\n[370 \nU.S. 114, 127]\n\u00a0\n the problem in terms of the limitations on the availability of state remedies imposed by the Court's decisions in Jensen, Knickerbocker, and Dawson.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] We attach no significance to Opinion No. 7, September 2, 1927, of the Employees' Compensation Commission (now the Bureau of Employees' Compensation) stating that the Commission \"will take no action under the longshoremen's act against an employer engaged only in the construction of vessels who does not comply with the act, nor against any employer engaged in the construction and repair of vessels who secures payment of compensation to employees while employed on repair work on a vessel in a dry dock or on marine ways.\" The Department was not foreclosed in the instant cases from changing an interpretation of the statute which was clear error. Automobile Club of Michigan v. Commissioner, \n353 \nU.S. 180\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] Section 5 of the Longshoremen's Act, 33 U.S.C. 905, which makes liability under the Act \"exclusive . . . of all other liability . . . to the employee, his legal representative . . . and anyone otherwise entitled to recover damages . . . at law or in admiralty . . .\" is not involved in this case.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART, whom MR. JUSTICE HARLAN joins, dissenting.\n\nIn the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. 901-950, Congress carefully provided for the recovery of benefits only \"if recovery for the disability or death through workmen's compensation proceedings may not validly be provided by State law.\" 33 U.S.C. 903 (a). Now, thirty-five years later, the Court concludes that Congress did not really mean what it said. I cannot join in this exercise in judicial legerdemain. I think the statute still means what it says, and what it has always been thought to mean - namely, that there can be no recovery under the Act in cases where the State may constitutionally confer a workmen's compensation remedy. While the result reached today may be a desirable one, it is simply not what the law provides.\n\nI seriously doubt whether statutory language as clear as that in 33 U.S.C. 903 (a) could ever be ignored in the name of effectuating the supposed \"Congressional desire.\" Be that as it may, this particular statutory language \n\n[370 \nU.S. 114, 133]\n\u00a0\n does in fact reflect the purpose of Congress, which was only to provide compensation for those whom this Court's decisions had barred from the benefits of state workmen's compensation laws. And at the time of the passage of this federal law the Court had squarely held, as Congress well knew, that state workmen's compensation remedies were constitutionally available to workers who, as in the present cases, were engaged in new ship construction on navigable waters.\n\nThe Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act was the culmination of a series of events beginning with this Court's decision in Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, \n244 \nU.S. 205\n, which held that the New York Workmen's Compensation Act could not constitutionally be applied to a stevedore unloading a vessel on navigable waters, because to do so would impair the uniformity of the general maritime law. Within five months after the Jensen decision Congress passed legislation which attempted to give injured maritime employees \"the rights and remedies under the workmen's compensation law of any State.\" 40 Stat. 395. This legislation was declared unconstitutional as an invalid attempt to delegate federal power to the States. Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart, \n253 \nU.S. 149\n. A second statute, 42 Stat. 634, similar in approach to the first, was declared invalid in Washington v. Dawson & Co., \n264 \nU.S. 219\n.\n\nMeanwhile, the Court was backing away somewhat from Jensen by recognizing that where the general employment and particular activities connected with an injury or death were local in character, though maritime in nature, state law could provide redress without disturbing the uniformity of the general maritime law. The maritime but local doctrine, first applied in connection with a state wrongful death statute, Western Fuel Co. v. Garcia, \n257 \nU.S. 233\n, provided the basis for holding that a state compensation act could be applied to a worker \n\n[370 \nU.S. 114, 134]\n\u00a0\n engaged in the construction of a new vessel which, while uncompleted, was afloat on navigable waters. Grant Smith-Porter Ship Co. v. Rohde, \n257 \nU.S. 469\n.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nAgainst this background Congress made its third and ultimately successful attempt to provide compensation for maritime employees deprived by the Jensen rule of state compensation remedies. Seizing upon a suggestion made by the Court in Washington v. Dawson & Co., supra, Congress turned its attention in the direction of a uniform federal compensation act. The Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act was the result. In the previous two attempts to circumvent Jensen Congress had indicated its belief that the compensation remedy could best be supplied by the States. It is obvious that in the new Act Congress did not depart from this basic approach, either by making federal law applicable where state law could apply, or by giving the injured employee a choice of remedies. Congress had simply been informed by decisions of this Court that a compensation remedy could be provided for certain maritime injuries only through a uniform federal law, and the federal legislation was enacted only to fill the gap created by those decisions.\n\nThe legislative materials connected with the Act fully support this conclusion. It was repeatedly emphasized that the purpose of the Act was to provide a compensation remedy for those who could not obtain such relief under state law. \"If longshoremen could avail themselves of the benefits of State compensation laws, there would be no occasion for this legislation; but, unfortunately, \n\n[370 \nU.S. 114, 135]\n\u00a0\n they are excluded form these laws by reason of the character of their employment; and they are not only excluded but the Supreme Court has more than once held that Federal legislation can not, constitutionally, be enacted that will apply State laws to this occupation.\" S. Rep. No. 973, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., at 16. \"The committee . . . recommends that this humanitarian legislation be speedily enacted into law so that this class of workers, practically the only class without the benefit of workmen's compensation, may be afforded this protection . . . .\" H. R. Rep. No. 1190, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., at 3. The chairman of the subcommittee conducting hearings on the bill categorically stated that \"we are proceeding on the theory that these people can not be compensated under the New York compensation law or any other compensation law.\" Hearings before a Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee on S. 3170, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., at 84. Similar statements were made by those who spoke during the committee hearings on the proposed legislation.\n2\n Several witnesses pointed out that the statute applied to but two categories of workers, longshoremen and those involved in ship repair,\n3\n the classes of employees denied relief under state compensation acts by the Jensen case and the decisions which followed it.\n4\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 114, 136]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe meaning of 33 U.S.C. 903 (a) can hardly be deemed a question of first impression. In the thirty-five years since its enactment this provision has been before the Court many times. The Court has consistently said that the Act does not apply to injuries on navigable waters where a State can constitutionally provide a compensation remedy. All the commentators have agreed.\n5\n And the administrators of the Act have so held specifically with respect to new ship construction.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nIn order to avoid the harsh results which the uncertainties of this statutory provision could sometimes produce, the Court in Davis v. Department of Labor, \n317 \nU.S. 249\n, developed the theory of the twilight zone. There we reversed a decision of the Washington Supreme Court which had held that a State could not constitutionally make a compensation award to the widow of a workman drowned in a navigable river while dismantling a drawbridge. Relying on the language of 903 (a) the Court pointed out that \"Congress made clear its purpose to permit state compensation protection whenever possible . . . .\" Id., at 252-253. The Court went on to note that harbor workers and longshoremen were clearly protected by the Federal Act but that \"employees such as decedent \n\n[370 \nU.S. 114, 137]\n\u00a0\n here, occupy that shadowy area within which, at some undefined and undefinable point, state laws can validly provide compensation.\" It was noted that both the Federal Act and the state compensation statute \"show clearly that neither was intended to encroach on the field occupied by the other.\" Id., at 255. Since this \"jurisdictional dilemma\" made it difficult for an injured worker to determine on which side of the line his particular case fell, the result in some cases had been that he obtained no compensation at all. In this \"twilight zone\" where the facts of a given case might place an injured worker on either side of the line, the Court held that it would give great weight to the administrative findings in cases brought under the Federal Act, and to the presumption of constitutionality in cases arising under state statutes. Because of this presumption of constitutionality the claimant in Davis was allowed her state remedy.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nWhatever else may be said of the Davis decision, it thus clearly rested on a construction of the statute precisely opposite to that adopted by the Court today. Indeed, if today's decision is correct, then there was no reason for the \"twilight zone\" doctrine worked out with such travail in Davis. For the Court now holds that the problem which led to the Davis decision never really existed. Yet as recently as 1959 the Court began a per curiam opinion with this topic sentence: \"By its terms, the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act does not apply `if recovery for the disability or death through workmen's compensation proceedings may . . . validly be provided by State law.'\" Hahn v. Ross Island \n\n[370 \nU.S. 114, 138]\n\u00a0\n Sand & Gravel Co., \n358 \nU.S. 272\n. Today the Court simply removes these \"terms\" from the Act.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nIn my view the decision of the Court of Appeals in these cases was correct. For almost forty years it has been unequivocally recognized that for those employed on new ship construction recovery for disability or death through workmen's compensation may validly be provided by state law. Grant Smith-Porter Ship Co. v. Rohde, supra. In one of the cases before us the claimant has actually been paid benefits under the Louisiana Compensation Act. In the other a claim under the Texas Act is pending and would clearly be allowed. See Travelers Ins. Co. v. Gonzalez, 351 S. W. 2d 374. These cases, therefore, were not by any stretch of the imagination within the twilight zone. The Federal Act is thus by its terms inapplicable.\n\nI would affirm.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] During this same period the Court consistently held that the principles of Jensen prohibited the application of state compensation laws to workers engaged in the repair of existing vessels. Robins Dry Dock & Repair Co. v. Dahl, \n266 \nU.S. 449\n; Gonsalves v. Morse Dry Dock & Repair Co., \n266 \nU.S. 171\n; Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v.

But it is apparent that the objections went to the possibility that the language \n\n[370 \nU.S. 114, 136]\n\u00a0\n \"except employment of local concern and of no direct relation to navigation and commerce\" might not accurately define the line beyond which state law could be applied - a difficulty which was easily removed by making the statute inapplicable where a remedy could \"validly be provided by State law.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] See Gilmore and Black, Admiralty, 346; Robinson, Admiralty, 110; Rodes, Workmen's Compensation for Maritime Employees: Obscurity in the Twilight Zone, 68 Harv.

Shortly thereafter, the company which had acquired the stock applied to the Federal Power Commission under 7 of the Natural Gas Act for authority to merge the assets of the two companies. The Commission authorized the merger of assets while the antitrust action was still pending in the District Court. The Court of Appeals sustained the Commission's action. Held: The Commission should not have proceeded to a decision on the merits of the merger application when there was pending in the courts a suit challenging the validity of that transaction under the antitrust laws. It should have awaited the decision of the courts. Pp. 483-490.\n\n 111 U.S. App. D.C. 226, 296 F.2d 348, reversed.\n\nWilliam M.

JUSTICE BRENNAN.\n\nEl Paso Natural Gas Company first acquired the stock of the Pacific Northwest Pipeline Corp. and then applied to the Federal Power Commission for authority to acquire the assets pursuant to 7 of the Natural Gas Act, 52 Stat. 825, 15 U.S.C. 717f (c). This application was dated August 7, 1957. Prior thereto, on July 22, 1957, the Federal Government commenced an action against El Paso and Pacific Northwest, alleging that El Paso's acquisition of the stock of Pacific Northwest violated 7 of the Clayton Act,\n1\n 38 Stat. 731, as amended, 64 Stat. 1125, 15 U.S.C. 18. On September 30, 1957, El Paso and Pacific Northwest filed a motion to dismiss the antitrust suit or to stay it, pending completion of the proceedings before the Commission. On October 21, 1957, that motion was denied after hearing; and we denied certiorari. \n355 \nU.S. 950\n. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 482, 484]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn May and June 1958, the Department of Justice wrote four letters to the Commission, asking that the proceeding be stayed pending the outcome of the antitrust suit. On July 29, 1958, the Department of Justice was advised by the Commission that it would not stay its proceedings. The Commission invited the Antitrust Division of the Department to participate in the administrative proceedings; but it did not do so.\n\nThe hearings before the Commission started September 17, 1958. On October 2, 1958, El Paso and Pacific Northwest moved in the District Court for a continuance of the antitrust suit. On October 6, 1958, the Department of Justice asked the Commission to postpone its hearing, pending final outcome of the antitrust suit which had then been set for trial November 17, 1958. On October 7, 1958, the Commission wrote the District Court that if the court denied El Paso and Pacific Northwest's motion for a continuance and proceeded with the antitrust trial, the Commission would continue its merger hearings to a date that would not conflict with the trial date of the antitrust case, but that if the court granted the motion for continuance, the Commission would proceed with its hearing. On October 13, 1958, the District Court continued the antitrust suit until the final decision in the administrative proceedings. The latter proceedings were concluded, the Commission authorizing the merger on December 23, 1959. 22 F. P. C. 1091, 23 F. P. C. 350. The merger was consummated December 31, 1959.\n\nPetitioner intervened in the administrative proceedings August 27, 1957, and obtained review by the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the Commission (111 U.S. App. D.C. 226, 296 F.2d 348), Judge Fahy dissenting. We granted certiorari, \n368 \nU.S. 810\n.\n\nEvidence of antitrust violations is plainly relevant in merger applications, for part of the content of \"public convenience and necessity\" as used in 7 of the Natural \n\n[369 \nU.S. 482, 485]\n\u00a0\n Gas Act is found in the laws of the United States. City of Pittsburgh v. Federal Power Commission, 99 U.S. App. D.C. 113, 237 F.2d 741.\n\nImmunity from the antitrust laws is not lightly implied. The exemption of agricultural cooperatives from the antitrust laws granted by 6 of the Clayton Act and 1 and 2 of the Capper-Volstead Act of 1922 became relevant in Milk Producers Assn. v. United States, \n362 \nU.S. 458\n. While 7 of the Clayton Act gave immunity to \"transactions duly consummated pursuant to authority given by . . . the Secretary of Agriculture under any statutory provision vesting such power in such . . . Secretary,\" we held that the only authority of the Secretary was to approve \"marketing agreements\" (id., 469-470) and not other types of agreements or restraints, typically covered by the antitrust laws. Accordingly, we held that the District Court was authorized to direct the cooperative to dispose as a unit of the assets of an independent producer that had been acquired to stifle competition and restrain trade. We could not assume that Congress, having granted only a limited exemption from the antitrust laws, nonetheless granted an overall inclusive one. See United States v. Borden Co., \n308 \nU.S. 188, 198\n-202. \"When there are two acts upon the same subject, the rule is to give effect to both if possible.\" Id., at 198. Here, as in United States v. R. C. A., \n358 \nU.S. 334\n, while \"antitrust considerations\" are relevant to the issue of \"public interest, convenience, and necessity\" (id., at 351), there is no \"pervasive regulatory scheme\" (ibid.) including the antitrust laws that has been entrusted to the Commission. And see National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, \n319 \nU.S. 190, 223\n. Under the Interstate Commerce Act, mergers of carriers that are approved have an antitrust immunity, as 5 (11) of that Act specifically provides that the carriers involved \"shall be and they are hereby relieved from the operation of the antitrust \n\n[369 \nU.S. 482, 486]\n\u00a0\n laws . . . .\" See McLean Trucking Co. v. United States, \n321 \nU.S. 67\n.\n\nThere is no comparable provision under the Natural Gas Act. Section 7 of the Clayton Act - which prohibits stock acquisitions \"where in any line of commerce in any section of the country, the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly\" - contains a proviso that \"Nothing contained in this section shall apply to transactions duly consummated pursuant to authority given by the . . . Federal Power Commission . . . under any statutory provision vesting such power in such Commission . . . .\" The words \"transactions duly consummated pursuant to authority\" given the Commission \"under any statutory provision vesting such power\" in it are plainly not a grant of power to adjudicate antitrust issues. Congress made clear that by this proviso in 7 of the Clayton Act \". . . it is not intended that . . . any . . . agency\" mentioned \"shall be granted any authority or powers which it does not already possess.\" S. Rep. No. 1775, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 7. The Commission's standard, set forth in 7 of the Natural Gas Act, is that the acquisition, merger, etc., will serve the \"public convenience and necessity.\" If existing natural gas companies violate the antitrust laws, the Commission is advised by 20 (a) to \"transmit such evidence\" to the Attorney General \"who, in his discretion, may institute the necessary criminal proceedings.\" Other administrative agencies are authorized to enforce 7 of the Clayton Act when it comes to certain classes of companies or persons;\n2\n but the Federal Power Commission is not included in the list. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 482, 487]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe do not decide whether in this case there were any violations of the antitrust laws. We rule only on one select issue and that is: should the Commission proceed to a decision on the merits of a merger application when there is pending in the courts a suit challenging the validity of that transaction under the antitrust laws? We think not. We think the Commission in those circumstances should await the decision of the courts.\n\nThe Commission considered the interplay between 7 of the Clayton Act and 7 of the Natural Gas Act and said:\n\n \"Section 7 of the Clayton Act, under which the antitrust suit was brought, prohibits the acquisition by one corporation of the stock or assets of another corporation where `the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.' Exempt, however, are transactions consummated pursuant to Commission authority. This shows, reasons the presiding examiner, that Congress placed reliance on the Commission not to approve an acquisition of assets in violation of the injunction of the Clayton Act, unless in the carefully exercised judgment of the Commission, the acquisition would nevertheless be in the public interest. What we are attempting to arrive at is the public convenience and necessity. In reaching our determination, we do not have authority to determine whether a given transaction is in violation of the Clayton Act, but we are required to consider the bearing \n\n[369 \nU.S. 482, 488]\n\u00a0\n of the policy of the antitrust laws on the public convenience and necessity. City of Pittsburgh v. F. P. C., 237 F.2d 741, 754 (CADC). With the presiding examiner, we find that any lessening of competition whether in the consumer markets or the producing fields, does not prevent our approving the merger because there are other factors which outweigh the elimination of Pacific as a competitor. In any case, it appears that any lessening of competition is not substantial.\" 22 F. P. C. 1091, 1095.\n\n\n Apart from the fact that the Commission did undertake to make a finding reserved to the courts by 7 of the Clayton Act,\n3\n there are practical reasons why it should have held its hand until the courts had acted.\n\nOne is that if the Commission approves the transaction and the courts in the antitrust suit later hold it to be illegal, an unscrambling is necessary. Milk Producers Assn. v. United States, supra. Thus a needless waste of time and money may be involved. Also these unscrambling processes often raise complicated and perplexing problems on tax matters and otherwise, as our recent decision in United States v. du Pont & Co., \n353 \nU.S. 586\n; \n366 \nU.S. 316\n, shows.\n4\n Such complexities \n\n[369 \nU.S. 482, 489]\n\u00a0\n are inherent in the situation, as approval of the transaction by the Commission would be no bar to the antitrust suit. See United States v. R. C. A., supra.\n\nAnother practical reason is that a transaction consummated under the aegis of the Commission as being a matter of \"public convenience and necessity\" is bound to carry momentum into the antitrust suit. The very prospect of undoing what was done raises a powerful influence in the antitrust litigation as United States v. du Pont & Co., supra, illustrates.\n\nThe orderly procedure is for the Commission to await decision in the antitrust suit before taking action.\n\nSection 7 of the Clayton Act, so far as material here, prohibits stock acquisitions having a prescribed effect. Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act confers jurisdiction on the Commission over the acquisition of assets of natural gas companies,\n5\n not over stock acquisitions in them. Had the Commission stayed its hand and had the courts found the stock acquisition unlawful, the entire transaction would have been set aside in limine. Had the courts found the stock acquisition lawful, presumably no problems under 7 of the Clayton Act would have remained. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 482, 490]\n\u00a0\n When the Commission proceeds in the face of a pending but undecided antitrust suit and approves a merger that has been preceded, as this one was, by a stock acquisition, it in substance treats the entire relation of the companies - from the acquisition of stock to the merger - as an integrated transaction. If that administrative action were approved, the Commission would be allowed to do by indirection what it has no jurisdiction to do directly.\n\nIt is not for us to say that the complementary legislative policies reflected in 7 of the Clayton Act on the one hand and in 7 of the Natural Gas Act on the other should be better accommodated. Our function is to see that the policy entrusted to the courts is not frustrated by an administrative agency. Where the primary jurisdiction is in the agency, courts withhold action until the agency has acted. Texas & Pac. R. Co. v. Abilene Oil Co., \n204 \nU.S. 426\n. The converse should also be true, lest the antitrust policy whose enforcement Congress in this situation has entrusted to the courts is in practical effect taken over by the Federal Power Commission.

JUSTICE STEWART joins, dissenting.\n\nIn this case originating in the Federal Power Commission, the Court today announces a new and surprising antitrust procedural rule: If the Commission is asked to \"proceed to a decision on the merits of a merger application when there is pending in the courts a suit challenging the validity of that [merger and its antecedent] transaction[s] under the antitrust laws,\" the Commission must abstain from a determination and \"await decision in the antitrust suit before taking action.\" (Ante, pp. 487, 489.)\n\nThe holding does not turn on any facts or circumstances which may be said to be peculiar to this particular case. It is not limited to Federal Power Commission proceedings. Without adverting to any legal principle or statute to support its decision, the Court appears to lay down a pervasive rule, born solely of its own abstract notions of what \"orderly procedure\" requires, that seemingly will henceforth govern every agency action involving matters with respect to which the antitrust laws are applicable and antitrust litigation is then pending in the courts.\n\nI cannot subscribe to a decision which broadly works such havoc with the proper relationship between the administrative and judicial functions in matters of this kind. The decision, on the one hand, in effect transfers to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice regulatory functions entrusted to administrative agencies, and on the other hand deprives the courts in government antitrust litigation of the authority given them by statute to determine whether or not interlocutory relief is necessary or appropriate. What this new rule entails is illustrated by this case: A business transaction of great magnitude and importance, which the Federal Power \n\n[369 \nU.S. 482, 492]\n\u00a0\n Commission has found to be in the public interest, is, at least for the time being, set for naught, without the slightest inquiry into whether the antitrust charges leveled against it are weighty or not. The Court's action is the more unusual because it is taken (1) despite the antitrust court's denial of interlocutory relief when such relief was belatedly sought by the Government; (2) in the face of the considered judgment of the Solicitor General, representing the public interests respectively involved in the administrative and antitrust proceedings, that determination of the ultimate effect of the Commission's order should be left to abide the event of the antitrust case, and that meanwhile such order should be allowed to stand; and (3) at the instance only of an intervenor in the Commission's proceeding which was not even a party to the Government's antitrust suit.\n\nThe undiscriminating nature and reach of this decision become apparent when attention is focused on the procedural events occurring prior to the order of the Commission which is here under attack. On July 22, 1957, the Department of Justice instituted a civil action in the United States District Court in Utah against the El Paso Natural Gas Company and the Pacific Northwest Pipeline Company, seeking to restrain an alleged violation of 7 of the Clayton Act. This violation was said to have occurred when, beginning in January 1957, El Paso embarked on a program of acquiring nearly all of Pacific's outstanding common stock. The complaint asked that the purchase be declared to be a violation of 7 of the Clayton Act and that El Paso be directed to divest itself of Pacific's stock. No interlocutory relief appears to have been requested.\n\nOn August 7, 1957, El Paso filed with the Federal Power Commission its application for authorization to merge Pacific's assets with its own. Despite this announced intention further to intermingle the affairs of the two corporations, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 482, 493]\n\u00a0\n the Government did not seek temporary relief from the District Court in Utah. El Paso, on the other hand, contended that \"primary jurisdiction\" with regard to the merger resided with the Commission and sought to have the antitrust action stayed. Its motion was denied by the District Court, and on March 3, 1958, we denied leave to file a petition for common-law certiorari to that decision. \n355 \nU.S. 950\n.\n\nWhen the case was returned to the District Court the Government again made no effort to obtain from that court an order maintaining the status quo pending the outcome of the suit. Instead, the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division suggested to the Commission that it stay its own proceedings until the antitrust suit had terminated. When this request was rejected by the Commission, the Antitrust Division withdrew from the Commission proceedings despite an express invitation from the Commission that it participate.\n\nHearings before the Commission's examiner were scheduled to begin on September 17, 1958, and the trial of the antitrust suit in the District Court was set for November 17, 1958. At a hearing on several pretrial matters held in the District Court on September 5 and 6, the Government, for the first time, moved for a temporary injunction to restrain the asset merger even if the Commission's approval were forthcoming.\n1\n That motion was denied and not renewed thereafter. The Commission's hearings began on September 17 and were recessed on September 26 until November 12.\n\nEl Paso again moved in the District Court for a continuance of the antitrust trial until after the Commission had passed on the merger application, and the Government \n\n[369 \nU.S. 482, 494]\n\u00a0\n once more asked the Commission to stay its proceedings pending the outcome of the antitrust case. While noting that the Government had refused the Commission's invitation to intervene in the merger proceedings, the Commission agreed to defer to the District Court. It notified the court that if El Paso's motion for a continuance of the trial were denied, the Commission would continue its merger proceeding to a later date. On October 13, 1958, the District Court issued an order granting El Paso's motion and continued the antitrust trial \"until the final determination by the Federal Power Commission of the applications now pending before it.\" The Government has never sought to review this order by mandamus or by any other available means. The Commission subsequently held its hearings and authorized the merger of El Paso and Pacific in an order dated December 23, 1959. It is that order which the Court today in effect holds to have been entered without jurisdiction.\n\nThe Court relies on three \"practical reasons\" to support its perplexing conclusion that despite the Government's failure promptly to seek relief pendente lite in the antitrust suit, its failure to press for review of the denial of such relief when belatedly sought, and the Commission's expressed willingness to defer to the antitrust court, the Commission was nonetheless required to withhold approval of the merger application: (1) If the asset merger were approved and executed, and the stock purchase thereafter held to be illegal, an \"unscrambling\" involving \"needless waste of time and money\" would be necessary; (2) such an \"unscrambling\" would \"raise complicated and perplexing problems on tax matters and otherwise\"; (3) the Commission's approval of the asset merger \"is bound to carry momentum into the antitrust suit.\" (Ante, pp. 488-489.) Whatever weight these considerations may be deemed to have, I think that \"orderly procedure\" \n\n[369 \nU.S. 482, 495]\n\u00a0\n required their determination, at least in the first instance, by the antitrust court, if indeed they were not rejected by the District Court on the Government's 1958 motion to enjoin consummation of the merger. Their consideration by this Court as an original matter is entirely inappropriate, and in no event do any of them affect the validity of the Commission's order approving the merger.\n2\n\u00a0\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nSection 15 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 25, grants jurisdiction to the United States District Courts \"to prevent and restrain violations\" of the Clayton Act, and empowers the United States Attorneys \"to institute proceedings in equity to prevent and restrain such violations.\" The same statutory section provides that pending determination of the merits of a complaint filed by the United States \"and before final decree, the court may at any time make such temporary restraining order or prohibition as shall be deemed just in the premises.\" Consequently, it is the duty of the District Court before which an antitrust suit is pending to pass on the desirability of temporary relief in order to avoid later problems of \"unscrambling.\" In the case before us, it was not until more than a year after the Government knew of El Paso's intention to merge Pacific's assets with its own that it requested the District Court to enjoin the execution of \n\n[369 \nU.S. 482, 496]\n\u00a0\n this plan. The court's denial of the temporary injunction must be presumed to have been based on its evaluation of the likelihood of success of the antitrust suit and of the difficulties that might arise if interlocutory relief were denied. Not having renewed its motion, the Government may surely not revive it indirectly by attacking the Commission's order. Moreover, by what authority is petitioner, the State of California, an intervenor only in the Commission's proceedings, empowered to assert claims relating to the enforcement of the antitrust laws that are unavailable to the Government, the plaintiff in the antitrust action?\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, whatever is meant by the suggestion that the Commission's approval carries \"momentum\" into the antitrust suit, this factor is one that should be remedied, if necessary, by purging the antitrust proceedings of any improper influence deriving from the agency determination, not by invalidating the administrative action. The Court's holding - which is unnecessary to a decision of this case and, as the Government argues, also premature\n3\n - that the concluding proviso of 7 of the Clayton Act gives the Commission's approval of this asset merger no immunizing effect against the antitrust claim, surely lends added support to the view that the agency is permitted to consider this application as it might consider any other which suggests no difficulties under the antitrust laws. If the Commission's approval is irrelevant to the merits of the Government's \n\n[369 \nU.S. 482, 497]\n\u00a0\n antitrust suit, it is the court considering the antitrust claim which should guard itself against giving weight to this irrelevancy, not the Commission passing on the merger application. And if the lower courts should ultimately go wrong in this regard, their error would be correctible in this Court.\n\nLikewise there is little substance to the difficulty which this Court finds in a court \"undoing what was done\" (ante, p. 489) by the Commission. Had the antitrust trial court been fearful on that score it could have entered an appropriate interlocutory order ensuring that nothing would be done while the litigation was pending.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nFinally, I do not think that the record in this case justifies a conclusion that the Commission's refusal to postpone consideration of the merger application amounted to an abuse of discretion. On the Court's premise that the agency's approval did not immunize the transaction from antitrust liability, the Commission's action in granting the certificate of public convenience and necessity did no more than permit the merger to be consummated subject to all possible antitrust infirmities. And even proceeding on the Commission's premise that the proviso of 7 of the Clayton Act gives it the power to immunize mergers from antitrust liability, its decision to go ahead after being notified by the District Court that the motion to continue the antitrust suit had been granted could hardly be regarded as an abuse of discretion.\n\nIn conclusion, the Court's decision in this case creates a wholly artificial imbalance between antitrust law enforcement and administrative regulation with respect to federally regulated industries. By displacing the continuing supervision of a court over such interlocutory \n\n[369 \nU.S. 482, 498]\n\u00a0\n terms as are \"just in the premises\" with an absolute rule prohibiting the regulating agency from considering applications relating to matters which are also involved in a pending antitrust suit, this decision seems to leave no room for sensible accommodation of the two sets of interests in a given instance. Neither the inflexible rule announced by the Court nor its decision on the facts of this case is supported by reason or authority.\n\nI would affirm.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The fact that such a motion was made and denied does not appear in the record before this Court. However, it is asserted in El Paso's brief and is not denied by any of the other parties.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Because of the posture of this case, I would not reach the question as to what weight should be given to the pendency of administrative merger proceedings by an antitrust court which is asked to grant interlocutory relief. However, I think more can be said than the Court does in favor of staying the hand of an antitrust court pending consideration by the appropriate agency of matters touching on \"those areas . . . in which active regulation has been found necessary to compensate for the inability of competition to provide adequate regulation.\" Federal Communications Comm'n v. RCA Communications, Inc., \n346 \nU.S. 86, 92\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Whatever may be the impact on a 7 action of the Commission's approval of this merger, it can be felt only in the antitrust suit. Consequently, I would, as the Solicitor General has suggested, leave this issue open for consideration in the District Court should the agency's order be asserted as a defense in that action. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 482, 499]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","29":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCANNATA v.

COCHRAN(1962)\nNo. 158\nArgued: Decided: April 30, 1962\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner, an illiterate, was tried in a Florida State Court without counsel and was convicted of serious noncapital offenses. The record was silent as to whether he had been offered and had waived counsel; but it clearly showed that he was incapable of conducting his own defense. Held:\n\n 1. Petitioner's case was one in which the assistance of counsel, unless intelligently and understandingly waived by him, was a right guaranteed him by the Fourteenth Amendment. Pp. 506-513.\n\n\n 2. Presuming waiver of counsel from a silent record is impermissible. To sustain a claim that counsel was waived, the record must show, or there must be an allegation and evidence which show, that the accused was offered counsel but intelligently and understandingly rejected the offer. Pp. 513-517.\n\n\n 123 So.2d 249, reversed and cause remanded.\n\nBy appointment of the Court, \n368 \nU.S. 806\n, Harold A. Ward III argued the cause and filed briefs for petitioner.\n\nJames G. Mahorner, Assistant Attorney General of Florida, argued the cause for respondent by special leave of Court, pro hac vice. With him on the brief was Richard W. Ervin, Attorney General.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe petitioner, who was not afforded the assistance of counsel for his defense at his trial, claims that, for this reason, his conviction by a jury in the Court of Record for Escambia County, Florida, deprived him of rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. He obtained a provisional writ of habeas corpus from the Florida Supreme Court on his petition asserting that claim. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 506, 507]\n\u00a0\n However, that court, on the petition, the respondent's return and the petitioner's reply - but without any hearing - discharged the writ. 123 So.2d 249. Since an important constitutional right is involved, we granted certiorari and appointed counsel to represent the petitioner in this Court. \n366 \nU.S. 958, 368\n U.S. 806.\n\nThe assistance of counsel might well have materially aided the petitioner in coping with several aspects of the case. He was charged with the noncapital offenses of incestuous sexual intercourse with his 13-year-old daughter and, in a separate count relating to the same acts, fondling a minor child, that is, assault in a lewd, lascivious, and indecent manner, upon a female child under the age of 14. At the time of trial two sets of Florida criminal statutes contained language reaching such behavior. Sections 741.22 and 800.04, Florida Statutes, 1959, were general criminal provisions separately defining the two offenses of incest and assault in a lewd, lascivious, and indecent manner. In addition, both offenses were included within the later enacted Chapter 801 of the Florida Statutes - Florida's so-called Child Molester Act - if the victim was 14 years of age or younger.\n1\n The Florida Supreme Court \n\n[369 \nU.S. 506, 508]\n\u00a0\n plainly conceived the petitioner's prosecution for both offenses as having been under the Child Molester Act. 123 So.2d, at 250. While that is an obviously plausible view, a lawyer, but not a layman, might have perceived that because the Child Molester Act was invoked against the petitioner in respect of conduct elsewhere specifically defined as criminal, the 1954 decision of the Florida Supreme Court in Copeland v. State, 76 So.2d 137, raised doubts, under the Florida Constitution, of the validity of a prosecution based on the Act.\n2\n The picture is further complicated by the fact that the Child Molester Act had included no reference to incest prior to an amendment made subsequent to the petitioner's alleged offense.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nEstablishing the basis of the petitioner's prosecution was vitally important for the protection of his rights. If the Child Molester Act was validly applied against the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 506, 509]\n\u00a0\n petitioner, counsel could have materially assisted him by invoking on his behalf the special provisions of that law governing the disposition of defendants charged under it. Sections 741.22 and 800.04 authorize only jail sentences. In contrast, the Child Molester Act empowers the sentencing judge in a proper case to commit the convicted defendant to a Florida state hospital for treatment and rehabilitation.\n4\n That law also permits the accused to \n\n[369 \nU.S. 506, 510]\n\u00a0\n petition for a psychiatric or psychological examination for the purpose of assisting the court in the trial of the case.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nThere are thus present considerations of a sort often deemed sufficient to require the conclusion that a trial for crime without defense counsel did not measure up to the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment. See, e. g., Chewning v. Cunningham, \n368 \nU.S. 443, 446\n-447; Reynolds v. Cochran, \n365 \nU.S. 525, 531\n-532; McNeal v. Culver, \n365 \nU.S. 109, 114\n-116; Rice v. Olson, \n324 \nU.S. 786, 789\n-791.\n\nOther aspects of this record also support petitioner's claim of the unfairness of trying him without affording him the help of a lawyer. As must generally be the case, the trial judge could not effectively discharge the roles of both judge and defense counsel. Here the record shows that the trial judge made efforts to assist the petitioner, but there were important omissions in the guidance he gave. He did not fully apprise the petitioner of vital \n\n[369 \nU.S. 506, 511]\n\u00a0\n procedural rights of which laymen could not be expected to know but to which defense counsel doubtless would have called attention. The omissions are significant. See, e. g., Cash v. Culver, \n358 \nU.S. 633, 637\n-638; Gibbs v. Burke, \n337 \nU.S. 773, 776\n-778; Hudson v. North Carolina, \n363 \nU.S. 697, 702\n-703. Despite the allegation in respondent's return that \"the petitioners were carefully instructed by the trial court with regard to the rights guaranteed by both the Constitution of Florida and the Constitution of the United States\n6\n and with regard to the procedures to be followed during the course of the trial,\" it appears that, while petitioner was advised that he need not testify, he was not told what consequences might follow if he did testify. He chose to testify and his criminal record was brought out on his cross-examination. For defense lawyers, it is commonplace to weigh the risk to the accused of the revelation on cross-examination of a prior criminal record, when advising an accused whether to take the stand in his own behalf; for petitioner, the question had to be decided in ignorance of this important consideration. Nor does it appear that the trial judge advised the petitioner of his right to examine prospective jurors on voir dire, or of his right to submit proposed instructions to the jury, or of his right to object to the instructions that were given.\n\nOther circumstances attending this case only serve to accentuate the unfairness of trial without counsel. Petitioner is illiterate. He did not interpose a single objection during the trial. The only two witnesses against him were his daughter and a 15-year-old son. Although both petitioner and his wife testified that they had experienced disciplinary problems with the children, and thus clearly revealed a possibly significant avenue for impeachment of \n\n[369 \nU.S. 506, 512]\n\u00a0\n the children's testimony, there was no cross-examination worthy of the name.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nWe hold that petitioner's case was one in which the assistance of counsel, unless intelligently and understandingly \n\n[369 \nU.S. 506, 513]\n\u00a0\n waived by him, was a right guaranteed him by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nWe must therefore consider whether the petitioner did intelligently and understandingly waive the assistance of counsel. The record does not show that the trial judge offered and the petitioner declined counsel. Cf. Moore v. Michigan, \n355 \nU.S. 155, 160\n-161. Nevertheless, the State Supreme Court imputed to petitioner the waiver of the benefit of counsel on a ground stated in the court's opinion as follows: \"If the record shows that defendant did not have counsel . . ., it will be presumed that defendant waived the benefit of counsel . . . .\" 123 So.2d ___, at 251. This might mean that the petitioner could have suffered no constitutional deprivation if he had not formally requested counsel, and that failure to make such a request is to be presumed unless the record shows the contrary. But it is settled that where the assistance of counsel is a constitutional requisite, the right to be furnished counsel does not depend on a request.\n8\n In McNeal v. Culver, supra, the petitioner's allegation that he had requested counsel was countered by a denial in the return that \"petitioner's constitutional rights were violated by the court's alleged refusal to appoint counsel in his behalf,\" and the State Supreme Court noted that the record was silent as to any request. We held that when the Constitution grants protection against criminal proceedings without the assistance of counsel, counsel must be furnished \"whether or not the accused requested the appointment of counsel. Uveges v. Pennsylvania, \n335 \nU.S. 437, 441\n.\" \n365 \nU.S., at 111\n, n. 1. See Rice v. Olson, supra, at 788; Gibbs v. Burke, supra, at 780. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 506, 514]\n\u00a0\n\n\nHowever, the Florida Supreme Court may not have meant that the constitutional right to counsel depends upon a formal request. The court may have meant that from the very fact that no counsel was present, it would be assumed that the trial judge made an offer of counsel which the petitioner declined.\n9\n Or, it may have meant that it would assume simply that petitioner knew of his right to counsel and was willing to forego it. Of course, the validity of such presumptions is immediately called in question because the accused has no way of protecting against them during his trial except by requesting counsel - a formality upon which we have just said his right may not be made to depend. Nor is it an answer to say that he may counter such presumptions on collateral attack by showing - if he can - that he had not in fact agreed, or been willing, to be tried without counsel. To cast such a burden on the accused is wholly at war with the standard of proof of waiver of the right to counsel which we laid down in Johnson v. Zerbst, \n304 \nU.S. 458, 464\n-465:\n\n\"It has been pointed out that `courts indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver' of fundamental constitutional rights and that we `do not presume acquiescence in the loss of fundamental rights.'\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"The constitutional right of an accused to be represented by counsel invokes, of itself, the protection of a trial court, in which the accused - whose life or liberty is at stake - is without counsel. This protecting duty imposes the serious and weighty \n\n[369 \nU.S. 506, 515]\n\u00a0\n responsibility upon the trial judge of determining whether there is an intelligent and competent waiver by the accused. While an accused may waive the right to counsel, whether there is a proper waiver should be clearly determined by the trial court, and it would be fitting and appropriate for that determination to appear upon the record.\"\n\n\n We have held the principles declared in Johnson v. Zerbst equally applicable to asserted waivers of the right to counsel in state criminal proceedings. In Rice v. Olson, supra, the petitioner had pleaded guilty to a burglary charge. He did not claim that he had requested counsel, but alleged that he had not been advised of his right to the assistance of counsel and that he had not waived that right. In affirming the denial of relief, the State Supreme Court wrote that \"`It is not necessary that there be a formal waiver; and a waiver will ordinarily be implied where accused appears without counsel and fails to request that counsel be assigned to him, particularly where accused voluntarily pleads guilty.'\" We held that even when there had been a guilty plea such an implication, treated as a conclusive presumption, was \"inconsistent with our interpretation of the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment,\" and that \"A defendant who pleads guilty is entitled to the benefit of counsel, and a request for counsel is not necessary.\" \n324 \nU.S., at 788\n. However, we recognized in Rice v. Olson that, although the Fourteenth Amendment would not countenance any presumption of waiver from the appearance of the accused without counsel and the silence of the record as to a request, the entry of the guilty plea might have raised a fact issue as to whether the accused did not intelligently and understandingly waive his constitutional right. We held that a hearing was required since the facts were in \n\n[369 \nU.S. 506, 516]\n\u00a0\n dispute. In the present case, however, there was no guilty plea, and the return to the writ does not allege an affirmative waiver.\n10\n Therefore, there is no disputed fact question requiring a hearing. Presuming waiver from a silent record is impermissible. The record must show, or there must be an allegation and evidence which show, that an accused was offered counsel but intelligently and understandingly rejected the offer. Anything less is not waiver.\n\nNeither Bute v. Illinois, \n333 \nU.S. 640\n, nor Moore v. Michigan, supra, is in any way inconsistent with our holding and disposition here. In Bute, in which the petitioner pleaded guilty without having requested counsel, it was alleged that he had not been advised of his right to counsel. The Court held that there had been no denial of a constitutional right, but it expressly disclaimed a waiver rationale. It decided simply that the nature of the charge and the circumstances attending the reception of the guilty plea, as recited in that record, were not such as to call into play any constitutionally protected right to counsel. In Moore, the record showed clearly that the petitioner had expressly declined an offer of counsel by the trial judge, and we held that the accused had to show by a preponderance of the evidence that his acquiescence was not sufficiently understanding and intelligent to amount to an effective waiver. But no such burden can be imposed upon an accused unless the record - or a hearing, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 506, 517]\n\u00a0\n where required - reveals his affirmative acquiescence. Where, as in this case, the constitutional infirmity of trial without counsel is manifest, and there is not even an allegation, much less a showing, of affirmative waiver, the accused is entitled to relief from his unconstitutional conviction.\n\nThe judgment of the Florida Supreme Court is reversed and the cause is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE HARLAN concurs in the result.\n\nMR.

I will get even with you one way or the other,' and also the girl would get mad and flirtified and she would almost have the same opinion.\"\n\nThe entire cross-examination of both witnesses by petitioner and by his wife, who was a codefendant, is as follows:\n\n\"CROSS EXAMINATION BY MR. WILLARD CARNLEY:\n\n\n\"Q. Carol Jean, you say your mother, she went and made arrangements to get the casket for your sister?\n\n\n\"A. Yes.\n\n\n\"Q. You are right sure now that she did?\n\n\n\"A.

Yes, I realize he said he was sick. He was supposed to be sick. I know that.\n\n\n\"THEREUPON the witness was excused.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] For this reason, there is no occasion to hold a hearing in this case to settle the fact issue raised by the petition and return as to whether the petitioner requested counsel.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Or that the trial judge was justified in believing that the accused knew perfectly well of his right to counsel, and that it was unnecessary to make an explicit offer and to secure the accused's rejection of the offer.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Petitioner's allegation that he requested counsel is, obviously, tantamount to a denial of waiver. The return's denial of a request is not, however, for reasons already canvassed, the equivalent of an allegation of waiver.\n\nThe return alleged that the trial judge instructed petitioner as to his constitutional rights, but this allegation claimed support in the transcript, inspection of which reveals no instruction as to any constitutional right except the right not to testify.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, concurring.\n\nI concur in the Court's judgment of reversal and agree for the reasons stated in its opinion that petitioner was, even under the constitutional doctrine announced in Betts v. Brady, \n316 \nU.S. 455\n, entitled to be represented by counsel. That case, decided in 1942, held that an indigent defendant charged with crime in a state court did not have a right under the Federal Constitution to be provided with counsel unless this Court could say \"by an appraisal of the totality of facts in a given case\" that the refusal to provide counsel for the particular defendant constituted \"a denial of fundamental fairness, shocking to the universal sense of justice . . . .\" Id., at 462. I dissented from the Court's denial of counsel and its announcement of what I considered to be such an impossibly vague and unpredictable standard. Among other \n\n[369 \nU.S. 506, 518]\n\u00a0\n grounds I thought the defendant in that case entitled to counsel because of my belief that the Fourteenth Amendment makes applicable to the States the Sixth Amendment's guarantee that \"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall . . . have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\" That is still my view.\n\nTwenty years' experience in the state and federal courts with the Betts v. Brady rule has demonstrated its basic failure as a constitutional guide. Indeed, it has served not to guide but to confuse the courts as to when a person prosecuted by a State for crime is entitled to a lawyer. Little more could be expected, however, of a standard which imposes upon courts nothing more than the perplexing responsibility of appointing lawyers for an accused when a trial judge believes that a failure to do so would be \"shocking to the universal sense of justice.\" To be sure, in recent years this Court has been fairly consistent in assuring indigent defendants the right to counsel. As the years have gone on we have been compelled even under the Betts rule to reverse more and more state convictions either for new trial or for hearing to determine whether counsel had been erroneously denied\n1\n - a result that in my judgment is due to a growing recognition of the fact that our Bill of Rights is correct in assuming that no layman should be compelled to defend himself in a criminal \n\n[369 \nU.S. 506, 519]\n\u00a0\n prosecution. But all defendants who have been convicted of crime without the benefit of counsel cannot possibly bring their cases to us. And one need only look at the records of the right-to-counsel cases since Betts v. Brady in both state and federal courts to understand the capriciousness with which the \"shocking to the universal sense of justice\" standard bestows its protection upon persons accused of crime.\n2\n I think that now is the time to abandon this vague, fickle standard for determining the right to counsel of a person prosecuted for crime in a state court. We can do that by recognizing that defendants in state courts have by reason of the Fourteenth Amendment the same unequivocal right to counsel as defendants in federal courts have been held to have by virtue of the Sixth Amendment. Johnson v. Zerbst, \n304 \nU.S. 458\n. For these and many other reasons, including those set out in McNeal v. Culver, \n365 \nU.S. 109, 117\n, by MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and joined in by MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, I would overrule Betts v. Brady in this case. In so doing we would simply return to the holding of this Court in Powell v. Alabama, \n287 \nU.S. 45, 68\n-69, where it was stated with reference to prosecution for crime in the state courts that the \". . . right to be heard would be, in many cases, of little avail if it did not comprehend the right to be heard by counsel.\" I am aware that this statement was made in a capital case, but the Fourteenth Amendment \n\n[369 \nU.S. 506, 520]\n\u00a0\n protects life, liberty, and property and I would hold that defendants prosecuted for crime are entitled to counsel whether it is their life, their liberty, or their property which is at stake in a criminal prosecution.\n\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, while joining the opinion of the Court, also join this opinion.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Chewning v. Cunningham, \n368 \nU.S. 443\n; Hamilton v. Alabama, \n368 \nU.S. 52\n; McNeal v.

Numerous other examples could of course be cited including the contrast between the decisions cited in note 1 and the lower court decisions which they reversed which had held that the denial of counsel had not been erroneous under the Betts v. Brady rule.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, concurring.\n\nWhile I join the opinion of the Court and the separate opinion of MR. JUSTICE BLACK, I wish to add a word to the reasons MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN and I gave in McNeal v. Culver, \n365 \nU.S. 109, 117\n-119, for overruling Betts v. Brady, \n316 \nU.S. 455\n.\n\nPetitioner, an admitted illiterate,\n*\n was forced to try his case to a six-man jury. There is no record of the proceedings at which the jury was impaneled. There is nothing to show that petitioner was told of his right to challenge individual veniremen, or the panel as a whole, or that he challenged anyone for cause or exercised any of the six peremptory challenges granted him by Florida law. Fla. Stat., 1959, 913.08.\n\nIt is certain that he could have made no challenge to the panel as a whole. Such challenge must be in writing, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 506, 521]\n\u00a0\n Fla. Stat., 1959, 913.01, and the Florida Supreme Court tells us he could not write. But even if he could, it is doubtful that he would have been able to show an improper method of selection or even discrimination, because he was confined for a lengthy period prior to trial, five months of which were alleged to have been spent in solitary confinement. He did not have an opportunity, therefore, to gather the factual evidence necessary to sustain a possible challenge to the panel. The Florida statute, moreover, explicitly requires that the written challenge specify the facts on which it is based. Ibid.\n\nHad petitioner been able to write, and had he access to the facts, he still would not, in all probability, have been able to build a legal argument sufficient to challenge the panel. He is a man of low intelligence. Some of the grounds for challenging the panel that might have been invoked by petitioner turn on difficult questions of state law, as where it is alleged that the legislature has passed a special, or local, law providing for the summoning and impaneling of grand and petit jurors. Article III, 20, of the Florida Constitution prohibits such \"special\" laws. It is not always clear, though, whether a particular law is \"special\" or \"general.\" See, e. g., Hysler v. State, 132 Fla. 200, 181 So. 350; 132 Fla. 209, 181 So. 354; State v. Pearson, 153 Fla. 314, 14 So.2d 565. The sophisticated nature of the arguments necessary to attack a law as \"special\" would almost always be beyond the comprehension of one unlearned in the law.\n\nIn Florida, a plea of abatement is the usual manner of testing the legality of a jury list. In some cases, a proceeding in mandamus has been deemed a proper remedy, as where it is claimed that the county commissioners have erred in the manner in which they selected the panel. Jackson v. Jordan, 101 Fla. 616, 135 So. 138. Often a simple oral challenge to an individual juror can achieve just as much, as where an accused contends a venireman \n\n[369 \nU.S. 506, 522]\n\u00a0\n does not have the \"qualifications required by law.\" Fla. Stat., 1959, 913.03 (1). Yet obviously an illiterate cannot be expected to know these niceties of criminal procedure.\n\nAssuming that an accused does decide to challenge prospective veniremen, either peremptorily or for cause, he must then decide how to secure the maximum benefit from his peremptory challenges. Florida statutes provide at least 12 independent grounds for a challenge for cause. Fla. Stat., 1959, 913.03. Ignorance of a ground for challenge is no defense. Denmark v. State, 43 Fla. 182, 31 So. 269; McNish v. State, 47 Fla. 69, 36 So. 176; Webster v. State, 47 Fla. 108, 36 So. 584. Objections to qualifications of jurors not raised at the trial will not be considered on appeal. McNish v. State, supra; Crosby v. State, 90 Fla. 381, 106 So. 741.\n\nWhere the trial court excuses a juror on its own motion, the accused has a right to object. The objection must be timely made, and the grounds therefor clearly stated. It is too late to object once the juror has been excused. Ellis v. State, 25 Fla. 702, 6 So. 768. On appeal, the accused must be able to show that the action of the court was prejudicial, or constituted an abuse of discretion. Williams v. State, 45 Fla. 128, 34 So. 279; Peadon v. State, 46 Fla. 124, 35 So. 204.\n\nThe special difficulties facing an accused in a jury trial do not end with challenges to the panel or individual jurors. Florida prohibits the trial judge from commenting on the weight of the evidence, Lester v. State, 37 Fla. 382, 20 So. 232; Leavine v. State, 109 Fla. 447, 147 So. 897; Seward v. State, 59 So.2d 529, or from expressing an opinion that the accused should be convicted, Wood v. State, 31 Fla. 221, 12 So. 539, lest he influence the jury in its decision. But if he did make such comment, and the accused took no exception, the error will be deemed waived on appeal (Surrency v. State, 48 Fla. 59, 37 So. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 506, 523]\n\u00a0\n 575; Smith v. State, 65 Fla. 56, 61 So. 120), except where the interests of justice would not be served. Kellum v. State, 104 So.2d 99 (Fla. Ct. App. 3d Dist.).\n\nHearsay evidence takes on added importance in jury trials. It is excluded if prejudicial. Owens v. State, 65 Fla. 483, 62 So. 651; Alvarez v. State, 75 Fla. 286, 78 So. 272. But if admitted without objection, it is generally regarded as having been received by consent. Sims v. State, 59 Fla. 38, 52 So. 198. An objection after a question has been answered is sometimes held to come too late. Schley v. State, 48 Fla. 53, 37 So. 518; Williams v. State, 58 Fla. 138, 50 So. 749; Sims v. State, supra. Yet a motion to strike may achieve the same result. Dickens v. State, 50 Fla. 17, 38 So. 909. In a rapid-fire exchange of questions and answers by the prosecution and a witness, a defendant without the assistance of counsel will oftentime find himself helpless to object or even to conceive grounds on which an objection to hearsay will lie. Indeed, what constitutes hearsay is itself a difficult question, on which judges may not always agree. See, e. g., Royal v. State, 127 Fla. 320, 170 So. 450.\n\nOnce the evidence is in, an accused in Florida has the right to have the jury instructed on the law of the case before any final arguments are made. \"The Judge's charge following immediately upon the conclusion of the evidence may enable the jury to obtain a clearer and more accurate conception of their duties in the particular case than if they were required to wait until after the argument of counsel to hear the law of the case from the judge.\" Smithie v. State, 88 Fla. 70, 76, 101 So. 276, 278. This right is waived by a failure to take exception to the procedure adopted by the court. Defects in the instructions of the court will likewise be deemed waived, where the accused fails to make timely objection. White v. State, 122 So.2d 340 (Fla. Ct. App. 2d Dist.); Williams v. State, 117 So.2d 473. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 506, 524]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIntricate procedural rules are not restricted to criminal trials in Florida. Similar rules, equally as complex and confusing to the layman, may be found in the criminal statutes of the other States. I assume that they might not be applied with the same vigor against a layman defending himself, as they would against one represented by a lawyer. Yet even so, the rule of Betts v. Brady projected in a jury trial faces a layman with a labyrinth he can never understand nor negotiate.\n\nAs a result, the jury system - pride of the English-speaking world - becomes a trap for the layman because he is utterly without ability to make it serve the ends of justice.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] The Florida Supreme Court denied petitioner's application for a writ of habeas corpus without a hearing. With respect to the allegation that both petitioner and his wife were illiterate and unable to defend themselves, the court admitted that the record showed conclusively that they were in fact illiterate. It concluded, however, that illiteracy alone did not necessarily import ignorance of the ordinary things of life, such as how to get money from a bank. Apparently classifying the conduct of a defense to a felony charge as one of the \"commonplace things of life,\" the court concluded there was no showing petitioner or his wife \"suffered in the slightest from lack of intelligence.\" 123 So.2d 249, 251.

PENNSYLVANIA(1962)\nNo. 400\nArgued: March 20, 1962Decided: June 25, 1962\n\n\n\n\n Appellant is a Pennsylvania corporation authorized to operate a railroad only within Pennsylvania and having no tracks outside of Pennsylvania. It owned freight cars which were used in ordinary transport operations in three ways: (1) By appellant on its own tracks in Pennsylvania; (2) by a New Jersey railroad on fixed routes and regular schedules over that railroad's tracks in New Jersey; and (3) by many other railroads on their own lines in various parts of the country. Pennsylvania levied an annual property tax on the total value of all freight cars owned by appellant; and appellant challenged its right to do so under the Commerce Clause and the Due Process and Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Held:\n\n 1. Appellant could not avoid imposition of Pennsylvania's tax on the full value of its freight cars merely by proving that some determinable fraction of them were absent from the State for part of the tax year. It must sustain the burden of proving that some determinable portion of them may be similarly taxed in another State. Pp. 611-613.\n\n\n 2. Appellant's freight cars that had been run habitually on fixed routes and regular schedules over the lines of the New Jersey railroad in New Jersey were subject to the imposition of an apportioned ad valorem tax by the State of New Jersey; and, consequently, the daily average of appellant's freight cars located on the New Jersey railroad's lines during the tax year could not constitutionally be included in the computation of this Pennsylvania tax. Pp. 613-614.\n\n\n 3. On the record in this case, Pennsylvania could constitutionally tax, at full value, the remainder of appellant's fleet of freight cars, including those used by other railroads in other States, since appellant has failed to sustain its burden of proving that a tax situs had been established elsewhere with respect to such cars. Pp. 614-617.\n\n\n 4. For the purposes of this tax, Pennsylvania could differentiate between railroads having tracks which lay only within its borders and those whose tracks were located both within and without the \n\n[370 \nU.S. 607, 608]\n\u00a0\n State, since such a classification would be reasonable and would not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Pp. 617-618.\n\n\n 403 Pa. 419, 169 A. 2d 878, affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n\nRoy J. Keefer argued the cause and filed briefs for appellant.\n\nGeorge W. Keitel, Deputy Attorney General of Pennsylvania, argued the cause for appellee. With him on the briefs was David Stahl, Attorney General.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nIn this case we must decide whether the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania may, consistently with the Commerce Clause and the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, impose an annual property tax on the total value of freight cars owned by the appellant, a Pennsylvania corporation, despite the fact that a considerable number of such cars spend a substantial portion of the tax year on the lines of other railroads located outside the State. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania upheld the application of the State's Capital Stock Tax, Purdon's Pa. Stat. Ann., 1949, Tit. 72 1871, 1901, to the full value of all appellant's freight cars.\n1\n 403 Pa. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 607, 609]\n\u00a0\n 419, 169 A. 2d 878. We postponed consideration of the question of jurisdiction to the hearing on the merits, \n368 \nU.S. 912\n, and now find that the appeal is appropriately before us under 28 U.S.C. 1257 (2). E. g., Standard Oil Co. v. Peck, \n342 \nU.S. 382\n.\n\nWe take the facts pertinent to decision from a stipulation submitted by the parties to the trial court. The appellant is a Pennsylvania corporation authorized to operate a railroad only within the State. It has not been licensed to do business elsewhere. The company's track runs from the anthracite coal region in Pennsylvania to the Pennsylvania-New Jersey border, at Easton, where it connects with the lines of the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey (hereinafter CNJ), a New Jersey corporation which owns all the outstanding shares of appellant's stock.\n\nIn 1951, the year for which the tax was assessed, the appellant owned 3,074 freight cars which were put to use in ordinary transport operations in three ways: (1) by the appellant on its own tracks; (2) by CNJ on that company's tracks in New Jersey; (3) by other unaffiliated railroads on their own lines in various parts of the country. CNJ's use of appellant's cars was pursuant to operating agreements under which CNJ was obliged to pay a daily rental equal to the then-effective rate prescribed by the Association of American Railroads. In order to facilitate interstate transportation by the interchange of equipment among carriers, as prescribed by 49 U.S.C. 1, pars. (4), (10), (12), the members of the Association. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 607, 610]\n\u00a0\n including the appellant, had entered into a separate \"Car Service and Per Diem Agreement\" under which each subscriber was authorized to use on its own lines the available freight cars of other subscribers at the established per diem rental. Consequently, during 1951 many of the appellant's freight cars were also used by other railroads on lines outside Pennsylvania.\n\nAppellant contended in the state courts, as it does here, that in computing its Pennsylvania capital stock tax, which is measured by the value of such property as is not exempt from taxation (note 1, supra), it was constitutionally entitled to deduct from the value of its taxable assets a proportional share reflecting the time spent by its freight cars outside Pennsylvania. In support of this claim appellant offered a statistical summary of the use of its freight cars during 1951, seeking to prove that a daily average of more than 1,659 of its 3,074 cars were located on the lines of railroads (including CNJ) which owned no track in Pennsylvania.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nIt also claimed that a daily average of approximately 1,056 other cars had been used by railroads having lines both within and without Pennsylvania. As to such cars, appellant sought to allocate to Pennsylvania only such portions of their value as the combined ratio of road miles of each user-railroad's tracks within Pennsylvania bore to its total road mileage throughout the United States.\n3\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 607, 611]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThese claims were disallowed by the Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue, by the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County, and by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.\n4\n The state courts relied primarily on this Court's decision in New York Central R. Co. v. Miller, \n202 \nU.S. 584\n, which upheld the constitutionality of a domiciliary State's ad valorem property tax levied upon the full value of a railroad's rolling stock, albeit \"some considerable proportion of the [railroad's] . . . cars always . . . [was] absent from the State.\" Id., at 595.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nSince Miller this Court has decided numerous cases touching on the intricate problems of accommodating, under the Due Process and Commerce Clauses, the taxing powers of domiciliary and other States with respect to the instrumentalities of interstate commerce.\n5\n None of these decisions has weakened the pivotal holding in Miller - that a railroad or other taxpayer owning rolling stock cannot avoid the imposition of its domicile's property tax on the full value of its assets merely by proving that some determinable fraction of its property was absent from the State for part of the tax year. This Court has consistently held that the State of domicile retains jurisdiction \n\n[370 \nU.S. 607, 612]\n\u00a0\n to tax tangible personal property which has \"not acquired an actual situs elsewhere.\" Johnson Oil Refining Co. v. Oklahoma, \n290 \nU.S. 158, 161\n.\n\nThis is because a State casts no forbidden burden upon interstate commerce by subjecting its own corporations, though they be engaged in interstate transport, to nondiscriminatory property taxes. It is only \"multiple taxation of interstate operations,\" Standard Oil Co. v. Peck, \n342 \nU.S. 382, 385\n, that offends the Commerce Clause. And obviously multiple taxation is possible only if there exists some jurisdiction, in addition to the domicile of the taxpayer, which may constitutionally impose an ad valorem tax.\n\nNor does the Due Process Clause confine the domiciliary State's taxing power to such proportion of the value of the property being taxed as is equal to the fraction of the tax year which the property spends within the State's borders. Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, \n199 \nU.S. 194\n, held only that the Due Process Clause prohibited ad valorem taxation by the owner's domicile of tangible personal property permanently located in some other State. Northwest Airlines, Inc., v. Minnesota, \n322 \nU.S. 292\n, reaffirmed the principle established by earlier cases that tangible property for which no tax situs has been established elsewhere may be taxed to its full value by the owner's domicile. See New York Central R. Co. v. Miller, supra; Southern Pacific Co. v. Kentucky, \n222 \nU.S. 63, 69\n; Johnson Oil Refining Co. v. Oklahoma, supra. If such property has had insufficient contact with States other than the owner's domicile to render any one of these jurisdictions a \"tax situs,\" it is surely appropriate to presume that the domicile is the only State affording the \"opportunities, benefits, or protection\" which due process demands as a prerequisite for taxation. See Ott v. Mississippi Valley Barge Line Co., \n336 \nU.S. 169, 174\n. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 607, 613]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAccordingly, the burden is on the taxpayer who contends that some portion of its total assets are beyond the reach of the taxing power of its domicile to prove that the same property may be similarly taxed in another jurisdiction. Cf. Dixie Ohio Express Co. v. State Revenue Comm'n, \n306 \nU.S. 72\n.\n\nThe controlling question here is, therefore, the same as it was in Standard Oil Co. v. Peck, \n342 \nU.S. 382\n, where the decision whether a state property tax might constitutionally be imposed on the full value of a domiciliary's moving assets turned on whether \"`a defined part of the domiciliary corpus'\" - there consisting of boats and barges traveling along inland waters - \"could be taxed by the several states on an apportionment basis.\" \n342 \nU.S., at 384\n.\n\nSince the burden of proving an exemption is on the taxpayer who claims it, we must consider whether the stipulated facts show that some determinable portion of the value of the appellant's freight cars had acquired a tax situs in a jurisdiction other than Pennsylvania.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nWith respect to the freight cars that had been used on the lines of CNJ during the taxable year, the stipulation establishes that they \"were run on fixed routes and regular schedules . . . over the lines of CNJ . . . in New Jersey.\" Their habitual employment within the jurisdiction in this manner would assuredly support New Jersey's imposition of an apportioned ad valorem tax on the value of the appellant's fleet of freight cars. Marye v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., \n127 \nU.S. 117, 123\n-124; Pullman's Palace Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n141 \nU.S. 18, 23\n; Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Lynch, \n177 \nU.S. 149\n; Johnson Oil Refining Co. v. Oklahoma, \n290 \nU.S. 158, 162\n-163; cf. Ott v. Mississippi Valley Barge Line Co., \n336 \nU.S. 169\n; \n\n[370 \nU.S. 607, 614]\n\u00a0\n Braniff Airways, Inc., v. Nebraska Board of Equalization, \n347 \nU.S. 590, 601\n. Consequently, the daily average of freight cars located on the CNJ lines in the 1951 tax year, 158 in number, could not constitutionally be included in the computation of this Pennsylvania tax. In this respect, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision (which is difficult to reconcile with its holding as to the similarly situated locomotives, note 4, supra) cannot be accepted.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nWe conclude, however, that on the record before us Pennsylvania was constitutionally permitted to tax, at full value, the remainder of appellant's fleet of freight cars, including those used by other railroads under the Car Service and Per Diem Agreement of the Association of American Railroads. These were, in the language of the stipulation, \"regularly, habitually and\/or continuously employed\" in this manner, but they did not run \"on fixed routes and regular schedules\" as did the cars used by CNJ.\n\nSince the domiciliary State is precluded from imposing an ad valorem tax on any property to the extent that it could be taxed by another State, not merely on such property as is subjected to tax elsewhere, the validity of Pennsylvania's tax must be determined by considering whether the facts in the record disclose a possible tax situs in some other jurisdiction. Had the record shown that appellant's cars traveled through other States along fixed and regular routes, even if it were silent with respect to the length of time spent in each nondomiciliary State, it would doubtless follow that the States through which the regular traffic flowed could impose a property tax measured by some fair apportioning formula. Cf. Braniff Airways, Inc., v. Nebraska Board of Equalization, \n347 \nU.S. 590\n. And this would render unconstitutional any domiciliary ad valorem tax at full value on property that could thus be \n\n[370 \nU.S. 607, 615]\n\u00a0\n taxed elsewhere. Standard Oil Co. v. Peck, supra, at 384.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nAlternatively a nondomiciliary tax situs may be acquired even if the rolling stock does not follow prescribed routes and schedules in its course through the nondomiciliary State. In American Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Hall, \n174 \nU.S. 70\n, this Court sustained the constitutionality of a Colorado property tax on a stipulated average number of railroad cars that had been located within the territorial limits of Colorado during the tax year, although it was agreed by the parties that the cars \"never were run in said State in fixed numbers nor at regular times, nor as a regular part of particular trains.\" Id., at 72. Habitual employment within the State of a substantial number of cars, albeit on irregular routes, may constitute sufficient contact to establish a tax situs permitting taxation of the average number of cars so engaged.\n\nOn the record before us, however, we find no evidence, except as to the CNJ cars, of either regular routes through particular nondomiciliary States or habitual presence, though on irregular missions, in particular nondomiciliary States. It is not disputed that many of the railroads listed as owning no track within Pennsylvania do have lines in more than one State, but there is no way of knowing which, if any, of these States may have acquired taxing jurisdiction over some of appellant's freight cars. And \n\n[370 \nU.S. 607, 616]\n\u00a0\n even with respect to railroads whose lines do not extend beyond the borders of a single State, it cannot be determined whether their use of appellant's cars was habitual or merely sporadic.\n7\n It must be obvious that the fraction of a railroad's lines located within Pennsylvania is wholly unilluminating as to the consistency with which that railroad used appellant's cars in some other State.\n\nIn short, except as to freight cars traveling on the lines of the CNJ, this record shows only that a determinable number of appellant's cars were employed outside the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania during the relevant tax year. But as this leaves at large the possibility of their having a nondomiciliary tax situs elsewhere, that showing does not suffice under our cases to exclude Pennsylvania from taxing such cars to their full value. Neither Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, supra, nor Standard Oil Co. v. Peck, supra, is properly read to the contrary. In the former, the case was remanded for further proceedings \"not inconsistent\" with the Court's opinion that the cars in question, \"so far as they were [permanently] located and employed in other States,\" were not subject to the taxing power of the domiciliary State. \n199 \nU.S., at 211\n. In the latter, the existence of a tax situs in one or more nondomiciliary States sufficiently appeared from the record. Note 6, supra. To accept the proposition that a mere general showing of continuous use of movable property outside the domiciliary State is sufficient to exclude the taxing power of \n\n[370 \nU.S. 607, 617]\n\u00a0\n that State with respect to it, would surely result in an unsound rule; in instances where it was ultimately found that a tax situs existed in no other State such property would escape this kind of taxation entirely.\n\nAs we have shown there is nothing to the contrary in Standard Oil Co. v. Peck. Note 6, supra. And neither the Braniff nor Ott case points to a different conclusion. In Braniff the airplanes held subject to nondomiciliary taxation were shown by the record to have flown on fixed and regular routes. \n347 \nU.S., at 600\n-601. In Ott the Court was careful to point out that \"the statute `was intended to cover and actually covers here, an average portion of property permanently within the State - and by permanently is meant throughout the taxing year.'\" \n336 \nU.S., at 175\n. (Emphasis added.) In the case before us it is impossible to tell, except as to cars on the lines of the CNJ, what the average number of cars was annually in any given State.\n\n\nIV.\n\n\n\nFinally, we think that the appellant's equal protection argument is insubstantial and that it was correctly rejected by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. For purposes of this tax, Pennsylvania could reasonably differentiate between railroads having tracks which lay only within its borders and those whose tracks were located both within and without the State. The various considerations that justify such a classification from a federal constitutional standpoint need hardly be elaborated. It is sufficient to note that the State might reasonably have concluded that the probability of a nondomiciliary apportioned ad valorem tax on a railroad's total assets is greater if the railroad maintains tracks in another State than if it does not. Or it might have determined that the imposition of franchise or other taxes by nondomiciliary States in which the railroad did business compelled some \n\n[370 \nU.S. 607, 618]\n\u00a0\n mitigation of the domiciliary's property tax in order to prevent an oppressive tax burden. In either event, the possible basis for the taxing measure's classification would be reasonable and could not be held to violate the Equal Protection Clause. Cf. Allied Stores of Ohio, Inc., v. Bowers, \n358 \nU.S. 522, 526\n-528; Stebbins v. Riley, \n268 \nU.S. 137, 142\n; Kidd v. Alabama, \n188 \nU.S. 730\n.\n\nAccordingly, we conclude that with respect to all cars other than those employed by CNJ on its lines in New Jersey the appellant has failed to sustain its burden of proving that a tax situs had been acquired elsewhere. The exemption was properly disallowed in this regard.\n\nThe judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n    It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the decision of this case.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The tax imposed by the state statute is denominated a \"capital stock tax,\" but it has been construed by the Pennsylvania court as being the equivalent of a property tax. Pennsylvania v. Standard Oil Co., 101 Pa. 119, 145; Pennsylvania v. Union Shipbuilding Co., 271 Pa. 403, 114 A. 257. Property employed by a corporation in its operations in another State and permanently located there is not subject to this tax. Pennsylvania v. American Dredging Co., 122 Pa. 386, 15 A. 443. The value of the capital stock subjected to the tax is determined by multiplying the total value of the capital stock, as measured by the worth of all the corporation's real and personal property, by the ratio that the value of such nonexempt property within Pennsylvania (including that temporarily outside the State) bears to the value of the corporation's property \n\n[370 \nU.S. 607, 609]\n\u00a0\n everywhere. Purdon's Pa. Stat. Ann., 1949, Tit. 72, 1896; Pennsylvania v. Delaware, L. & W. R. Co., 145 Pa. 96, 22 A. 157. With reference to this precise taxing measure, this Court has said in the past that it, in practical effect, amounts to \"a tax upon the specific property which gives the added value to the capital stock.\" Delaware, L. & W. R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n198 \nU.S. 341, 357\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] If appellant's entire fleet of cars (3,074) is multiplied by the number of days in the year 1951 (365), the total number of \"car days\" comes to 1,122,010. Appellant's schedules show that 605,678 \"car days\" were spent on railroads which owned no track in Pennsylvania. If this latter number is divided by 365, the quotient (1,659) represents the average number of cars located on such railroads on any one day during 1951.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] For example, appellant computes 91,899 \"car days\" as having been spent on the lines of the New York Central Railroad. Since 7.36% of that railroad's track mileage is within Pennsylvania, appellant allocates 6,764 \"car days,\" a proportional share, to Pennsylvania.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania did find, however, that certain diesel locomotives which had been leased to CNJ by the appellant and which traveled along fixed routes and schedules had acquired a tax situs in New Jersey and could not be taxed at their full value by Pennsylvania. The State has not sought review of this part of that decision.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] E. g., Southern Pac. Co. v. Kentucky, \n222 \nU.S. 63\n; Johnson Oil Refining Co. v. Oklahoma, \n290 \nU.S. 158\n; Northwest Airlines, Inc., v. Minnesota, \n322 \nU.S. 292\n; Ott v. Mississippi Valley Barge Line Co., \n336 \nU.S. 169\n; Standard Oil Co. v. Peck, \n342 \nU.S. 382\n; Braniff Airways, Inc., v. Nebraska State Board of Equalization, \n347 \nU.S. 590\n. See generally Developments, 75 Harv. L. Rev. 953, 979-987.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The record in Standard Oil Co. v. Peck discloses that the boats and barges which Ohio sought to tax had been traveling along three regular routes on the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers: from Memphis, Tennessee, to Mt. Vernon, Indiana; from Memphis, Tennessee, to Bromley, Kentucky; and from Baton Rouge or Gibson's Landing, Louisiana, to Bromley, Kentucky. The States in which the vessels landed, as well as those through which they regularly traveled, could undoubtedly have traced these regular trips and levied appropriately apportioned ad valorem taxes.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The fact that revenues for the use of one or more of appellant's cars were accounted for by a subscriber to the \"Car Service and Per Diem Agreement\" does not necessarily indicate that such cars were ever used on the lines of that subscriber. For under the Agreement subscribers were authorized to permit the use of another railroad's cars by nonsubscribers, though they themselves remained liable to the owner railroad for the per diem rentals in respect of their nonsubscriber use.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, concurring.\n\nIn holding that one State's property tax may be invalidated in part because excessive under the Commerce Clause upon the showing of a risk that some other State could impose a tax on part of the value of the same property, the Court is following principles announced in prior decisions of this Court from which I dissented.\n1\n While my views expressed in those cases remain unchanged, \n\n[370 \nU.S. 607, 619]\n\u00a0\n the necessity of this Court's deciding cases requires me to make decisions under the constitutional doctrine there declared so long as the Court remains committed to it.\n2\n Where a party seeks to invoke that doctrine, as here, I wholly agree with the Court that the burden of showing that there is a risk of multiple taxation should rest upon the party challenging the constitutionality of a state tax. I also agree with the Court that the railroad in this case has failed to show a risk of multiple taxation with reference to any cars other than the average number that are in New Jersey on any given day. It is for the foregoing reasons that I concur in the Court's judgment and its opinion insofar as it rests on the Commerce Clause.\n\nSince I think partial invalidation of the tax as to the average number of cars in New Jersey on any given day in the taxable year is fully supported by the Commerce Clause as this Court has interpreted it, I would have been content not to discuss the due process question at all. But since the Court does rest in part on due process, I find it necessary to express my doubts about the use of the Due Process Clause to strike down state tax laws. The modern use of due process to invalidate state taxes rests on two doctrines: (1) that a State is without \"jurisdiction to tax\" property beyond its boundaries, and (2) that multiple taxation of the same property by different States is prohibited. Nothing in the language or the history of the Fourteenth Amendment, however, indicates any intention to establish either of these two doctrines concerning the power of States to tax. In fact neither of these doctrines originated in the Due Process Clause at all, but were first declared by this Court long before the Fourteenth Amendment with its Due Process Clause was \n\n[370 \nU.S. 607, 620]\n\u00a0\n adopted in 1868.\n3\n And in the first case striking down a state tax for lack of jurisdiction to tax after the passage of that Amendment neither the Amendment nor its Due Process Clause nor any other constitutional provision was even mentioned; the Court simply struck down the state tax saying that to sustain it would be \"giving effect to the acts of the legislature of Pennsylvania upon property and interests lying beyond her jurisdiction.\"\n4\n These cases and others that followed for many years after the adoption of the Amendment rested either on the Commerce Clause or on no constitutional provision at all.\n5\n In fact not a single state tax was struck down by this Court as a violation of the Due Process Clause until 1903\n6\n - 35 years after the adoption of the Amendment - and then wholly without any historical or other reasons to show why the cryptic words of the Due Process Clause justified the invalidation of otherwise lawful state taxes. Nor did the Court reveal its reasons for giving due process this meaning in the next case.\n7\n Finally, in the third case applying the Due Process Clause to strike down a state tax, the Court's complete lack of explanation led Mr. Justice Holmes to say:\n\n\"It seems to me that the result reached by the court probably is a desirable one, but I hardly understand \n\n[370 \nU.S. 607, 621]\n\u00a0\n how it can be deduced from the Fourteenth Amendment, and as the Chief Justice feels the same difficulty, I think it proper to say that my doubt has not been removed.\"\n8\n\u00a0\n\n\n The Court has ever since used the Due Process Clause to strike down state laws by finding in it substantially the same protection for interstate commerce as it has found in the Commerce Clause.\n9\n But there is no reference to commerce in the Fourteenth Amendment and the Court has still never adequately explained just what the basis for \n\n[370 \nU.S. 607, 622]\n\u00a0\n its constitutional doctrine is. Because of this I have long entertained many of the same doubts that Mr. Justice Holmes expressed as to the use of this flexible and expansive interpretation of due process to invalidate state tax laws,\n10\n but since the Court's holding here adequately rests on the presently prevailing interpretation of the Commerce Clause, I do not find this to be an appropriate occasion to suggest reconsideration of the applicability of the Due Process Clause to state tax laws.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See, e. g., Gwin, White & Prince, Inc., v.

Professor Beale has said of this decision that, \"[t]he dissent seemed sound as directed against the opinion that the state had no jurisdiction. Nevertheless, Judge Holmes was equally sound in saying that the result was a desirable one. It would be a rash constitutional lawyer who would argue today that an undesirable result was nevertheless constitutional.\" 1 Beale, Conflict of Laws, 522. The use of the Due Process Clause as a method of striking down state tax laws remained a source of concern to Mr. Justice Holmes throughout the remainder of his service on the Court and produced quite a number of dissents. See, e. g., Safe Deposit & Trust Co. v. Virginia, \n280 \nU.S. 83, 96\n (1929); Farmers Loan & Trust Co. v. Minnesota, \n280 \nU.S. 204, 216\n (1930) (overruling Blackstone v. Miller, \n188 \nU.S. 189\n); Baldwin v. Missouri, \n281 \nU.S. 586, 595\n (1930). In the Baldwin case he stated:\n\n\"I have not yet adequately expressed the more than anxiety that I feel at the ever increasing scope given to the Fourteenth Amendment in cutting down what I believe to be the constitutional rights of the States. As the decisions now stand, I see hardly any limit but the sky to the invalidating of those rights if they happen to strike a majority of this Court as for any reason undesirable.\" \n281 \nU.S., at 595\n.

Virginia, \n364 \nU.S. 443\n (dissenting opinion).\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE STEWART join, dissenting in part.\n\nThe stipulations of fact in this case show that an average of 158 freight cars (of the value of $525,765.71) run on fixed routes and regular schedules over railroad lines outside of Pennsylvania. The Court properly holds that they are beyond the constitutional reach of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe stipulations of fact also show that an average of 2189.30 freight cars (of the value of $7,282,773) run regularly, habitually, and continuously on the lines of other railroads outside of Pennsylvania, though not on fixed schedules. The Pennsylvania tax on these cars is sustained on the authority of New York Central R. Co. v. Miller, \n202 \nU.S. 584\n; and if that case is still intact the Court is correct in denying the exemption claimed.\n\nWith all deference we cannot, however, allow Pennsylvania to lay this tax and adhere to our recent decisions. In Ott v. Mississippi Barge Line, \n336 \nU.S. 169\n, we allowed Louisiana and the City of New Orleans to levy ad valorem taxes on barges of foreign corporations even though the barges were not permanently in those jurisdictions nor operated there on fixed routes and regular schedules. The assessments sustained were \"based on the ratio \n\n[370 \nU.S. 607, 623]\n\u00a0\n between the total number of miles of appellees' lines in Louisiana and the total number of miles of the entire line.\" Id., at 171. We adopted for barge lines the rule applicable to railroads, saying that we saw \"no practical difference so far as either the Due Process Clause or the Commerce Clause is concerned whether it is vessels or railroad cars that are moving in interstate commerce.\" Id., at 174. We went on to say:\n\n\"The problem under the Commerce Clause is to determine `what portion of an interstate organism may appropriately be attributed to each of the various states in which it functions.' Nashville, C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Browning, \n310 \nU.S. 362, 365\n. So far as due process is concerned the only question is whether the tax in practical operation has relation to opportunities, benefits, or protection conferred or afforded by the taxing State. See Wisconsin v. J. C. Penney Co., \n311 \nU.S. 435, 444\n. Those requirements are satisfied if the tax is fairly apportioned to the commerce carried on within the State.\" Ibid.\n\n\n We applied the decision in Pullman's Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n141 \nU.S. 18\n, to barges, even though the Pullman's Car case, as noted in the Miller case (\n202 \nU.S., at 597\n), sustained a tax on capital stock where the \"same cars were continuously receiving the protection\" of the nondomiciliary taxing State. Nonetheless, in the Ott decision we allowed the tax by the nondomiciliary State to be levied on \"an average portion of property permanently within the State.\" \n336 \nU.S., at 175\n.\n\nIn Standard Oil Co. v. Peck, \n342 \nU.S. 382\n, we completed the redefinition of the holding in the Miller decision which was implicit in what we wrote in Ott. In the Peck case the domiciliary State was held to have no power to tax barges, except on a formula \"which fairly apportioned the tax to the commerce carried on within the state\" (id., \n\n[370 \nU.S. 607, 624]\n\u00a0\n at 383), as a result of which \"inland water transportation\" was placed \"on the same constitutional footing as other interstate enterprises.\" Id., at 384. We distinguished the Miller case by saying that there \"it did not appear that `any specific cars or any average of cars' was so continuously in another state as to be taxable there.\" Id., at 384. And we went on to say:\n\n\"No one vessel may have been continuously in another state during the taxable year. But we do know that most, if not all, of them were operating in other waters and therefore under Ott v. Mississippi Barge Line Co., supra, could be taxed by the several states on an apportionment basis. The rule which permits taxation by two or more states on an apportionment basis precludes taxation of all of the property by the state of the domicile. See Union Transit Co. v. Kentucky, \n199 \nU.S. 194\n. Otherwise there would be multiple taxation of interstate operations and the tax would have no relation to the opportunities, benefits, or protection which the taxing state gives those operations.\" Id., at 384-385.\n\n\n In Braniff Airways v. Nebraska Board, \n347 \nU.S. 590\n, we allowed a nondomiciliary State to levy an apportioned ad valorem tax on aircraft making 18 stops per day in that State. We said, \"We think such regular contact is sufficient to establish Nebraska's power to tax even though the same aircraft do not land every day and even though none of the aircraft is continuously within the state.\" Id., at 601.\n\nAs a result of the Ott, Peck and Braniff cases the average of 2189.30 freight cars that run regularly, habitually, and continuously on lines of other railroads outside Pennsylvania could be taxed by other States, even though no State can identify the precise cars within its borders and even though the complement of cars is constantly \n\n[370 \nU.S. 607, 625]\n\u00a0\n changing. Since that average of freight cars is regularly, habitually, and continuously outside Pennsylvania, those cars are taxable elsewhere and thus beyond Pennsylvania's reach. The fact that we do not know the average annual number of cars in any given State does not help Pennsylvania's case. Whatever the average in any one State, the total outside Pennsylvania and taxable elsewhere is known and definite. Since that is true, we sanction double taxation when we sustain this tax. We would not allow it in the case of any other interstate business; and, as I read the Constitution, no exception is made that puts the railroad business at a disadvantage. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 607, 626]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","33":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCEPERO v.

CUNNINGHAM(1962)\nNo. 63\nArgued: Decided: February 19, 1962\n\n\n\n\n In a trial in a Virginia court at which he requested but was denied counsel, petitioner was convicted of having been three times convicted and sentenced for felonies, and he was sentenced to 10 years' additional imprisonment. The applicable statute provides that, when it appears that a person convicted of an offense has been previously sentenced \"to a like punishment,\" he may be tried on an information that alleges \"the existence of records of prior convictions and the identity of the prisoner named in each,\" and it leaves to the trial court's discretion the length of the sentence which may be imposed for three or more convictions. Under Virginia law, not only the identity of the prisoner and the existence of the records but also the validity of the prior convictions may be at issue in such a proceeding. Held: Trial on a charge of being a habitual criminal is such a serious one, the issues presented under Virginia's statute are so complex, and the potential prejudice resulting from the absence of counsel is so great that petitioner's trial and conviction without counsel violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Pp. 443-447.\n\n Reversed.\n\nDaniel J. Meador, acting under appointment by the Court, \n365 \nU.S. 875\n, argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs was F. D. G. Ribble.\n\nReno S. Harp III, Assistant Attorney General of Virginia, argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was Frederick T. Gray, Attorney General.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner was sentenced to 10 years in prison under Virginia's recidivist statute. Va. Code, 1950, 53-296. This statute provides that when it appears that a person convicted of an offense has been previously sentenced \"to \n\n[368 \nU.S. 443, 444]\n\u00a0\n a like punishment,\" he may be tried on an information that alleges \"the existence of records of prior convictions and the identity of the prisoner with the person named in each.\" The statute goes on to provide that the prisoner may deny the existence of any such records, or that he is the same person named therein, or both.\n\nIf the existence of the records is denied, the court determines whether they exist. If the court so finds and the prisoner denies he is the person mentioned in the records or remains silent, a jury is impaneled to try that issue. If the jury finds he is the same person and if he has one prior conviction, the court may sentence him for an additional term not to exceed five years. If he has been twice sentenced, the court may impose such additional sentence as it \"may deem proper.\"\n\nPetitioner, then imprisoned in Virginia, was charged with having been three times convicted of and sentenced for a felony. He was accordingly tried under the recidivist statute; and he is now serving the sentence imposed at that trial. He brought this habeas corpus proceeding in the Virginia courts to challenge the legality of that sentence. The crux of his complaint was that he was tried and convicted without having had the benefit and aid of counsel, though he had requested one.\n1\n The Law and Equity Court of Richmond denied relief; and the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia refused a writ of error. While the grounds for the action of the Supreme Court of Appeals are not disclosed, the Law and Equity Court wrote an opinion, making clear that it ruled on the federal constitutional claim:\n\n  \"As to the mandate of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, here relied upon, the converse has been adjudicated. In Gryger \n\n[368 \nU.S. 443, 445]\n\u00a0\n v. Burke, \n334 \nU.S. 728\n, where release [on] habeas corpus was sought on the ground that petitioner was without counsel at his recidivist hearing, Mr. Justice Jackson said, in part, as follows (at p. 731):\n\n\n  \" `. . . the State's failure to provide counsel for this petitioner on his plea to the fourth offender charge did not render his conviction and sentence invalid.'\n\n\n  \"This holding was adhered to in Chandler v. Fretag, \n348 \nU.S. 3\n, where it was decided that, while a State is not required under the Fourteenth Amendment to furnish counsel, it cannot deny the defendant in a repeater hearing of the right to be heard by counsel of his own choice.\"\n\n\n The Law and Equity Court, while conceding that a proceeding under the recidivist statute was \"criminal\" and that in that proceeding the accused was entitled to most of the protections afforded defendants in criminal trials, concluded that petitioner was not entitled to have counsel appointed to assist him, since the proceeding was \"only connected with the measure of punishment for the last-committed crime.\" Cf. Fitzgerald v. Smyth, 194 Va. 681, 689-690, 74 S. E. 2d 810, 816.\n\nWe put to one side Gryger v. Burke, \n334 \nU.S. 728\n, on which the Virginia court relied. In that case, identity was the only issue and the specialized circumstances seemed to a majority not to require the appointment of counsel. Under the present recidivist statute, the situation is quite different. As we have seen, the \"existence\" of records of prior convictions of the kind described in the statute is an issue tendered in Virginia. We said of a like issue in Reynolds v. Cochran, \n365 \nU.S. 525, 531\n, \". . . if petitioner had been allowed the assistance of his counsel when he first asked for it, we cannot know that counsel could not have found defects in the 1934 conviction that would have precluded its admission in a multiple-offender \n\n[368 \nU.S. 443, 446]\n\u00a0\n proceeding.\" In that case we also pointed out that the issue of \"identity\" may at times present difficult local law issues, as for example \"whether the second-offender statute may be applied to reimprison a person who has completely satisfied the sentence imposed upon his second conviction and has been discharged from custody.\" Id., p. 532.\n\nIn Reynolds v. Cochran, supra, the accused had his own lawyer and only asked for a continuance. But the holding in the case applies equally to an accused faced with an information under Virginia's recidivist statute and who has no lawyer. It is \"The nature of the charge\" (Tomkins v. Missouri, \n323 \nU.S. 485, 488\n) that underlines the need for counsel. In trials of this kind the labyrinth of the law is, or may be, too intricate for the layman to master. Id., pp. 488-489; Williams v. Kaiser, \n323 \nU.S. 471, 474\n. Virginia has held that the validity of any of the prior convictions, used to bring the multiple-offender statute into play, may be inquired into. See, e. g., Wesley v. Commonwealth, 190 Va. 268, 272-274, 56 S. E. 2d 362, 364. These may involve judgments of conviction in any state or federal court in the Nation. Counsel, whom we appointed to represent petitioner here, has shown the wide variety of problems that may be tendered. In Virginia, a trial under this statute may present questions such as whether the courts rendering the prior judgments had jurisdiction over the offenses and over the defendant and whether these offenses were punishable by a penitentiary sentence. Wesley v. Commonwealth, supra, 190 Va., at 273, 56 S. E. 2d, at 364. In Virginia, a sentence in excess of the one the court rendering it had power to impose is \"void for the excess only.\" See Royster v. Smith, 195 Va. 228, 235, 77 S. E. 2d 855, 858-859. In Virginia, a court in considering whether the prior convictions afforded a proper basis on which to invoke the recidivist statute has considered whether, in a prior trial, \n\n[368 \nU.S. 443, 447]\n\u00a0\n the defendant was represented by counsel and whether it was a fair and impartial trial. Willoughby v. Smyth, 194 Va. 267, 271, 72 S. E. 2d 636, 639. In Virginia, a prior conviction that is on appeal may not be the proper basis for a recidivist charge. White v. Commonwealth, 79 Va. 611. And there appears to be a question whether two prior convictions rendered the same day or at the same term could both be used in a Virginia multiple-offender prosecution. Commonwealth v. Welsh, 4 Va. 57. See Dye v. Skeen, 135 W. Va. 90, 102-103, 62 S. E. 2d 681, 688-689.\n\nDouble jeopardy and ex post facto application of a law are also questions which, as indicated in Reynolds v. Cochran, supra, p. 529, may well be considered by an imaginative lawyer, who looks critically at the layer of prior convictions on which the recidivist charge rests. We intimate no opinion on whether any of the problems mentioned would arise on petitioner's trial nor, if so, whether any would have merit. We only conclude that a trial on a charge of being a habitual criminal is such a serious one (Chandler v. Fretag, \n348 \nU.S. 3\n), the issues presented under Virginia's statute so complex, and the potential prejudice resulting from the absence of counsel so great that the rule we have followed concerning the appointment of counsel in other types of criminal trials\n2\n is equally applicable here.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n [For opinion of MR.

Henry Kutz and Joseph Kovner.\n\nMartin D. Cohen argued the cause for respondent. With him on the briefs was Louis J. Cohen.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case concerns the deductibility as an expense for \"medical care,\" under 213 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C. 213, of rent paid by a taxpayer for an apartment in Florida, where he was ordered by his physician, as part of a regimen of medical treatment, to spend the winter months.\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 499, 500]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe taxpayer, now deceased, was an attorney practicing law in Newark, New Jersey. In December 1953, when he was 43 years of age and had suffered four heart attacks during the previous eight years, he was advised by a heart specialist to spend the winter season in a warm climate. The taxpayer, his wife, and his three-year-old daughter proceeded immediately to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where they resided for the ensuing three months in an apartment rented for $1,500. Two months of the succeeding winter were also spent in Fort Lauderdale in an apartment rented for $829.\n\nThe taxpayer claimed the two rental payments as deductible medical expenses in his 1954 and 1955 income tax returns. These deductions were disallowed in their entirety by the Commissioner.\n2\n The Tax Court reversed the Commissioner's determination to the extent of one-third of the deductions, finding that proportion of the total claimed attributable to the taxpayer's own living accommodations. The remaining two-thirds it attributed to the accommodations of his wife and child, whose presence, the Tax Court concluded, had not been shown to be necessary to the medical treatment of the taxpayer's illness. 33 T. C. 155.\n\nOn cross-appeals from the decision of the Tax Court, the Court of Appeals held, by a divided vote, that the full \n\n[369 \nU.S. 499, 501]\n\u00a0\n rental payments were deductible as expenses for \"medical care\" within the meaning of 213. 289 F.2d 291. Because of a subsequent contrary holding by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Carasso v. Commissioner, 292 F.2d 367, and the need for a uniform rule on the point, we granted certiorari to resolve the conflict. \n368 \nU.S. 912\n.\n\nThe Commissioner concedes that prior to the enactment of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 rental payments of the sort made by the taxpayer were recognized as deductible medical expenses. This was because 23 (x) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, though expressly authorizing deductions only for \"amounts paid for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease,\"\n3\n had been construed to include \"travel primarily for and essential to . . . the prevention or alleviation of a physical or mental defect or illness,\" Treasury Regulations 111, 29.23 (x)-1, and the cost of meals and lodging during such travel, I. T. 3786, 1946-1 Cum. Bull. 76. See, e. g., Stringham v. Commissioner, 12 T. C. 580, aff'd, 183 F.2d 597; Rev. Rule 55-261, 1955-1 Cum. Bull. 307.\n\nThe Commissioner maintains, however, that it was the purpose of Congress, in enacting 213 (e) (1) (A) of the 1954 Code, albeit in language identical to that used in 23 (x) of the 1939 Code (compare notes 1 and 3, supra), \n\n[369 \nU.S. 499, 502]\n\u00a0\n to deny deductions for all personal or living expenses incidental to medical treatment other than the cost of transportation of the patient alone, that exception having been expressly added by subdivision (B) to the definition of \"medical care\" in 213 (e) (1). Note 1, supra.\n\nWe consider the Commissioner's position unassailable in light of the congressional purpose explicitly revealed in the House and Senate Committee Reports on the bill. These reports, anticipating the precise situation now before us, state:\n\n \"Subsection (e) defines medical care to mean amounts paid for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of diseases or for the purpose of affecting any structure or function of the body (including amounts paid for accident or health insurance), or for transportation primarily for and essential to medical care. The deduction permitted for `transportation primarily for and essential to medical care' clarifies existing law in that it specifically excludes deduction of any meals and lodging while away from home receiving medical treatment. For example, if a doctor prescribes that a patient must go to Florida in order to alleviate specific chronic ailments and to escape unfavorable climatic conditions which have proven injurious to the health of the taxpayer, and the travel is prescribed for reasons other than the general improvement of a patient's health, the cost of the patient's transportation to Florida would be deductible but not his living expenses while there. However, if a doctor prescribed an appendectomy and the taxpayer chose to go to Florida for the operation not even his transportation costs would be deductible. The subsection is not intended otherwise to change the existing definitions of medical care, to deny the cost of ordinary \n\n[369 \nU.S. 499, 503]\n\u00a0\n ambulance transportation nor to deny the cost of food or lodging provided as part of a hospital bill.\" H. R. Rep. No. 1337, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. A60 (1954); S. Rep. No. 1622, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. 219-220 (1954).\n4\n (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n Since under the predecessor statute, as it had been construed, expenses for meals and lodging were deductible as expenses for \"medical care,\" it may well be true that the Committee Reports spoke in part inartistically when they referred to subsection (e) as a mere clarification of \"existing law,\" although it will be noted that the report also referred to what was being done as a pro tanto \"change\" in \"the existing definitions of medical care.\" Yet Congress' purpose to exclude such expenses as medical deductions under the new bill is unmistakable in these authoritative pronouncements, ibid.; cf. Budget Message of the President for the Fiscal Year 1955, H. R. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 499, 504]\n\u00a0\n Doc. No. 264, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. M17 (1954); Memorandum of Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation, 1 Senate Hearings on the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. 24 (1954); Memorandum of the Under Secretary of the Treasury, id., at 103. It is that factor which is of controlling importance here.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nWe need not consider whether we would be warranted in disregarding these unequivocal expressions of legislative intent if the statute were so written as to permit no reasonable construction other than that urged on behalf of the taxpayer. Compare Boston Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 41, 48\n; United States v. Dickerson, \n310 \nU.S. 554, 561\n-562; Harrison v. Northern Trust Co., \n317 \nU.S. 476, 479\n. See also Association of Westinghouse Salaried Employees v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., \n348 \nU.S. 437, 444\n. Even the initial decision of the Tax Court under the 1939 Code respecting the deductibility of similar expenses under 23 (x) recognized that the language of that statute was \"susceptible to a variety of conflicting interpretations,\" Stringham v. Commissioner, 12 T. C. 580, 583. The Tax Court's conclusion as to the meaning of 23 (x) of the earlier statute which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, 183 F.2d 579, and acquiesced in by the Commissioner, necessarily rested on what emerged from a study of the legislative history of \n\n[369 \nU.S. 499, 505]\n\u00a0\n that enactment. So too the conclusion in this case, which turns on the construction of the identical words re-enacted as part of 213, must be based on an examination of the legislative history of this provision of the 1954 Code. The Committee Reports foreclose any reading of that provision which would permit this taxpayer to take the rental payments for his Florida apartment as \"medical care\" deductions.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE DOUGLAS would affirm the judgment below for the reasons given by Judge Kalodner, 289 F.2d 291.\n\nMR.

C., at 157. The taxpayer also claimed in each of his tax returns a $250 deduction for his transportation between Newark and Fort Lauderdale. Although the Commissioner initially disallowed this deduction, he thereafter acquiesced in its allowance by the Tax Court.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Section 23 (x) was added to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 by 127 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1942, 56 Stat. 825. It provided, in pertinent part:\n\n\"[In computing net income there shall be allowed as deductions] . . . expenses paid during the taxable year, not compensated for by insurance or otherwise, for medical care of the taxpayer, his spouse, or a dependent . . . of the taxpayer. The term `medical care,' as used in this subsection, shall include amounts paid for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or for the purpose of affecting any structure or function of the body (including amounts paid for accident or health insurance).\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The substance of the rule set forth in both Reports has been embodied in the Treasury Regulations interpreting 213:\n\n\"(iv) Expenses paid for transportation primarily for and essential to the rendition of the medical care are expenses paid for medical care. However, an amount allowable as a deduction for \"transportation primarily for and essential to medical care' shall not include the cost of any meals and lodging while away from home receiving medical treatment. For example, if a doctor prescribes that a taxpayer go to a warm climate in order to alleviate a specific chronic ailment, the cost of meals and lodging while there would not be deductible. On the other hand, if the travel is undertaken merely for the general improvement of a taxpayer's health, neither the cost of transportation nor the cost of meals and lodging would be deductible. If a doctor prescribes an operation or other medical care, and the taxpayer chooses for purely personal considerations to travel to another locality (such as a resort area) for the operation or the other medical care, neither the cost of transportation nor the cost of meals and lodging (except where paid as part of a hospital bill) is deductible.\" Treasury Regulations on Income Tax (1954 Code) 1.213-1 (e) (1) (iv).\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The explicitness of the Committee Reports renders it unnecessary to consider the Commissioner's alternative argument that the statute on its face precludes these deductions because (1) 262 of the 1954 Code, 26 U.S.C. 262, allows no deductions for \"personal, living, or family expenses\" \"[e]xcept as otherwise expressly provided in this chapter,\" and (2) apart from the medical \"transportation\" expense provided in 213 (e) (1) (B), no other express exception can be found in the statute. And the equitable considerations which the respondent brings to bear in support of her construction of 213 are of course beside the point in this Court, since we must give the statute effect in accordance with the purpose so clearly manifested by Congress. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 499, 506]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","36":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCONTINENTAL CO. v. UNION CARBIDE(1962)\nNo. 304\nArgued: Decided: June 25, 1962\n\n\n\n\n Petitioners sued respondents under 4 of the Clayton Act to recover treble damages, alleging that respondents had violated 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act by conspiring to restrain, by monopolizing, and by attempting and conspiring to monopolize, trade and commerce in ferrovanadium and vanadium oxide. The jury brought in a verdict for respondents, and petitioners appealed, contending that the District Court erred in excluding various items of evidence, in giving certain instructions to the jury, in refusing to give other instructions and in other rulings. The Court of Appeals held that there was insufficient evidence to justify a jury's finding that respondents' illegal acts were the cause of petitioners' failure in the vanadium business and that, therefore, a verdict should have been directed for respondents. Held: The judgment is vacated and the case is remanded for a new trial. Pp. 691-710.\n\n 1. In concluding that there should have been a directed verdict for respondents, the Court of Appeals erred in failing to view the evidence in the light most favorable to petitioners and to give petitioners the benefit of all inferences which the evidence fairly supported; and it erred in holding that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that respondents' conduct in fact caused injury to petitioners' business. It was the jury's function to weigh the evidence and the inferences to be drawn therefrom and to come to an ultimate conclusion as to the facts. Pp. 696-702.\n\n\n 2. The District Court erred in rejecting petitioners' offer to prove that they had been excluded from the Canadian market by a wholly owned subsidiary of one of the respondents, which was acting as the exclusive purchasing agent for the wartime Office of Metals Controller of the Canadian Government, but which allegedly operated in this connection under the control and direction of its parent corporation for the purpose of carrying out the overall conspiracy to restrain and monopolize the vanadium industry in the United States. This offer of proof was relevant evidence of a violation of the Sherman Act charged in the complaint, and it was not inadmissible on the ground that the subsidiary corporation was acting as an arm of the Canadian Government. Pp. 702-708. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 690, 691]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n 3. The District Court committed several trial errors which should not be repeated in a new trial. Pp. 708-710.\n\n\n  (a) The District Court erred in charging the jury that, in the context of the facts alleged in this case, a conspiracy must be proved \"which was reasonably calculated to prejudice the public interest by unduly\" restraining trade and which was intended \"to injure the general public by\" restraining trade. P. 708.\n\n\n  (b) The District Court misinterpreted the law in defining \"monopolization\" and \"attempted monopolization\" in terms of \"conspiracy to monopolize,\" and this error was prejudicial rather than harmless. Pp. 708-709.\n\n\n  (c) The District Court erred in its persistent exclusion of evidence relating to the period before petitioners' entrance into the industry, since this evidence was clearly material to petitioners' charge that there was a conspiracy and monopolization in existence when they came into the industry and that they were eliminated in furtherance thereof. Pp. 709-710.\n\n\n 289 F.2d 86, judgment vacated and case remanded for new trial.\n\nJoseph L. Alioto argued the cause for petitioners.

With him on the briefs were Herbert W. Clark and Girvan Peck.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis is a private treble damage action under the antitrust laws.\n1\n Continental Ore Company, a partnership, \n\n[370 \nU.S. 690, 692]\n\u00a0\n and its individual partners, who were plaintiffs in the trial court, are petitioners here.\n2\n Henry J. Leir, the principal party in Continental, had engaged in the buying and selling of metals, including vanadium products, in Europe prior to 1938, in which year he immigrated to the United States. This case concerns his subsequent efforts in this country to build a successful business in the production and sale of vanadium.\n\nVanadium is a metal obtained from certain ores which, in this country, are mined principally on the Colorado plateau. The ore is processed at mills near the mines into a substance commonly known as vanadium oxide. The oxide is then transported to the East and converted into ferrovanadium,\n3\n which is purchased chiefly by steel companies for use as an alloy in hardening steels.\n\nThe defendants named in the complaint were Vanadium Corporation of America (VCA), a fully integrated miner and manufacturer of vanadium products, Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation (Carbide), and the following four wholly owned subsidiary corporations of the latter company: United States Vanadium Corporation (USV), engaged in mining vanadium ore and processing vanadium oxide; Electro Metallurgical Company (Electro Met), engaged in making ferrovanadium; Electro Metallurgical Sales Corporation (Electro Met Sales), engaged in the sale of vanadium oxide and ferrovanadium; and Electro Metallurgical Company of Canada, Ltd. (Electro Met of Canada), engaged in selling vanadium products in Canada. The complaint was filed on November 15, \n\n[370 \nU.S. 690, 693]\n\u00a0\n 1949, and service was had on VCA, Carbide and USV. There was no service on Electro Met, Electro Met Sales or Electro Met of Canada. Carbide acquired the assets of Electro Met and Electro Met Sales by dissolution or merger during the year 1949, prior to the filing of the complaint herein.\n\nThe complaint alleged that, beginning in about 1933, the defendants and others acting in concert with them violated 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act\n4\n by conspiring to restrain, by monopolizing, and by attempting and conspiring to monopolize, trade and commerce in ferrovanadium and vanadium oxide. The defendants were charged with purchasing and acquiring control over substantially all accessible vanadium-bearing ore deposits in the United States and substantially all vanadium oxide produced by others in the United States, with refusing to sell vanadium oxide to other potential producers of ferrovanadium, including Continental and its associates, with apportioning and dividing sales of ferrovanadium and vanadium oxide among themselves in certain proportions, with fixing identical prices for the sale of ferrovanadium and vanadium oxide and for the purchase of ore, and with making certain mutual arrangements whereby one or more Carbide subsidiaries supplied VCA with substantial quantities of vanadium oxide at preferential prices to VCA. The complaint stated that between 1933 and 1949 the defendants produced over \n\n[370 \nU.S. 690, 694]\n\u00a0\n 99% of all ferrovanadium and over 90% of all vanadium oxide produced in the United States and that during the same period the defendants sold over 99% of the ferrovanadium and vanadium oxide sold in this country.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nAccording to the complaint, as a proximate consequence of defendants' monopolistic and restrictive practices, independent producers and distributors of ferrovanadium and vanadium oxide, including Continental, were eliminated from the business. Specifically, the complaint detailed several efforts which Continental made to enter and maintain itself in the vanadium business, all of which were allegedly frustrated by defendants' Sherman Act violations: (1) In 1938, Continental negotiated a contract with Apex Smelting Company of Chicago whereby Apex was to build and operate a plant for the conversion of oxide to ferrovanadium by use of the aluminothermic process. Continental and Apex were to share the profits of this venture. On its part, Continental agreed to obtain raw materials for Apex and to sell the finished product. Operations under this contract began in the spring of 1940, but Apex terminated the agreement in 1942 allegedly because the illegal activities of defendants prevented the obtaining of a sufficient supply of vanadium oxide. (2) Meanwhile, Continental itself had begun to produce a compound called \"Van-Ex,\" composed of vanadium oxide and other materials, which was designed for direct introduction into the steel-making process without prior conversion to ferrovanadium. This venture was allegedly \n\n[370 \nU.S. 690, 695]\n\u00a0\n terminated in 1944 because of the difficulty of securing raw materials caused by defendants' unlawful practices, including the efforts of defendants to obtain ownership or control of the mines and mills of Continental's suppliers. (3) Continental had developed a business with a Canadian customer during 1942. When Electro Met Sales of Canada was appointed by the Canadian Government as the exclusive wartime agent to purchase and allocate vanadium for Canadian industries, that company, it is alleged, acting under the control and direction of its parent, Carbide, eliminated Continental entirely from the Canadian market and divided Continental's business solely between defendants. (4) Defendants in 1943, by open threats of reprisals, allegedly frustrated certain arrangements which Continental had with the Climax Molybdenum Corporation for the manufacture of ferrovanadium. (5) In January 1944, Continental contracted with Imperial Paper & Color Corporation for the processing by the latter of vanadium oxide and ferrovanadium. Continental agreed to act as sales agent for the output. The complaint charged that Imperial abandoned the contract at the end of 1944 because of the inability to secure raw materials and that Continental then left the vanadium business altogether, all as a result of the restrictive and monopolistic practices of the defendants.\n\nTrial was to a jury and a verdict was returned for defendants. Continental appealed, asserting error in the trial court's exclusion of various evidentiary items, in certain of the instructions given to the jury, in the refusal to give other instructions, and in other rulings of the trial court. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit announced that its task was to review the correctness of the judgment below, not the reasons therefor, and on that basis affirmed the judgment, 289 F.2d 86, holding that there was insufficient evidence to justify a jury finding \n\n[370 \nU.S. 690, 696]\n\u00a0\n that defendants' illegal acts were in fact the cause of Continental's failure in the vanadium business, and hence, that a verdict for defendants should have been directed. In reaching its decision, the court stated that it had considered not only all the evidence admitted by the trial judge, but also all the evidence offered by the plaintiffs which the trial judge excluded. The court did not deal with or rule upon any of the alleged trial errors relied upon by Continental, except for the issue relating to Continental's alleged exclusion from the Canadian market. Certiorari was granted, limited to issues which required examination in the light of previous decisions of this Court and which presented important questions under the antitrust laws. \n368 \nU.S. 886\n. We have concluded, for the reasons discussed hereafter, that the Court of Appeals' decision must be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial.\n\n\nI.\n\n\nThe Court of Appeals was, of course, bound to view the evidence in the light most favorable to Continental and to give it the benefit of all inferences which the evidence fairly supports, even though contrary inferences might reasonably be drawn.\n6\n From our examination of the \n\n[370 \nU.S. 690, 697]\n\u00a0\n rather extensive record, we have concluded that the Court of Appeals departed from this rule and erred in holding that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that respondents' conduct in fact caused injury to Continental's business.\n\nContinental's fundamental claim throughout was that inadequate supplies of vanadium oxide were available to it and its associates, and that respondents' alleged Sherman Act violations caused or contributed to this shortage. The Court of Appeals acknowledged the principle in antitrust cases that \"where the plaintiff proves a loss, and a violation by defendant of the antitrust laws of such a nature as to be likely to cause that type of loss, there are cases which say that the jury, as the trier of the facts, must be permitted to draw from this circumstantial evidence the inference that the necessary causal relation exists.\"\n7\n The court also assumed that the evidence was \n\n[370 \nU.S. 690, 698]\n\u00a0\n adequate to support a jury finding that respondents committed the alleged violations of the Sherman Act and that the specific acts charged to have been done by respondents were performed as part of the basic plan to monopolize the vanadium market. Nor did the court take express issue with the averments that adequate supplies of vanadium oxide were unavailable to Continental during certain periods or with the argument that a shortage of vanadium oxide was the type of consequence that would reasonably be expected to flow from a conspiratorial and monopolistic arrangement controlling 99% of the ferrovanadium and vanadium oxide sold in this country. The court nevertheless concluded, in effect, that before there could be a sufficient showing of any shortage of vanadium oxide, or at least before the jury could be permitted to infer that any such lack of material was chargeable to respondents, Continental was required to demonstrate both that it made timely demands for oxide from respondents and that it exhausted all other possible sources of that material.\n\nThe court then examined seriatim the Apex, Van-Ex, Climax, Canadian and Imperial ventures and ruled separately upon the respondents' alleged damage to Continental in connection with each of these episodes. As to Apex and Imperial, it was said that Continental's demands for oxide from respondents were not sufficiently contemporaneous with the failure of these ventures to subject respondents to liability. As to the Van-Ex period, respondents were blameless not because oxide had not been requested from them but because Continental failed, in the court's view, to exhaust at least one other available source. The Canadian and Climax issues were disposed of on different grounds.\n\nIt is apparent from the foregoing that the Court of Appeals approached Continental's claims as if they were five completely separate and unrelated lawsuits. We \n\n[370 \nU.S. 690, 699]\n\u00a0\n think this was improper. In cases such as this, plaintiffs should be given the full benefit of their proof without tightly compartmentalizing the various factual components and wiping the slate clean after scrutiny of each. \". . . [T]he character and effect of a conspiracy are not to be judged by dismembering it and viewing its separate parts, but only by looking at it as a whole. United States v. Patten, \n226 \nU.S. 525, 544\n . . .; and in a case like the one before us, the duty of the jury was to look at the whole picture and not merely at the individual figures in it.\" American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 147 F.2d 93, 106 (C. A. 6th Cir.). See Montague & Co. v. Lowry, \n193 \nU.S. 38, 45\n-46.\n\nFurthermore, we do not believe that respondents' liability under the antitrust laws can be measured by any rigid or mechanical formula requiring Continental both to demand materials from respondents and to exhaust all other sources of supply. The Court of Appeals appears to have accorded no weight to Continental's evidence which was offered to show that respondents had interfered with, acquired, or destroyed the several small independent sources of vanadium oxide relied upon by Continental. Under the criteria used by the Court of Appeals, respondents could, with impunity, concertedly refuse to deal with Continental while the latter was able to obtain some oxide from independent sources, then proceed at their leisure to dry up those other sources, and finally insist that Continental make repeated demands for respondents' oxide before incurring antitrust liability. The cases relied upon by the Court of Appeals\n8\n clearly do not support any such formula and we cannot deem the injury \n\n[370 \nU.S. 690, 700]\n\u00a0\n alleged to flow from a monopolist's elimination of one's independent suppliers to be so \"remote\" as to justify refusing to let the damages issue go to the jury.\n9\n\u00a0\n\nOur review of the record discloses sufficient evidence for a jury to infer the necessary causal connection between respondents' antitrust violations and petitioners' injury. In concluding that Continental and Apex had not made sufficient efforts to obtain vanadium oxide from respondents, the Court of Appeals either overlooked or interpreted into insignificance the repeated approaches made to respondents by Continental and Apex in July and October of 1939, in March and October of 1940 and in June and July of 1941. The court also failed to notice certain communications from Apex in September and December 1941, saying that it could operate at only partial capacity due to the lack of raw materials. Nor did the court mention the testimony of an officer of Apex to the effect that Apex's supply of oxide was irregular and intermittent and that the unavailability of oxide was one of the reasons that Apex did not operate at full capacity. According to the Court of Appeals, the \"critical period\" during which Continental and Apex should have demanded materials from the respondents was the year preceding the termination of the Apex contract, which the court placed in June 1942. But it is quite plain from the record that Apex notified Continental of its determination to terminate the contract in January and February of 1942, which followed much more closely the previous refusals of respondents to deal with Continental and Apex.\n\nUndoubtedly, all of the evidence during this period does not point in one direction and different inferences might reasonably be drawn from it. There was, however, sufficient evidence to go to the jury and it is the jury \n\n[370 \nU.S. 690, 701]\n\u00a0\n which \"weighs the contradictory evidence and inferences\" and draws \"the ultimate conclusion as to the facts.\" Tennant v. Peoria & P. U. R. Co., \n321 \nU.S. 29, 35\n.\n\nDuring the so-called Van-Ex period, the court did not exculpate respondents because of petitioners' failure to request oxide from them but because petitioners supposedly failed to take advantage of an independent source of supplies. But the evidence relied upon by the court can just as reasonably be read in a manner favorable to Continental and it appears that the court may have misapprehended significant parts of this record.\n10\n In any event, the interpretation and significance of this evidence were for the jury.\n\nThe Court of Appeals also concluded that the respondents did not contribute to the failure of Imperial to produce ferrovanadium under its contract with Continental. The court acknowledged, and there appears to be substantial evidence to this effect, that Imperial's decision was based upon its concern about a steady and reliable \n\n[370 \nU.S. 690, 702]\n\u00a0\n source of raw materials. Continental had requested VCA and USV to provide sizable monthly supplies of oxide in November of 1943, but the Court of Appeals bracketed this evidence with the Van-Ex period even though the testimony clearly was that the supplies then sought were for the Imperial arrangement which was then being negotiated. Imperial, after signing the contract, carefully surveyed foreign sources of vanadium, concluded they were inadequate and determined not to go into production because a reliable, long-range source of oxide was not available. In spite of the refusal of respondents to deal with Continental in November 1943 and in previous months and years, and in spite of the assumed monopolistic control of almost all of the vanadium oxide in the United States, the court ruled that Continental must have requested oxide from respondents after the contract with Imperial was signed in January of 1944. We think the jury should be allowed to determine whether respondents' conduct materially contributed to the failure of the Imperial venture, to Continental's damage.\n\n\nII.\n\n\nContinental's alleged elimination from the Canadian market raises different issues. At the trial Continental introduced evidence to show that beginning in March 1942, it had shipped Van-Ex to a Canadian customer each month during the remainder of that year. There was then received in evidence a letter dated January 19, 1943, from Continental to Electro Met in New York City reciting that the new allocation system in Canada\n11\n had eliminated \n\n[370 \nU.S. 690, 703]\n\u00a0\n Continental from the Canadian market in January, that Continental had inquired about the matter from the Metals Controller for the Canadian Government and that the latter had referred Continental to Electro Met. The court then struck this letter from the record and rejected petitioners' offer to prove that Continental was excluded from the Canadian market by Electro Met of Canada, a wholly owned subsidiary corporation of Carbide, acting as exclusive purchasing agent for the Metals Controller but allegedly operating in this connection under the control and direction of Carbide for the purpose of carrying out the overall conspiracy to restrain and monopolize the vanadium industry. To that end, Continental offered to prove that its former share of the Canadian market was divided between Carbide and VCA. Continental offered various correspondence with Electro Met of Canada and a memorandum and proposed testimony by Continental's vice president concerning his conversations with an employee of Electro Met who had communicated with Continental in response to Continental's letter of January 19, 1943, to Electro Met. The court denied the entire offer of proof \"for the reason that this is a transaction wholly in the hands of the Canadian Government and that whether or not this plaintiff was permitted to sell his material to a customer in Canada was a matter wholly within the control of the Canadian Government.\" \n\n[370 \nU.S. 690, 704]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Court of Appeals agreed with the trial court and concluded that Continental was not legally entitled to recover from respondents for the destruction of its Canadian business. The court said that no vanadium oxide could be imported into Canada by anyone other than the Canadian Government's agent, Electro Met of Canada, which refused to purchase from the petitioners. Thus, according to the court, \"even if we assume that Electro Metallurgical Company of Canada, Ltd., acted for the purpose of entrenching the monopoly position of the defendants in the United States, it was acting as an arm of the Canadian Government, and we do not see how such efforts as appellants claim defendants took to persuade and influence the Canadian Government through its agent are within the purview of the Sherman Act.\" 289 F.2d, at 94. This ruling was erroneous and we hold that Continental's offer of proof was relevant evidence of a violation of the Sherman Act as charged in the complaint and was not inadmissible on the grounds stated by the courts below.\n\nRespondents say that American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co., \n213 \nU.S. 347\n, shields them from liability. This Court there held that an antitrust plaintiff could not collect damages from a defendant who had allegedly influenced a foreign government to seize plaintiff's properties. But in the light of later cases in this Court respondents' reliance upon American Banana is misplaced. A conspiracy to monopolize or restrain the domestic or foreign commerce of the United States is not outside the reach of the Sherman Act just because part of the conduct complained of occurs in foreign countries. United States v. American Tobacco Co., \n221 \nU.S. 106\n; United States v. Pacific & Arctic R. & Navigation Co., \n228 \nU.S. 87\n; Thomsen v. Cayser, \n243 \nU.S. 66\n; United States v. Sisal Sales Corp., \n274 \nU.S. 268\n. Cf. Steele v. Bulova Watch Co., \n344 \nU.S. 280\n; Branch v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 141 F.2d 31 \n\n[370 \nU.S. 690, 705]\n\u00a0\n (C. A. 7th Cir.). See United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, 148 F.2d 416 (C. A. 2d Cir.); United States v. National Lead Co., 63 F. Supp. 513 (D.C. S. D. N. Y.), aff'd, \n332 \nU.S. 319\n.\n12\n\u00a0\n\nFurthermore, in the Sisal case, supra, a combination entered into within the United States to monopolize an article of commerce produced abroad was held to violate the Sherman Act even though the defendants' control of that production was aided by discriminatory legislation of the foreign country which established an official agency as the sole buyer of the product from the producers and even though one of the defendants became the exclusive selling agent of that governmental authority. Since the activities of the defendants had an impact within the United States and upon its foreign trade, American Banana was expressly held not to be controlling.\n13\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 690, 706]\n\u00a0\n\n\nOlsen v. Smith, \n195 \nU.S. 332\n; United States v. Rock Royal Co-op, \n307 \nU.S. 533\n; and Parker v. Brown, \n317 \nU.S. 341\n, do not help respondents. These decisions, each of which sustained the validity of mandatory state or federal governmental regulations against a claim of antitrust illegality, are wide of the mark. In the present case petitioners do not question the validity of any action taken by the Canadian Government or by its Metals Controller. Nor is there left in the case any question of the liability of the Canadian Government's agent, for Electro Met of Canada was not served. What the petitioners here contend is that the respondents are liable for actions which they themselves jointly took, as part of their unlawful conspiracy, to influence or to direct the elimination of Continental from the Canadian market. As in Sisal, the conspiracy was laid in the United States, was effectuated both here and abroad, and respondents are not insulated by the fact that their conspiracy involved some acts by the agent of a foreign government.\n\nFrom the evidence which petitioners offered it appears that Continental complained to the Canadian Metals Controller that Continental had lost its Canadian business. The Controller referred Continental to one of the respondents. But there is no indication that the Controller or any other official within the structure of the Canadian Government approved or would have approved of joint efforts to monopolize the production and sale of vanadium or directed that purchases from Continental be stopped. The exclusion, Continental claims, resulted from the action of Electro Met of Canada, taken within the area of its discretionary powers granted by the Metals Controller and in concert with or under the direction of the respondents. The offer of proof at least presented an issue for the jury's resolution as to whether the loss of Continental's Canadian business was occasioned by respondents' activities. Respondents are afforded no \n\n[370 \nU.S. 690, 707]\n\u00a0\n defense from the fact that Electro Met of Canada, in carrying out the bare act of purchasing vanadium from respondents rather than Continental, was acting in a manner permitted by Canadian law. There is nothing to indicate that such law in any way compelled discriminatory purchasing, and it is well settled that acts which are in themselves legal lose that character when they become constituent elements of an unlawful scheme. Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 375, 396\n; American Tobacco Co. v. United States, \n328 \nU.S. 781, 809\n; Steele v. Bulova Watch Co., \n344 \nU.S. 280, 287\n. See Georgia v. Pennsylvania R. Co., \n324 \nU.S. 439, 457\n-458; Slick Airways v. American Airlines, 107 F. Supp. 199, 207 (D.C. N. J.).\n\nThe case of Eastern Railroad Presidents Conf. v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., \n365 \nU.S. 127\n, cited by the court below and much relied upon by respondents here, is plainly inapposite. The Court there held not cognizable under the Sherman Act a complaint charging, in essence, that the defendants had engaged in a concerted publicity campaign to foster the adoption of laws and law enforcement practices inimical to plaintiff's business. Finding no basis for imputing to the Sherman Act a purpose to regulate political activity, a purpose which would have encountered serious constitutional barriers, the Court ruled the defendants' activities to be outside the ban of the Act \"at least insofar as those activities comprised mere solicitation of governmental action with respect to the passage and enforcement of laws.\" \n365 \nU.S., at 138\n. In this case, respondents' conduct is wholly dissimilar to that of the defendants in Noerr. Respondents were engaged in private commercial activity, no element of which involved seeking to procure the passage or enforcement of laws. To subject them to liability under the Sherman Act for eliminating a competitor from the Canadian market by exercise of the discretionary power \n\n[370 \nU.S. 690, 708]\n\u00a0\n conferred upon Electro Met of Canada by the Canadian Government would effectuate the purposes of the Sherman Act and would not remotely infringe upon any of the constitutionally protected freedoms spoken of in Noerr.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nSince our decision concerning the alleged loss of Continental's Canadian business will in any event require a new trial of the entire case in view of the close interconnection between the Canadian and domestic issues, we shall remand the case to the District Court for further proceedings. We therefore deem it appropriate to pass upon certain of the alleged trial errors raised by Continental in the Court of Appeals but not considered by that court. In passing upon these issues, we are not to be understood as expressing any views on the merits of those matters raised by Continental before the Court of Appeals but not discussed here.\n\nAn error committed by the trial court, perhaps understandable because the trial preceded this Court's decision in Klor's, Inc., v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc., \n359 \nU.S. 207\n, was the \"public injury\" charge. Although petitioners pleaded a concerted refusal to deal with them by respondents, a price-fixing conspiracy, and an allocation of customers, all per se violations under 1 of the Sherman Act, the court charged the jury that a conspiracy must be proved \"which was reasonably calculated to prejudice the public interest by unduly\" restraining trade, and which was intended \"to injure the general public by\" restraining trade. Under the rule stated in Klor's, this charge was error.\n\nThe trial court also erred in its treatment of monopolization. Initially, in its charge to the jury, the court defined \"monopolize\" as referring to \"the joint acquisition or maintenance by the members of the conspiracy formed for that purpose, of the power to control and dominate \n\n[370 \nU.S. 690, 709]\n\u00a0\n interstate trade and commerce in a commodity to such an extent that they are able, as a group, to exclude actual or potential competitors from the field, accompanied with the intention and purpose to exercise such power.\" The court also related its definition of \"attempt to monopolize\" to action taken by a combination or conspiracy. The jury was further instructed that \"an essential element of the illegal monopoly or monopolization is the existence of a combination or conspiracy to acquire and maintain the power\" and that a verdict must be returned for the defendants \"if you find that the plaintiffs have not proved that there was . . . a conspiracy.\" Petitioners duly excepted to the charge on the ground that they were entitled to prevail if they could prove that either respondent monopolized unilaterally.\n\nPetitioners' complaint did not preclude reliance on unilateral monopolization and the evidence offered was relevant and material to such a charge. The trial court's misinterpretation of the law in defining \"monopolization\" and \"attempted monopolization\" in terms of \"conspiracy to monopolize\" was therefore prejudicial rather than harmless. This error should not be repeated in a new trial.\n14\n\u00a0\n\nThe trial court further erred in its persistent exclusion of evidence relating to the pre-1938 period, on the ground that since Mr. Leir came to this country in 1938 nothing which transpired earlier could be relevant to his suit. Petitioners sought to introduce evidence that the conspiracy and monopolization alleged began in the early 1930's, that overt acts in furtherance thereof \n\n[370 \nU.S. 690, 710]\n\u00a0\n occurred in the 1930's, and that it was pursuant to this anticompetitive scheme that respondents sought to and did eliminate petitioners from the vanadium industry after 1938. This evidence was clearly material to petitioners' charge that there was a conspiracy and monopolization in existence when they came into the industry, and that they were eliminated in furtherance thereof.\n15\n We do not mean that a trial court may not place reasonable limits upon such evidence or set a reasonable cut-off date, evidence before which point is to be considered too remote to have sufficient probative value to justify burdening the record with it.\n16\n But that was not the basis for this exclusionary ruling.\n\nWe conclude that the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be vacated and the case remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The action was brought under 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 15:\n\n\"Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor in any district court of the United States . . . and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The partnership is the successor in interest to Continental Ore Corporation, organized in 1938 but later dissolved.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] During the years in question here the conversion was accomplished by respondents in electric furnaces.

According to petitioners' evidence, the Carbide group produced approximately 77% of domestic vanadium oxide, while VCA produced about 65% of ferrovanadium.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] As Professor Moore has indicated, \"In ruling on the motion [for directed verdict] the trial court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the party against whom the motion is made.

But in October 1943, Nisley & Wilson was entirely engaged in processing ore furnished by the Government and its vanadium oxide product was obtainable only through allocation by the War Production Board. The correspondence between Nisley & Wilson and Continental was looking toward a postwar relationship, and Continental's letter might well be interpreted by a jury not as a refusal to buy but as a statement of intention by Continental to cooperate with Nisley & Wilson to keep the latter's mill running during peacetime. As for the 300,000 pounds of \"oxide\" which the court said was offered to Continental, the material actually was ore, not oxide. Furthermore, Nisley & Wilson did not own the ore and failed in its effort to buy it from the Government.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] Canada's entry into World War II prompted the Canadian Government to take extraordinary measures to assure optimum availability of strategic materials to Canadian private industries engaged in the war effort. Pursuant to these measures, the Office of Metals Controller was established and given broad powers to regulate the \n\n[370 \nU.S. 690, 703]\n\u00a0\n procurement of the materials and to allocate them to industrial users. See Order of the Governor General in Council, P. C. 3187, July 15, 1940. The Metals Controller enlisted the aid of Electro Met of Canada in early 1943, delegating to it the discretionary agency power to purchase and allocate to Canadian industries all vanadium products required by them. The validity of these wartime measures and delegations under Canadian law is not here contested. Cf. Reference Re Regulations (Chemicals) Under War Measures Act, 1 D. L.

UNITED STATES(1962)\nNo. 157\nArgued: December 12, 1961Decided: April 30, 1962\n\n\n\n\n Tried and convicted in a Federal District Court, petitioner applied to that Court under 28 U.S.C. 1915 for leave to appeal in forma pauperis. The District Court denied the application and certified that the appeal was not in good faith. Petitioner then filed a similar application in the Court of Appeals, which appointed counsel for petitioner. Such counsel filed a memorandum in support of the application, contending, inter alia, that the indictment had been procured by perjured testimony and that petitioner had been unable to prove this charge because of the refusal of the District Court to permit him to examine the transcript of the grand jury proceedings. The Court of Appeals ordered that a transcript of the trial proceedings be furnished to petitioner and that the application to appeal in forma pauperis otherwise be held in abeyance. After the transcript had been prepared, the Government filed a detailed memorandum opposing the application and petitioner filed another memorandum based upon the transcript, urging the same questions and others which he claimed showed that his appeal was not frivolous. After considering the petition and the memoranda in support and in opposition, but without hearing arguments, the Court of Appeals denied the petition without opinion. Held: The summary disposition of petitioner's application was not justified. Pp. 440-454.\n\n (a) A person convicted in a Federal District Court of a federal offense is entitled to appeal as a matter of right, and he need not petition the Court of Appeals for the exercise of its discretion to allow him to bring the case before it. Pp. 441-442.\n\n\n (b) If a defendant is unable to pay the fee for docketing his appeal in the Court of Appeals or to pay the cost of preparing a transcript of the record of the proceedings in the trial court, he cannot perfect his appeal except by applying under 28 U.S.C. 1915 for leave to appeal in forma pauperis. Pp. 442-444.\n\n\n (c) The sole statutory language to guide the District Court in passing upon such an application is that, \"An appeal may not be taken in forma pauperis if the trial court certifies in writing that it is not taken in good faith.\" P. 444. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 438, 439]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n (d) The requirement that an appeal in forma pauperis be taken \"in good faith\" is satisfied when the defendant seeks appellate review of any issue that is not frivolous. Pp. 444-445.\n\n\n (e) When a defendant applies to a Court of Appeals for leave to proceed in forma pauperis, the District Court's certification that the application is not \"in good faith\" is entitled to weight; but it is not conclusive. Pp. 445-446.\n\n\n (f) If it appears from the face of the papers filed in the Court of Appeals that the applicant will present issues for review which are not clearly frivolous, the Court of Appeals should grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis, appoint counsel to represent the appellant and proceed to consideration of the appeal on the merits in the same manner that it considers paid appeals. P. 446.\n\n\n (g) If the claims made or the issues sought to be raised by the applicant are such that their substance cannot adequately be ascertained from the face of the application, the Court of Appeals must provide the would-be appellant with the assistance of counsel and with a transcript of the record sufficient to enable him to attempt to make a showing that the District Court's certificate of lack of good faith is erroneous. P. 446.\n\n\n (h) If, with such aid, the applicant then presents any issue for the court's consideration which is not clearly frivolous, leave to proceed in forma pauperis must be granted. P. 446.\n\n\n (i) An indigent defendant is entitled in all respects to the same right of appeal as a defendant who is able to pay the expenses of his appeal. Pp. 446-447.\n\n\n (j) On an application for leave to appeal in forma pauperis, the burden is not on the applicant to show that his appeal has merit in the sense that he is bound, or even likely, to prevail ultimately; the burden is on the Government to show that the appeal is so lacking in merit that the court would dismiss the case as frivolous on the Government's motion had the case been docketed and had a record been filed by an appellant able to pay the expenses of complying with these requirements. Pp. 447-448.\n\n\n (k) If it is the practice of a Court of Appeals to defer rulings on motions to dismiss paid appeals until the court has had the benefit of hearing argument and considering briefs and an adequate record, it must accord the same procedural rights to a person applying for leave to proceed in forma pauperis. P. 448.\n\n\n (l) In passing upon applications for leave to appeal in forma pauperis, the Courts of Appeals should have due regard for the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 438, 440]\n\u00a0\n facts that Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 39 (d) requires that, in setting appeals for argument, preference shall be given by the Courts of Appeals to appeals in criminal cases and that the purpose of this requirement is to meet the need for speedy disposition of such cases. Pp. 448-450.\n\n\n (m) Although there have been many proceedings and much delay in disposing of this case, the petitioner has not yet received the plenary review of his conviction to which he is entitled, since he has not yet received the benefits of presenting either oral argument or full briefs on the merits to the Court of Appeals. Pp. 450-453.\n\n\n (n) On the record in this case taken as a whole, it cannot be said that petitioner's claims are so frivolous as to justify the summary disposition of his case which was ordered below. Pp. 450-454.\n\n\n Judgment vacated and case remanded for further proceedings.\n\nBennett Boskey argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner.\n\nCarl W. Belcher argued the cause for the United States. On the brief were Solicitor General Cox, Assistant Attorney General Miller, Beatrice Rosenberg and Sidney M. Glazer.\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nTried and convicted in a Federal District Court for an offense against the United States, petitioner applied for leave to appeal his conviction to the Court of Appeals in forma pauperis. His application was denied. The case presents this question: What standard is to be applied by the lower federal courts in passing upon such applications? The articulation of a usable standard has been the source of considerable recent litigation.\n1\n And, while \n\n[369 \nU.S. 438, 441]\n\u00a0\n we recognize that no single word or group of words can provide a precise formula that will dispose of every case, we think it appropriate to indicate in somewhat greater detail than in the past, the approach a Court of Appeals must take toward an indigent's application for leave to take a direct appeal from his criminal conviction in forma pauperis.\n\nStatutory provision for litigation in forma pauperis in the federal courts is made by 28 U.S.C. 1915, authorizing \"[a]ny court of the United States\" to allow indigent persons to prosecute, defend or appeal suits without prepayment of costs. Before discussing our understanding of the proper manner in which a Court of Appeals is to exercise its authority to allow a criminal appeal in forma pauperis, we believe it would be helpful to indicate briefly the law applicable to criminal appeals generally. The provisions of 1915 can be understood and applied in such cases only when read together with the other provisions of the Judicial Code and the Federal Rules governing criminal appeals.\n\nPresent federal law has made an appeal from a District Court's judgment of conviction in a criminal case what is, in effect, a matter of right.\n2\n That is, a defendant has a right to have his conviction reviewed by a Court of Appeals, and need not petition that court for an exercise \n\n[369 \nU.S. 438, 442]\n\u00a0\n of its discretion to allow him to bring the case before the court. The only requirements a defendant must meet for perfecting his appeal are those expressed as time limitations within which various procedural steps must be completed. First, a timely notice of appeal must be filed in the District Court to confer jurisdiction upon the Court of Appeals over the case.\n3\n Subsequently, designations of the transcript, a record on appeal and briefs must be filed in the appropriate forum.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nThe indigent defendant will generally experience no material difficulty in filing a timely notice of appeal.\n5\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 438, 443]\n\u00a0\n But thereafter he is immediately faced with court fees for docketing his appeal in the Court of Appeals and with the cost of preparing the record, including a stenographic transcript of at least portions of the trial proceedings.\n6\n If he is unable to meet either or both of these expenses, he can perfect his appeal only by applying for leave to appeal in forma pauperis. The application, to be made to the District Court in which the defendant was convicted,\n7\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 438, 444]\n\u00a0\n must conform to the requirements of 28 U.S.C. 1915 (a) and include, in affidavit form, the defendant's representations of poverty, a statement of the case, and his belief that he is entitled to redress. The sole statutory language by which the District Court is guided in passing upon the application provides \"[a]n appeal may not be taken in forma pauperis if the trial court certifies in writing that it is not taken in good faith.\" 28 U.S.C. 1915 (a).\n\nWhat meaning should be placed on the \"good faith\" of which the statute speaks? In the context of a criminal appeal, we do not believe it can be read to require a District Court to determine whether the would-be appellant seeks further review of his case in subjective good faith, i. e., good faith from his subjective point of view.\n8\n Such \n\n[369 \nU.S. 438, 445]\n\u00a0\n a construction would deprive the legislation of sensible meaning, there probably being no convicted defendant who would not sincerely wish a Court of Appeals to review his conviction. Further, a subjective standard might suggest that only persons who, in good conscience, could insist on their innocence, are to be entitled to a review of their convictions without payment of costs. We believe this interpretation of the statute is not required by reason nor is it consistent with the sound administration of criminal justice in the federal courts. We hold, instead, that \"good faith\" in this context must be judged by an objective standard. We consider a defendant's good faith in this type of case demonstrated when he seeks appellate review of any issue not frivolous. In so doing, we note that if in forma pauperis litigation is attempted for reasons that may genuinely be characterized as the litigant's \"bad faith,\" express authority exists in 28 U.S.C. 1915 (d) for dismissal of the cause as frivolous.\n9\n\u00a0\n\nIf the District Court finds the application is not in good faith, and therefore denies leave to appeal in forma pauperis, the defendant may seek identical relief from the Court of Appeals.\n10\n In considering such an application \n\n[369 \nU.S. 438, 446]\n\u00a0\n addressed to it, the Court of Appeals will have before it what is usually the pro se pleading of a layman and the certificate of a district judge that the applicant lacks \"good faith\" in seeking appellate review. The District Court's certificate is not conclusive, although it is, of course, entitled to weight.\n11\n However, we have recognized that the materials before the Court of Appeals at this stage of the proceedings are generally inadequate for passing upon the defendant's application. Nevertheless, if from the face of the papers he has filed, it is apparent that the applicant will present issues for review not clearly frivolous, the Court of Appeals should then grant leave to appeal in forma pauperis, appoint counsel to represent the appellant and proceed to consideration of the appeal on the merits in the same manner that it considers paid appeals. If, on the other hand, the claims made or the issues sought to be raised by the applicant are such that their substance cannot adequately be ascertained from the face of the defendant's application, the Court of Appeals must provide the would-be appellant with both the assistance of counsel and a record of sufficient completeness to enable him to attempt to make a showing that the District Court's certificate of lack of \"good faith\" is in error and that leave to proceed with the appeal in forma pauperis should be allowed.\n12\n If, with such aid, the applicant then presents any issue for the court's consideration not clearly frivolous, leave to proceed in forma pauperis must be allowed.\n\nIn so holding we have been impelled by considerations beyond the corners of 28 U.S.C. 1915, considerations that it is our duty to assure to the greatest degree possible, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 438, 447]\n\u00a0\n within the statutory framework for appeals created by Congress, equal treatment for every litigant before the bar.\n13\n We have expressed this view in a case comparable to the one before us here by holding that\n\n\"[u]nless the issues raised [by the indigent seeking leave to appeal in forma pauperis] are so frivolous that the appeal would be dismissed in the case of a nonindigent litigant, Fed. Rules Crim. Proc. 39 (a), the request of an indigent for leave to appeal in forma pauperis must be allowed.\" Ellis v. United States, \n356 \nU.S. 674, 675\n.\n\n\n The point of equating the test for allowing a pauper's appeal to the test for dismissing paid cases, is to assure equality of consideration for all litigants. The equation is intended to place the burdens of proof and persuasion in all cases on the same party - in these cases, on the Government. Since our statutes and rules make an appeal in a criminal case a matter of right, the burden of showing that that right has been abused through the prosecution \n\n[369 \nU.S. 438, 448]\n\u00a0\n of frivolous litigation should, at all times, be on the party making the suggestion of frivolity. It is not the burden of the petitioner to show that his appeal has merit, in the sense that he is bound, or even likely, to prevail ultimately. He is to be heard, as is any appellant in a criminal case, if he makes a rational argument on the law or facts. It is the burden of the Government, in opposing an attempted criminal appeal in forma pauperis, to show that the appeal is lacking in merit, indeed, that it is so lacking in merit that the court would dismiss the case on motion of the Government, had the case been docketed and a record been filed by an appellant able to afford the expense of complying with those requirements.\n14\n If it were the practice of a Court of Appeals to screen the paid appeals on its docket for frivolity, without hearing oral argument, reviewing a record of the trial proceedings or considering full briefs, paupers could, of course, be bound by the same rules. But, if the practice of the Court of Appeals is to defer rulings on motions to dismiss paid appeals until the court has had the benefit of hearing argument and considering briefs and an adequate record, we hold it must no less accord the poor person the same procedural rights.\n\nTwo additional factors have relevance to our view of the proper disposition of motions for leave to perfect criminal appeals in forma pauperis. These factors are the foundation for Rule 39 (d) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, specifying that preference shall be given by the Courts of Appeals to criminal cases. This Rule, first, acknowledges the importance to the sovereign, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 438, 449]\n\u00a0\n to the accused and to society of a criminal prosecution. When society acts to deprive one of its members of his life, liberty or property, it takes its most awesome steps. No general respect for, nor adherence to, the law as a whole can well be expected without judicial recognition of the paramount need for prompt, eminently fair and sober criminal law procedures. The methods we employ in the enforcement of our criminal law have aptly been called the measures by which the quality of our civilization may be judged.\n15\n Second, the preference to be accorded criminal appeals recognizes the need for speedy disposition of such cases. Delay in the final judgment of conviction, including its appellate review, unquestionably erodes the efficacy of law enforcement.\n\nBoth of these considerations are particularly pertinent to criminal appeals in forma pauperis. Statistics compiled in the court below illustrate the undeniable fact that as many meritorious criminal cases come before that court through applications for leave to proceed in forma pauperis as on the paid docket, and that no a priori justification can be found for considering them, as a class, to be more frivolous than those in which costs have been paid.\n16\n Even-handed administration of the criminal law \n\n[369 \nU.S. 438, 450]\n\u00a0\n demands that these cases be given no less consideration than others on the courts' dockets. Particularly since litigants in forma pauperis may, in the trial court, have suffered disadvantages in the defense of their cases inherent in their impecunious condition, is appellate review of their cases any less searching than that accorded paid appeals inappropriate. Indigents' appeals from criminal convictions cannot be used as a convenient valve for reducing the pressures of work on the courts. If there are those who insist on pursuing frivolous litigation, the courts are not powerless to dismiss or otherwise discourage it. But if frivolous litigation exists, we are not persuaded that it is concentrated in this narrow, yet vital, area of judicial duty.\n\nSimilarly, statistics demonstrate the inevitable delay that surrounds a procedure in which the courts give piecemeal attention to the series of motions that indigents must make before a final adjudication of the merits of their cases is reached. Delays described in years between trial and final decision in criminal cases are the unhappy result of separate considerations of motions for the appointment of counsel, for the preparation of a transcript of the trial proceedings and, ultimately, for the leave to appeal in forma pauperis. The case before us illustrates the point. Petitioner was indicted on June 16, 1958, for offenses alleged to have been committed in early December 1957. He was first tried and convicted in December 1958. Leave to appeal in forma pauperis was \n\n[369 \nU.S. 438, 451]\n\u00a0\n granted by the District Court, and on June 23, 1959, the Court of Appeals reversed the conviction and remanded the case for a new trial. 106 U.S. App. D.C. 275, 272 F.2d 504. In October 1959, new counsel was appointed by the District Court to represent petitioner at his second trial. Pre-trial motions were argued in the District Court in December 1959 and January 1960, and petitioner's trial took place in the first week of March 1960. Petitioner was convicted and then sentenced on March 11, 1960. On March 22, 1960, the District Court denied an application for leave to appeal in forma pauperis. An application for leave to appeal in forma pauperis was then directed to the Court of Appeals, and was filed in that court on April 15, 1960. On April 20, that court appointed counsel to represent petitioner, and on June 15, 1960, counsel filed a 30-page memorandum in support of the petition for leave to appeal. The following day, the Government answered with a memorandum stating that it believed it appropriate for the court to order the preparation of a transcript at government expense before ruling on the petition for leave to appeal. Petitioner objected to this procedure on the grounds that his memorandum sufficiently indicated that non-frivolous issues were present in his case and that further delay in allowing the appeal was, therefore, unwarranted. On July 1, 1960, the Court of Appeals ordered the preparation of a transcript at the expense of the United States. The transcript became available August 15, 1960, and the Government's opposition to petitioner's application for leave to appeal in forma pauperis was filed, pursuant to an extension of time granted by the court, on September 2, 1960. The Government, misconceiving the issue as we understand it, claimed the points sought to be raised were \"not sufficiently substantial\" to warrant an appeal in forma pauperis; it did not suggest the appeal sought was \"frivolous.\" Petitioner filed a reply memorandum on \n\n[369 \nU.S. 438, 452]\n\u00a0\n September 8. On November 5, 1960, the court, one judge dissenting, denied the petition for leave to appeal in forma pauperis. The petition for certiorari was filed in this Court on November 16, 1960, and was granted on June 19, 1961. \n366 \nU.S. 959\n. We heard oral argument in December 1961, and our present disposition of the case, remanding it for reconsideration by the Court of Appeals on an intermediary step, still far from the end of petitioner's course through the courts on his original conviction, is now ordered more than four years after the commission of the offenses for which petitioner was tried and more than two years from the date of the trial and judgment petitioner seeks to have reviewed.\n17\n\u00a0\n\nIn the light of this delay, it is not surprising that petitioner asks us to reach the merits of his case immediately. However, delay alone, unfortunate though it is, is not sufficient cause to bypass the orderly processes of judicial review. Contrary to the Government's assertion here that petitioner has already received what amounts to \n\n[369 \nU.S. 438, 453]\n\u00a0\n plenary review of the conviction following his second trial, we hold petitioner has not yet received the benefits of presenting either oral argument or full briefs on the merits of his claims to the court first charged with the supervision of the trial court.\n18\n The memoranda prepared by counsel in support of petitioner's application for leave to appeal in forma pauperis were not intended to be, nor are they rightly considered as, full appellate briefs. But they do serve to demonstrate that petitioner sought consideration of issues that it would be difficult for an appellate court to consider so patently frivolous as to require a dismissal of petitioner's case without full briefing or argument. In so saying, we need not, and do not, express any opinion on whether petitioner's conviction should ultimately be affirmed or reversed. We only hold that taken as a whole, petitioner's various claims cannot justify the summary disposition of his case ordered below.\n\nThe first of numerous claims asserted by the petitioner is that the indictment against him was procured through the use of perjured testimony before the grand jury. This Court has not yet decided whether such a charge, if proven, would require the reversal of a criminal conviction based upon an indictment returned by a grand jury hearing the perjury. But we have granted certiorari and given full consideration to related issues in other cases. See, e. g., Costello v. United States, \n350 \nU.S. 359\n (hearsay evidence considered by grand jury); Lawn v. United States, \n355 \nU.S. 339\n (illegally seized evidence considered by grand jury); Beck v. Washington, post, p. 541 (alleged inflammatory publicity surrounding state grand jury deliberations).\n\nPetitioner also claims that he has been unable to prove his charge that perjured testimony was presented to the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 438, 454]\n\u00a0\n grand jury because of the refusal of the courts below to permit him to examine the transcript of the grand jury's proceedings. Again, although in the particular context of this case access to the normally secret minutes of the grand jury may ultimately be held to have been properly denied, recent volumes of the United States Reports and the Federal Reporter include a number of opinions in which the extent of the secrecy normally attached to grand jury minutes has been explored.\n19\n\u00a0\n\nA number of other arguable claims were also made by petitioner to support his application for leave to appeal. But we believe those mentioned would alone have warranted the allowance of an appeal in forma pauperis. They meet the test of being sufficiently reasonable to withstand a claim that their frivolity is so manifest that they merit no further argument or consideration, and that dismissal of petitioner's case is, therefore, in order. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the decision of this case.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] During the past five Terms of the Court, we have found it necessary to vacate and remand for reconsideration 14 cases in which a Court of Appeals has applied an erroneous standard in passing on an indigent's application for leave to appeal.

If neither counsel, whether retained or court appointed, nor the district judge imposing sentence, notifies the defendant of the requirement for filing a prompt notice of appeal, the right of appeal may irrevocably be lost.

Stenographic transcripts in the federal courts cost $0.65 per page for the first copy, and $0.30 per page for additional copies. Transcripts in excess of 100 pages are not uncommon. The cost of printing briefs, records, and appendices, as illustrated by the present charge for printing records in this Court, may be $3.80 per page or more. The printing requirements are generally waived in appeals proceeding in forma pauperis. Cf. Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 75 (m). But if, in such cases, printing is required by the Court of Appeals, the expense is borne by the United States. 28 U.S.C. 1915 (b).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The statute appears to contemplate an initial application to the District Court by providing \"An appeal may not be taken in forma pauperis if the trial court certifies in writing that it is not taken in \n\n[369 \nU.S. 438, 444]\n\u00a0\n good faith.\" 28 U.S.C. 1915 (a). And this is the manner in which the statute has been interpreted. See, e. g., West v. United States, 94 U.S. App. D.C. 46, 222 F.2d 774; Waterman v. McMillan, 77 U.S. App. D.C. 310, 135 F.2d 807; Murrey v. United States, 134 F.2d 956 (C. A. 8th Cir.); Bayless v. Johnston, 127 F.2d 531 (C. A. 9th Cir.).

United States, 104 U.S. App. D.C. 265, 269, 261 F.2d 731, 735, vacated, \n357 \nU.S. 219\n; Parsell v. United States, 218 F.2d 232 (C. A. 5th Cir.). See also United States v.

Proc. 12 (f).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] 28 U.S.C. 1915 expressly authorizes \"[a]ny court of the United States\" to permit a litigant to proceed in forma pauperis. Thus it is not necessary to consider the application to the Court of Appeals a separate \"appeal\" from the order of the District Court denying relief, to which the time requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure would be applicable as they are to appeals in other ancillary post-conviction proceedings. Cf. Roberts v. United States District Court, \n339 \nU.S. 844, 845\n. The court below has, by its own Rule 41 (b), required all persons seeking leave to appeal a judgment of the District Court in forma pauperis, to apply for such leave from the Court of Appeals within 30 days of the date on which their applications for such relief from the District Court have been denied.

The bill of exceptions was difficult, if not impossible, to prepare without a stenographic transcript of the trial proceedings. Persons sentenced to death received transcripts at the expense of the State; all others were required to purchase a transcript. We found the failure of the State to provide for appellate review for indigents in non-capital cases, when such review was available for all defendants able to purchase transcripts, an \"invidious discrimination\" inconsistent with the guarantees of due process and equal protection of the laws of the Fourteenth Amendment.

There, Judge Bazelon pointed out that of 86 criminal appeals considered by the Court of Appeals within a period of approximately 15 months, 18 were prepaid, while 68 were considered after either the District Court or the Court of Appeals had granted leave to appeal in forma pauperis. Of this total, 14 of the prepaid appeals resulted in a judgment affirming the conviction; a similar majority of the paupers' appeals resulted in affirmance. However, during a comparable span between September 1, 1957, and February 28, 1959, 24 criminal appeals were decided by the Court of Appeals in which the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 438, 450]\n\u00a0\n District Court had initially denied leave to appeal in forma pauperis. In 11 of those 24 cases, reversals were ordered, and in 6 more, one of the three judges of the court's panel dissented from the judgment affirming the conviction. During those same 18 months, the court granted 31 of 47 petitions for leave to take a direct appeal in forma pauperis from a conviction, and this Court subsequently reversed the denials of leave to appeal ordered in the cases of 5 of the 16 unsuccessful applicants in the court below.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] The instant case is not unique in this regard.

Q. 382. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 438, 455]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART, with whom MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN agrees, concurring.\n\nIn joining the opinion and judgment of the Court, I think it appropriate to add a few words. The rule of Ellis v. United States is a simple one. An appeal in forma pauperis must be allowed in a criminal case \"unless the issues raised are so frivolous that the appeal would be dismissed in the case of a nonindigent litigant.\" \n356 \nU.S. 674, 675\n. The difficulties which the Courts of Appeals have encountered in applying this simple and practical test are largely, I think, of their own making.\n\nThese difficulties may stem in part from a failure to consider the in forma pauperis statute in the context of the over-all scheme governing criminal appeals. Our statutes and rules make an appeal in a criminal case a matter of right. The provisions governing appeals in forma pauperis are not to be read as diluting that right by imposing a more stringent test of merit. Rather, 28 U.S.C. 1915 provides at most a device for advance screening of appeals which, if paid, would upon motion be dismissed before argument as frivolous. The only justification for such a preliminary screening is the absence of the built-in pecuniary brake upon frivolous appeals which is present in nonindigent cases. There is no other difference between paid and unpaid appeals. In both, the burden of showing that the right to appeal has been abused is on the party making the suggestion.\n\nIt has been said that a District Court's certification that an appeal is not taken in good faith is entitled to great weight. Johnson v. United States, \n352 \nU.S. 565, 566\n. Nevertheless, if a District Court has denied leave to appeal in forma pauperis, the Court of Appeals has the ultimate responsibility of deciding for itself whether the appeal is frivolous. Justice demands an independent and objective assessment of a district judge's appraisal of his \n\n[369 \nU.S. 438, 456]\n\u00a0\n own conduct of a criminal trial. Anything less would impose a disability upon indigent defendants far greater than that contemplated by the preliminary screening provision which 1915 permits. The statutory safeguard against overindulgence in free frivolous appeals cannot be allowed to impinge upon the fundamental right of every litigant, rich or poor, to equal consideration before the courts.\n\nWhen a Court of Appeals chooses to utilize the preliminary screening device permitted by 1915, difficulties of the kind evident in this case frequently arise. The bare application for leave to appeal in forma pauperis seldom furnishes sufficient material for evaluating the weight of the issues involved. For this reason, we have held that in such cases a Court of Appeals must provide the applicant with the assistance of counsel and with a record of sufficient completeness to give him full opportunity to show that the appeal is in \"good faith.\" Johnson v. United States, supra; Farley v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 521\n. In the course of such proceedings, however, experience has shown that there may be a tendency to lose sight of the precise issue before the court at this point - whether the appeal is so frivolous that it would be dismissed even if all the fees had been paid. Obviously arguments concerning the weight of the issues raised by an appeal are difficult to disengage from arguments dealing with the ultimate merits of these same issues. Understandably and commendably, counsel for indigent defendants often exert every effort to prove the substantial nature of their clients' claims - an exertion of energy which draws a similar effort from government counsel. The product of these forces is a procedure which may bear close superficial resemblance to the appeal itself.\n\nThe result is that a Court of Appeals may come to think of these preliminary proceedings as tantamount to appeals on the merits, and may tend to decide whether or \n\n[369 \nU.S. 438, 457]\n\u00a0\n not to grant leave to appeal by appraising the entire case in terms of whether or not reversible error appears. By the same token, when leave to appeal has been denied, and the case has come here, the Government has argued in the past, as it argues in this case, that the preliminary screening procedure was itself the equivalent of an affirmance on the merits. See Lurk v. United States, \n366 \nU.S. 712\n.\n\nThis attempted conversion of the proceedings to determine good faith into a truncated substitute for appeal distorts the purpose of 1915, and, if accepted, would raise serious questions of due process. The filing of memoranda in support of an application for leave to appeal is not an appeal. The merits of the ultimate issues are not logically involved at this point, but only the weight of those issues. Appellate briefs are not written or submitted. There is no oral argument. The court's mode of considering such memoranda, as a matter of internal machinery, may markedly differ from the process employed in the decision of cases actually on appeal. For all these reasons the interim proceeding permitted by 1915 cannot itself be deemed to constitute the appeal to which a person convicted of crime in the federal courts is entitled.\n\nIn addition to the danger of equating the \"good faith\" determination with the appeal itself, there are other disadvantages inherent in compelling the parties to go through the preliminary procedure permitted by 1915. It is a serious imposition upon appointed counsel to require dissipation of energy and time in preliminary skirmishing. Moreover, the delay occasioned by this extended interim proceeding is itself offensive to the ideal of speedy administration of criminal justice.\n\nThe primary responsibility for containing within limited bounds the separate \"good faith\" proceeding permitted by 1915 rests upon those Courts of Appeals \n\n[369 \nU.S. 438, 458]\n\u00a0\n which choose to utilize this system of dealing with in forma pauperis appeals. While I would not deny great latitude to the various circuits autonomously to devise their own procedures consistent with their appraisal of local conditions and needs, the courts' duty in this area can be properly achieved only by keeping in mind the very limited test of \"good faith\" which the Ellis case established.\n\nThis suggests that each Court of Appeals might well consider whether its task could not be more expeditiously and responsibly performed by simply granting applications to appeal from criminal convictions in forma pauperis as a matter of course, and appointing counsel to brief and argue each case on the merits. The Government would then be free in any case to file before argument a motion to dismiss the appeal as frivolous, as every appellee is always free to do. In the absence of such a motion an appeal which after argument appeared clearly without merit could be expeditiously disposed of by summary affirmance, in the secure knowledge that all the issues had been fully canvassed. This procedure, it seems to me, would not only save the time and energy of court and counsel, but would obviate the many difficulties which, as the present case shows, the complicated two-step system is all too likely to produce.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK, with whom MR. JUSTICE HARLAN joins, dissenting.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nCongress has provided that no indigent appeal may be taken \"if the trial court certifies in writing that it is not taken in good faith,\" i. e., is frivolous. 28 U.S.C. 1915 (a). With the opinion today the Court for all practical purposes repeals this statute by placing the burden on the Government to sustain such a certification \n\n[369 \nU.S. 438, 459]\n\u00a0\n rather than on the indigent to overturn it. This position is a sub silentio reversal of our previous holding in Farley v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 521, 523\n (1957), where we said that \"petitioner has not yet been afforded an adequate opportunity to show the Court of Appeals that his claimed errors are not frivolous. . . .\" Accord, Johnson v. United States, \n352 \nU.S. 565\n (1957).\n1\n Moreover, the Court goes against a long line of cases holding that the trial judge's certificate of frivolity is entitled to \"great weight\" - a rule which the opinion here notes but fails to recognize. If the finding is entitled to \"great weight,\" in fact controlling weight in the absence of \"some showing that the certificate is made without warrant . . .,\" Wells v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 257, 259\n (1943), how can it be said the Government has the burden of upholding it? The Court seems to say the burden is upon the Government because when it files a motion to dismiss in a nonindigent case it has the burden of showing frivolity. I submit the two are not at all analogous. In the case of paid appeals Congress has not provided for a determination by the trial court of whether the issues warrant further review, and to treat nonpaid appeals like paid appeals is to ignore such a provision in the statute governing indigent appeals.\n\nThe Court does not make clear on what grounds it bases its assumption that the Government has the burden of showing frivolity. It professes to act \"within the statutory framework for appeals created by Congress\"; but it intimates that it is \"impelled by considerations beyond the corners of 28 U.S.C. 1915,\" and the touchstone of its opinion is a principle arising from cases based on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 438, 460]\n\u00a0\n I do not believe, however, that a disparity in the burden of showing frivolity denies equal justice as between paid and nonpaid appeals. They both remain subject to the same peril. Congress has set up a special procedure which subjects every nonpaid appeal to an examination to determine if further briefing and oral argument are necessary. Such an examination in the case of paid appeals is left to the initiative of the court or the Government. This distinction does not give rise to a discrimination of constitutional proportions. As was pointed out in Hirabayashi v. United States, \n320 \nU.S. 81, 100\n (1943), \"[t]he Fifth Amendment contains no equal protection clause and it restrains only such discriminatory legislation by Congress as amounts to a denial of due process. . . . Congress may hit at a particular danger where it is seen, without providing for others which are not so evident or so urgent.\" I see no constitutional impediment to asking one who seeks a free ride to show that he is not just a joyrider. Although a government that affords appellate review must pay the cost of meritorious indigent appeals, surely it may protect itself from frivolous ones (which incidentally in numbers over-whelmingly predominate) being \"subsidized and public moneys . . . needlessly spent.\" Griffin v. Illinois, \n351 \nU.S. 12, 24\n (1956) (concurring opinion).\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nThe Court holds that petitioner is entitled to oral argument in the Court of Appeals on new briefs. An examination of the record shows that the action of the Court of Appeals was on the basis of a complete transcript and extensive briefs filed by counsel. With due deference to the Court's suggestion that these briefs were only preliminary, I find them to be substantially similar in both bulk and substance to the ones filed here on which petitioner asks for a decision on the merits. Upon such \n\n[369 \nU.S. 438, 461]\n\u00a0\n presentation the Court of Appeals found itself satisfied that petitioner's conviction was proper. It is true that no oral argument was permitted. However, having come to the conclusion that the case had no merit, the court had to put a stop to the review proceeding. This is true whether the appeal is paid or nonpaid. See United States v. Johnson, \n327 \nU.S. 106\n (1946). We adjudicate most of our appeals in the same manner, i. e., by dismissing or affirming on the briefs without argument. Inasmuch as the case had arisen within the procedural confines of appeals in forma pauperis, the Court of Appeals simply denied leave to appeal. It could have granted leave to proceed and then summarily affirmed or dismissed the appeal under Rule 39 (a), Fed. Rules Crim. Proc. I see no substantial distinction between the two dispositions.\n\nThe Court, however, is remanding the case for further review proceedings because it has concluded that at least two of petitioner's claims are not frivolous and that the Court of Appeals therefore erred in not allowing the review to run its full length. The Court in reaching this conclusion has, in my view, misplaced the burden on the issue of frivolity, but even assuming arguendo that petitioner's contentions are not frivolous, I cannot agree to the fruitless approach the Court has taken.\n\nTo be sure, frivolity or some analogous standard delimits those appeals, paid or nonpaid, which can be decided without oral argument. However, it would seem that any error by a Court of Appeals in evaluating frivolity upon such a full presentation as was had below is often not only incorrectable but harmless. Concededly, this Court has of late consistently remanded cases in which a Court of Appeals has mistakenly characterized contentions as frivolous. Experience has shown this tack to be unsatisfactory, and perhaps it is now time to re-evaluate our approach. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 438, 462]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThis is not to say that we should do a complete turn about and never remand a case for further review. What I am suggesting is that we give substance to the congressional mandate and yet analyze, inter alia, the thoroughness of the review below, the character of the issues raised, the beneficiality of further action by a lower court, and the strength or weakness of the contentions made. Applying such criteria to the present case, I am convinced that to remand this case will only compel the lower court to go through wasteful formalities to the detriment of its consideration of other appeals and put off to another day action by this Court.\n2\n The Court speaks of long delays, but by remanding it appears to have contributed to the very evil which it seeks to eliminate. I would follow the teaching of Pollard v. United States, \n352 \nU.S. 354\n (1957), and Holiday v. Johnston, \n313 \nU.S. 342\n (1941), and decide the merits of petitioner's contentions now. I therefore dissent.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Ellis v. United States, \n356 \nU.S. 674\n (1958), is inapposite. There the Court was concerned with the standard governing the allowance of appeals in forma pauperis, not with where rests the burden of showing frivolity in the face of a certification by the trial court.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] For a case in which a similar warning was sounded, see Lurk v. United States, \n366 \nU.S. 712\n (1961) (dissenting opinion). Subsequent events have shown this admonition to be words of wisdom indeed.

WOOD(1962)\nNo. 244\nArgued: Decided: April 30, 1962\n\n\n\n\n Claiming that petitioner had breached its contract to pay $150,000 for the exclusive use of the trademark \"DAIRY QUEEN\" in certain portions of Pennsylvania, the owners of the trademark sued in a Federal District Court for (1) temporary and permanent injunctions to restrain petitioner from any future use of or dealing in the franchise and trademark, (2) an accounting to determine the exact amount of money owing by petitioner and a judgment for that amount, and (3) an injunction pending accounting to prevent petitioner from collecting any money from \"Dairy Queen\" stores in the territory. Petitioner filed an answer raising a number of defenses and made a timely demand for a trial by jury. The District Court struck petitioner's demand for a trial by jury, on the alternative grounds that either the action was \"purely equitable\" or that whatever legal issues were raised were \"incidental\" to equitable issues. The Court of Appeals denied petitioner's application for a writ of mandamus to compel the District Judge to vacate his order. Held: The District Judge erred in refusing petitioner's demand for a trial by jury of the factual issues related to the question whether there had been a breach of contract or a trademark infringement, and the Court of Appeals should have corrected that error by granting the petition for mandamus. Pp. 470-480.\n\n (a) Where both legal and equitable issues are presented in a single case, any legal issues for which a trial by jury is timely and properly demanded must be submitted to a jury.

Ooms argued the cause for respondents. With him on the briefs was Mark D. Alspach.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania granted a motion to strike petitioner's demand for a trial by jury in an action now pending before it on the alternative grounds that either the action was \"purely equitable\" or, if not purely equitable, whatever legal issues that were raised were \"incidental\" to equitable issues, and, in either case, no right to trial by jury existed.\n1\n The petitioner then sought mandamus in the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit to compel the district judge to vacate this order. When that court denied this request without opinion, we granted certiorari because the action of the Court of Appeals seemed inconsistent with protections already clearly recognized for the important constitutional right to trial by jury in our previous decisions.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nAt the outset, we may dispose of one of the grounds upon which the trial court acted in striking the demand for trial by jury - that based upon the view that the right to trial by jury may be lost as to legal issues where those issues are characterized as \"incidental\" to equitable issues - for our previous decisions make it plain that no such rule may be applied in the federal courts. In Scott \n\n[369 \nU.S. 469, 471]\n\u00a0\n v. Neely, decided in 1891, this Court held that a court of equity could not even take jurisdiction of a suit \"in which a claim properly cognizable only at law is united in the same pleadings with a claim for equitable relief.\"\n3\n That holding, which was based upon both the historical separation between law and equity and the duty of the Court to insure \"that the right to a trial by a jury in the legal action may be preserved intact,\"\n4\n created considerable inconvenience in that it necessitated two separate trials in the same case whenever that case contained both legal and equitable claims. Consequently, when the procedure in the federal courts was modernized by the adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in 1938, it was deemed advisable to abandon that part of the holding of Scott v. Neely which rested upon the separation of law and equity and to permit the joinder of legal and equitable claims in a single action. Thus Rule 18 (a) provides that a plaintiff \"may join either as independent or as alternate claims as many claims either legal or equitable or both as he may have against an opposing party.\" And Rule 18 (b) provides: \"Whenever a claim is one heretofore cognizable only after another claim has been prosecuted to a conclusion, the two claims may be joined in a single action; but the court shall grant relief in that action only in accordance with the relative substantive rights of the parties. In particular, a plaintiff may state a claim for money and a claim to have set aside a conveyance fraudulent as to him, without first having obtained a judgment establishing the claim for money.\"\n\nThe Federal Rules did not, however, purport to change the basic holding of Scott v. Neely that the right to trial \n\n[369 \nU.S. 469, 472]\n\u00a0\n by jury of legal claims must be preserved.\n5\n Quite the contrary, Rule 38 (a) expressly reaffirms that constitutional principle, declaring: \"The right of trial by jury as declared by the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution or as given by a statute of the United States shall be preserved to the parties inviolate.\" Nonetheless, after the adoption of the Federal Rules, attempts were made indirectly to undercut that right by having federal courts in which cases involving both legal and equitable claims were filed decide the equitable claim first. The result of this procedure in those cases in which it was followed was that any issue common to both the legal and equitable claims was finally determined by the court and the party seeking trial by jury on the legal claim was deprived of that right as to these common issues. This procedure finally came before us in Beacon Theatres, Inc., v. Westover,\n6\n a case which, like this one, arose from the denial of a petition for mandamus to compel a district judge to vacate his order striking a demand for trial by jury.\n\nOur decision reversing that case not only emphasizes the responsibility of the Federal Courts of Appeals to grant mandamus where necessary to protect the constitutional right to trial by jury but also limits the issues open for determination here by defining the protection to which that right is entitled in cases involving both legal and equitable claims. The holding in Beacon Theatres was that where both legal and equitable issues are presented in a single case, \"only under the most imperative circumstances, circumstances which in \n\n[369 \nU.S. 469, 473]\n\u00a0\n view of the flexible procedures of the Federal Rules we cannot now anticipate, can the right to a jury trial of legal issues be lost through prior determination of equitable claims.\"\n7\n That holding, of course, applies whether the trial judge chooses to characterize the legal issues presented as \"incidental\" to equitable issues or not.\n8\n Consequently, in a case such as this where there cannot even be a contention of such \"imperative circumstances,\" Beacon Theatres requires that any legal issues for which a trial by jury is timely and properly demanded be submitted to a jury. There being no question of the timeliness or correctness of the demand involved here, the sole question which we must decide is whether the action now pending before the District Court contains legal issues.\n\nThe District Court proceeding arises out of a controversy between petitioner and the respondent owners of the trademark \"DAIRY QUEEN\" with regard to a written licensing contract made by them in December 1949, under which petitioner agreed to pay some $150,000 for the exclusive right to use that trademark in certain portions of Pennsylvania.\n9\n The terms of the contract provided \n\n[369 \nU.S. 469, 474]\n\u00a0\n for a small initial payment with the remaining payments to be made at the rate of 50% of all amounts received by petitioner on sales and franchises to deal with the trademark and, in order to make certain that the $150,000 payment would be completed within a specified period of time, further provided for minimum annual payments regardless of petitioner's receipts. In August 1960, the respondents wrote petitioner a letter in which they claimed that petitioner had committed \"a material breach of that contract\" by defaulting on the contract's payment provisions and notified petitioner of the termination of the contract and the cancellation of petitioner's right to use the trademark unless this claimed default was remedied immediately.\n10\n When petitioner continued to deal with the trademark despite the notice of termination, the respondents brought an action based upon their view that a material breach of contract had occurred. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 469, 475]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe complaint filed in the District Court alleged, among other things, that petitioner had \"ceased paying . . . as required in the contract;\" that the default \"under the said contract . . . [was] in excess of $60,000.00;\" that this default constituted a \"material breach\" of that contract; that petitioner had been notified by letter that its failure to pay as alleged made it guilty of a material breach of contract which if not \"cured\" would result in an immediate cancellation of the contract; that the breach had not been cured but that petitioner was contesting the cancellation and continuing to conduct business as an authorized dealer; that to continue such business after the cancellation of the contract constituted an infringement of the respondents' trademark; that petitioner's financial condition was unstable; and that because of the foregoing allegations, respondents were threatened with irreparable injury for which they had no adequate remedy at law. The complaint then prayed for both temporary and permanent relief, including: (1) temporary and permanent injunctions to restrain petitioner from any future use of or dealing in the franchise and the trademark; (2) an accounting to determine the exact amount of money owing by petitioner and a judgment for that amount; and (3) an injunction pending accounting to prevent petitioner from collecting any money from \"Dairy Queen\" stores in the territory.\n\nIn its answer to this complaint, petitioner raised a number of defenses, including: (1) a denial that there had been any breach of contract, apparently based chiefly upon its allegation that in January 1955 the parties had entered into an oral agreement modifying the original written contract by removing the provision requiring minimum annual payments regardless of petitioner's receipts thus leaving petitioner's only obligation that of turning over 50% of all its receipts; (2) laches and estoppel \n\n[369 \nU.S. 469, 476]\n\u00a0\n arising from respondents' failure to assert their claim promptly, thus permitting petitioner to expend large amounts of money in the development of its right to use the trademark; and (3) alleged violations of the antitrust laws by respondents in connection with their dealings with the trademark. Petitioner indorsed upon this answer a demand for trial by jury in accordance with Rule 38 (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n11\n\u00a0\n\nPetitioner's contention, as set forth in its petition for mandamus to the Court of Appeals and reiterated in its briefs before this Court, is that insofar as the complaint requests a money judgment it presents a claim which is unquestionably legal. We agree with that contention. The most natural construction of the respondents' claim for a money judgment would seem to be that it is a claim that they are entitled to recover whatever was owned them under the contract as of the date of its purported termination plus damages for infringement of their trademark since that date. Alternatively, the complaint could be construed to set forth a full claim based upon both of these theories - that is, a claim that the respondents were entitled to recover both the debt due under the contract and damages for trademark infringement for the entire period of the alleged breach including that before the termination of the contract.\n12\n Or it might possibly be construed to set forth a claim for recovery based completely on either one of these two theories - that is, a claim \n\n[369 \nU.S. 469, 477]\n\u00a0\n based solely upon the contract for the entire period both before and after the attempted termination on the theory that the termination, having been ignored, was of no consequence, or a claim based solely upon the charge of infringement on the theory that the contract, having been breached, could not be used as a defense to an infringement action even for the period prior to its termination.\n13\n We find it unnecessary to resolve this ambiguity in the respondents' complaint because we think it plain that their claim for a money judgment is a claim wholly legal in its nature however the complaint is construed. As an action on a debt allegedly due under a contract, it would be difficult to conceive of an action of a more traditionally legal character.\n14\n And as an action for damages based upon a charge of trademark infringement, it would be no less subject to cognizance by a court of law.\n15\n\u00a0\n\nThe respondents' contention that this money claim is \"purely equitable\" is based primarily upon the fact that their complaint is cast in terms of an \"accounting,\" rather than in terms of an action for \"debt\" or \"damages.\" But the constitutional right to trial by jury cannot be made \n\n[369 \nU.S. 469, 478]\n\u00a0\n to depend upon the choice of words used in the pleadings. The necessary prerequisite to the right to maintain a suit for an equitable accounting, like all other equitable remedies, is, as we pointed out in Beacon Theatres, the absence of an adequate remedy at law.\n16\n Consequently, in order to maintain such a suit on a cause of action cognizable at law, as this one is, the plaintiff must be able to show that the \"accounts between the parties\" are of such a \"complicated nature\" that only a court of equity can satisfactorily unravel them.\n17\n In view of the powers given to District Courts by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 53 (b) to appoint masters to assist the jury in those exceptional cases where the legal issues are too complicated for the jury adequately to handle alone,\n18\n the burden of such a showing is considerably increased and it will indeed be a rare case in which it can be met.\n19\n But be that as it may, this is certainly \n\n[369 \nU.S. 469, 479]\n\u00a0\n not such a case. A jury, under proper instructions from the court, could readily determine the recovery, if any, to be had here, whether the theory finally settled upon is that of breach of contract, that of trademark infringement, or any combination of the two. The legal remedy cannot be characterized as inadequate merely because the measure of damages may necessitate a look into petitioner's business records.\n\nNor is the legal claim here rendered \"purely equitable\" by the nature of the defenses interposed by petitioner. Petitioner's primary defense to the charge of breach of contract - that is, that the contract was modified by a subsequent oral agreement - presents a purely legal question having nothing whatever to do either with novation, as the district judge suggested, or reformation, as suggested by the respondents here. Such a defense goes to the question of just what, under the law, the contract between the respondents and petitioner is and, in an action to collect a debt for breach of a contract between these parties, petitioner has a right to have the jury determine not only whether the contract has been breached and the extent of the damages if any but also just what the contract is.\n\nWe conclude therefore that the district judge erred in refusing to grant petitioner's demand for a trial by jury on the factual issues related to the question of whether there has been a breach of contract. Since these issues are common with those upon which respondents' claim to equitable relief is based, the legal claims involved in the action must be determined prior to any final court determination of respondents' equitable claims.\n20\n The Court \n\n[369 \nU.S. 469, 480]\n\u00a0\n of Appeals should have corrected the error of the district judge by granting the petition for mandamus. The judgment is therefore reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE STEWART concurs in the result.\n\nMR.

As long as any legal cause is involved the jury rights it creates control. This is the teaching of Beacon Theatres, as we construe it.\" Thermo-Stitch, Inc., v. Chemi-Cord Processing Corp., 294 F.2d 486, 491.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] There are two groups of respondents in this case in addition to the district judge who is formally a respondent by reason of the procedural posture of the case. H. A. McCullough and H. F. McCullough, a partnership doing business as McCullough's Dairy Queen, are the owners of the trademark and are entitled under the contract to payment for its use. B. F. Myers, R. J. Rydeen, M. E. Montgomery, and H. S. Dale are the original licensees under the contract through \n\n[369 \nU.S. 469, 474]\n\u00a0\n whom petitioner obtained its rights by assignment. This latter group of respondents joined in the action against petitioner on the grounds (1) that they would be responsible to the trademark owners if petitioner defaulted on its obligations under the contract, and (2) that they are themselves entitled to certain royalties under the assignment arrangement. since the portion of the complaint involving this latter group raises no issues relevant to the question to be determined here which differ from those raised in that part of the complaint involving the trademark owners, the discussion can be restricted to the issues raised by the trademark owners and \"respondents\" as used in this opinion will refer only to that group.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] The full text of the letter sent to petitioner is as follows:\n\n\"This letter is to advise you that your failure to pay the amounts required in your contract with McCullough's Dairy Queen for the `Dairy Queen' franchise for the State of Pennsylvania, as called for in your contract with your assignors, constitutes in our opinion a material breach of that contract.\n\n\n\"This will advise you that unless this material breach is completely satisfied for the amount due and owing, your franchise for `Dairy Queen' in Pennsylvania is hereby cancelled.\n\n\n\"Copies of this letter are being sent to your assignors.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] \"Any party may demand a trial by jury of any issue triable of right by a jury by serving upon the other parties a demand therefor in writing at any time after the commencement of the action and not later than 10 days after the service of the last pleading directed to such issue. Such demand may be indorsed upon a pleading of the party.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] This seems to be the construction given the complaint by the district judge in passing on the motion to strike petitioner's jury demand. See 194 F. Supp., at 687-688.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] This last possible construction of the complaint, though accepted as the correct one in the concurring opinion, actually seems the least likely of all. For it seems plain that irrespective of whatever else the complaint sought, it did seek a judgment for the some $60,000 allegedly owing under the contract. Certainly, the district judge had no doubt that this was the case: \"Incidental to this relief, the complaint also demands the $60,000 now allegedly due and owing plaintiffs under the aforesaid contract.\" 194 F.

See also In re Watkins, 271 F.2d 771.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] It was settled in Beacon Theatres that procedural changes which remove the inadequacy of a remedy at law may sharply diminish the scope of traditional equitable remedies by making them unnecessary in many cases. \"Thus, the justification for equity's deciding legal issues once it obtains jurisdiction, and refusing to dismiss a case, merely because subsequently a legal remedy becomes available, must be re-evaluated in the light of the liberal joinder provisions of the Federal Rules which allow legal and equitable causes to be brought and resolved in one civil action. Similarly the need for, and therefore, the availability of such equitable remedies as Bills of Peace, Quia Timet and Injunction must be reconsidered in view of the existence of the Declaratory Judgment Act as well as the liberal joinder provision of the Rules.\" \n359 \nU.S., at 509\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] This does not, of course, interfere with the District Court's power to grant temporary relief pending a final adjudication on the merits. Such temporary relief has already been granted in this case (see McCullough v. Dairy Queen, Inc., 290 F.2d 871) and is no part of the issues before this Court.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS joins, concurring.\n\nI am disposed to accept the view, strongly pressed at the bar, that this complaint seeks an accounting for alleged trademark infringement, rather than contract damages. Even though this leaves the complaint as formally asking only for equitable relief,\n*\n this does not end the inquiry. The fact that an \"accounting\" is sought is not of itself dispositive of the jury trial issue. To render this aspect of the complaint truly \"equitable\" it must appear that the substantive claim is one cognizable only in equity or that the \"accounts between the parties\" are of such a \"complicated nature\" that they can be satisfactorily unraveled only by a court of equity. Kirby v. Lake Shore & Michigan Southern R. Co., \n120 \nU.S. 130, 134\n. See 5 Moore, Federal Practice (1951), 198-202. It is manifest from the face of the complaint that the \"accounting\" sought in this instance is not of either variety. A jury, under proper instructions from the court, could readily calculate the damages flowing from this alleged \n\n[369 \nU.S. 469, 481]\n\u00a0\n trademark infringement, just as courts of law often do in copyright and patent cases. Cf., e. g., Hartell v. Tilghman, \n99 \nU.S. 547, 555\n; Arnstein v. Porter, 154 F.2d 464; Bruckman v. Hollzer, 152 F.2d 730.\n\nConsequently what is involved in this case is nothing more than a joinder in one complaint of prayers for both legal and equitable relief. In such circumstances, under principles long since established, Scott v. Neely, \n140 \nU.S. 106, 110\n, the petitioner cannot be deprived of his constitutional right to a jury trial on the \"legal\" claim contained in the complaint.\n\nOn this basis I concur in the judgment of the Court.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Except as to the damage claim there is no dispute but that the complaint seeks only equitable relief. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 469, 482]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","40":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDAVIS v.

Gen., for respondent.\n  Petition for wirt of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Georgia.\n  Denied.\n\n THE CHIEF JUSTICE, with whom Mr. Justice DOUGLAS joins, has filed the following memorandum:   While it is not our custom to state reasons when denying a writ of certiorari, there are occasions when the gravity of the allegations in a petition makes it appropriate to state what the denial does not mean* in order to give assurance that this Court is not insensible to charges of egregious violations of constitutional rights.   The denial of a writ of certiorari does not mean that this Court approves the decision below nor, in state criminal cases, that the petitioner is necessarily precluded from obtaining relief in some other appropriate proceeding. Both state and federal courts have an equally binding obligation to uphold the Constitution, and when a state court fails to vindicate rights guaranteed by the Constitution in a criminal proceeding upon a proper demand, the federal courts are open to an aggrieved petitioner.\n  In this case the state courts refused to grant a hearing to the petitioner on procedural grounds. However, a life is at stake, and unless some court, state or federal, entertains his petition, this petitioner will be executed without a hearing on the charges that strike at the very foundation of American justice. He contends that, under a statute recently declared unconstitutional by this Court, he was \n\n[369 \nU.S. 811\n, 812]\n\u00a0\n denied the right to be a witness in his own defense or even to testify that the confession used against him was coerced during a two-month period of illegal detention. He also claims that he was denied the right to trial by jury of his peers under a valid indictment through the systematic exclusion of members of his race from the jury lists, a practice which has often been condemned as unconstitutional by this Court and which Congress has made criminal.\n  No man should ever be imprisoned-let alone executed-in this country if such charges can be substantiated. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] See, e.g., English v.

Feit and Marshall Tamor Golding.\n\nJoseph P. Manners argued the cause and filed briefs for respondent in No. 93.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThese two cases present variants of the same problem: the appealability of an order granting or denying a pretrial motion to suppress the evidentiary use in a federal criminal trial of material allegedly procured through \n\n[369 \nU.S. 121, 122]\n\u00a0\n an unreasonable search and seizure.\n1\n A brief recital of the procedural history of each will place our problem in context.\n\nOn October 15, 1958, a warrant was issued by a United States Commissioner in the Eastern District of New York for the arrest of Mario DiBella upon a complaint charging unlawful sales of narcotics. The warrant was executed on March 9, 1959, in DiBella's apartment, and was followed by seizure of the drugs, equipment, and cash now in question. DiBella was arraigned and released under bail the next day. On June 17, 1959, a motion to suppress was filed on his behalf with the District Court for the Eastern District of New York, and hearing was scheduled for July 6. Several continuances followed, and before the hearing was held, on August 25, an indictment against DiBella was returned in the same district. The motion was ultimately denied, without prejudice to renewal at trial. 178 F. Supp. 5. The Court of Appeals \n\n[369 \nU.S. 121, 123]\n\u00a0\n for the Second Circuit held the order appealable, in accordance with its prior decisions, because the motion was filed before return of the indictment. 284 F.2d 897.\n\nThe motion in the companion case, on behalf of Daniel Koenig, was likewise filed before indictment, and this time in a district other than that of trial. Koenig had been arrested on September 22, 1959, in the Southern District of Florida on the basis of a complaint charging robbery of a federally insured bank in the Southern District of Ohio. His motion to suppress and for return of property seized during that arrest was filed in the Florida federal court on October 12, three days after the local United States Commissioner had held a final hearing on the Ohio complaint and two days before he recommended a warrant of removal. On October 16, an indictment against Koenig was returned in the Southern District of Ohio. After three hearings on the motion, the Florida District Court entered its order on December 18, granting suppression but denying return without prejudice to renewal of the motion in the trial court. The Government's appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction on the ground that, following recent decisions of that court, the order was interlocutory in a criminal case. 290 F.2d 166. We granted certiorari in the two cases, \n365 \nU.S. 809\n and \n368 \nU.S. 812\n, respectively, to resolve a conflict among the circuits.\n\nThe settled view of the Second Circuit, that a ruling on a pre-indictment motion invariably lays the basis for immediate appellate review, in that it constitutes a \"final decision\" under 28 U.S.C. 1291, even though an indictment intervenes, has not been squarely passed upon by this Court. We have denied appealability from orders on post-indictment motions to both the Government, Carroll v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 394\n, and the defendant, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 121, 124]\n\u00a0\n Cogen v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 221\n. The Court has, however, in fact allowed appeals from orders granting and denying pre-indictment motions,\n2\n and these dispositions have given rise to explanatory dicta that lend support to the rule developed in the Second Circuit.\n3\n Not only disagreement among the circuits but dubieties within them demand an adjudication based upon searching consideration of such conflicting and confused views regarding a problem of considerable importance in the proper administration of criminal justice.\n\nThe general principle of federal appellate jurisdiction, derived from the common law and enacted by the First Congress, requires that review of nisi prius proceedings await their termination by final judgment. First Judiciary Act, 21, 22, 25, 1 Stat. 73, 83, 84, 85 (1789); see McLish v. Roff, \n141 \nU.S. 661\n. This insistence on finality and prohibition of piecemeal review discourage undue litigiousness and leaden-footed administration of justice, particularly damaging to the conduct of criminal cases. See Cobbledick v. United States, \n309 \nU.S. 323, 324\n-326.\n\nSince the procedural aspects of law deal with the practical affairs of men and do not constitute an abstract system of doctrinaire notions, Congress has recognized the need of exceptions for interlocutory orders in certain types of proceedings where the damage of error unreviewed before the judgment is definitive and complete, see Collins v. Miller, \n252 \nU.S. 364, 370\n, has been deemed greater than the disruption caused by intermediate appeal. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 121, 125]\n\u00a0\n See 30 Stat. 544, 553 (1898), as amended, 11 U.S.C. 47 (bankruptcy proceedings); 28 U.S.C. 1252 (orders invalidating federal statutes); 28 U.S.C. 1253 (injunctions issued or refused by statutory three-judge courts); 28 U.S.C. 1292 (a) (1)-(4) (injunctions, receivership, admiralty, patent infringement). Most recently, in the Interlocutory Appeals Act of 1958, 72 Stat. 1770, 28 U.S.C. 1292 (b), Congress expanded the latitude for intermediate appeals in civil actions through the device of discretionary certification of controlling questions of law. See Note, 75 Harv. L. Rev. 351, 378-379.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nMoreover, the concept of finality as a condition of review has encountered situations which make clear that it need not invite self-defeating judicial construction. Thus, acceptance of appeal from orders definitively directing an immediate transfer of property, although an accounting remains, Forgay v. Conrad, 6 How. 201, has been justified as \"review of the adjudication which is concluded because it is independent of, and unaffected by, another litigation with which it happens to be entangled.\" Radio Station WOW v. Johnson, \n326 \nU.S. 120, 126\n.\n5\n Similarly, so as not to frustrate the right \n\n[369 \nU.S. 121, 126]\n\u00a0\n of appellate review, immediate appeal has been allowed from an order recognized as collateral to the principal litigation because touching matters that will not \"affect, or . . . be affected by, decision of the merits of [the] . . . case,\" Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., \n337 \nU.S. 541, 546\n, when the practical effect of the order will be irreparable by any subsequent appeal. E. g., Stack v. Boyle, \n342 \nU.S. 1\n; Swift & Co. v. Compania Caribe, \n339 \nU.S. 684, 688\n-689. To like effect is Rule 54 (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which, as amended in 1961, \n368 \nU.S., at 1015\n, allows appeals in multiple litigation from an express entry of \"final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties,\" but only when the trial judge certifies that \"there is no just reason for delay.\"\n\nDespite these statutory exceptions to, and judicial construction of, the requirement of finality, \"the final judgment rule is the dominant rule in federal appellate practice.\" 6 Moore, Federal Practice (2d ed. 1953), 113. Particularly is this true of criminal prosecutions. See, e. g., Parr v. United States, \n351 \nU.S. 513, 518\n-521. Every statutory exception is addressed either in terms or by necessary operation solely to civil actions. Moreover, the delays and disruptions attendant upon intermediate appeal are especially inimical to the effective and fair administration of the criminal law. The Sixth Amendment guarantees a speedy trial. Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure counsels construction of the Rules \"to secure simplicity in procedure, fairness in administration and the elimination of unjustifiable expense and delay\"; Rules 39 (d) and 50 assign preference to criminal cases on both trial and appellate dockets.\n\nAgain, the decisions according finality to civil orders in advance of an ultimately concluding judgment have rested on finding a particular claim to be independent, because \n\n[369 \nU.S. 121, 127]\n\u00a0\n \"fairly severable from the context of a larger litigious process.\" Swift & Co. v. Compania Caribe, supra, \n339 \nU.S., at 689\n. No such severability inheres in a motion seeking the suppression of evidence at a forthcoming trial; its disposition, as the Court recognized in Cogen v. United States, supra, \n278 \nU.S., at 223\n, \"will necessarily determine the conduct of the trial and may vitally affect the result.\" No less when it precedes indictment, the motion presents an issue that is involved in and will be part of a criminal prosecution in process at the time the order is issued.\n\nThe precise question before us has been much canvassed in the lower courts. It has not only produced a conflict among the circuits, but has provoked practical difficulties in the administration of criminal justice and caused expressions of dissatisfaction even in courts that have sustained an appeal. Although only the Fourth and Fifth Circuits have clearly departed from the Second Circuit's view,\n6\n the consensus in the others is far from unwavering.\n7\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 121, 128]\n\u00a0\n The First Circuit, for example, has declined to permit pretrial entertainment of any suppression motions other than those explicitly authorized by the language of Rule 41 (e). Centracchio v. Garrity, 198 F.2d 382, 386-389 (1952); accord, e. g., Benes v. Canary, 224 F.2d 470, 472 (C. A. 6th Cir. 1955). And see In re Fried, 161 F.2d 453, 465-466 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1947) (opinions of L. Hand and A. Hand, JJ.). These opinions manifest a disinclination to treat as separate and final rulings on the admissibility of evidence which depend on factual contentions that may be more appropriately resolved at a plenary trial. Similarly, a California District Court has recently dismissed for want of equity a pre-indictment bill to suppress, on the ground that, at the time relief would issue, there was an adequate remedy at law by motion in the criminal trial; and the Ninth Circuit refused an application for prerogative writs. Rodgers v. United States, 158 F. Supp. 670 (1958); id., at 684 note. See also Eastus v. Bradshaw, 94 F.2d 788 (C. A. 5th Cir. 1938). In the Third Circuit, which up to now has agreed with the Second, the latest opinion on the subject expresses doubts as to the validity \n\n[369 \nU.S. 121, 129]\n\u00a0\n of its precedents. United States v. Murphy, 290 F.2d 573, 575 n. 2 (1961).\n\nWe should decide the question here - we are free to do so - with due regard to historic principle and to the practicalities in the administration of criminal justice. An order granting or denying a pre-indictment motion to suppress does not fall within any class of independent proceedings otherwise recognized by this Court, and there is every practical reason for denying it such recognition. To regard such a disjointed ruling on the admissibility of a potential item of evidence in a forthcoming trial as the termination of an independent proceeding, with full panoply of appeal and attendant stay, entails serious disruption to the conduct of a criminal trial.\n8\n The fortuity of a pre-indictment motion may make of appeal an instrument of harassment, jeopardizing by delay the availability of other essential evidence. See Rodgers v. United States, supra, 158 F. Supp., at 673 n. 1. Furthermore, as cases in the Second Circuit make clear, appellate intervention makes for truncated presentation of the issue of admissibility, because the legality of the search too often cannot truly be determined until the evidence at the trial has brought all circumstances to light. See In re Milburne, 77 F.2d 310, 311 (1935); Grant v. United States, 291 F.2d 227, 229 (1961).\n9\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 121, 130]\n\u00a0\n\n\nNor are the considerations against appealability made less compelling as to orders granting motions to suppress, by the fact that the Government has no later right to appeal when and if the loss of evidence forces dismissal of its case. United States v. Pack, 247 F.2d 168 (C. A. 3d Cir. 1957); Umbriaco v. United States, 258 F.2d 625, 626 (C. A. 9th Cir. 1958). As the Ninth Circuit said of this circumstance, the Government is no more disadvantaged than in the case of an adverse ruling on the evidence during trial. United States v. Rosenwasser, 145 F.2d 1015, 1018 (1944). What disadvantage there be springs from the historic policy, over and above the constitutional protection against double jeopardy, that denies the Government the right of appeal in criminal cases save as expressly authorized by statute. United States v. Sanges, \n144 \nU.S. 310\n; United States v. Dickinson, \n213 \nU.S. 92, 102\n-103; Carroll v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 394, 400\n-403 and n. 9-12. No such expression appears in 28 U.S.C. 1291, and the Government's only right of appeal, given by the Criminal Appeals Act of 1907, 34 Stat. 1246, now 18 U.S.C. 3731, is confined to narrowly defined situations not relevant to our problem. Allowance of any further right must be sought from Congress and not this Court. Carroll v. United States, supra, \n354 \nU.S., at 407\n-408.\n\nIn the Narcotic Control Act of 1956, 201, 70 Stat. 567, 573, 18 U.S.C. 1404, Congress did grant the Government the right to appeal from orders granting pretrial motions to suppress the use of seized narcotics as \n\n[369 \nU.S. 121, 131]\n\u00a0\n evidence; but, though invited to do so,\n10\n it declined to extend this right to all suppression orders. Since then, each Congress has had before it bills to accomplish that extension,\n11\n at least one of which has been reported favorably.\n12\n As yet, however, none has been adopted.\n\nWe hold, accordingly, that the mere circumstance of a pre-indictment motion does not transmute the ensuing evidentiary ruling into an independent proceeding begetting finality even for purposes of appealability. Presentations before a United States Commissioner, Go-Bart Co. v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 344, 352\n-354, as well as before a grand jury, Cobbledick v. United States, \n309 \nU.S. 323, 327\n, are parts of the federal prosecutorial system leading to a criminal trial. Orders granting or denying suppression in the wake of such proceedings are truly interlocutory, for the criminal trial is then fairly in train. When at the time of ruling there is outstanding a complaint, or a detention or release on bail following arrest, or an arraignment, information, or indictment - in each such case the order on a suppression motion must be treated as \"but a step in the criminal case preliminary to the trial thereof.\" Cogen v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 221, 227\n. Only if the motion is solely for return of property \n\n[369 \nU.S. 121, 132]\n\u00a0\n and is in no way tied to a criminal prosecution in esse against the movant can the proceedings be regarded as independent. Ibid.; see Carroll v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 394, 404\n n. 17; In re Brenner, 6 F.2d 425 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1925).\n\nAn alternative ground for appealability in the Koenig case, likewise culled from dicta in some of our decisions, would assign independence to the suppression order because rendered in a different district from that of trial. Dier v. Banton, \n262 \nU.S. 147\n, the only holding pointed to, is clearly inapposite; it allowed an appeal from an order by a federal bankruptcy court permitting delivery of a bankrupt's papers to state prosecuting officials. Cf. Rea v. United States, \n350 \nU.S. 214\n; Wilson v. Schnettler, \n365 \nU.S. 381\n. There is a decision in the Second Circuit, United States v. Klapholz, 230 F.2d 494 (1956), allowing the Government an appeal from an order granting a post-indictment motion to suppress, apparently for the single reason that the motion was filed in the district of seizure rather than of trial; but the case was soon thereafter taken by a District Court to have counseled declining jurisdiction of such motions for reasons persuasive against allowing the appeal: \"This course will avoid a needless duplication of effort by two courts and provide a more expeditious resolution of the controversy besides avoiding the risk of determining prematurely and inadequately the admissibility of evidence at the trial. . . . A piecemeal adjudication such as that which would necessarily follow from a disposition of the motion here might conceivably result in prejudice either to the Government or the defendants, or both.\" United States v. Lester, 21 F. R. D. 30, 31 (D.C. S. D. N. Y. 1957). Rule 41 (e), of course, specifically provides for making of the motion in the district of seizure. On a summary hearing, however, the ruling there is likely always to be tentative. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 121, 133]\n\u00a0\n We think it accords most satisfactorily with sound administration of the Rules to treat such rulings as interlocutory.\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals in No. 21 is vacated and the cause is remanded with instructions to dismiss the appeal. In No. 93, the judgment is affirmed.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE STEWART concur in the result.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER took no part in the disposition of these cases.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Rule 41 (e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides:\n\n\"A person aggrieved by an unlawful search and seizure may move the district court for the district in which the property was seized for the return of the property and to suppress for use as evidence anything so obtained on the ground that (1) the property was illegally seized without warrant, or (2) the warrant is insufficient on its face, or (3) the property seized is not that described in the warrant, or (4) there was not probable cause for believing the existence of the grounds on which the warrant was issued, or (5) the warrant was illegally executed. The judge shall receive evidence on any issue of fact necessary to the decision of the motion. If the motion is granted the property shall be restored unless otherwise subject to lawful detention and it shall not be admissible in evidence at any hearing or trial. The motion to suppress evidence may also be made in the district where the trial is to be had. The motion shall be made before trial or hearing unless opportunity therefore did not exist or the defendant was not aware of the grounds for the motion, but the court in its discretion may entertain the motion at the trial or hearing.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Perlman v.

Reynolds, Attorney General of Wisconsin, and Beatrice Lampert, Assistant Attorney General, filed a brief for the Wisconsin Employment Relations Board, as amicus curiae, urging affirmance.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nSection 301 (a) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 provides:\n\n \"(a) Suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce as defined in this chapter, or between any such labor organizations, may be brought in any district court of the United States having jurisdiction of the parties, without respect to the amount in controversy \n\n[368 \nU.S. 502, 503]\n\u00a0\n or without regard to the citizenship of the parties.\"\n1\n\u00a0\n\n\n The sole question presented by this case is whether this federal statute operates to divest a state court of jurisdiction over a suit for violation of a contract between an employer and a labor organization.\n\nThe petitioner is an employer engaged in an industry affecting commerce as defined in the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947. The United Steelworkers of America, an international union, was the collective bargaining representative of the petitioner's production and maintenance employees, organized in Local 5158. A few \n\n[368 \nU.S. 502, 504]\n\u00a0\n weeks before the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement in 1957, negotiations were initiated between representatives of the union and of the petitioner with respect to proposals which the union had submitted for a new agreement. After a number of negotiating sessions, a \"Stipulation\" was signed by representatives of each party, continuing in effect many provisions of the old agreement, but providing for wage increases and making other changes with respect to holidays and vacations. The terms of the \"Stipulation\" were later embodied in a draft of a proposed new agreement. The petitioner originally announced to its employees that it would put into effect the wage changes and other provisions covered by the \"Stipulation\" and draft agreement, but a few weeks later notified its employees of its intention to terminate these changes and return \"to the rates in effect as of May 18, 1957.\" It was the petitioner's position that its bargaining representatives had acted without authority in negotiating the new agreement, and that the union had been so advised before any contract had actually been concluded.\n\nThe present action was then brought in the Superior Court of Massachusetts for Worcester County by the respondents, local union officers and a staff representative of the International Union. The complaint alleged that the plaintiffs \"fairly and adequately represent the interests of the entire membership\" of the union and Local 5158, and asked for a judgment declaring that there existed a valid and binding collective bargaining agreement, for an order enjoining the company from terminating or violating it, and for an accounting and damages. Responding to the complaint, the petitioner interposed several defenses, among them the contention that, by reason of 301 (a) of the Labor Management Relations Act, the state court had no jurisdiction over the controversy. \n\n[368 \nU.S. 502, 505]\n\u00a0\n The trial court rejected this attack upon its jurisdiction, determined on the merits that the collective bargaining agreement was \"valid and binding on the parties thereto,\" and entered a money judgment in conformity with the wage provisions of the agreement.\n\nThe Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts affirmed, expressly ruling that 301 (a) has not made the federal courts the exclusive arbiters of suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce. As Chief Justice Wilkins put it, \"We do not accept the contention that State courts are without jurisdiction. The statute does not so declare. The conferring of jurisdiction in actions at law upon the appropriate District Courts of the United States is not, in and of itself, a deprivation of an existing jurisdiction both at law and in equity in State courts. The case principally relied upon by the defendant, Textile Wkrs. Union of America v. Lincoln Mills, \n353 \nU.S. 448\n, does not so state. In the absence of a clear holding by the Supreme Court of the United States that Federal jurisdiction has been made exclusive, we shall not make what would be tantamount to an abdication of the hitherto undoubted jurisdiction of our own courts.\"\n2\n Certiorari was granted to consider \n\n[368 \nU.S. 502, 506]\n\u00a0\n the important question of federal law thus presented. \n365 \nU.S. 809\n. We agree with the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts that the courts of that Commonwealth had jurisdiction in this case, and we accordingly affirm the judgment before us.\n\nIt has not been argued, nor could it be, that 301 (a) speaks in terms of exclusivity of federal court jurisdiction over controversies within the statute's purview. On its face 301 (a) simply gives the federal district courts jurisdiction over suits for violation of certain specified types of contracts. The statute does not state nor even suggest that such jurisdiction shall be exclusive. It provides that suits of the kind described \"may\" be brought in the federal district courts, not that they must be.\n\nThe petitioner points out, however, that this Court held in Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills, \n353 \nU.S. 448\n, that 301 (a) is more than jurisdictional - that it authorizes federal courts to fashion, from the policy of our national labor laws, a body of federal law for the enforcement of agreements within its ambit. The Court recognized in that case that \"state law, if compatible with the purpose of 301, may be resorted to in order to find the rule that will best effectuate the federal policy,\" but \n\n[368 \nU.S. 502, 507]\n\u00a0\n emphasized that \"[a]ny state law applied . . . will be absorbed as federal law . . . .\" \n353 \nU.S., at 457\n.\n\nIt is argued that the rationale of Lincoln Mills would be frustrated if state courts were allowed to exercise concurrent jurisdiction over suits within the purview of 301 (a). The task of formulating federal common law in this area of labor management relations must be entrusted exclusively to the federal courts, it is said, because participation by the state courts would lead to a disharmony incompatible with the Lincoln Mills concept of an all-embracing body of federal law. Only the federal judiciary, the argument goes, possesses both the familiarity with federal labor legislation and the monolithic judicial system necessary for the proper achievement of the creative task envisioned by Lincoln Mills. An analogy is drawn to our decisions which have recognized the necessity of withdrawing from the state courts jurisdiction over controversies arguably subject to the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nWhatever the merits of this argument as a matter of policy, we find nothing to indicate that Congress adopted such a policy in enacting 301. The legislative history of the enactment nowhere suggests that, contrary to the clear import of the statutory language, Congress intended in enacting 301 (a) to deprive a party to a collective bargaining contract of the right to seek redress for its violation in an appropriate state tribunal.\n\nWe start with the premise that nothing in the concept of our federal system prevents state courts from enforcing rights created by federal law. Concurrent jurisdiction has been a common phenomenon in our judicial history, and exclusive federal court jurisdiction over cases arising under federal law has been the exception rather than the \n\n[368 \nU.S. 502, 508]\n\u00a0\n rule.\n4\n This Court's approach to the question of whether Congress has ousted state courts of jurisdiction was enunciated by Mr. Justice Bradley in Claflin v. Houseman, \n93 \nU.S. 130\n, and has remained unmodified through the years. \"The general question, whether State courts can exercise concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal courts in cases arising under the Constitution, laws, and treaties of the United States, has been elaborately discussed, both on the bench and in published treatises . . . [and] the result of these discussions has, in our judgment, been . . . to affirm the jurisdiction, where it is not excluded by express provision, or by incompatibility in its exercise arising from the nature of the particular case.\" \n93 \nU.S., at 136\n. See Robb v. Connolly, \n111 \nU.S. 624\n; Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 \nU.S. 1, 56\n-59; St. Louis, B. & M. R. Co. v. Taylor, \n266 \nU.S. 200\n; Garrett v. Moore-McCormack Co., \n317 \nU.S. 239, 245\n; Brown v. Gerdes, \n321 \nU.S. 178, 188\n (concurring opinion).\n5\n To hold that 301 (a) operates to deprive the state courts of a substantial segment of their established jurisdiction over contract actions would thus be to disregard this consistent history of hospitable acceptance of concurrent jurisdiction.\n\nSuch a construction of 301 (a) would also disregard the particularized history behind the enactment of that provision of the federal labor law. The legislative history makes clear that the basic purpose of 301 (a) was not to limit, but to expand, the availability of forums for the enforcement of contracts made by labor organizations. \n\n[368 \nU.S. 502, 509]\n\u00a0\n Moreover, there is explicit evidence that Congress expressly intended not to encroach upon the existing jurisdiction of the state courts.\n\nThe Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 represented a far-reaching and many-faceted legislative effort to promote the achievement of industrial peace through encouragement and refinement of the collective bargaining process. It was recognized from the outset that such an effort would be purposeless unless both parties to a collective bargaining agreement could have reasonable assurance that the contract they had negotiated would be honored. Section 301 (a) reflects congressional recognition of the vital importance of assuring the enforceability of such agreements.\n\nThe direct antecedent of 301 was 10 of the Case bill, H. R. 4908, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., which was passed by both Houses of the Congress, but vetoed by the President in 1946. In conferring upon the federal district courts jurisdiction over suits upon contracts made by labor organizations, that section of the Case bill contained provisions substantially the same for present purposes as the provisions of 301 at issue in this case.\n6\n\u00a0\n\n[368 \nU.S. 502, 510]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn considering these provisions of the proposed legislation in 1946, Congress manifested its complete awareness of both the existence and the limitations of state court remedies for violation of collective agreements. A principal motive behind the creation of federal jurisdiction in this field was the belief that the courts of many States could provide only imperfect relief because of rules of local law which made suits against labor organizations difficult or impossible, by reason of their status as unincorporated associations. The discussion between the supporters and opponents of this provision of the Case bill centered primarily on the nature and availability of existing state remedies. As a result, both factions collected and presented comprehensive data respecting the laws of the various States as to the status of labor organizations as legal entities. See, e. g., S. Rep. No. 1177, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., Minority Report, pp. 10-14; 92 Cong. Rec. 5412-5415.\n\nThe bill which the Senate originally passed the following year contained a provision making a breach of a collective bargaining agreement an unfair labor practice subject to the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board, S. 1126, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 8 (a) (6), \n\n[368 \nU.S. 502, 511]\n\u00a0\n 8 (b) (5), as well as a provision conferring jurisdiction upon the federal courts over suits for violation of collective agreements. In conference, however, it was decided to make collective bargaining agreements enforceable only in the courts. \"Once parties have made a collective bargaining contract,\" the conference report stated, \"the enforcement of that contract should be left to the usual processes of the law and not to the National Labor Relations Board.\" H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 510, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 42.\n\nThe report which accompanied the bill passed by the House of Representatives in 1947 explicitly acknowledged that the proposed 301 was a slightly recast version of 10 of the Case bill. H. R. Rep. No. 245, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 45. The record of the congressional debates on 301 of the 1947 Act reflects the same concern with the adequacy of the laws of the various States as had been expressed the previous year in the discussion of 10 of the Case bill. The Minority Report in the House in 1947 again discussed the availability of relief, the alternative means of recovery, and the scope of remedy in suits against labor organizations under the laws of the various States. H. R. Rep. No. 245, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 108-109. The Senate Report reproduced verbatim the detailed analysis of state procedural law which had been contained in the Senate Minority Report on the 1946 legislation. S. Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 15-18.\n\nThe clear implication of the entire record of the congressional debates in both 1946 and 1947 is that the purpose of conferring jurisdiction upon the federal district courts was not to displace, but to supplement, the thoroughly considered jurisdiction of the courts of the various States over contracts made by labor organizations. There seems to have been explicit mention of the question only once - in the Senate debate over 10 of the \n\n[368 \nU.S. 502, 512]\n\u00a0\n 1946 bill. A spokesman for the bill, Senator Ferguson, stated unequivocally that state court jurisdiction would not be ousted by enactment of the federal law:\n\n \"Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. President, there is nothing whatever in the now-being-considered amendment which takes away from the State courts all the present rights of the State courts to adjudicate the rights between parties in relation to labor agreements. The amendment merely says that the Federal courts shall have jurisdiction. It does not attempt to take away the jurisdiction of the State courts, and the mere fact that the Senator and I disagree does not change the effect of the amendment.\n\n\n \"Mr. MURRAY. But it authorizes the employers to bring suit in the Federal courts, if they so desire.\n\n\n \"Mr. FERGUSON. That is correct. That is all it does. It takes away no jurisdiction of the State courts.\" 92 Cong. Rec. 5708.\n\n\n Although the record of the 1947 debates contains no explicit statement of such precise relevance as Senator Ferguson's remarks in 1946, the entire tenor of the 1947 legislative history confirms that the purpose of 301, like its counterpart in the Case bill, was to fill the gaps in the jurisdictional law of some of the States, not to abolish existing state court jurisdiction. For example, Senator Ball, one of the Floor Leaders for the bill, stated:\n\n\"[W]e give to employers the right to sue a union in interstate commerce, in a Federal court, for violation of contract. It does not go beyond that. As a matter of law, I think they have that right, now, but because unions are voluntary associations, the common law in a great many States requires service on every member of the union, which is very difficult; . . .\" 93 Cong. Rec. 5014.\n7\n\u00a0\n\n[368 \nU.S. 502, 513]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n This basic purpose of 301 is epitomized in the Senate Report: \"It is apparent that until all jurisdictions, and particularly the Federal Government, authorize actions against labor unions as legal entities, there will not be the mutual responsibility necessary to vitalize collective-bargaining agreements.\" S. Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 17. It is obvious that Congress did not intend this remedial measure to destroy the foundation upon which it was built.\n\nThis Court, in holding that the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 operates to withdraw from the jurisdiction of the States controversies arguably subject to the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board, has delineated the specific considerations which led to that conclusion:\n\n \"Congress did not merely lay down a substantive rule of law to be enforced by any tribunal competent to apply law generally to the parties. It went on to confide primary interpretation and application of its rules to a specific and specially constituted tribunal and prescribed a particular procedure for investigation, complaint and notice, and hearing and decision, including judicial relief pending a final administrative order. Congress evidently considered that centralized administration of specially designed procedures was necessary to obtain uniform application of its substantive rules and to avoid these diversities and conflicts likely to result from a variety of local procedures and attitudes toward labor controversies.\" Garner v. Teamsters Union, \n346 \nU.S. 485, 490\n.\n\n\n By contrast, Congress expressly rejected that policy with respect to violations of collective bargaining agreements by rejecting the proposal that such violations be made unfair labor practices. Instead, Congress deliberately chose to leave the enforcement of collective agreements \"to the usual processes of the law.\" \n\n[368 \nU.S. 502, 514]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt is implicit in the choice Congress made that \"diversities and conflicts\" may occur, no less among the courts of the eleven federal circuits, than among the courts of the several States, as there evolves in this field of labor management relations that body of federal common law of which Lincoln Mills spoke. But this not necessarily unhealthy prospect is no more than the usual consequence of the historic acceptance of concurrent state and federal jurisdiction over cases arising under federal law. To resolve and accommodate such diversities and conflicts is one of the traditional functions of this Court.\n8\n\u00a0\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BLACK concurs in the result.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The remaining provisions of 301 are as follows:\n\n\"(b) Any labor organization which represents employees in an industry affecting commerce as defined in this chapter and any employer whose activities affect commerce as defined in this chapter shall be bound by the acts of its agents.

BAKERY WORKERS(1962)\nNo. 598\nArgued: April 18, 1962Decided: June 18, 1962\n\n\n\n\n Under 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, an employer sued a union for damages alleged to have resulted from the union's action in encouraging its members to strike or not to report for work on a certain day in violation of a no-strike clause contained in a collective bargaining agreement between the employer and the union. The contract provided for compulsory, final and binding arbitration, at the request of either party, of \"all complaints, disputes or grievances arising between [the parties] involving questions of interpretation or application of any clause or matter covered by this contract or any act or conduct or relation between the parties hereto, directly or indirectly.\" The union moved that the suit be stayed pending arbitration of the dispute, and it supported this motion by an affidavit denying that it had instigated a strike or encouraged its members not to work on the day in question. Held: The District Court properly stayed the action pending completion of arbitration. The contract here involved obligates the employer to arbitrate its claim for damages for forbidden strikes by the union, and there are no circumstances in this record which would justify relieving the employer of its duty to arbitrate the consequences of this one-day strike, intertwined as it is with the union's denials that there was any strike or any breach of contract. Pp. 255-267.\n\n (a) The employer's claim against the union for damages for an alleged strike in violation of the contract is clearly within the scope of the arbitration provisions of the contract here involved. Atkinson v. Sinclair Refining Co., ante, p. 238, distinguished. Pp. 256-260.\n\n\n (b) In the circumstances of this case, the alleged one-day strike was not such a breach or repudiation of the arbitration clause by the union that the employer was excused from arbitrating its claim for damages resulting therefrom. Pp. 260-266. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 254, 255]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n (c) On the record in this case, it cannot be said that the union is not entitled to a stay because it did not proceed with sufficient dispatch in seeking arbitration of the employer's damage claim against it. Pp. 266-267.\n\n\n 294 F.2d 399, affirmed.\n\nRobert Abelow argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs were Horace S. Manages and Marshall C. Berger.\n\nHoward N. Meyer argued the cause for respondents. With him on the briefs was Paul O'Dwyer.\n\nEdward Maguire filed a brief for the New York State AFL-CIO, as amicus curiae, urging affirmance.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe petitioning company brought this action for damages in the District Court under 301 (a) of the Taft-Hartley Act, alleging that the respondent union had violated the no-strike clause of the collective bargaining contract between the union and the company. The sole question in the case is whether the District Court was correct in holding that the employer's claim was an arbitrable matter under the contract and in ordering a stay of the action pending completion of arbitration. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the judgment of the District Court by an equally divided vote.\n1\n This Court granted certiorari (\n368 \nU.S. 975\n), and set the cause for argument immediately following Atkinson v. Sinclair Refining Co., ante, p. 238, decided this day. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 254, 256]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe company's business is baking and selling cakes and other bakery products. On December 16, 1959, the company notified the union and its employees that because Christmas and New Year's would fall on Fridays and because it was desirable to have fresh bakery products to sell on the Mondays following the holidays, employees would not work on the Thursdays before Christmas and New Year's but would work on the Saturdays following those holidays. Meetings between the union and the company on December 18 and December 22 ensued, the company's position being that it was exercising management's prerogative in rescheduling work, the union's that the proposed work schedule violated the collective bargaining contract and that the employees were not obligated to work on December 26 or January 2. A compromise arrangement was worked out for December 26, and 80 out of 190 employees reported on that day, a sufficient number to allow production to proceed. Further conversations on December 28 were not fruitful, however, and on Saturday, January 2, the company was unable to produce its goods because only 26 employees reported for work. The company promptly filed this damage action on January 4, 1960, alleging that the union instigated and encouraged its members to strike or not to report for work on January 2, all in violation of the no-strike clause contained in the collective bargaining contract. No answer has been filed by the union but the union's affidavit in support of the motion for stay stated what its answer would contain and specifically denied that the union had instigated a strike or encouraged its members not to work on January 2.\n\nAs was true in Atkinson, supra, the issue of arbitrability is a question for the courts and is to be determined by the contract entered into by the parties. \". . . [A] party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.\" United Steelworkers \n\n[370 \nU.S. 254, 257]\n\u00a0\n v. Warrior & Gulf Nav. Co., \n363 \nU.S. 574, 582\n. But the contract here is much different from the agreement in Atkinson. Under Article V\n2\n of the contract: \"The parties agree that they will promptly attempt to adjust all complaints, disputes or grievances arising between them involving questions of interpretation or application of any clause or matter covered by this contract or any act or conduct or relation between the parties hereto directly or indirectly.\"\n\nThis is broad language, indeed, and the procedure thereafter provided in Article V does not, as it did in Atkinson, exclude claims or complaints of the employer. It is provided that in the first instance the union will be represented by a committee and the shop chairman, and the employer by the shop manager. Failing adjustment at this stage, the issue is required to be submitted in writing by \"the party claiming to be aggrieved to the other party,\" \n\n[370 \nU.S. 254, 258]\n\u00a0\n whereupon the union and the plant manager are to attempt to reach a satisfactory agreement. If agreement is not reached within seven days from the time the issue is submitted in writing, either party \"shall have the right to refer the matter to arbitration . . . .\"\n\nArticle V does not stop with disputes \"involving questions of interpretation or application of any clause or matter\" covered by the contract. The adjustment and arbitration procedures are to apply to all complaints, all disputes and all grievances involving any act of either party, or any conduct of either party, or any relation between the parties, directly or indirectly. The company asserts that there was a strike by the union in violation of the no-strike clause. It therefore has a \"complaint\" against the union concerning the \"acts\" or \"conduct\" of the union. There is also involved a \"dispute\" between the union and the company, for the union denies that there was a strike at all, denies that it precipitated any strike, denies that the employees were obligated under the contract to work on that January 2, and itself claims that the employer breached the contract in scheduling work for the holidays.\n3\n Article V on its face easily reaches the employer's claim against the union for damages caused by an alleged strike in violation of the contract.\n\nThe company earnestly contends that the parties cannot have intended to arbitrate so fundamental a matter as a union strike in breach of contract, and that only an \n\n[370 \nU.S. 254, 259]\n\u00a0\n express inclusion of a damage claim by the employer would suffice to require arbitration. But it appears more reasonable to us to expect such a matter, if it is indeed so fundamental and so basic to the company under the contract, to have been excluded from the comprehensive language of Article V if the parties so intended. In Article VII.\n4\n which contains the no-strike provisions, the parties prohibited strikes, insulated the union, its officers and members from damages for strikes which the union did not authorize, and agreed that, even in the case of unauthorized strikes, the company would arbitrate disciplinary action taken against the strikers. In the face \n\n[370 \nU.S. 254, 260]\n\u00a0\n of the comprehensive language of Article V, it would have been most appropriate at this point for the parties to have excluded from the arbitration procedures the company's claim for strike damages, if they had intended to do so. Instead, the inclusive coverage of Article V was left intact.\n\nOf significance also are certain events which occurred in August 1959. At that time the company took issue with union conduct in connection with overtime work. Labeling this conduct an \"overtime strike\" and a \"breach of contract,\" the company wrote a letter to the State Mediation Board of New York saying that the contract with the union provided for arbitration of disputes before an arbitrator appointed by the Board and requesting the appointment of an arbitrator to \"determine the question of breach of contract and damages suffered by\" the company as a result of the strike. An award of damages against the union was requested, as was injunctive relief against a continuance of the overtime strike.\n5\n It would appear, then, that the company, just four months earlier in 1959, considered that the fundamental matter of a union-led strike was a dispute to be arbitrated under the provisions of the contract.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nThe company further asserts that even if it agreed in the contract to arbitrate union violations of the no-strike clause, it is excused by the union's breach from pursuing the post-breach remedies called for in the contract. The \n\n[370 \nU.S. 254, 261]\n\u00a0\n company does not deny that grievance and arbitration procedures under this contract - as is true generally (United Steelworkers v. Warrior & Gulf Nav. Co., \n363 \nU.S. 574, 584\n) - contemplate as a matter of course the arbitration of many alleged breaches of contract. Indeed, central to the company's position is its assertion that the union was bound to arbitrate, rather than strike over, its claim that the company breached the contract by scheduling Saturday work. But in its view, the union's violation of the no-strike clause is sui generis and so basic to what the employer bargained for in the contract and so inherently and \"fundamentally inconsistent with\" the grievance and arbitration procedures that the faithful observance of the no-strike clause by the union is a condition precedent to the employer's duty to arbitrate (even though he has promised to do so), or that the union must be deemed to have waived, or to be estopped from asserting, its right to arbitrate.\n\nHowever, this Court has prescribed no such inflexible rule rigidly linking no-strike and arbitration clauses of every collective bargaining contract in every situation.\n7\n The company has not attempted, or claimed the right, either to terminate the entire contract or to extinguish permanently its obligations under the arbitration provisions. Instead, it has sued for damages for an alleged strike and, as far as this record reveals, the contract continued in effect, as did the promises of the parties to arbitrate and the promise of the union not to strike. Moreover, in this \n\n[370 \nU.S. 254, 262]\n\u00a0\n case, under this contract, by agreeing to arbitrate all claims without excluding the case where the union struck over an arbitrable matter, the parties have negatived any intention to condition the duty to arbitrate upon the absence of strikes. They have thus cut the ground from under the argument that an alleged strike, automatically and regardless of the circumstances, is such a breach or repudiation of the arbitration clause by the union that the company is excused from arbitrating, upon theories of waiver, estoppel, or otherwise.\n8\n Arbitration provisions, which themselves have not been repudiated, are meant to survive breaches of contract, in many contexts, even total breach;\n9\n and in determining whether one party has so repudiated his promise to arbitrate that the other party is excused the circumstances of the claimed repudiation \n\n[370 \nU.S. 254, 263]\n\u00a0\n are critically important.\n10\n In this case the union denies having repudiated in any respect its promise to arbitrate, denies that there was a strike, denies that the employees were bound to work on January 2 and asserts that it was the company itself which ignored the adjustment and arbitration provisions by scheduling holiday work.\n\nIn passing 301, Congress was interested in the enforcement of collective bargaining contracts since it would \"promote a higher degree of responsibility upon the parties to such agreements, and will thereby promote industrial peace\" (S. Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 17). It was particularly interested in placing \"sanctions behind agreements to arbitrate grievance disputes\" (Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills, \n353 \nU.S. 448, 456\n). The preferred method for settling disputes was declared by Congress to be \"[f]inal adjustment by a method agreed upon by the parties\" ( 203 (d) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. 173 (d)). \"That policy can be effectuated only if the means chosen by the parties for settlement of their differences under a collective bargaining agreement is given full play\" (United Steelworkers v. American Mfg. Co., \n363 \nU.S. 564, 566\n). Under our federal labor policy, therefore, we have every reason to preserve the stabilizing influence of the \n\n[370 \nU.S. 254, 264]\n\u00a0\n collective bargaining contract in a situation such as this. We could enforce only the no-strike clause by refusing a stay in the suit for damages in the District Court. We can enforce both the no-strike clause and the agreement to arbitrate by granting a stay until the claim for damages is arbitrated. This we prefer to do.\n11\n\u00a0\n\nPetitioner relies upon decisions by various Courts of Appeals denying stays of damage suits for breach of no-strike clauses for want of arbitrability of the dispute.\n12\n Most of them, however, involved far more narrowly drawn arbitration clauses than that which is involved here.\n13\n And in at least two Court of Appeals decisions involving clauses of comparable breadth to that of the instant case, violations of no-strike clauses have been held to be arbitrable \n\n[370 \nU.S. 254, 265]\n\u00a0\n and suits for damages have been stayed pending arbitration.\n14\n\u00a0\n\nThis Court held in Mastro Plastics Corp. v. Labor Board, \n350 \nU.S. 270\n, that the employer did not have the right to replace employees who had struck over employer unfair labor practices, in the face of an absolute no-strike clause. It was said that, despite the broad prohibition of strikes in the contract, the parties could not have intended to waive the employees' right to strike over a flagrant unfair labor practice, absent an express statement in the contract to that effect. The company urges that Mastro precludes the result we have reached in this case. Mastro, however, involved a flagrant unfair labor practice by the company threatening the very existence of the union itself. A strike in violation of contract is not per se an unfair labor practice\n15\n and there is no suggestion in this record that the one-day strike involved here was of that nature. We do not decide in this case that in no circumstances would a strike in violation of the no-strike clause contained in this or other contracts entitle the employer to rescind or abandon the entire contract or to declare its promise to arbitrate forever discharged or to refuse to arbitrate its damage claims against the union. We do decide and hold that Article V of this contract obligates the company to arbitrate its claims for damages from forbidden strikes by the union and that there are no circumstances in this record which justify relieving \n\n[370 \nU.S. 254, 266]\n\u00a0\n the company of its duty to arbitrate the consequences of this one-day strike, intertwined as it is with the union's denials that there was any strike or any breach of contract at all.\n\nIf the union did strike in violation of the contract, the company is entitled to its damages; by staying this action, pending arbitration, we have no intention of depriving it of those damages. We simply remit the company to the forum it agreed to use for processing its strike damage claims. That forum, it is true, may be very different from a courtroom,\n16\n but we are not persuaded that the remedy there will be inadequate. Whether the damages to be awarded by the arbitrator would not normally be expected to serve as an \"effective\" deterrent to future strikes, which the company urges, is not a question to be answered in the abstract or in general terms. This question, as well as what result will best promote industrial peace, can only be answered in the factual context of particular cases. Here, the union claims it did not call a strike and that the men were not bound to work on January 2, basing its claim upon years of past practice under the contract. The dispute which this record presents appears to us to be one particularly suited for arbitration, if the parties have agreed to arbitrate. We hold that they did so agree and will hold the company to its bargain.\n\nA final matter is the company's suggestion that the union is not entitled to a stay because it has not proceeded with dispatch in seeking arbitration. The District Court held that the union was not in default, and we agree. If the company had a claim for damages, the contract provided for the company's attempting to adjust its claim by consulting with the union. Failing this, either party could take the matter to arbitration. The company's claim arose out of events which occurred on \n\n[370 \nU.S. 254, 267]\n\u00a0\n January 2. This case was filed on January 4. This was the first occasion for the union to insist upon its right to arbitrate the employer's claim for damages. This it promptly did by moving for a stay in the District Court.\n17\n As its conduct shows in a previous situation, the employer was aware of the procedure to be followed.\n18\n It should have followed it here.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment affirming the opinion of the District Court was correct, and, on the merits, the panel decision properly withdrawn.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Court of Appeals originally heard the appeal before a three-judge panel, which reversed the judgment below (287 F.2d 155). But rehearing was ordered before the active judges of the court, who divided 3-3 on the merits, and by a 4-2 vote withdrew the panel decision and affirmed the judgment below (294 F.2d 399). The propriety of this procedure was questioned in the petition for certiorari, but later petitioner abandoned the question.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] \"Article V - Grievance Procedure\n\n\"(a) The parties agree that they will promptly attempt to adjust all complaints, disputes or grievances arising between them involving questions of interpretation or application of any clause or matter covered by this contract or any act or conduct or relation between the parties hereto, directly or indirectly.\n\n\n\"In the adjustment of such matters the Union shall be represented in the first instance by the duly designated committee and the Shop Chairman and the Employer shall be represented by the Shop Management. It is agreed that in the handling of grievances there shall be no interference with the conduct of the business.\n\n\n\"(b) If the Committee and the Shop Management are unable to effect an adjustment, then the issue involved shall be submitted in writing by the party claiming to be aggrieved to the other party. The matter shall then be taken up for adjustment between the Union and the Plant Manager or other representative designated by management for the purpose. If no mutually satisfactory adjustment is reached by this means, or in any event within seven (7) days after the submission of the issue in writing as provided above, then either party shall have the right to refer the matter to arbitration as herein provided.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Immediately before the Christmas weekend in 1959, petitioner and respondent exchanged telegrams, in the course of which exchange respondent charged:\n\n\"We have informed you that we did not agree with, or accept your proposal to amend or alter past practice concerning holiday weekends. Your proposed schedule and your threats of disciplinary penalties violates contract and practice . . . . If you do not retract position we shall demand arbitration.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] \"Article VII - No Strikes\n\n\"(a) There shall be no strike, boycott, interruption of work, stoppage, temporary walk-out or lock-out for any reason during the terms of this contract except that if either party shall fail to abide by the decision of the Arbitrator, after receipt of such decision, under Article 6 of this contract, then the other party shall not be bound by this provision.\n\n\n\"(b) The parties agree as part of the consideration of this agreement that neither the International Union, the Local Union, or any of its officers, agents or members, shall be liable for damages for unauthorized stoppage, strikes, intentional slowdowns or suspensions of work if:\n\n \"(a) The Union gives written notice to the Company within twenty-four (24) hours of such action, copies of which shall be posted immediately by the Union on the bulletin board that it has not authorized the stoppage, strike, slowdown or suspension of work, and\n\n\n \"(b) if the Union further cooperates with the Company in getting the employees to return and remain at work.\n\n\n\n\"It is recognized that the Company has the right to take disciplinary action, including discharge, against any employee who engages in any unauthorized strike or work stoppage, subject to the Union's right to submit to arbitration in accordance with the agreement the question of whether or not the employee did engage in any unauthorized strike or work stoppage.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Apparently the employer's thought was that the federal law should borrow the New York rule which is that an arbitrator may award relief in the nature of an injunction, enforceable in the courts regardless of the New York statute similar to the Norris-LaGuardia Act. Ruppert v. Egelhofer, 3 N. Y. 2d 576, 148 N. E. 2d 129.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The union opposed arbitration of this dispute, claiming that there was no arbitrable controversy as to the claimed existence of an obligation to work overtime. The parties settled the controversy without conclusive determination of the arbitrability dispute.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] We do not understand the opinions in Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills, \n353 \nU.S. 448, 455\n, or United Steelworkers v. American Mfg. Co., \n363 \nU.S. 564, 567\n, to enunciate a flat and general rule that these two clauses are properly to be regarded as exact counterweights in every industrial setting, or to justify either party to the contract in wrenching them from their context in the collective agreement on the ground that they are mutually dependent covenants which are severable from the other promises between the parties.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] In Local 174 v. Lucas Flour Co., \n369 \nU.S. 95, 105\n-106, it was held that a clause requiring the parties to submit disputes to final determination by arbitration implied an obligation not to strike over such disputes. Accordingly, the Court upheld an employer's 301 breach of contract suit against the union for strike damages due to a walkout over an arbitrable dispute. In that case, unlike the present one, the union conceded that there had been a strike over a grievance which the union had agreed to submit to arbitration. The only question in dispute was liability vel non. The union did not contend that, and the Court did not consider whether, the employer's damage claim should have been taken to an arbitrator. And, of course, the Court did not consider whether the union's breach of the no-strike clause constituted a repudiation or waiver of arbitration of the damage claim.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] See In re Pahlberg Petition, 131 F.2d 968 (C.

One who flatly repudiates the provision for arbitration itself should have no right to the stay of a court action brought by the other party. But mere nonperformance, even though unjustified, is not per se a `repudiation.' One who asserts in good faith that the facts justify him in refusing performance of other provisions in the contract should not thereby lose his right to arbitration that he would otherwise have had. There is no inconsistency in his demanding arbitration at the same time that he asserts his legal privilege not to proceed with performance.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] Cf. Boone v. Eyre, 1 Bl.

JUSTICE HARLAN, dissenting.\n\nThe question presented in this case is whether the parties to this collective bargaining agreement intended that a court, rather than an arbitrator, should decide the employer's claim that the union had violated the no-strike clause of the agreement. Whether a strike in breach of contract has occurred and, if so, what damages have been suffered, are matters with respect to which a court of law can hardly be deemed less competent, as an adjudicator, than an arbitrator. There is no special reason to suppose that the parties preferred to submit this kind of a dispute to an arbitrator whose expertise is more likely to be in the area of employees' grievance claims, as in United Steelworkers v. Warrior & Gulf Navigation Co., \n363 \nU.S. 574, 580\n-582; United Steelworkers v. Enterprise Wheel & \n\n[370 \nU.S. 254, 268]\n\u00a0\n Car Corp., \n363 \nU.S. 593, 597\n-598. The less so, from the standpoint of the employer, when it is recognized that any damages awarded by an arbitrator would not be self-enforcing.\n\nIt would require more persuasive evidence than either this collective agreement or record affords to persuade me that it was contemplated that the employer would forego his statutory remedy under 301 respecting alleged violations of the no-strike clause of the collective agreement. I would reverse the judgment below substantially for the reasons given in the panel opinion of the Court of Appeals, 287 F.2d 155. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 254, 269]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","45":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEAGLE v.

JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\nThe respondent Board of Education of Union Free School District No. 9, New Hyde Park, New York, acting in its official capacity under state law, directed the School District's principal to cause the following prayer to be said aloud by each class in the presence of a teacher at the beginning of each school day:\n\n\"Almighty God, we acknowledge our dependence upon Thee, and we beg Thy blessings upon us, our parents, our teachers and our Country.\"\n\n\n\n This daily procedure was adopted on the recommendation of the State Board of Regents, a governmental agency created by the State Constitution to which the New York Legislature has granted broad supervisory, executive, and \n\n[370 \nU.S. 421, 423]\n\u00a0\n legislative powers over the State's public school system.\n1\n These state officials composed the prayer which they recommended and published as a part of their \"Statement on Moral and Spiritual Training in the Schools,\" saying: \"We believe that this Statement will be subscribed to by all men and women of good will, and we call upon all of them to aid in giving life to our program.\"\n\n\nShortly after the practice of reciting the Regents' prayer was adopted by the School District, the parents of ten pupils brought this action in a New York State Court insisting that use of this official prayer in the public schools was contrary to the beliefs, religions, or religious practices of both themselves and their children. Among other things, these parents challenged the constitutionality of both the state law authorizing the School District to direct the use of prayer in public schools and the School District's regulation ordering the recitation of this particular prayer on the ground that these actions of official governmental agencies violate that part of the First Amendment of the Federal Constitution which commands that \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion\" - a command which was \"made applicable to the State of New York by the Fourteenth Amendment of the said Constitution.\" The New York Court of Appeals, over the dissents of Judges Dye and Fuld, sustained an order of the lower state courts which had upheld the power of New York to use the Regents' prayer as a part of the daily procedures of its public schools so long as the schools did not compel any pupil to join in the prayer over his or his parents' objection.\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 421, 424]\n\u00a0\n We granted certiorari to review this important decision involving rights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\n3\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe think that by using its public school system to encourage recitation of the Regents' prayer, the State of New York has adopted a practice wholly inconsistent with the Establishment Clause. There can, of course, be no doubt that New York's program of daily classroom invocation of God's blessings as prescribed in the Regents' prayer is a religious activity. It is a solemn avowal of divine faith and supplication for the blessings of the Almighty. The nature of such a prayer has always been \n\n[370 \nU.S. 421, 425]\n\u00a0\n religious, none of the respondents has denied this and the trial court expressly so found:\n\n\"The religious nature of prayer was recognized by Jefferson and has been concurred in by theological writers, the United States Supreme Court and State courts and administrative officials, including New York's Commissioner of Education. A committee of the New York Legislature has agreed.\n\n\n \"The Board of Regents as amicus curiae, the respondents and intervenors all concede the religious nature of prayer, but seek to distinguish this prayer because it is based on our spiritual heritage. . . .\"\n4\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The petitioners contend among other things that the state laws requiring or permitting use of the Regents' prayer must be struck down as a violation of the Establishment Clause because that prayer was composed by governmental officials as a part of a governmental program to further religious beliefs. For this reason, petitioners argue, the State's use of the Regents' prayer in its public school system breaches the constitutional wall of separation between Church and State. We agree with that contention since we think that the constitutional prohibition against laws respecting an establishment of religion must at least mean that in this country it is no part of the business of government to compose official prayers for any group of the American people to recite as a part of a religious program carried on by government.\n\n\nIt is a matter of history that this very practice of establishing governmentally composed prayers for religious services was one of the reasons which caused many of our early colonists to leave England and seek religious freedom in America. The Book of Common Prayer, \n\n[370 \nU.S. 421, 426]\n\u00a0\n which was created under governmental direction and which was approved by Acts of Parliament in 1548 and 1549,\n5\n set out in minute detail the accepted form and content of prayer and other religious ceremonies to be used in the established, tax-supported Church of England.\n6\n The controversies over the Book and what should be its content repeatedly threatened to disrupt the peace of that country as the accepted forms of prayer in the established church changed with the views of the particular ruler that happened to be in control at the time.\n7\n Powerful groups representing some of the varying religious views of the people struggled among themselves to impress their particular views upon the Government and \n\n[370 \nU.S. 421, 427]\n\u00a0\n obtain amendments of the Book more suitable to their respective notions of how religious services should be conducted in order that the official religious establishment would advance their particular religious beliefs.\n8\n Other groups, lacking the necessary political power to influence the Government on the matter, decided to leave England and its established church and seek freedom in America from England's governmentally ordained and supported religion.\n\n\nIt is an unfortunate fact of history that when some of the very groups which had most strenuously opposed the established Church of England found themselves sufficiently in control of colonial governments in this country to write their own prayers into law, they passed laws making their own religion the official religion of their respective colonies.\n9\n Indeed, as late as the time of the Revolutionary \n\n[370 \nU.S. 421, 428]\n\u00a0\n War, there were established churches in at least eight of the thirteen former colonies and established religions in at least four of the other five.\n10\n But the successful Revolution against English political domination was shortly followed by intense opposition to the practice of establishing religion by law. This opposition crystallized rapidly into an effective political force in Virginia where the minority religious groups such as Presbyterians, Lutherans, Quakers and Baptists had gained such strength that the adherents to the established Episcopal Church were actually a minority themselves. In 1785-1786, those opposed to the established Church, led by James Madison and Thomas Jefferson, who, though themselves not members of any of these dissenting religious groups, opposed all religious establishments by law on grounds of principle, obtained the enactment of the famous \"Virginia Bill for Religious Liberty\" by which all religious groups were placed on an equal footing so far as the State was concerned.\n11\n Similar though less far-reaching \n\n[370 \nU.S. 421, 429]\n\u00a0\n legislation was being considered and passed in other States.\n12\n\u00a0\n\n\nBy the time of the adoption of the Constitution, our history shows that there was a widespread awareness among many Americans of the dangers of a union of Church and State. These people knew, some of them from bitter personal experience, that one of the greatest dangers to the freedom of the individual to worship in his own way lay in the Government's placing its official stamp of approval upon one particular kind of prayer or one particular form of religious services. They knew the anguish, hardship and bitter strife that could come when zealous religious groups struggled with one another to obtain the Government's stamp of approval from each King, Queen, or Protector that came to temporary power. The Constitution was intended to avert a part of this danger by leaving the government of this country in the hands of the people rather than in the hands of any monarch. But this safeguard was not enough. Our Founders were no more willing to let the content of their prayers and their privilege of praying whenever they pleased be influenced by the ballot box than they were to let these vital matters of personal conscience depend upon the succession of monarchs. The First Amendment was added to the Constitution to stand as a guarantee that neither the power nor the prestige of the Federal Government would be used to control, support or influence the kinds of prayer the American people can say - \n\n[370 \nU.S. 421, 430]\n\u00a0\n that the people's religious must not be subjected to the pressures of government for change each time a new political administration is elected to office. Under that Amendment's prohibition against governmental establishment of religion, as reinforced by the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, government in this country, be it state or federal, is without power to prescribe by law any particular form of prayer which is to be used as an official prayer in carrying on any program of governmentally sponsored religious activity.\n\n\nThere can be no doubt that New York's state prayer program officially establishes the religious beliefs embodied in the Regents' prayer. The respondents' argument to the contrary, which is largely based upon the contention that the Regents' prayer is \"non-denominational\" and the fact that the program, as modified and approved by state courts, does not require all pupils to recite the prayer but permits those who wish to do so to remain silent or be excused from the room, ignores the essential nature of the program's constitutional defects. Neither the fact that the prayer may be denominationally neutral nor the fact that its observance on the part of the students is voluntary can serve to free it from the limitations of the Establishment Clause, as it might from the Free Exercise Clause, of the First Amendment, both of which are operative against the States by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment. Although these two clauses may in certain instances overlap, they forbid two quite different kinds of governmental encroachment upon religious freedom. The Establishment Clause, unlike the Free Exercise Clause, does not depend upon any showing of direct governmental compulsion and is violated by the enactment of laws which establish an official religion whether those laws operate directly to coerce nonobserving individuals or not. This is not to say, of course, that \n\n[370 \nU.S. 421, 431]\n\u00a0\n laws officially prescribing a particular form of religious worship do not involve coercion of such individuals. When the power, prestige and financial support of government is placed behind a particular religious belief, the indirect coercive pressure upon religious minorities to conform to the prevailing officially approved religion is plain. But the purposes underlying the Establishment Clause go much further than that. Its first and most immediate purpose rested on the belief that a union of government and religion tends to destroy government and to degrade religion. The history of governmentally established religion, both in England and in this country, showed that whenever government had allied itself with one particular form of religion, the inevitable result had been that it had incurred the hatred, disrespect and even contempt of those who held contrary beliefs.\n13\n That same history showed that many people had lost their respect for any religion that had relied upon the support of government to spread its faith.\n14\n The Establishment Clause \n\n[370 \nU.S. 421, 432]\n\u00a0\n thus stands as an expression of principle on the part of the Founders of our Constitution that religion is too personal, too sacred, too holy, to permit its \"unhallowed perversion\" by a civil magistrate.\n15\n Another purpose of the Establishment Clause rested upon an awareness of the historical fact that governmentally established religions and religious persecutions go hand in hand.\n16\n The Founders knew that only a few years after the Book of Common Prayer became the only accepted form of religious services in the established Church of England, an Act of Uniformity was passed to compel all Englishmen to attend those services and to make it a criminal offense to conduct or attend religious gatherings of any other kind\n17\n - a law \n\n[370 \nU.S. 421, 433]\n\u00a0\n which was consistently flouted by dissenting religious groups in England and which contributed to widespread persecutions of people like John Bunyan who persisted in holding \"unlawful [religious] meetings . . . to the great disturbance and distraction of the good subjects of this kingdom . . . .\"\n18\n And they knew that similar persecutions had received the sanction of law in several of the colonies in this country soon after the establishment of official religions in those colonies.\n19\n It was in large part to get completely away from this sort of systematic religious persecution that the Founders brought into being our Nation, our Constitution, and our Bill of Rights with its prohibition against any governmental establishment of religion. The New York laws officially prescribing the Regents' prayer are inconsistent both with the purposes of the Establishment Clause and with the Establishment Clause itself.\n\n\nIt has been argued that to apply the Constitution in such a way as to prohibit state laws respecting an \n\n[370 \nU.S. 421, 434]\n\u00a0\n establishment of religious services in public schools is to indicate a hostility toward religion or toward prayer. Nothing, of course, could be more wrong. The history of man is inseparable from the history of religion. And perhaps it is not too much to say that since the beginning of that history many people have devoutly believed that \"More things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of.\" It was doubtless largely due to men who believed this that there grew up a sentiment that caused men to leave the cross-currents of officially established state religions and religious persecution in Europe and come to this country filled with the hope that they could find a place in which they could pray when they pleased to the God of their faith in the language they chose.\n20\n And there were men of this same faith in the \n\n[370 \nU.S. 421, 435]\n\u00a0\n power of prayer who led the fight for adoption of our Constitution and also for our Bill of Rights with the very guarantees of religious freedom that forbid the sort of governmental activity which New York has attempted here. These men knew that the First Amendment, which tried to put an end to governmental control of religion and of prayer, was not written to destroy either. They knew rather that it was written to quiet well-justified fears which nearly all of them felt arising out of an awareness that governments of the past had shackled men's tongues to make them speak only the religious thoughts that government wanted them to speak and to pray only to the God that government wanted them to pray to. It is neither sacrilegious nor antireligious to say that each separate government in this country should stay out of the business of writing or sanctioning official prayers and leave that purely religious function to the people themselves and to those the people choose to look to for religious guidance.\n21\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 421, 436]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt is true that New York's establishment of its Regents' prayer as an officially approved religious doctrine of that State does not amount to a total establishment of one particular religious sect to the exclusion of all others - that, indeed, the governmental endorsement of that prayer seems relatively insignificant when compared to the governmental encroachments upon religion which were commonplace 200 years ago. To those who may subscribe to the view that because the Regents' official prayer is so brief and general there can be no danger to religious freedom in its governmental establishment, however, it may be appropriate to say in the words of James Madison, the author of the First Amendment:\n\n\"[I]t is proper to take alarm at the first experiment on our liberties. . . . Who does not see that the same authority which can establish Christianity, in exclusion of all other Religions, may establish with the same ease any particular sect of Christians, in exclusion of all other Sects? That the same authority which can force a citizen to contribute three pence only of his property for the support of any one establishment, may force him to conform to any other establishment in all cases whatsoever?\"\n22\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals of New York is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the decision of this case.\n\n\nMR.

It is enough on this score, however, that regulations, such as were adopted by New York City's Board of Education in connection with its released time program, be adopted, making clear that neither teachers nor any other school authority may comment on participation or nonparticipation in the exercise nor suggest or require that any posture or language be used or dress be worn or be not used or not worn. Nonparticipation may take the form either of remaining silent during the exercise, or if the parent or child so desires, of being excused entirely from the exercise. Such regulations must also make provision for those nonparticipants who are to be excused from the prayer exercise. The exact provision to be made is a matter for decision by the board, rather than the court, within the framework of constitutional requirements. Within that framework would fall a provision that prayer participants proceed to a common assembly while nonparticipants attend other rooms, or that nonparticipants be permitted to arrive at school a few minutes late or to attend separate opening exercises, or any other method which treats with equality both participants and nonparticipants.\" 18 Misc. 2d, at 696, 191 N.

In 1553, Edward VI died and was succeeded by Mary who abolished the Book of Common Prayer entirely. 1 Mary, c. 2. But upon the accession of Elizabeth in 1558, the Book was restored with important alterations from the form it had been given by Edward VI. 1 Elizabeth, c. 2. The resentment to this amended form of the Book was kept firmly under control during the reign of Elizabeth but, upon her death in 1603, a petition signed by more than 1,000 Puritan ministers was presented to King James I asking for further alterations in the Book. Some alterations were made and the Book retained substantially this form until it was completely suppressed again in 1645 as a result of the successful Puritan Revolution. Shortly after the restoration in 1660 of Charles II, the Book was again reintroduced, 13 & 14 Charles II, c. 4, and again with alterations. Rather than accept this form of the Book some 2,000 Puritan ministers vacated their benefices. See generally Pullan, The History of the Book of Common Prayer (1900), pp. vii-xvi; Encyclopaedia Britannica (1957 ed.), Vol. 18, pp. 421-422.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] For example, the Puritans twice attempted to modify the Book of Common Prayer and once attempted to destroy it. The story of their struggle to modify the Book in the reign of Charles I is vividly summarized in Pullan, History of the Book of Common Prayer, at p. xiii: \"The King actively supported those members of the Church of England who were anxious to vindicate its Catholic character and maintain the ceremonial which Elizabeth had approved. Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury, was the leader of this school. Equally resolute in his opposition to the distinctive tenets of Rome and of Geneva, he enjoyed the hatred of both Jesuit and Calvinist. He helped the Scottish bishops, who had made large concessions to the uncouth habits of Presbyterian worship, to draw up a Book of Common Prayer for Scotland. It contained a Communion Office resembling that of the book of 1549. It came into use in 1637, and met with a bitter and barbarous opposition. The vigour of the Scottish Protestants strengthened the hands of their English sympathisers. Laud and Charles were executed, Episcopacy was abolished, the use of the Book of Common Prayer was prohibited.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] For a description of some of the laws enacted by early theocratic governments in New England, see Parrington, Main Currents in American Thought (1930), Vol. 1, pp. 5-50; Whipple, Our Ancient Liberties (1927), pp. 63-78; Wertenbaker, The Puritan Oligarchy (1947).\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] The Church of England was the established church of at least five colonies: Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia. There seems to be some controversy as to whether that church was officially established in New York and New Jersey but there is no doubt that it received substantial support from those States. See Cobb, The Rise of Religious Liberty in America (1902), pp. 338, 408. In Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Connecticut, the Congregationalist Church was officially established. In Pennsylvania and Delaware, all Christian sects were treated equally in most situations but Catholics were discriminated against in some respects. See generally Cobb, The Rise of Religious Liberty in America (1902). In Rhode Island all Protestants enjoyed equal privileges but it is not clear whether Catholics were allowed to vote.

Williams, who was one of the earliest exponents of the doctrine of separation of church and state, believed that separation was necessary in order to protect the church from the danger of destruction which he thought inevitably flowed from control by even the best-intentioned civil authorities: \"The unknowing zeale of Constantine and other Emperours, did more hurt to Christ Jesus his Crowne and Kingdome, then the raging fury of the most bloody Neroes. In the persecutions of the later, Christians were sweet and fragrant, like spice pounded and beaten in morters: But those good Emperours, persecuting some erroneous persons, Arrius, & c. and advancing the professours of some Truths of Christ (for there was no small number of Truths lost in those times) and maintaining their Religion by the materiall Sword, I say by this meanes Christianity was ecclipsed, and the Professors of it fell asleep . . . .\" Williams, The Bloudy Tenent, of Persecution, for cause of Conscience, discussed in A Conference between Truth and Peace (London, 1644), reprinted in Narragansett Club Publications, Vol. III, p. 184. To Williams, it was no part of the business or competence of a civil magistrate to interfere in religious matters: \"[W]hat imprudence and indiscretion is it in the most common \n\n[370 \nU.S. 421, 435]\n\u00a0\n affaires of Life, to conceive that Emperours, Kings and Rulers of the earth must not only be qualified with politicall and state abilities to make and execute such Civill Lawes which may concerne the common rights, peace and safety (which is worke and businesse, load and burthen enough for the ablest shoulders in the Commonweal) but also furnished with such Spirituall and heavenly abilities to governe the Spirituall and Christian Commonweale . . . .\" Id., at 366. See also id., at 136-137.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 21\n] There is of course nothing in the decision reached here that is inconsistent with the fact that school children and others are officially encouraged to express love for our country by reciting historical documents such as the Declaration of Independence which contain references to the Deity or by singing officially espoused anthems which include the composer's professions of faith in a Supreme Being, or with the fact that there are many manifestations in our public life of belief in God. Such patriotic or ceremonial occasions bear no true resemblance to the unquestioned religious exercise that the State of New York has sponsored in this instance.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 22\n] Memorial and Remonstrance against Religious Assessments, II Writings of Madison 183, at 185-186. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 421, 437]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, concurring.\n\n\nIt is customary in deciding a constitutional question to treat it in its narrowest form. Yet at times the setting of the question gives it a form and content which no abstract treatment could give. The point for decision is whether the Government can constitutionally finance a religious exercise. Our system at the federal and state levels is presently honeycombed with such financing.\n1\n Nevertheless, I think it is an unconstitutional undertaking whatever form it takes.\n\n\nFirst, a word as to what this case does not involve. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 421, 438]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nPlainly, our Bill of Rights would not permit a State or the Federal Government to adopt an official prayer and penalize anyone who would not utter it. This, however, is not that case, for there is no element of compulsion or coercion in New York's regulation requiring that public schools be opened each day with the following prayer:\n\n\"Almighty God, we acknowledge our dependence upon Thee, and we beg Thy blessings upon us, our parents, our teachers and our Country.\"\n\n\n\n The prayer is said upon the commencement of the school day, immediately following the pledge of allegiance to the flag. The prayer is said aloud in the presence of a teacher, who either leads the recitation or selects a student to do so. No student, however, is compelled to take part. The respondents have adopted a regulation which provides that \"Neither teachers nor any school authority shall comment on participation or non-participation . . . nor suggest or request that any posture or language be used or dress be worn or be not used or not worn.\" Provision is also made for excusing children, upon written request of a parent or guardian, from the saying of the prayer or from the room in which the prayer is said. A letter implementing and explaining this regulation has been sent to each taxpayer and parent in the school district. As I read this regulation, a child is free to stand or not stand, to recite or not recite, without fear of reprisal or even comment by the teacher or any other school official.\n\n\nIn short, the only one who need utter the prayer is the teacher; and no teacher is complaining of it. Students can stand mute or even leave the classroom, if they desire.\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 421, 439]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nMcCollum v. Board of Education, \n333 \nU.S. 203\n, does not decide this case. It involved the use of public school facilities for religious education of students. Students either had to attend religious instruction or \"go to some other place in the school building for pursuit of their secular studies. . . . Reports of their presence or absence were to be made to their secular teachers.\" Id., at 209. The influence of the teaching staff was therefore brought to bear on the student body, to support the instilling of religious principles. In the present case, school facilities are used to say the prayer and the teaching staff is employed to lead the pupils in it. There is, however, no effort at indoctrination and no attempt at exposition. Prayers of course may be so long and of such a character as to amount to an attempt at the religious instruction that was denied the public schools by the McCollum case. But New York's prayer is of a character that does not involve any element of proselytizing as in the McCollum case.\n\n\nThe question presented by this case is therefore an extremely narrow one. It is whether New York oversteps the bounds when it finances a religious exercise.\n\n\nWhat New York does on the opening of its public schools is what we do when we open court. Our Crier has from the beginning announced the convening of the Court and then added \"God save the United States and this Honorable Court.\" That utterance is a supplication, a prayer in which we, the judges, are free to join, but which we need not recite any more than the students need recite the New York prayer.\n\n\nWhat New York does on the opening of its public schools is what each House of Congress\n3\n does at the opening \n\n[370 \nU.S. 421, 440]\n\u00a0\n of each day's business.\n4\n Reverend Frederick B. Harris is Chaplain of the Senate; Reverend Bernard Braskamp is Chaplain of the House. Guest chaplains of various denominations also officiate.\n5\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 421, 441]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIn New York the teacher who leads in prayer is on the public payroll; and the time she takes seems minuscule as compared with the salaries appropriated by state legislatures and Congress for chaplains to conduct prayers in the legislative halls. Only a bare fraction of the teacher's time is given to reciting this short 22-word prayer, about the same amount of time that our Crier spends announcing the opening of our sessions and offering a prayer for this Court. Yet for me the principle is the same, no matter how briefly the prayer is said, for in each of the instances given the person praying is a public official on the public payroll, performing a religious exercise in a governmental institution.\n6\n It is said that the \n\n[370 \nU.S. 421, 442]\n\u00a0\n element of coercion is inherent in the giving of this prayer. If that is true here, it is also true of the prayer with which this Court is convened, and of those that open the Congress. Few adults, let alone children, would leave our courtroom or the Senate or the House while those prayers are being given. Every such audience is in a sense a \"captive\" audience.\n\n\nAt the same time I cannot say that to authorize this prayer is to establish a religion in the strictly historic meaning of those words.\n7\n A religion is not established in the usual sense merely by letting those who choose to do so say the prayer that the public school teacher leads. Yet once government finances a religious exercise it inserts a divisive influence into our communities.\n8\n The New York Court said that the prayer given does not conform to all of the tenets of the Jewish, Unitarian, and Ethical Culture groups. One of the petitioners is an agnostic.\n\n\"We are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being.\" Zorach v. Clauson, \n343 \nU.S. 306, 313\n. Under our Bill of Rights free play is given for \n\n[370 \nU.S. 421, 443]\n\u00a0\n making religion an active force in our lives.\n9\n But \"if a religious leaven is to be worked into the affairs of our people, it is to be done by individuals and groups, not by the Government.\" McGowan v. Maryland, \n366 \nU.S. 420, 563\n (dissenting opinion). By reason of the First Amendment government is commanded \"to have no interest in theology or ritual\" (id., at 564), for on those matters \"government must be neutral.\" Ibid. The First Amendment leaves the Government in a position not of hostility to religion but of neutrality. The philosophy is that the atheist or agnostic - the nonbeliever - is entitled to go his own way. The philosophy is that if government interferes in matters spiritual, it will be a divisive force. The First Amendment teaches that a government neutral in the field of religion better serves all religious interests.\n\n\n\n My problem today would be uncomplicated but for Everson v. Board of Education, \n330 \nU.S. 1, 17\n, which allowed taxpayers' money to be used to pay \"the bus fares of parochial school pupils as a part of a general program under which\" the fares of pupils attending public and other schools were also paid. The Everson case seems in retrospect to be out of line with the First Amendment. Its result is appealing, as it allows aid to be given to needy children. Yet by the same token, public funds could be used to satisfy other needs of children in parochial schools - lunches, books, and tuition being obvious examples. Mr. Justice Rutledge stated in dissent what I think is durable First Amendment philosophy:\n\n  \"The reasons underlying the Amendment's policy  have not vanished with time or diminished in force. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 421, 444]\n\u00a0\n  Now as when it was adopted the price of religious  freedom is double. It is that the church and religion  shall live both within and upon that freedom. There  cannot be freedom of religion, safeguarded by the  state, and intervention by the church or its agencies  in the state's domain or dependency on its largesse.  Madison's Remonstrance, Par. 6, 8. The great condition  of religious liberty is that it be maintained free  from sustenance, as also from other interferences,  by the state. For when it comes to rest upon that  secular foundation it vanishes with the resting. Id.,  Par. 7, 8. Public money devoted to payment of  religious costs, educational or other, brings the quest  for more. It brings too the struggle of sect against  sect for the larger share or for any. Here one by  numbers alone will benefit most, there another.  That is precisely the history of societies which have  had an established religion and dissident groups. Id.,  Par. 8, 11. It is the very thing Jefferson and Madison  experienced and sought to guard against, whether in  its blunt or in its more screened forms. Ibid. The  end of such strife cannot be other than to destroy  the cherished liberty. The dominating group will  achieve the dominant benefit; or all will embroil the  state in their dissensions. Id., Par. 11.\" Id., pp.  53-54.\n\n\n\n What New York does with this prayer is a break with that tradition. I therefore join the Court in reversing the judgment below.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"There are many `aids' to religion in this country at all levels of government. To mention but a few at the federal level, one might begin by observing that the very First Congress which wrote the First Amendment provided for chaplains in both Houses and in the armed services. There is compulsory chapel at the service academies, and religious services are held in federal hospitals and prisons. The President issues religious proclamations. The Bible is used for the administration of oaths. N. Y. A. and W. P. A. funds were available to parochial schools during the depression. Veterans receiving money under the `G. I.' Bill of 1944 could attend denominational schools, to which payments were made directly by the government. During World War II, federal money was contributed to denominational schools for the training of nurses. The benefits of the National School Lunch Act are available to students in private as well as public schools. The Hospital Survey and Construction Act of 1946 specifically made money available to non-public hospitals. The slogan `In God We Trust' is used by the Treasury Department, and Congress recently added God to the pledge of allegiance. There is Bible-reading in the schools of the District of Columbia, and religious instruction is given in the District's National Training School for Boys. Religious organizations are exempt from the federal income tax and are granted postal privileges. Up to defined limits - 15 per cent of the adjusted gross income of individuals and 5 per cent of the net income of corporations - contributions to religious organizations are deductible for federal income tax purposes. There are no limits to the deductibility of gifts and bequests to religious institutions made under the federal gift and estate tax laws. This list of federal `aids' could easily be expanded, and of course there is a long list in each state.\" Fellman, The Limits of Freedom (1959), pp. 40-41.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] West Point Cadets are required to attend chapel each Sunday. Reg., c. 21, 2101. The same requirement obtains at the Naval Academy (Reg., c. 9, 0901, (1) (a)), and at the Air Force Academy except First Classmen. Catalogue, 1962-1963, p. 110. And see Honeywell, \n\n[370 \nU.S. 421, 439]\n\u00a0\n Chaplains of the United States Army (1958): Jorgensen, The Service of Chaplains to Army Air Units, 1917-1946, Vol. I (1961).\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The New York Legislature follows the same procedure. See, e. g., Vol. 1, N. Y. Assembly Jour., 184th Sess., 1961, p. 8: Vol. 1, N. Y. Senate Jour., 184th Sess., 1961, p. 5.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Rules of the Senate provide that each calendar day's session shall open with prayer. See Rule III, Senate Manual, S. Doc. No. 2, 87th Cong., 1st Sess. The same is true of the Rules of the House. See Rule VII, Rules of the House of Representatives, H. R. Doc. No. 459, 86th Cong., 2d Sess. The Chaplains of the Senate and of the House receive $8,810 annually. See 75 Stat. 320, 324.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] It would, I assume, make no difference in the present case if a different prayer were said every day or if the ministers of the community rotated, each giving his own prayer. For some of the petitioners in the present case profess no religion.\n\n\nThe Pledge of Allegiance, like the prayer, recognizes the existence of a Supreme Being. Since 1954 it has contained the words \"one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\" 36 U.S.C. 172. The House Report recommending the addition of the words \"under God\" stated that those words in no way run contrary to the First Amendment but recognize \"only the guidance of God in our national affairs.\" H. R. Rep. No. 1693, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 3. And see S. Rep. No. 1287, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. Senator Ferguson, who sponsored the measure in the Senate, pointed out that the words \"In God We Trust\" are over the entrance to the Senate Chamber. 100 Cong. Rec. 6348. He added:\n\n\"I have felt that the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag which stands for the United States of America should recognize the Creator who we really believe is in control of the destinies of this great Republic.\n\n\n\"It is true that under the Constitution no power is lodged anywhere to establish a religion. This is not an attempt to establish a religion; it has nothing to do with anything of that kind. It relates to belief in God, in whom we sincerely repose our trust. We know that America cannot be defended by guns, planes, and ships alone. Appropriations and expenditures for defense will be of value only if the God under whom we live believes that we are in the right. We should at all times recognize God's province over the lives of our people and over this great Nation.\" Ibid. And see 100 Cong. Rec. 7757 et seq. for the debates in the House.\n\n\n\n The Act of March 3, 1865, 13 Stat. 517, 518, authorized the phrase \"In God We Trust\" to be placed on coins. And see 17 Stat. 427. The first mandatory requirement for the use of that motto on coins \n\n[370 \nU.S. 421, 441]\n\u00a0\n was made by the Act of May 18, 1908, 35 Stat. 164. See H. R. Rep. No. 1106, 60th Cong., 1st Sess.; 42 Cong. Rec. 3384 et seq. The use of the motto on all currency and coins was directed by the Act of July 11, 1955, 69 Stat. 290. See H. R. Rep. No. 662, 84th Cong., 1st Sess.; S. Rep. No. 637, 84th Cong., 1st Sess. Moreover, by the Joint Resolution of July 30, 1956, our national motto was declared to be \"In God We Trust.\" 70 Stat. 732. In reporting the Joint Resolution, the Senate Judiciary Committee stated:\n\n\"Further official recognition of this motto was given by the adoption of the Star-Spangled Banner as our national anthem. One stanza of our national anthem is as follows:\n\n\"`O, thus be it ever when freemen shall stand  Between their lov'd home and the war's desolation!  Blest with vict'ry and peace may the heav'n rescued land  Praise the power that hath made and preserved us a nation!  Then conquer we must when our cause it is just,  And this be our motto - \"In God is our trust.\"  And the Star-Spangled Banner in triumph shall wave  O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.'\n\n\n\n\"In view of these words in our national anthem, it is clear that `In God we trust' has a strong claim as our national motto.\" S. Rep. No. 2703, 84th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 2.\n\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The fact that taxpayers do not have standing in the federal courts to raise the issue (Frothingham v. Mellon, \n262 \nU.S. 447\n) is of course no justification for drawing a line between what is done in New York on the one hand and on the other what we do and what Congress does in this matter of prayer.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The Court analogizes the present case to those involving the traditional Established Church. We once had an Established Church, the Anglican. All baptisms and marriages had to take place there. That church was supported by taxation. In these and other ways the Anglican Church was favored over the others. The First Amendment put an end to placing any one church in a preferred position. It ended support of any church or all churches by taxation. It went further and prevented secular sanction to any religious ceremony, dogma, or rite. Thus, it prevents civil penalties from being applied against recalcitrants or nonconformists.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Some communities have a Christmas tree purchased with the taxpayers' money. The tree is sometimes decorated with the words \"Peace on earth, goodwill to men.\" At other times the authorities draw from a different version of the Bible which says \"Peace on earth to men of goodwill.\" Christmas, I suppose, is still a religious celebration, not merely a day put on the calendar for the benefit of merchants.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Religion was once deemed to be a function of the public school system. The Northwest Ordinance, which antedated the First Amendment, provided in Article III that \"Religion, morality, and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.\"\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART, dissenting.\n\n\nA local school board in New York has provided that those pupils who wish to do so may join in a brief prayer at the beginning of each school day, acknowledging their dependence upon God and asking His blessing upon them \n\n[370 \nU.S. 421, 445]\n\u00a0\n and upon their parents, their teachers, and their country. The Court today decides that in permitting this brief nondenominational prayer the school board has violated the Constitution of the United States. I think this decision is wrong.\n\n\nThe Court does not hold, nor could it, that New York has interfered with the free exercise of anybody's religion. For the state courts have made clear that those who object to reciting the prayer must be entirely free of any compulsion to do so, including any \"embarrassments and pressures.\" Cf. West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, \n319 \nU.S. 624\n. But the Court says that in permitting school children to say this simple prayer, the New York authorities have established \"an official religion.\"\n\n\nWith all respect, I think the Court has misapplied a great constitutional principle. I cannot see how an \"official religion\" is established by letting those who want to say a prayer say it. On the contrary, I think that to deny the wish of these school children to join in reciting this prayer is to deny them the opportunity of sharing in the spiritual heritage of our Nation.\n\n\nThe Court's historical review of the quarrels over the Book of Common Prayer in England throws no light for me on the issue before us in this case. England had then and has now an established church. Equally unenlightening, I think, is the history of the early establishment and later rejection of an official church in our own States. For we deal here not with the establishment of a state church, which would, of course, be constitutionally impermissible, but with whether school children who want to begin their day by joining in prayer must be prohibited from doing so. Moreover, I think that the Court's task, in this as in all areas of constitutional adjudication, is not responsibly aided by the uncritical invocation of metaphors like the \"wall of separation,\" a phrase nowhere to \n\n[370 \nU.S. 421, 446]\n\u00a0\n be found in the Constitution. What is relevant to the issue here is not the history of an established church in sixteenth century England or in eighteenth century America, but the history of the religious traditions of our people, reflected in countless practices of the institutions and officials of our government.\n\n\nAt the opening of each day's Session of this Court we stand, while one of our officials invokes the protection of God. Since the days of John Marshall our Crier has said, \"God save the United States and this Honorable Court.\"\n1\n Both the Senate and the House of Representatives open their daily Sessions with prayer.\n2\n Each of our Presidents, from George Washington to John F. Kennedy, has upon assuming his Office asked the protection and help of God.\n3\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 421, 447]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe Court today says that the state and federal governments are without constitutional power to prescribe any particular form of words to be recited by any group of the American people on any subject touching religion.\n4\n One of the stanzas of \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" made our National Anthem by Act of Congress in 1931,\n5\n contains these verses:\n\n\"Blest with victory and peace, may the heav'n  rescued land\n\n\n Praise the Pow'r that hath made and preserved  us a nation!\n\n\n Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,  And this be our motto `In God is our Trust.'\"\n\n\n\n In 1954 Congress added a phrase to the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag so that it now contains the words \"one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\"\n6\n In 1952 Congress enacted legislation calling upon the President each year to proclaim a National Day of Prayer.\n7\n Since 1865 the words \"IN GOD WE TRUST\" have been impressed on our coins.\n8\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 421, 450]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nCountless similar examples could be listed, but there is no need to belabor the obvious.\n9\n It was all summed up by this Court just ten years ago in a single sentence: \"We are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being.\" Zorach v. Clauson, \n343 \nU.S. 306, 313\n.\n\n\nI do not believe that this Court, or the Congress, or the President has by the actions and practices I have mentioned established an \"official religion\" in violation of the Constitution. And I do not believe the State of New York has done so in this case. What each has done has been to recognize and to follow the deeply entrenched and highly cherished spiritual traditions of our Nation - traditions which come down to us from those who almost two hundred years ago avowed their \"firm Reliance on the Protection of divine Providence\" when they proclaimed the freedom and independence of this brave new world.\n10\n\u00a0\n\n\nI dissent.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Warren, The Supreme Court in United States History, Vol. 1, p. 469.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See Rule III, Senate Manual, S.

In tendering this homage to the Great Author of every public and private good, I assure myself that it expresses your sentiments not less than my own, nor those of my fellow-citizens at large less than either.

In these my confidence will under every difficulty be best placed, next to that which we have all been encouraged to feel in the guardianship and guidance of that Almighty Being whose power regulates the destiny of nations, whose blessings have been so conspicuously dispensed to this rising Republic, and to whom we are bound to address our devout gratitude for the past, as well as our fervent supplications and best hopes for the future.\" \n\n[370 \nU.S. 421, 448]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n On March 4, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln said:\n\n \". . .

Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said `the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.'\n\n\n \"With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.\"\n\n\n\n On March 4, 1885, President Grover Cleveland said:\n\n \". . . And let us not trust to human effort alone, but humbly acknowledging the power and goodness of Almighty God, who presides over the destiny of nations, and who has at all times been revealed in our country's history, let us invoke His aid and His blessing upon our labors.\"\n\n\n\n On March 5, 1917, President Woodrow Wilson said:\n\n \". . . I pray God I may be given the wisdom and the prudence to do my duty in the true spirit of this great people.\"\n\n\n\n On March 4, 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt said:\n\n \"In this dedication of a Nation we humbly ask the blessing of God. May He protect each and every one of us. May He guide me in the days to come.\"\n\n\n\n On January 21, 1957, President Dwight D.

WILLIAMS PACKING CO.(1962)\nNo. 493\nArgued: April 18, 1962Decided: May 28, 1962\n\n\n\n\n Respondent, which is in the business of providing fishing trawlers to commercial fishermen, sued in a Federal District Court to enjoin the collection of social security and unemployment taxes claimed by petitioner to be past due. Although petitioner adduced evidence in support of his claim that there was an employment relationship, the District Court found that such taxes were not, in fact, payable and that their collection would destroy respondent's business; and it permanently enjoined their collection. Held: The suit for injunction was barred by 7421 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, and a judgment sustaining the injunction is reversed. Miller v. Standard Nut Margarine Co., \n284 \nU.S. 498\n, distinguished. Pp. 1-8.\n\n 291 F.2d 402, reversed.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Oberdorfer argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs were Solicitor General Cox, Acting Assistant Attorney General Jones, Meyer Rothwacks and George F. Lynch. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge E. Morse argued the cause for respondent. With him on the briefs was W. E. Morse.\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nFearing that the District Director of Internal Revenue for Mississippi would attempt to collect allegedly past due social security and unemployment taxes for the years 1953, 1954 and 1955, respondent, in late 1957 brought suit in the District Court, maintaining that it was not liable for the exactions and seeking an injunction prohibiting their collection. The District Director, petitioner herein, made no objection to the issuance of a preliminary restraining order but resisted a permanent injunction, asserting that the provisions of 7421 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 barred any such injunctive proceeding. That section provides:\n\n \"Except as provided in sections 6212 (a) and (c), and 6213 (a), no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court.\"\n\n\n The exception for Tax Court proceedings created by 6212 (a) and (c) and 6213 (a) was not applicable because that body is without jurisdiction over taxes of the sort here in issue. Nevertheless, on July 14, 1959, the court, relying upon Miller v. Standard Nut Margarine Co., \n284 \nU.S. 498\n, permanently enjoined collection of the taxes on the ground that they were not, in fact, payable and because collection would destroy respondent's business. 176 F. Supp. 168. On June 14, 1961, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, one judge dissenting. 291 F.2d 402. We granted certiorari to determine whether the case came within the scope of this Court's holding in Nut Margarine which indicated that 7421 (a) was not, in the \"special and extraordinary facts and circumstances\" \n\n[370 \nU.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n of that case,\n1\n intended to apply.\n2\n\u00a0\n368 \nU.S. 937\n.\n\nRespondent corporation (hereinafter referred to as Williams) is engaged in the business of providing trawlers to fishermen who take shrimp, oysters and fish off the Louisiana and Mississippi coasts. It is the Government's position that these fishermen are the corporation's employees within the meaning of 1426 (d) (2) and 1607 (i) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, 26 U.S.C. (1952 ed.), and 3121 (d) (2) and 3306 (i) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. These sections specifically adopt the common-law test for ascertaining the existence of the employer-employee relationship. As stated in United States v. Silk, \n331 \nU.S. 704, 716\n, \"degrees of control, opportunities for profit or loss, investment in facilities, permanency of relation and skill required . . . are important for decision [under these statutes].\" If, under the involved circumstances of this case, the fishermen were employees, respondent Williams is admittedly liable for social security and unemployment taxes for the years in question.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nThe following facts, material to the question of the existence of the employment relationship, were established. Williams provided its boats to captains which it selected; they employed their own crews and could fire them at will, but the relationship between respondent corporation \n\n[370 \nU.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n and the fishermen was not ordinarily of short duration. The catch was generally sold to Williams which in turn resold it to the DeJean Packing Co., a partnership closely allied to Williams both by reason of integrated operation and substantially identical ownership. The proceeds, after the deduction of expenses, were divided among the captain, the crew and the boat. Williams received an additional share if it supplied the nets and rigging. It extended credit to the captains and made it possible for them to obtain credit elsewhere, and if a trip was unsuccessful and if the captain or crew members no longer continued to operate a boat, Williams absorbed the loss.\n\nWith respect to the existence of a recognized right of control by the employer, as might be expected, the testimony was in conflict. Petitioner introduced evidence to show that Williams could effectively refuse ice to boats and thus determine whether they would go out, that the boats' times of return were sometimes directed by the respondent corporation, that it could dictate the nature of the catch, and that permission was needed to sell the catch to someone other than respondent. And petitioner pointed out that both respondent and its fishermen had for other purposes represented that an employer-employee relationship existed.\n4\n On the other hand, the District Court here found, and the respondent now asserts, that the corporation was wholly without any right of control. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAttempting to establish a basis for equitable jurisdiction, the corporation maintains that it will be thrown into bankruptcy if required to pay the entire assessment of $41, 568.57. It is undisputed that Williams itself is without available funds in this amount, but the Government suggests that respondent has denuded itself of assets in anticipation of its tax liability, that DeJean's assets should be considered as belonging to respondent, and that, in any event, the respondent corporation may pay the assessment for a single quarter and then sue for a refund.\n\nThe object of 7421 (a) is to withdraw jurisdiction from the state and federal courts to entertain suits seeking injunctions prohibiting the collection of federal taxes. In Miller v. Standard Nut Margarine Co., supra, this Court was confronted with the question whether a manufacturer of \"Southern Nut Product\" could enjoin the collection of federal oleomargarine taxes on its goods. Prior to the assessment in issue three lower federal court cases had held that similar products were nontaxable and, by letter, the collector had informed the manufacturer that \"Southern Nut Product\" was not subject to the tax. This Court found that \"[a] valid oleomargarine tax could by no legal possibility have been assessed against . . . [the manufacturer], and therefore the reasons underlying . . . [ 7421 (a)] apply, if at all, with little force.\"\n5\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n Noting that collection of the tax \"would destroy its business, ruin it financially and inflict loss for which it would have no remedy at law,\" the Court held that an injunction could properly issue. Id., at 510-511. The courts below seem to have found that Nut Margarine decides that 7421 (a) does not bar suit for an injunction against the collection of taxes not due if the legal remedy is inadequate. We cannot agree.\n\nThe enactment of the comparable Tax Injunction Act of 1937, 50 Stat. 738, now, as amended, 28 U.S.C. 1341, forbidding the federal courts to entertain suits to enjoin collection of state taxes \"where a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy may be had at law or in equity in the courts of such State,\" throws light on the proper construction to be given 7421 (a). It indicates that if Congress had desired to make the availability of the injunctive remedy against the collection of federal taxes not lawfully due depend upon the adequacy of the legal remedy, it would have said so explicitly. Its failure to do so shows that such a suit may not be entertained merely because collection would cause an irreparable injury, such as the ruination of the taxpayer's enterprise. This is not to say, of course, that inadequacy of the legal remedy need not be established if 7421 (a) is inapplicable; indeed, the contrary rule is well established. See, e. g., Matthews v. Rodgers, \n284 \nU.S. 521\n; Miller v. Standard Nut Margarine Co., supra; Dows v. Chicago, 11 Wall. 108. However, since we conclude that 7421 (a) bars any suit for an injunction in this case, we need not determine whether \n\n[370 \nU.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n the taxpayer would suffer irreparable injury if collection were effected.\n\nThe manifest purpose of 7421 (a) is to permit the United States to assess and collect taxes alleged to be due without judicial intervention, and to require that the legal right to the disputed sums be determined in a suit for refund. In this manner the United States is assured of prompt collection of its lawful revenue.\n6\n Nevertheless, if it is clear that under no circumstances could the Government ultimately prevail, the central purpose of the Act is inapplicable and, under the Nut Margarine case, the attempted collection may be enjoined if equity jurisdiction otherwise exists. In such a situation the exaction is merely in \"the guise of a tax.\" Id., at 509.\n\nWe believe that the question of whether the Government has a chance of ultimately prevailing is to be determined on the basis of the information available to it at the time of suit. Only if it is then apparent that, under the most liberal view of the law and the facts, the United States cannot establish its claim, may the suit for an injunction be maintained. Otherwise, the District Court is without jurisdiction, and the complaint must be dismissed. To require more than good faith on the part of the Government would unduly interfere with a collateral \n\n[370 \nU.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n objective of the Act - protection of the collector from litigation pending a suit for refund. And to permit even the maintenance of a suit in which an injunction could issue only after the taxpayer's nonliability had been conclusively established might \"in every practical sense operate to suspend collection of the . . . taxes until the litigation is ended.\" Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v. Huffman, \n319 \nU.S. 293, 299\n. Thus, in general, the Act prohibits suits for injunctions barring the collection of federal taxes when the collecting officers have made the assessment and claim that it is valid. Snyder v. Marks, \n109 \nU.S. 189, 194\n.\n\nThe record before us clearly reveals that the Government's claim of liability was not without foundation. Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the District Court with directions to dismiss the complaint.\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \n284 \nU.S., at 511\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See also Hill v.

And in the course of a prior antitrust litigation, instituted against a union to which respondent's fishermen belonged, the union defended against the charge of price fixing on the ground that its members were employees. The Government, curiously, successfully maintained that an employment relationship did not exist. See Gulf Coast Shrimpers & Oystermans Assn. v. United States, 236 F.2d 658 (C. A. 5th Cir. 1956).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Id., at 510.\n\nThe product in issue was made only with vegetable oils. The pertinent taxing statute defined \"oleomargarine\" as \"[a]ll substances heretofore known as oleomargarine, oleo, oleomargarine-oil, butterine, lardine, suine, and neutral; all mixtures and compounds of oleomargarine, oleo, oleomargarine-oil, butterine, lardine, suine, and neutral; all lard extracts and tallow extracts; and all mixtures and compounds of tallow, beef-fat, suet, lard, lard-oil, vegetable-oil annotto [a coloring material], and other coloring matter, intestinal fat, and offal fat made in imitation or semblance of butter, or when so made, calculated or intended to be sold as butter or for butter.\" 24 Stat. 209. The assessment was based on the argument that the statutory \n\n[370 \nU.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n reference to \"vegetable-oil annotto\" was meant to bring products made with vegetable oil within the definition. The Court held that the Act was obviously designed to include only vegetable-oil coloring used in conjunction with animal-fat products; in fact, after the tax year involved, the statute had been amended to bring vegetable-oil products within the definition. See 46 Stat. 1022.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Compare S. Rep.

The union peacefully picketed a refinery operated by a subsidiary of American that had a valid collective bargaining agreement with the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union.

The injunction in express terms bound the petitioner, an official of the National Maritime Union. Petitioner nevertheless picketed the refinery after publicly announcing his intention so to do, on the ground that he did not believe that the court had jurisdiction to issue the injunction. He was adjudged in contempt.\n\nThe only issue mooted on the habeas corpus proceeding was the jurisdiction of the District Court to issue the injunction.

Tennessee Gas Transmission Co. et al., also on certiorari to the same Court.\n\n Under 4 of the Natural Gas Act, a natural gas pipeline company filed increased rate schedules for its 6 different rate zones. All such increased rates were predicated, in part, on a cost of service which included a claim to a 7% rate of return on investment. After suspension by the Federal Power Commission for the full 5 months permitted by law, the new rates went into effect, subject to refund of any portion not ultimately justified in proceedings before the Commission. Several months later, after hearings, the Commission treated separately the issue of the rate of return on investment, found that 7% was excessive and that 6 1\/8% would be proper, and ordered an interim rate reduction and an immediate refund of the amounts collected in excess of the resulting lower rates. It deferred determination of other issues in the proceeding, including the allocation of over-all costs of the company's services among its 6 rate zones.

JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case involves the authority of the Federal Power Commission after hearing to order an interim rate reduction as well as a refund of amounts collected in excess thereof where a portion of a previously filed increased rate is found unjustified but the remainder of the proceeding is deferred. Respondent Tennessee Gas Transmission Company, a natural gas company, included within its filed increased rate schedule a 7% over-all return on its net investment. In considering this item\n1\n along with others involved in the filing, including the allocation of the over-all cost of service among its rate zones, the Commission concluded, after a full hearing, that 6 1\/8% rather than the filed 7% would be a just and reasonable return. It accordingly required Tennessee Gas to file reduced rates, based on the lower return figure, retroactive to the end of a five-month suspension period, and ordered a refund of the excessive amounts collected since that date. 24 F. P. C. 204. The Court of Appeals, 293 F.2d 761, \n\n[371 \nU.S. 145, 147]\n\u00a0\n found that the 6 1\/8% return was just and reasonable. It held, however, by a divided vote, that the Commission erred in ordering an immediate reduction and refund since it had not determined other issues in the proceeding, particularly that of the proper allocation of the over-all costs of the company's services among its six zones. The latter, the court reasoned, might be determinative of the ultimate question of whether the over-all filed rates in each zone were just and reasonable; therefore, the interim order might result in irretrievable loss to the company. The importance of the question in the administration of the Natural Gas Act led us to grant certiorari, \n368 \nU.S. 974\n. We have concluded that the issuance of the order was an appropriate exercise of the power granted the Commission by the Act.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nTennessee Gas does not have a system-wide rate applicable to all services regardless of where performed. It has since the early 1950's, with Commission approval, divided its extensive pipeline system into six rate zones with rate differentials. The appropriate allocation of its costs of service among these zones and types of customers was not then decided by the Commission nor agreed upon between the parties, but was left for future decision. It was in this posture that in 1959 Tennessee Gas, pursuant to 4 (d) of the Natural Gas Act,\n2\n filed with the Commission \n\n[371 \nU.S. 145, 148]\n\u00a0\n proposed increased rates for its six rate zones. The rates were predicated upon a cost of service which included a claim to a 7% rate of return on net investment. At the inception of hearings on the reasonableness of the filed rates the Commission, under its 4 (e)\n3\n authority, imposed a five-month suspension period on the proposed increase after which the rates became effective subject to refund of any portion not ultimately justified by Tennessee Gas in the proceedings.\n\nHearings commenced on February 2, 1960, and Tennessee Gas presented its evidence on cost of service and rate of return. The Commission staff presented evidence on the latter alone and then proposed that the rate of return issue be treated separately from cost of service and allocation of rates among zones. At the time of this proposal to the Commission the zone allocation issue was also pending in another docket in a proceeding involving Tennessee Gas. By motion Tennessee Gas requested that the allocation issue be decided simultaneously with that involving the rate of return. On August 5, 1960, this motion was denied, and four days later the Commission issued the interim order under attack here. It found that a 7% return was excessive and that a 6 1\/8% rate of return was just and reasonable. This finding was based on the \n\n[371 \nU.S. 145, 149]\n\u00a0\n Commission's determination that Tennessee Gas had failed to justify a rate of return greater than 6 1\/8%. Accordingly, the Commission issued an interim order which disallowed the 7% return, required Tennessee Gas to file appropriate lower rates retroactively to the effective date of the increased rates and ordered refunds of the differences collected since that time. Tennessee Gas does not contest the Commission's determination that a 6 1\/8% return on its net investment is just and reasonable. It does contend that to require the refunds prior to a determination of cost allocation among its zones of operation might result in its being unable to realize this return during the refund period. In this connection it points out that the rates as finally determined might, in some of its zones, be above the rates collected less the refund ordered. This would result in Tennessee Gas not being able to recoup a return of 6 1\/8% since it would be unable to collect retroactively the higher rates found appropriate in those zones while it would be required to make full refunds in the remaining lower rate zones.\n\nThe Court of Appeals, in setting aside the Commission's order of immediate reduction and refund, found that it was unreasonable and an abuse of discretion to thus splinter the issues, especially since the cost allocation among zones issue was deemed \"ripe for decision,\"\n4\n and \n\n[371 \nU.S. 145, 150]\n\u00a0\n a ruling on it was an \"essential element in determining whether the filed rates are excessive.\" The court also questioned whether a hearing confined to the issue of rate of return was such a \"full hearing\" as 4 (e) demands prerequisite to a rate-change and refund order.\n\nThe Federal Power Commission and the City of Pittsburgh, which is acting in behalf of resident consumers of natural gas, are here in separate cases. Since they raise identical factual and legal issues, we consider the two cases together.\n5\n\u00a0\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nAs all of the respondents admit, there is \"no question\" as to the Commission's authority to issue interim rate orders. Indeed, such general authority is well established by cases in this Court, Federal Power Comm'n v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co., \n315 \nU.S. 575\n (1942); New England Divisions Case, \n261 \nU.S. 184\n (1923), as well as in the Courts of Appeals. Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. v. Federal Power Comm'n, 236 F.2d 606 (C. A. 3d Cir. 1956); State Corporation Comm'n of Kansas v. Federal Power Comm'n, 206 F.2d 690 (C. A. 8th Cir. 1953). It is true that none of these cases involved an undecided cost allocation issue applicable retroactively. However, in Natural Gas Pipeline Co. this Court took pains to point out the fact that \n\n[371 \nU.S. 145, 151]\n\u00a0\n \"establishment of a rate for a regulated industry often involves two steps of different character, one of which may appropriately precede the other.\" 315 U.S., at p. 584. Significantly, that case also involved the issue of a fair rate of return and \"the adjustment of a rate schedule . . . so as to eliminate discriminations and unfairness from its details.\" Ibid. And the Court specifically found power to order a decrease in rates \"without establishing a specific schedule.\" It declared that the proviso of 5\n6\n authorized the Commission to \"order a decrease where existing rates are unjust . . . or are not the lowest reasonable rates.\" Finally, the Court concluded that 16\n7\n placed discretion \n\n[371 \nU.S. 145, 152]\n\u00a0\n in the Commission to \"issue . . . such orders . . . as it may find necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this chapter.\" Here the Commission took similar action directing Tennessee Gas to file a new schedule which would reflect the prescribed 7\/8% reduction in the rate of return and, in addition, to refund under 4 (e) the amounts collected in excess of the lower, substituted charges reflecting the lawful rate of return. The fact that the Natural Gas Pipeline Co. case was initiated under 5 of the Act and the refund provisions of 4 (e) were not available was, in our opinion, of no consequence since the hazard of not making a profit remains on the company in each instance. \"Discriminations and unfairness\" if later found present in Natural Gas Pipeline's schedule might have caused it losses just as the refunds might here. In addition, an analysis of the policy of the Act clearly indicates that a natural gas company initiating an increase in rates under 4 (d) assumes the hazards involved in that procedure. It bears the burden of establishing its rate schedule as being \"just and reasonable.\" In addition, the company can never recoup the income lost when the five-month suspension power of the Commission is exercised under 4 (e). The company is also required to refund any sums thereafter collected should it not sustain its burden of proving the reasonableness of an increased rate, and it may suffer further loss when the Commission upon a finding of excessiveness makes adjustments in the rate detail of the company's filing. In this latter respect a rate for one class or zone of customers may be found by the Commission to \n\n[371 \nU.S. 145, 153]\n\u00a0\n be too low, but the company cannot recoup its losses by making retroactive the higher rate subsequently allowed; on the other hand, when another class or zone of customers is found to be subjected to excessive rates and a lower rate is ordered, the company must make refunds to them. The company's losses in the first instance do not justify its illegal gain in the latter. Such situations are entirely consistent with the policy of the Act and, we are told, occur with frequency. The company having initially filed the rates and either collected an illegal return or failed to collect a sufficient one must, under the theory of the Act, shoulder the hazards incident to its action including not only the refund of any illegal gain but also its losses where its filed rate is found to be inadequate.\n\nNor do we share the doubts of the Court of Appeals concerning the practicalities of the two-step procedure invoked by the Commission. We cannot see how the severance of the two issues left Tennessee Gas without guidance as to \"the extent to which individual rates should be reduced, or to whom refunds are due.\" 293 F.2d ___, at p. 767. The Commission has found that the revised over-all rate schedule should have been calculated on a rate of return of 6 1\/8% rather than 7%. As a result the over-all rate was to that extent unlawful and refunds were due across the board to all customers in the Tennessee Gas system. The interim order directed their payment. True, the old and undecided zone rate structure under attack as discriminatory was left in effect by this order and survives a bit longer. But the probabilities present in that situation are more than offset by the certainty of the Commission's actions in finding the 7% rate unlawful, fixing the 6 1\/8% lawful return and giving timely effectiveness, including refunds, to the latter. Perhaps discrimination may later be found in the allocation of cost between \n\n[371 \nU.S. 145, 154]\n\u00a0\n some zones, but it would affect only the customers in those zones while the postponement of the interim order here would be of continuing detriment to all customers in all zones. Moreover, if decreased rates and resultant refunds are later found to be necessary in those isolated instances the Commission has the power to so order upon such finding and the individual lawful rates could at that time be fixed.\n\nMoreover, the use of the interim order technique is in keeping with the purposes of the Act \"to protect consumers against exploitation at the hands of natural gas companies . . .,\" Federal Power Comm'n v. Hope Natural Gas Co., \n320 \nU.S. 591, 610\n (1944), and \"to underwrite just and reasonable rates to the consumers of natural gas . . . .\" Atlantic Refining Co. v. Public Service Comm'n of New York, \n360 \nU.S. 378, 388\n (1959). Faced with the finding that the rate of return was excessive, the Commission acted properly within its statutory power in issuing the interim order of reduction and refund, since the purpose of the Act is \"to afford consumers a complete, permanent and effective bond of protection from excessive rates and charges. . . .\" Id., at p. 388. To do otherwise would have permitted Tennessee Gas to collect the illegal rate for an additional 18 months\n8\n at a cost of over $16,500,000 to consumers. True, the exaction would have been subject to refund, but experience has shown this to be somewhat illusory in view of the trickling down process necessary to be followed, the incidental cost of which is often borne by the consumer, and in view of the transient nature of our society which often prevents refunds from reaching those to whom they \n\n[371 \nU.S. 145, 155]\n\u00a0\n are due.\n9\n It is, therefore, the duty of the Commission to look at \"the backdrop of the practical consequences [resulting] . . . and the purposes of the Act,\" Sunray Mid-Continent Oil Co. v. Federal Power Comm'n, \n364 \nU.S. 137, 147\n (1960), in exercising its discretion under 16 to issue interim orders and, where refunds are found due, to direct their payment at the earliest possible moment consistent with due process. In so doing under the circumstances here the Commission's ultimate action in directing the severance and in entering the interim order was not only entirely appropriate but in the best tradition of effective administrative practice.\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed insofar as it set aside the interim order; otherwise it is affirmed.\n\n     Reversed in part.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] On motion of the Commission's staff counsel, the proceeding was divided into two phases: (1) determination of rate of return; (2) determination of other factors, including allocation of rates among zones.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 15 U.S.C. 717c (d): \"Unless the Commission otherwise orders, no change shall be made by any natural-gas company in any such rate, charge, classification, or service, or in any rule, regulation, or contract relating thereto, except after thirty days' notice to the Commission and to the public. Such notice shall be given by filing with the Commission and keeping open for public inspection new schedules stating plainly the change or changes to be made in the schedule or schedules then in force and the time when the change or changes will go into effect. The Commission, for good cause shown, may allow changes to take effect without \n\n[371 \nU.S. 145, 148]\n\u00a0\n requiring the thirty days' notice herein provided for by an order specifying the changes so to be made and the time when they shall take effect and the manner in which they shall be filed and published.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 15 U.S.C. 717c (e): \"Whenever any such new schedule is filed the Commission shall have authority . . . to enter upon a hearing concerning the lawfulness of such rate, charge, classification, or service; and, pending such hearing and the decision thereon, the Commission, upon filing with such schedules and delivering to the natural-gas company affected thereby a statement in writing of its reasons for such suspension, may suspend the operation of such schedule and defer the use of such rate, charge, classification, or service, but not for a longer period than five months beyond the time when it would otherwise go into effect. . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] In this connection we note the Commission found: \"Hearings on the cost allocation issue, severed from the other issues in Docket No. G-11980 by Commission order, were concluded on December 17, 1959, and briefing thereon was concluded on April 11, 1960. Tennessee's motion for omission of the intermediate decision on that issue is neither timely nor concurred in by the other parties to the proceeding. Further, while we recognize that an early decision on that issue is desirable, the nature and considerable size of the record, indicates that it would be more practicable in the interests of an early decision and in the interest of effective administration of the Natural Gas Act, that the Presiding Examiner, who has available \n\n[371 \nU.S. 145, 150]\n\u00a0\n knowledge of that record, should proceed with consideration of the evidence and render decision thereon.\" Unreported order of the Commission issued Aug. 5, 1960.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Respondents Columbia Gas Companies raise a separate point as to their not being permitted to offer evidence in this case as to cost allocation. We note that they had a full opportunity to do so in another proceeding involving the same parties. This contention, therefore, has no merit. This hearing, insofar as it determined that the rate of return was unreasonable, was to that extent and for the purpose of the interim order the \"full hearing\" contemplated by the statute, even though it did not at that time dispose of the entire case.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] 15 U.S.C. 717d (a): \". . . Provided, however, That the Commission shall have no power to order any increase in any rate contained in the currently effective schedule of such natural gas company on file with the Commission, unless such increase is in accordance with a new schedule filed by such natural gas company; but the Commission may order a decrease where existing rates are unjust, unduly discriminatory, preferential, otherwise unlawful, or are not the lowest reasonable rates.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] 15 U.S.C. 717o: \"The Commission shall have power to perform any and all acts, and to prescribe, issue, make, amend, and rescind such orders, rules, and regulations as it may find necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this chapter. Among other things, such rules and regulations may define accounting, technical, and trade terms used in this chapter; and may prescribe the form or forms of all statements, declarations, applications, and reports to be filed with the Commission, the information which they shall contain, and the time within which they shall be filed. Unless a different date is specified therein, rules and regulations of the Commission shall be effective thirty days, after publication in the manner which the Commission shall prescribe. Orders of the Commission shall be effective on the date and in the manner which the Commission shall prescribe. For the purposes of its rules and regulations, the Commission may classify persons and matters within its jurisdiction and prescribe different requirements for different classes of persons or matters. All rules \n\n[371 \nU.S. 145, 152]\n\u00a0\n and regulations of the Commission shall be filed with its secretary and shall be kept open in convenient form for public inspection and examination during reasonable business hours. (June 21, 1938, ch. 556, 16, 52 Stat. 830.)\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] The cost allocation issue was decided 18 months following the Commission's decision on rate of return, and substantial issues on the cost-of-service question are still unresolved. If the interim order had not been entered the illegal rate would have been in effect 22 months, with an excessive return of some $20,000,000.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] In some of the States refunds due unfound former customers remain with the company in separate accounts subject to future order; a larger group escheats such amounts to the State; others permit them to be used in defraying the cost of the refund; a fourth group has no problem regarding transients since refunds are prorated among company customers and credited on future bills; and one State includes all refunds in future rate reductions. While refunds are permissible in cash, most of the States approve plans whereby credits are permitted on future gas bills in proportion to average consumption. \n\n[371 \nU.S. 145, 156]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","54":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFASS v.

JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission seeks reversal of the action of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in modifying the cease-and-desist order which the Commission had issued against the respondent Broch on finding that Broch violated 2 (c) of the Clayton Act.\n1\n 285 F.2d 764. The action of the Court of Appeals was sua sponte, and was taken in proceedings on remand which followed our reversal of that Court's earlier action setting aside the order in its entirety because Broch's conduct was thought not to violate 2 (c).\n2\n Federal Trade Comm'n v. Broch & Co., \n363 \nU.S. 166\n, reversing 261 F.2d 725. We granted certiorari, \n366 \nU.S. 923\n.\n\nBroch is a broker selling food products on commission for some 25 seller principals. One of his principals is \n\n[368 \nU.S. 360, 362]\n\u00a0\n Canada Foods, Ltd., a processor of apple concentrate. The Commission found that Broch, to make possible Canada Foods' acceptance of an offer from J. M. Smucker Co. to buy an unusually large quantity of apple concentrate at less than Canada Foods' established price, reduced to 3%, for this sale, the agreed 5% rate of commission ordinarily payable by Canada Foods to Broch.\n3\n The Commission adjudged, and in our prior opinion we agreed, that this action of Broch was, in the circumstances, a violation of 2 (c).\n\nThe Commission's order was not confined to restraints against repetition of the precise violation of 2 (c) which Broch was found to have committed, nor was the application of the order limited to future sales from Canada Foods to Smucker.\n4\n Paragraph (1) did prohibit the \n\n[368 \nU.S. 360, 363]\n\u00a0\n repetition of the particular violation which Broch committed, but in connection with sales for Canada Foods, or for \"any other seller principal,\" to Smucker, or \"to any other buyer.\" Paragraph (2) also extended its prohibitions to sales from all seller principals to all buyers, but went beyond paragraph (1) to prohibit Broch from \"In any other manner . . . directly or indirectly\" paying, granting or allowing, in the words of 2 (c), \"anything of value as a commission, brokerage, or other compensation, or any allowance or discount in lieu thereof . . . .\" The Court of Appeals excised from the order all references to \"any other seller principal\" and to \"any other buyer,\" thus limiting the order's application to future sales from Canada Foods to Smucker.\n\nThe Commission renews here the argument it made in the Court of Appeals that judicial modification of the order was precluded because Broch failed to object to the scope of the order before the Commission. Broch disputes that he failed to register a proper objection before the Commission. We see no reason to determine the fact. We will assume, without deciding, that the Court of Appeals properly passed upon the scope of the order. We nevertheless think that in the circumstances of this case the order should have been affirmed in the form entered by the Commission.\n\nBroch supports the action of the Court of Appeals as to paragraph (1) of the order with the argument that, \n\n[368 \nU.S. 360, 364]\n\u00a0\n since the order was based only upon findings limited to an asserted illegal payment respecting a single sale from Canada Foods to Smucker, the Commission's ban was too sweeping in its application to sales from all seller principals to all buyers. There is no merit in this argument. The Commission has a wide discretion to formulate a remedy adequate to prevent Broch's repetition of the violation he was found to have committed. See Jacob Siegel Co. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, \n327 \nU.S. 608, 611\n-612. We cannot say that the Commission exceeded its discretion in banning repetitions of Broch's violation in connection with transactions involving any seller and buyer, rather than simply forbidding recurrence of the transgression in sales between Canada and Smucker. Federal Trade Comm'n v. Cement Institute, \n333 \nU.S. 683, 728\n-729. Compare United States v. United States Gypsum Co., \n340 \nU.S. 76, 90\n.\n\nBroch further argues that the Commission exceeded its discretion in the prohibitions embodied in paragraph (2). He did not cross-petition this Court for a writ of certiorari and does not here challenge paragraph (2) as modified by the Court of Appeals. Had the only vice claimed in paragraph (2) been its extension to all seller principals and all buyers, the Court of Appeals' sua sponte amendment would for reasons already stated have been clearly erroneous. But Broch contends that, before it was restricted to transactions involving Canada and Smucker, this part of the order was so broad as to jeopardize the conduct of his entire business, in that it unqualifiedly prohibited reductions of commissions coupled with lower prices - even uniform reductions, or reductions which are service- or cost-justified, or reductions for the purpose of meeting competition.\n\nIn considering Broch's challenge to paragraph (2) it is necessary to observe that the 1959 amendments to 11 of the Clayton Act - which substitute for the Clayton Act \n\n[368 \nU.S. 360, 365]\n\u00a0\n provisions for enforcement of administrative orders those in 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act - do not apply to enforcement of the instant order.\n5\n In consequence, Broch cannot be subjected to penalties except for violation of an enforcement order yet to be entered by an appropriate Court of Appeals, to be predicated upon a determination that some particular practice of Broch violated the Commission's order. Thus Broch is not, by virtue of that order, presently acting under the risk of incurring any penalty without further administrative and judicial consideration and interpretation, despite the fact that he has already received determination of his petition for review. Federal Trade Comm'n v. Ruberoid Co., \n343 \nU.S. 470, 477\n-480.\n6\n\u00a0\n\n[368 \nU.S. 360, 366]\n\u00a0\n\n\nUpon any future enforcement proceeding, the Commission and the Court of Appeals will have ready at hand interpretive tools - the employment of which we have previously sanctioned - for use in tailoring the order, in the setting of a specific asserted violation, so as to meet the legitimate needs of the case. They will be free to construe the order as designed strictly to cope with the threat of future violations identical with or like or related to the violations which Broch was found to have committed,\n7\n or as forbidding \"no activities except those which if continued would directly aid in perpetuating the same old unlawful practices.\" Federal Trade Comm'n v. Cement Institute, \n333 \nU.S. 683, 727\n. They need not - as we have already made clear - read the order as denying \n\n[368 \nU.S. 360, 367]\n\u00a0\n to Broch the benefit of statutory defenses or exceptions. Federal Trade Comm'n v. Ruberoid Co., supra, at 475-476; Federal Trade Comm'n v. National Lead Co., \n352 \nU.S. 419, 426\n.\n8\n Nor need the order be construed as prohibiting anything as clearly lawful as a uniform reduction in commissions.\n9\n And, we repeat, these various interpretive aids will have to be brought to bear by a Court of Appeals upon a particular practice of Broch, and will have to yield the announced result that such practice violates the order, before Broch can be subjected to penalties because of still a second repetition of the violation.\n\nIn this situation, and on this record, we hold that the attempt of the Court of Appeals to redress the asserted overbroadness by the inapt device of confining paragraph (2) to Canada's sales to Smucker was inappropriate and, indeed, any attempt to restrict the scope of the order would have been premature.\n\nWe do not wish to be understood, however, as holding that the generalized language of paragraph (2) would necessarily withstand scrutiny under the 1959 amendments.\n10\n The severity of possible penalties prescribed \n\n[368 \nU.S. 360, 368]\n\u00a0\n by the amendments for violations of orders which have become final underlines the necessity for fashioning orders which are, at the outset, sufficiently clear and precise to avoid raising serious questions as to their meaning and application.\n11\n See Labor Board v. Express Pub. Co., \n312 \nU.S. 426, 435\n-437; Federal Trade Comm'n v. Cement Institute, \n333 \nU.S. 683, 726\n; Federal Trade Comm'n v. Morton Salt Co., \n334 \nU.S. 37, 54\n. Compare New Haven R.

Broch's motion was denied but the order embodying the denial also included the provision questioned here amending the order \"On the Court's own motion.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] There was evidence in the proceedings before the Commission that, following the transaction described above, Broch continued to sell apple concentrate to Smucker on behalf of Canada Foods at a reduced price and to receive a reduced commission of 3% on such sales.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The Commission's order was as follows:\n\n\"It is ordered That respondents Henry Broch and Oscar Adler, copartners trading as Henry Broch & Co., their representatives, agents, or employees, directly or through any corporate or other device, in connection with the sale of food or food products for Canada Foods Ltd., or any other seller principal, in commerce, as `commerce' is defined in the Clayton Act, as amended, do forthwith cease and desist from:\n\n\n\"(1) Paying, granting or allowing, directly or indirectly, to The J.

L. 86-107, 73 Stat. 243. The order herein was entered by the Commission on December 10, 1957. The procedures enacted by the 1959 amendments therefore do not apply to it. See Sperry Rand Corp. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 110 U.S. App. D.C. 1, 288 F.2d 403.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The 1959 Amendments resulted from a congressional conclusion that the former 11 procedures were too cumbersome to assure effective enforcement of agency orders. It was said in the House Committee Report accompanying the 1959 amendments:\n\n\"The Clayton Act, in its present enforcement procedures, permits a person to engage in the same illegal practices three times before effective legal penalties can be applied as a result of action by the commission or board vested with jurisdiction. First, in order to issue and serve a cease-and-desist order initially, the commission or board must investigate and prove that the respondent has violated the prohibitions of the Clayton Act. No provision of the Clayton Act, however, makes the commission or board's cease-and-desist order final in the absence of an appeal by the respondent for judicial review. At the present time, the Clayton Act contains no procedure by which the commission or board may secure civil penalties for violations of its orders.\n\n\n\"Second, before the commission or board may obtain a court ruling that commands obedience to its cease-and-desist order, it must again investigate and prove that the respondent has violated both the order and the Clayton Act. The jurisdiction of the court of appeals, under \n\n[368 \nU.S. 360, 366]\n\u00a0\n the present provisions of Clayton Act section 11, cannot be invoked by the commission or board unless a violation of the cease-and-desist order is first shown.\n\n\n\"Third, enforcement of the court's order must be secured in a subsequent contempt proceeding, which requires proof that new activities of the respondent have violated the court's order. This entails a third hearing before the commission and a review thereof by the court of appeals.\n\n\n\"In contrast, the procedures that are contained in the Federal Trade Commission Act for enforcement of cease-and-desist orders issued thereunder are much simpler and more direct. A cease-and-desist order issued pursuant to section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, becomes final upon the expiration of the time allowed for filing a petition for review, if no such petition is filed within that time.\" H.

If the Commission is to attain the objectives Congress envisioned, it cannot be required to confine its road block to the narrow lane the transgressor has traveled; it must be allowed effectively to close all roads to the prohibited goal, so that its order may not be by-passed with impunity.\" Federal Trade Comm'n v. Ruberoid Co., \n343 \nU.S. 470, 473\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Broch complains of the order's omission of any reference to the statutory exception for brokerage \"for services rendered in connection with the sale or purchase of goods . . . .\" We made it clear in our prior opinion that the order need not be read as prohibiting transactions to which the statutory exception applies. \n363 \nU.S., at 173\n, 177, n. 19. Nor need the order, when viewed in the context of Broch's violation, be read as prohibiting Broch from reducing commissions competitively to gain a particular buyer's account, if the competitive setting would otherwise have afforded a defense to a charge under 2 (c).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] \"Had respondent . . . agreed to accept a 3% commission on all sales to all buyers there plainly would be no room for finding that the price reductions were violations of 2 (c). Neither the legislative history nor the purposes of the Act would require such an absurd result, and neither the Commission nor the courts have ever suggested it.\" \n363 \nU.S., at 176\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] See notes 5, 6, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] The penalties under the 1959 amendments are as follows:\n\n\"Any person who violates any order issued by the commission or board under subsection (b) of this section after such order has become final, and while such order is in effect, shall forfeit and pay to the United States a civil penalty of not more than $5,000 for each violation . . . . Each separate violation of any such order shall be a separate offense, except that in the case of a violation through continuing failure or neglect to obey a final order of the commission or board each day of continuance of such failure or neglect shall be deemed a separate offense.\"\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE WHITTAKER, with whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER and MR. JUSTICE HARLAN join, dissenting.\n\nOn the Court's assumption that the Court of Appeals had power, sua sponte, to modify the decree, I would affirm. This Court reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals on the prior appeal largely on the very narrow ground that petitioner's \"reduction in brokerage was made to obtain this particular order and this order only . . .,\" \n\n[368 \nU.S. 360, 369]\n\u00a0\n \n363 \nU.S. 166, 176\n, and therefore the Court of Appeals was justified in limiting the Commission's order accordingly.\n\nWhen its attention is focused to the appropriateness of the scope of an order to restrain illegality, the Commission has shown responsible awareness of the difference in shaping its order to a situation like the one presented by this case, to wit: a specific, closely confined illegality as distinguished from a widespread illegal practice inimical to the public interest. See opinion of the Commission in In re Colgate-Palmolive Co. and Ted Bates & Co., Docket No. 7736, December 29, 1961, CCH Trade Reg. Rep., \u00a7 15,643, pp. 20,474, 20,485.

DAVIS(1962)\nNo. 41\nArgued: November 14, 1962Decided: December 3, 1962\n\n\n\n\n A Federal District Court dismissed petitioner's complaint in a civil action for failure to state a claim upon which relief might be granted. Petitioner promptly moved to vacate the judgment and amend the complaint so as to state an alternative theory for recovery. Before the Court ruled on those motions, petitioner filed notice of appeal from the judgment of dismissal. Subsequently, the District Court denied the motions to vacate the judgment and to amend the complaint, and petitioner filed notice of appeal from that denial. On appeal, the parties briefed and argued the merits of both the dismissal of the complaint and the denial of petitioner's motions. The Court of Appeals treated the first notice of appeal as premature, because of the then pending motion to vacate, and it dismissed that appeal. It held that the second notice of appeal was ineffective to review the judgment of dismissal, because it failed to specify that the appeal was from that judgment, and it affirmed denial of petitioner's motions, on the ground that there was nothing in the record to support a finding that the District Court had abused its discretion in refusing to allow amendment of the complaint. Held:\n\n 1. On the record in this case, the Court of Appeals erred in narrowly reading the second notice of appeal as applying only to the denial of petitioner's motions, since petitioner's intention to seek review of both the dismissal of the complaint and the denial of her motions was manifest from the record as a whole. Pp. 181-182.\n\n\n 2. The Court of Appeals also erred in affirming the District Court's denial of petitioner's motion to vacate the judgment of dismissal in order to allow amendment of the complaint, since it appears from the record that the amendment would have done no more than state an alternative theory of recovery, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 (a) declares that leave to amend \"shall be freely given when justice so requires,\" and denial of the motion without any apparent justifying reason was an abuse of discretion.

With him on the briefs was Richard R. Caples.\n\nMR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner filed a complaint in the District Court alleging that, in exchange for petitioner's promise to care for and support her mother, petitioner's father had agreed not to make a will, thereby assuring petitioner of an intestate share of the father's estate; it was further alleged that petitioner had fully performed her obligations under the oral agreement, but that contrary thereto the father had devised his property to respondent, his second wife and executrix. Petitioner sought recovery of what would have been her intestate share of the father's estate. Respondent moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the oral agreement was unenforceable under the applicable state statute of frauds. Accepting respondent's contention, the District Court entered judgment on December 19, 1960, dismissing petitioner's complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief might be granted. On December 20, 1960, petitioner filed motions to vacate the judgment and to amend the complaint to assert a right of recovery in quantum meruit for performance of the obligations which were the consideration for the assertedly unenforceable oral contract. On January 17, 1961, petitioner filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of December 19, 1960. On January 23, 1961, the District Court denied petitioner's motions to vacate the judgment and to amend the complaint. On January 26, 1961, petitioner filed a notice of appeal from denial of the motions.\n\nOn appeal, the parties briefed and argued the merits of dismissal of the complaint and denial of petitioner's \n\n[371 \nU.S. 178, 180]\n\u00a0\n motions by the District Court. Notwithstanding, the Court of Appeals of its own accord dismissed the appeal insofar as taken from the District Court judgment of December 19, 1960, and affirmed the orders of the District Court entered January 23, 1961. 292 F.2d 85. This Court granted certiorari. \n368 \nU.S. 951\n.\n\nThe Court of Appeals reasoned that in the absence of a specific designation of the provision of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure under which the December 20, 1960, motion to vacate was filed, the motion would be treated as filed pursuant to Rule 59 (e), rather than under Rule 60 (b);\n1\n since, under Rule 73 (a),\n2\n a motion under Rule 59 suspends the running of time within which an appeal may be perfected, the first notice of appeal was treated as premature in view of the then pending motion to vacate and of no effect. The Court of Appeals held the second notice of appeal, filed January 26, 1961, ineffective to review the December 19, 1960, judgment dismissing the complaint because the notice failed to specify that the appeal was being taken from that judgment as well as \n\n[371 \nU.S. 178, 181]\n\u00a0\n from the orders denying the motions. Considering the second notice of appeal, therefore, only as an appeal from the denial by the District Court of the motions to vacate and amend, the Court of Appeals held that there was nothing in the record to show the circumstances which were before the District Court for consideration in ruling on those motions; consequently it regarded itself as precluded from finding any abuse of discretion in the refusal of the court below to allow amendment.\n\nThe Court of Appeals' treatment of the motion to vacate as one under Rule 59 (e) was permissible, at least as an original matter, and we will accept that characterization here. Even if this made the first notice of appeal premature, we must nonetheless reverse for we believe the Court of Appeals to have been in error in so narrowly reading the second notice.\n\nThe defect in the second notice of appeal did not mislead or prejudice the respondent. With both notices of appeal before it (even granting the asserted ineffectiveness of the first), the Court of Appeals should have treated the appeal from the denial of the motions as an effective, although inept, attempt to appeal from the judgment sought to be vacated. Taking the two notices and the appeal papers together, petitioner's intention to seek review of both the dismissal and the denial of the motions was manifest. Not only did both parties brief and argue the merits of the earlier judgment on appeal, but petitioner's statement of points on which she intended to rely on appeal, submitted to both respondent and the court pursuant to rule, similarly demonstrated the intent to challenge the dismissal.\n\nIt is too late in the day and entirely contrary to the spirit of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for decisions on the merits to be avoided on the basis of such mere technicalities. \"The Federal Rules reject the approach that pleading is a game of skill in which one misstep by \n\n[371 \nU.S. 178, 182]\n\u00a0\n counsel may be decisive to the outcome and accept the principle that the purpose of pleading is to facilitate a proper decision on the merits.\" Conley v. Gibson, \n355 \nU.S. 41, 48\n. The Rules themselves provide that they are to be construed \"to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action.\" Rule 1.\n\nThe Court of Appeals also erred in affirming the District Court's denial of petitioner's motion to vacate the judgment in order to allow amendment of the complaint. As appears from the record, the amendment would have done no more than state an alternative theory for recovery.\n\nRule 15 (a) declares that leave to amend \"shall be freely given when justice so requires\"; this mandate is to be heeded. See generally, 3 Moore, Federal Practice (2d ed. 1948), \u00a7\u00a7 15.08, 15.10. If the underlying facts or circumstances relied upon by a plaintiff may be a proper subject of relief, he ought to be afforded an opportunity to test his claim on the merits. In the absence of any apparent or declared reason - such as undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, futility of amendment, etc. - the leave sought should, as the rules require, be \"freely given.\" Of course, the grant or denial of an opportunity to amend is within the discretion of the District Court, but outright refusal to grant the leave without any justifying reason appearing for the denial is not an exercise of discretion; it is merely abuse of that discretion and inconsistent with the spirit of the Federal Rules.\n\nThe judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Rule 59 (e) provides: \"A motion to alter or amend the judgment shall be served not later than 10 days after entry of the judgment.\" Rule 60 (b) provides in relevant part: \"On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect . . . or (6) any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment. . . . A motion under this subdivision (b) does not affect the finality of a judgment or suspend its operation. . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Rule 73 (a) provides in relevant part: \"The running of the time for appeal is terminated by a timely motion made pursuant to any of the rules hereinafter enumerated, and the full time for appeal fixed in this subdivision commences to run and is to be computed from the entry of any of the following orders made upon a timely motion under such rules . . . granting or denying a motion under Rule 59 to alter or amend the judgment . . . .\" \n\n[371 \nU.S. 178, 183]\n\u00a0\n\n\nSeparate memorandum of MR.

After the Government had introduced part, but not all, of its evidence, the District Judge directed the jury to return verdicts of acquittal, and a formal judgment of acquittal was entered. The Government petitioned the Court of Appeals for a writ of mandamus, praying that the judgment of acquittal be vacated and the case reassigned for trial. The Court of Appeals granted the petition on the ground that, under the circumstances revealed by the record, the District Court was without power to direct the judgment of acquittal. Held: The judgment of the Court of Appeals was contrary to the guaranty of the Fifth Amendment against double jeopardy. Pp. 141-143.\n\n 286 F.2d 556, reversed.\n\nArthur Richenthal argued the causes for petitioners and filed briefs for petitioner in No. 65. David E.

Pollak, Beatrice Rosenberg, Philip R. Monahan and J. F. Bishop.\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\nThe petitioners, a corporation and two of its employees, were brought to trial before a jury in a federal district court upon an indictment charging a conspiracy and the substantive offense of concealing material facts in a matter within the jurisdiction of an agency of the United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 371 and 1001. After seven \n\n[369 \nU.S. 141, 142]\n\u00a0\n days of what promised to be a long and complicated trial, three government witnesses had appeared and a fourth was in the process of testifying. At that point the district judge directed the jury to return verdicts of acquittal as to all the defendants, and a formal judgment of acquittal was subsequently entered.\n\nThe record shows that the district judge's action was based upon one or both of two grounds: supposed improper conduct on the part of the Assistant United States Attorney who was prosecuting the case, and a supposed lack of credibility in the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution who had testified up to that point.\n\nThe Government filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, praying that the judgment of acquittal be vacated and the case reassigned for trial. The court granted the petition, upon the ground that under the circumstances revealed by the record the trial court was without power to direct the judgment in question. Judge Aldrich concurred separately, finding that the directed judgment of acquittal had been based solely on the supposed improper conduct of the prosecutor, and agreeing with his colleagues that the district judge was without power to direct an acquittal on that ground. 286 F.2d 556. We granted certiorari to consider a question of importance in the administration of justice in the federal courts. \n366 \nU.S. 959\n.\n\nIn holding that the District Court was without power to direct acquittals under the circumstances disclosed by the record, the Court of Appeals relied primarily upon two decisions of this Court, Ex parte United States, \n242 \nU.S. 27\n, and Ex parte United States, \n287 \nU.S. 241\n. In the first of these cases it was held that a district judge had no power to suspend a mandatory prison sentence, and that a writ of mandamus would lie to require the judge to vacate his erroneous order of suspension. In the second case the Court issued a writ of mandamus ordering a district \n\n[369 \nU.S. 141, 143]\n\u00a0\n judge to issue a bench warrant which he had refused to do, in the purported exercise of his discretion, for a person under an indictment returned by a properly constituted grand jury.\n\nNeither of those decisions involved the guaranty of the Fifth Amendment that no person shall \"be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\" That constitutional provision is at the very root of the present case, and we cannot but conclude that the guaranty was violated when the Court of Appeals set aside the judgment of acquittal and directed that the petitioners be tried again for the same offense.\n\nThe petitioners were tried under a valid indictment in a federal court which had jurisdiction over them and over the subject matter. The trial did not terminate prior to the entry of judgment, as in Gori v. United States, \n367 \nU.S. 364\n. It terminated with the entry of a final judgment of acquittal as to each petitioner. The Court of Appeals thought, not without reason, that the acquittal was based upon an egregiously erroneous foundation. Nevertheless, \"[t]he verdict of acquittal was final, and could not be reviewed . . . without putting [the petitioners] twice in jeopardy, and thereby violating the Constitution.\" United States v. Ball, \n163 \nU.S. 662, 671\n.\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE WHITTAKER took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring.\n\nWere I able to find, as Judge Aldrich did, that the District Court's judgment of acquittal was based solely on the Assistant United States Attorney's alleged misconduct, I would think that a retrial of the petitioners would not be prevented by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 141, 144]\n\u00a0\n Fifth Amendment. Even assuming that a trial court may have power, in extreme circumstances, to direct a judgment of acquittal, instead of declaring a mistrial, because of a prosecutor's misconduct - a proposition which I seriously doubt - I do not think that such power existed in the circumstances of this case. But since an examination of the record leaves me unable, as it did the majority of the Court of Appeals, to attribute the action of the District Court to this factor alone, I concur in the judgment of reversal.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK, dissenting.\n\nThe Court speaks with such expanse that I am obliged to dissent. It says that because \"a final judgment of acquittal\" was entered pursuant to a directed verdict the propriety of such \"acquittal\" cannot be reviewed even though the Government had not concluded its main case at the time the verdict was directed. The District Court under the circumstances here clearly had no power to direct a verdict of acquittal or to enter a judgment thereon. In my view when a trial court has no power to direct such a verdict, the judgment based thereon is a nullity. The word \"acquittal\" in this context is no magic open sesame freeing in this case two persons and absolving a corporation from serious grand jury charges of fraud upon the Government.\n\nOn the record before us it matters not whether the so-called acquittal was pursuant to the trial court's conclusion that the Government's witnesses up to that point lacked credibility or was based on the alleged misconduct of the prosecution.\n\nOn the first point, the Government had only examined three of its witnesses and was in the process of examining a fourth when the acquittal was entered. The first and third witnesses were merely preliminary, offered to identify \n\n[369 \nU.S. 141, 145]\n\u00a0\n documents and explain the functions performed by the individual defendants for the corporate defendant. The second was offered to give the jury an explanation of radiosondes, devices for gathering weather data, which petitioners were furnishing the Government under contracts totaling several million dollars. It was during the latter's testimony - entirely explanatory - that the court called a recess for the stated purpose of requiring the United States Attorney to \"consider whether the public interest is served by a further prosecution of this case.\" Upon the vigorous insistence of the United States Attorney himself, the trial was resumed and the Government called its third and fourth witnesses. The fourth witness was the first to testify as to the fraud upon the Government which related to a deliberate scheme to conceal from government inspectors defects in the devices. During direct examination the fourth witness was \"not sure\" as to the date of a certain conference at which representatives of the corporate defendant were present. Thereafter at a recess period his memory was refreshed during a conversation with one of the Assistant United States Attorneys. Upon resuming the stand he corrected his previous testimony as to the date, placing it a few months earlier. On cross-examination he admitted that the error had been called to his attention by the Assistant. The court then excused the jury and after excoriating the Assistant called the jury back into session and directed the verdict of acquittal.\n\nIt is fundamental in our criminal jurisprudence that the public has a right to have a person who stands legally indicted by a grand jury publicly tried on the charge. No judge has the power before hearing the testimony proffered by the Government or at least canvassing the same to enter a judgment of acquittal and thus frustrate the Government in the performance of its duty to prosecute those who violate its law. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 141, 146]\n\u00a0\n\n\nHere, as the United States Attorney advised the court, only three witnesses of the \"many . . . to be heard from . . .\" had testified. The court had only begun to hear what promised to be a protracted conspiracy case involving many witnesses. The Government had not rested. As the majority of the Court of Appeals observed, the District Court:\n\n\"abruptly terminated the Government's case . . . long before the Government had had an opportunity to show whether or not it had a case; and, moreover, he did so in ignorance of either the exact nature or the cogency of the specific evidence of guilt which Government's counsel said he had available and was ready to present.\" 286 F.2d, at 562-563.\n\n\n At such a stage of the case the District Court had no power to prejudge the Government's proof - find it insufficient or unconvincing - and set the petitioners free.\n\nOn the second point, even if there were misconduct, the court still had no power to punish the Government because of the indiscretion of its lawyer. As this Court said in McGuire v. United States, \n273 \nU.S. 95, 99\n (1927), \"A criminal prosecution is more than a game in which the Government may be checkmated and the game lost merely because its officers have not played according to rule.\" At most, if there had been misconduct, the remedy would have been to declare a mistrial and impose appropriate punishment upon the Assistant United States Attorney, rather than upon the public. In my view the judgment of the Court of Appeals should, therefore, be affirmed.\n\n\n[369 \nU.S. 141, 147]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","60":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFORD v. FORD(1962)\nNo. 63\nArgued: November 15, 1962Decided: December 10, 1962\n\n\n\n\n After being informed that a husband and his estranged wife had reached an agreement concerning the custody of their children, a Virginia court dismissed a petition for habeas corpus which had been filed by the husband in order to obtain their custody. Subsequently, while the children were with their mother in South Carolina, she sued in a court of that State to have full custody awarded to her, and that was done in a proceeding in which the husband appeared and contended that it was a violation of the agreement reached in Virginia which was the basis of the Virginia court's order of dismissal. The Supreme Court of South Carolina reversed, on the ground that the judgment of the Virginia court was res judicata and binding on the South Carolina courts under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Federal Constitution, in the absence of a change of circumstances warranting a change of the custody of the children. Held: Even if the Full Faith and Credit Clause is applicable to cases involving custody of children, the courts of South Carolina were not bound by the Virginia order of dismissal here, since that order was not res judicata in Virginia. Pp. 187-194.\n\n 239 S. C. 305, 123 S. E. 2d 33, reversed.\n\nW. Francis Marion argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs was O. G. Calhoun.\n\nWesley M. Walker argued the cause for respondent. With him on the briefs were John S. Davenport III and Angus H. Macaulay, Jr.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis is a controversy between a husband and wife over the custody of their three young children which raises questions under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the \n\n[371 \nU.S. 187, 188]\n\u00a0\n United States Constitution.\n1\n Their first litigation was in 1959 when the husband filed in the Richmond Virginia Law and Equity Court a petition for habeas corpus alleging that the wife had the children but was not a suitable person to keep them and asking that they be produced before the court and custody awarded to him. The wife promptly answered, alleging that she was the proper person to have custody of the children and asking that the writ be dismissed. Thereafter negotiations took place between the parents, both being represented by counsel, and they agreed that the husband was, with minor exceptions, to have custody of the children during the school year and the wife was to have custody during summer vacation and other holidays. When notified of this agreement, the Richmond court entered the following order:\n\n\"It being represented to the court by counsel that the parties hereto have agreed concerning the custody of the infant children, it is ordered that this case be dismissed.\"\n\n\n Some nine months later, August 10, 1960, while the three children were with their mother in Greenville, South Carolina, she began this suit for full custody in the Greenville County Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court, again alleging that she was the proper person to have custody and that the husband was not. Service was had upon the husband, who answered, charging that for \n\n[371 \nU.S. 187, 189]\n\u00a0\n reasons set out the mother was not fit to have custody of the children and asserting that he was. He also set up as a defense that\n\n\". . . Plaintiff has violated and breached the agreement made between the parties by and with their respective legal counsel and further violated the Order of the Court of record in Richmond, Virginia that was duly issued and based upon said agreement.\"\n\n\n After hearing testimony from 11 witnesses including the husband and wife, the trial judge found as a fact that while both the father and mother were fit persons to have the children, it was \"to the best interest of the children that the mother have custody and control.\" The judge also rejected the husband's argument that the order of dismissal in the Virginia court should be treated as res judicata of the issue of fitness before the South Carolina court.\n\nOn appeal the Court of Common Pleas, like the judge of the juvenile court, held that under the law of South Carolina the interests of the children were \"paramount\" and that it was their welfare which had to be protected. It decided that, while both parents would be suitable custodians, the best interests of the children required that the wife have custody during the school months and the husband during the other parts of the year, in effect inverting the arrangement previously made in the parents' agreement. In rejecting the husband's contention that South Carolina courts should be bound by the dismissal of the habeas corpus proceedings in Virginia which was based on the parents' agreement, the court said:\n\n\"To hold that the custody of these three children was fully and finally determined in Richmond, Virginia, by the agreement reached between the plaintiff's \n\n[371 \nU.S. 187, 190]\n\u00a0\n attorneys and the defendant's attorneys would be unfair to the children and too harsh a rule to follow.\"\n\n\n On appeal the Supreme Court of South Carolina reversed. 239 S. C. 305, 123 S. E. 2d 33 (1961). That court, after a review of certain Virginia cases, said:\n\n\"If the respondent [the wife] here had instituted in the Courts of Virginia the action commenced by her in the Courts of this State, the appellant could have successfully interposed a plea of res judicata as a defense to said action. Since the judgment entered in the Virginia Court by agreement or consent is res judicata in that State, it is res judicata and entitled to full faith and credit in this State. We are required under Art. IV, Sec. 1 of the Constitution of the United States to give the same faith and credit in this State to the `dismissed agreed' order or judgment as `by law or usage' the Courts of Virginia would give to such order or judgment.\" 239 S. C., at 317. 123 S. E. 2d, at 39.\n\n\n We granted certiorari to consider this question of full faith and credit upon which the South Carolina Supreme Court's judgment rests. \n369 \nU.S. 801\n (1962).\n\nThe husband has argued that we need not reach the full faith and credit question because the State Supreme Court rested its decision on South Carolina law rather than on the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Federal Constitution. This argument is based on language in the closing part of the court's opinion, where it was said that \"A judicial award of the custody of a child is never final\" and that a South Carolina court may \"even on its own motion\" reconsider the custody of a child if new facts and circumstances make it necessary or desirable for the child's welfare to do so. The court concluded, however, that it found in the pleadings and the record \"neither allegation \n\n[371 \nU.S. 187, 191]\n\u00a0\n nor proof of any changed circumstances authorizing a change of the custody of the minor children of the parties to this action.\" 239 S. C., at 317-318, 123 S. E. 2d, at 39. It seems clear to us that the State Supreme Court was merely stating that under its own law it could modify custody decrees if the circumstances had changed.\n2\n It seems equally clear to us that the court was not attempting to rely on South Carolina law for its conclusion that, since there were no changed circumstances, it had to give effect to the prior Virginia decree. In previously stating the issue submitted in the case, the court had said this:\n\n\"It was further submitted that the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court of Greenville County must recognize, in accordance with the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution of the United States, the agreed Order of Dismissal of the Virginia Court and that such was res judicata, unless there was evidence of subsequent misconduct on the part of the appellant or a change of conditions warranting a change of the custody of the children.\" 239 S. C., at 309, 123 S. E. 2d, at 34-35.\n\n\n What the court then went on to discuss was not whether the Virginia decree was res judicata under South Carolina law but whether it was res judicata under Virginia law and therefore entitled to full faith and credit in South Carolina. We are convinced that the court rested its decision squarely and solely on its reading of Virginia law and of the Full Faith and Credit Clause as requiring South Carolina, in the absence of a change of circumstances, to give full effect to the prior Virginia decree. Nothing in the court's opinion suggests what it might have \n\n[371 \nU.S. 187, 192]\n\u00a0\n done under South Carolina law had it not so interpreted the Full Faith and Credit Clause.\n\nWhether the South Carolina court's interpretation of the Full Faith and Credit Clause is a correct one is a question we have previously reserved.\n3\n We need not reach that question here. The Full Faith and Credit Clause, if applicable to a custody decree, would require South Carolina to recognize the Virginia order as binding only if a Virginia court would be bound by it. Recognizing this, the South Carolina Supreme Court's opinion was largely devoted to a review of Virginia cases to determine the effect in Virginia of the order of dismissal. The cases relied on by the South Carolina court do hold that the parties to some actions may agree to a dismissal and that in such cases a \"dismissed agreed\" order is res judicata between the parties. All of the Virginia cases discussed by the South Carolina court, however, involved purely private controversies\n4\n which private litigants can settle, and none involved the custody of children where the public interest is strong. In each case the Virginia dismissal was the result of an agreement between the parties equivalent to a compromise intended to settle a cause of action.\n5\n Whatever the effect given such dismissals where only private interests of parties are involved, cases involving custody of children raise very different considerations. We are of the opinion that Virginia law, which \n\n[371 \nU.S. 187, 193]\n\u00a0\n does not treat a contract between the parents as a bar to the court's jurisdiction in custody cases,\n6\n would similarly not treat as res judicata the dismissal in this case.\n\nThe Virginia court held no hearings as to the custody of the children. In entering its order of dismissal, the court neither examined the terms of the parents' agreement nor exercised its own judgment of what was best for the children. The court's order meant no more than that the parents had made an agreement between themselves. Virginia law, like that of probably every State in the Union,\n7\n requires the court to put the child's interest first. The Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia has stated this policy with unmistakable clarity:\n\n\"In Virginia, we have established the rule that the welfare of the infant is the primary, paramount, and controlling consideration of the court in all controversies between parents over the custody of their minor children. All other matters are subordinate.\" Mullen v. Mullen, 188 Va. 259, 269, 49 S. E. 2d 349, 354 (1948).\n\n\n Unfortunately, experience has shown that the question of custody, so vital to a child's happiness and well-being, frequently cannot be left to the discretion of parents. This is particularly true where, as here, the estrangement of husband and wife beclouds parental judgment with emotion and prejudice. In Virginia, the parents cannot make agreements which will bind courts to decide a custody case one way or the other. The Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals has emphasized this deep-rooted Virginia policy by declaring: \"The custody and welfare of children are not the subject of barter.\" Buchanan v. Buchanan, 170 Va. 458, 477, 197 S. E. 426, 434 (1938). \n\n[371 \nU.S. 187, 194]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhatever a Virginia court might do in a case where another court had exercised its considered judgment before awarding custody,\n8\n we do not believe that, in view of Virginia's strong policy of safeguarding the welfare of the child, a court of that State would consider itself bound by a mere order of dismissal where, as here, the trial judge never even saw, much less passed upon, the parents' private agreement for custody and heard no testimony whatever upon which to base a judgment as to what would be best for the children.\n\nWe hold that the courts of South Carolina were not precluded by the Full Faith and Credit Clause from determining the best interest of these children and entering a decree accordingly. In holding otherwise, the South Carolina Supreme Court was in error. The case is reversed and remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n     Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] U.S. Const., Art.

CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nWe are called upon to determine whether the Treasury Regulations creating a right of survivorship in United States Savings Bonds pre-empt any inconsistent Texas community property law by virtue of the Supremacy Clause, Article VI, Clause 2, of the Constitution.\n\nThe petitioner is the widower of Mrs. Mary Ida Free, and the respondent is her son by a previous marriage. Mr. and Mrs. Free were domiciled in Texas. That State follows the community property system; except in certain instances not here material, all property acquired by either spouse during marriage belongs to the community of the husband and wife.\n1\n Property purchased with community property retains a community character. See Love v. Robertson, 7 Tex. 6. Although each spouse owns an undivided one-half interest in the community property, the husband is the sole authorized manager.\n2\n During the years 1941 to 1945, petitioner Free, using community property, purchased several United States Savings Bonds, series \"E\" and \"F.\" The bonds were all issued to \"Mr. or Mrs.\" Free. Under the Treasury Regulations promulgated under 31 U.S.C. 757c (a) which govern bonds issued in that form, when either co-owner \n\n[369 \nU.S. 663, 665]\n\u00a0\n dies, \"the survivor will be recognized as the sole and absolute owner.\" 31 CFR 315.61. After Mrs. Free passed away in 1958, this controversy arose between the husband, who claimed exclusive ownership by operation of the Treasury Regulations, and the son, who, as the principal beneficiary under his mother's will, claimed an interest in the bonds by virtue of the state community property laws. Respondent son demanded either one-half of the bonds or reimbursement for the loss of Mrs. Free's community half interest in the bonds which was converted into petitioner's separate property by operation of the federal regulations.\n\nIn order to resolve the controversy, petitioner Free filed suit in the District Court of Upshur County, Texas, against the respondent individually and as the executor of Mrs. Free's estate. Respondent Bland filed a counterclaim. On the petitioner's motion for summary judgment, the trial court awarded full title to the bonds to the petitioner by virtue of the federal regulations but awarded reimbursement to the respondent by virtue of the state community property laws, making the bonds security for payment. The petitioner appealed to the Court of Civil Appeals. That court affirmed the trial court's award of full title to the petitioner but reversed the award of reimbursement to the respondent,\n3\n relying upon Smith v. Ricks, 159 Tex. 280, 318 S. W. 2d 439, in which unconditional effect was given to the survivorship provisions of the federal regulations governing savings bonds.\n\nWhile respondent's writ of error was pending in the Supreme Court of Texas, that court overruled the Ricks case in Hilley v. Hilley, 161 Tex. 569, 342 S. W. 2d 565. After holding that married couples in Texas would not be permitted to agree to any survivorship provision with \n\n[369 \nU.S. 663, 666]\n\u00a0\n regard to community property, the court dismissed the argument that the Supremacy Clause would compel recognition of the survivorship provisions in United States Savings Bonds with:\n\n \"It is clear that the Federal regulations do not override our local laws in matters of purely private ownership where the interests of the United States are not involved. Bank of America National Trust & Savings Ass'n v. Parnell, \n352 \nU.S. 29\n.\" 161 Tex., at 577, 342 S. W. 2d, at 570.\n\n\n Subsequently, respondent Bland's writ of error was granted, and the Supreme Court of Texas, acting under the authority of the Hilley case, reversed the Court of Civil Appeals and reinstated the judgment of the trial court in a per curiam opinion. Bland v. Free, 162 Tex. 72, 344 S. W. 2d 435. We granted certiorari. \n368 \nU.S. 811\n.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Texas' interpretation of the Supremacy Clause is not in accord with controlling doctrine. The relative importance to the State of its own law is not material when there is a conflict with a valid federal law, for the Framers of our Constitution provided that the federal law must prevail. Article VI, Clause 2. This principle was made clear by Chief Justice Marshall when he stated for the Court that any state law, however clearly within a State's acknowledged power, which interferes with or is contrary to federal law, must yield. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 210-211. See Franklin National Bank v. New York, \n347 \nU.S. 373\n; Wissner v. Wissner, \n338 \nU.S. 655\n; Sola Electric Co. v. Jefferson Electric Co., \n317 \nU.S. 173\n. Thus our inquiry is directed toward whether there is a valid federal law, and if so, whether there is a conflict with state law.\n\nArticle I, Section 8, Clause 2 of the Constitution delegates to the Federal Government the power \"[t]o borrow \n\n[369 \nU.S. 663, 667]\n\u00a0\n money on the credit of the United States.\" Pursuant to this grant of power, the Congress authorized the Secretary of the Treasury, with the approval of the President, to issue savings bonds in such form and under such conditions as he may from time to time prescribe, subject to certain limitations not here material. 31 U.S.C. 757c (a).\n4\n Cf. United States v. Sacks, \n257 \nU.S. 37\n. Exercising that authority, the Secretary of the Treasury issued savings bonds under regulations which provided, inter alia, that the co-owner of a savings bond issued in the \"or\" form who survives the other co-owner \"will be recognized as the sole and absolute owner\" of the bond, 31 CFR 315.61,\n5\n and that \"[n]o judicial determination will be recognized which would . . . defeat or impair the rights of survivorship conferred by these regulations,\" 31 CFR 315.20.\n6\n The Treasury has consistently maintained \n\n[369 \nU.S. 663, 668]\n\u00a0\n that the purpose of these regulations is to establish the right of survivorship regardless of local state law,\n7\n and a majority of the States which have considered the problem have recognized this right.\n8\n The respondent, however, contends that the purpose of the regulations is simply to provide a convenient method of payment.\n9\n This argument depends primarily on the distinction between stating that the surviving co-owner will \"be recognized as\" the sole owner and stating that the surviving co-owner will \"be\" the sole owner. This distinction is insubstantial. The clear purpose of the regulations is to confer the right of survivorship on the surviving co-owner. Thus, the survivorship provision is a federal law\n10\n which must prevail if it conflicts with state law. See Wissner v. Wissner, \n338 \nU.S. 655\n. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 663, 669]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe success of the management of the national debt depends to a significant measure upon the success of the sales of the savings bonds. The Treasury is authorized to make the bonds attractive to savers and investors.\n11\n One of the inducements selected by the Treasury is the survivorship provision, a convenient method of avoiding complicated probate proceedings. Notwithstanding this provision, the State awarded full title to the co-owner but required him to account for half of the value of the bonds to the decedent's estate. Viewed realistically, the State has rendered the award of title meaningless. Making the bonds security for the payment confirms the accuracy of this view. If the State can frustrate the parties' attempt to use the bonds' survivorship provision through the simple expedient of requiring the survivor to reimburse the estate of the deceased co-owner as a matter of law, the State has interfered directly with a legitimate exercise of the power of the Federal Government to borrow money.\n\nBank of America Trust & Savings Assn. v. Parnell, \n352 \nU.S. 29\n, relied upon by the court below, does not support the result reached. The Court in that case held that, in the absence of any federal law, the application of state law to determine the liability of a converter of Federal Home Owners' Loan Corporation bonds was permissible, because the litigation between the two private parties there did not intrude upon the rights and the duties of the United States, the effect on the only possible interest of the United States - the floating of securities - being too speculative to justify the application of a federal rule. That doctrine clearly does not apply when the State fails to give effect to a term or condition under which a federal bond is issued, as the Court there noted. \"Federal law of course governs the interpretation of the nature of the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 663, 670]\n\u00a0\n rights and obligations created by the Government bonds themselves.\" \n352 \nU.S., at 34\n.\n\nWe hold, therefore, that the state law which prohibits a married couple from taking advantage of the survivorship provisions of United States Savings Bonds merely because the purchase price is paid out of community property must fall under the Supremacy Clause.\n\nOur holding is supported by Wissner v. Wissner, \n338 \nU.S. 655\n. There the Congress made clear its intent to allow a serviceman to select the beneficiary of his own government life insurance policy regardless of state law, even when it was likely that the husband intended to deprive his wife of a right to share in his life insurance proceeds, a right guaranteed by state law. But the regulations governing savings bonds do not go that far. While affording purchasers of bonds the opportunity to choose a survivorship provision which must be recognized by the States, the regulations neither insulate the purchasers from all claims regarding ownership nor immunize the bonds from execution in satisfaction of a judgment.\n12\n The Solicitor General, appearing as amicus curiae, acknowledges that there is an exception implicit in the savings bond regulations, including the survivorship provision, so that federal bonds will not be a \"sanctuary for a wrongdoer's gains.\"\n13\n With this, we agree. The regulations are not intended to be a shield for fraud, and relief would be available in a case where the circumstances manifest fraud or a breach of trust tantamount thereto on the part of a husband while acting in his capacity as manager of the general community property. However, the doctrine of fraud applicable under federal \n\n[369 \nU.S. 663, 671]\n\u00a0\n law\n14\n in such a case must be determined on another day, for this issue is not presently here. On the record before us, no issue of fraud was or could properly have been decided by the court below on summary judgment. There was no direct allegation of fraud in the counterclaim. Other allegations which in some circumstances might have a bearing on the subject were controverted and therefore can only be resolved by a trial on the merits. Accordingly, the judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n   Reversed and remanded.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the decision of this case.\n\nMR.

Picked up 12 days later by police, petitioner immediately admitted the assault and robbery. Over two weeks later, he was convicted in a juvenile court of \"assault to injure\" and was committed to the State Industrial School for an indeterminate period. Subsequently the victim died, and petitioner was charged with first degree murder. At his trial in a state court, a jury found him guilty. The crucial evidence introduced at the trial was a formal confession which petitioner had signed before his victim died, before petitioner had been brought before a judge, and after he had been held for five days without seeing a lawyer, parent, or other friendly adult, although his mother had attempted to see him. Held: On the totality of the circumstances in this case, the formal confession on which petitioner's conviction may have rested was obtained in violation of due process, and the judgment sustaining his conviction is reversed.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner, a child of 14, and another juvenile followed an elderly man to a hotel, got into his room on a ruse, assaulted him, overpowered him, stole $13 from his pockets, and fled. All this happened on December 20, \n\n[370 \nU.S. 49, 50]\n\u00a0\n 1958. Petitioner was picked up by the police on January 1, 1959, and immediately admitted the assault and robbery. At that time, however, the victim of the robbery was still alive, though hospitalized. He died on January 26, 1959, and forthwith an information charging first degree murder was returned against petitioner. A jury found him guilty, the crucial evidence introduced at the trial being a formal confession which he signed on January 7, 1959, after he had been held for five days during which time he saw no lawyer, parent, or other friendly adult. The Supreme Court of Colorado affirmed the judgment of conviction. 145 Colo. 53, 358 P.2d 1028. We granted the petition for certiorari, \n368 \nU.S. 815\n.\n\nAfter petitioner's arrest on January 1, the following events took place. His mother tried to see him on Friday, January 2, but permission was denied, the reason given being that visiting hours were from 7 p. m. to 8 p. m. on Monday and Thursday. From January 1 through January 7, petitioner was in Juvenile Hall, where he was kept in security, though he was allowed to eat with the other inmates. He was examined by the police in Juvenile Hall January 2, and made a confession which an officer recorded in longhand. On January 3, 1959, a complaint was filed against him in the Juvenile Court by the investigating detectives.\n\nThe State in its brief calls this preliminary procedure in Juvenile Hall being \"booked in.\" As noted, petitioner signed a full and formal confession on January 7. The trial in the Juvenile Court took place January 16 on a petition dated January 13 containing a charge of \"assault to injure.\" He was committed to the State Industrial School for an indeterminate period. Thereafter, as noted above, the victim of the robbery died and the murder trial was held.\n\nConfessions obtained by \"secret inquisitorial processes\" (Chambers v. Florida, \n309 \nU.S. 227, 237\n) are suspect, \n\n[370 \nU.S. 49, 51]\n\u00a0\n since such procedures are conductive to the use of physical and psychological pressures. Chambers v. Florida, supra; Leyra v. Denno, \n347 \nU.S. 556\n. The reason that due process, as used in the Fourteenth Amendment, condemns the obtaining of confessions in that manner is a compound of two influences. First is the procedural requirement stated in Chambers v. Florida, supra, 236-237:\n\n\"From the popular hatred and abhorrence of illegal confinement, torture and extortion of confessions of violations of the `law of the land' evolved the fundamental idea that no man's life, liberty or property be forfeited as criminal punishment for violation of that law until there had been a charge fairly made and fairly tried in a public tribunal free of prejudice, passion, excitement, and tyrannical power. Thus, as assurance against ancient evils, our country, in order to preserve `the blessings of liberty,' wrote into its basic law the requirement, among others, that the forfeiture of the lives, liberties or property of people accused of crime can only follow if procedural safeguards of due process have been obeyed.\"\n\n\n We emphasized this point in Ashcraft v. Tennessee, \n322 \nU.S. 143, 152\n, where we said that \"always evidence concerning the inner details of secret inquisitions is weighted against an accused . . . .\"\n\nSecond is the element of compulsion which is condemned by the Fifth Amendment. Chief Justice Hughes in Brown v. Mississippi, \n297 \nU.S. 278, 285\n, emphasized that ingredient of due process. After noting that the Court had held that the exemption from compulsory self-incrimination in the courts of the States is not guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, he went on to say:\n\n\"But the question of the right of the State to withdraw the privilege against self-incrimination is not \n\n[370 \nU.S. 49, 52]\n\u00a0\n here involved. The compulsion to which the quoted statements refer is that of the processes of justice by which the accused may be called as a witness and required to testify. Compulsion by torture to extort a confession is a different matter.\" And see Brennan, The Bill of Rights and the States, 36 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 761.\n\n\n We reiterated that view in Ashcraft v. Tennessee, supra, where we held that the principle of Bram v. United States, \n168 \nU.S. 532, 562\n-563, was applicable to state proceedings. \n322 \nU.S., at 154\n, n. 9. We said:\n\n \"We think a situation such as that here shown by uncontradicted evidence is so inherently coercive that its very existence is irreconcilable with the possession of mental freedom by a lone suspect against whom its full coercive force is brought to bear. It is inconceivable that any court of justice in the land, conducted as our courts are, open to the public, would permit prosecutors serving in relays to keep a defendant witness under continuous cross-examination for thirty-six hours without rest or sleep in an effort to extract a `voluntary' confession. Nor can we, consistently with Constitutional due process of law, hold voluntary a confession where prosecutors do the same thing away from the restraining influences of a public trial in an open court room.\" \n322 \nU.S., at 154\n. (Italics added.)\n\n\n The application of these principles involves close scrutiny of the facts of individual cases. The length of the questioning (Spano v. New York, \n360 \nU.S. 315\n), the use of fear to break a suspect (Malinski v. New York, \n324 \nU.S. 401\n), the youth of the accused (Haley v. Ohio, \n332 \nU.S. 596\n) are illustrative of the circumstances on which \n\n[370 \nU.S. 49, 53]\n\u00a0\n cases of this kind turn. The youth of the suspect was the crucial factor in Haley v. Ohio, supra, at 599-600:\n\n \"What transpired would make us pause for careful inquiry if a mature man were involved. And when, as here, a mere child - an easy victim of the law - is before us special care in scrutinizing the record must be used. Age 15 is a tender and difficult age for a boy of any race. He cannot be judged by the more exacting standards of maturity. That which would leave a man cold and unimpressed can overawe and overwhelm a lad in his early teens. This is the period of great instability which the crisis of adolescence produces. A 15-year-old lad, questioned through the dead of night by relays of police, is a ready victim of the inquisition. Mature men possibly might stand the ordeal from midnight to 5 a. m. But we cannot believe that a lad of tender years is a match for the police in such a contest. He needs counsel and support if he is not to become the victim first of fear, then of panic. He needs someone on whom to lean lest the overpowering presence of the law, as he knows it, crush him. No friend stood at the side of this 15-year-old boy as the police, working in relays, questioned him hour after hour, from midnight until dawn. No lawyer stood guard to make sure that the police went so far and no farther, to see to it that they stopped short of the point where he became the victim of coercion. No counsel or friend was called during the critical hours of questioning. A photographer was admitted once this lad broke and confessed. But not even a gesture towards getting a lawyer for him was ever made.\"\n\n\n The fact that petitioner was only 14 years old puts this case on the same footing as Haley v. Ohio, supra. There \n\n[370 \nU.S. 49, 54]\n\u00a0\n was here no evidence of prolonged questioning. But the five-day detention - during which time the boy's mother unsuccessfully tried to see him and he was cut off from contact with any lawyer or adult advisor - gives the case an ominous cast. The prosecution says that the boy was advised of his right to counsel, but that he did not ask either for a lawyer or for his parents. But a 14-year-old boy, no matter how sophisticated, is unlikely to have any conception of what will confront him when he is made accessible only to the police. That is to say, we deal with a person who is not equal to the police in knowledge and understanding of the consequences of the questions and answers being recorded and who is unable to know how to protect his own interests or how to get the benefits of his constitutional rights.\n\nThe prosecution says that the youth and immaturity of the petitioner and the five-day detention are irrelevant, because the basic ingredients of the confession came tumbling out as soon as he was arrested. But if we took that position, it would, with all deference, be in callous disregard of this boy's constitutional rights. He cannot be compared with an adult in full possession of his senses and knowledgeable of the consequences of his admissions. He would have no way of knowing what the consequences of his confession were without advice as to his rights - from someone concerned with securing him those rights - and without the aid of more mature judgment as to the steps he should take in the predicament in which he found himself. A lawyer or an adult relative or friend could have given the petitioner the protection which his own immaturity could not. Adult advice would have put him on a less unequal footing with his interrogators. Without some adult protection against this inequality, a 14-year-old boy would not be able to know, let alone assert, such constitutional rights as he had. To \n\n[370 \nU.S. 49, 55]\n\u00a0\n allow this conviction to stand would, in effect, be to treat him as if he had no constitutional rights.\n\nThere is no guide to the decision of cases such as this, except the totality of circumstances that bear on the two factors we have mentioned. The youth of the petitioner, the long detention, the failure to send for his parents, the failure immediately to bring him before the judge of the Juvenile Court, the failure to see to it that he had the advice of lawyer or a friend - all these combine to make us conclude that the formal confession on which this conviction may have rested (see Payne v. Arkansas, \n356 \nU.S. 560, 568\n) was obtained in violation of due process.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER and MR. JUSTICE WHITE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK, with whom MR. JUSTICE HARLAN and MR. JUSTICE STEWART join, dissenting.\n\nAs Chief Justice John Marshall said a century and a quarter ago, \"[i]f courts were permitted to indulge their sympathies, a case better calculated to excite them can scarcely be imagined.\" Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1, 15 (1831). A 14-year-old boy stands convicted of murder and has been sentenced to imprisonment for life. But, as Mr. Justice Paterson said in Penhallow v. Doane's Admr., 3 Dall. 54, 88-89 (1795), \"motives of commiseration, from whatever source they flow, must not mingle in the administration of justice.\"\n\nThe Court sets aside the conviction here on due process grounds, finding that the formal confession made by petitioner on January 7 was obtained by \"secret inquisitorial processes\" and other forms of compulsion. In so doing it turns its back on the spontaneous oral admissions made \n\n[370 \nU.S. 49, 56]\n\u00a0\n by petitioner at the time of arrest on January 1, as well as a detailed confession made the next day, all long before the formal confession was given five days later. Moreover, I find nothing in the record that suggests any \"secret inquisitorial processes\" were used or any compulsion was exerted upon petitioner even during that longer period. With due deference I cannot see how the Court concludes from the record that petitioner was \"cut off from contact with any lawyer or adult advisor\" and \"made accessible only to the police,\" that there was a failure to bring him before the juvenile judge in the manner required in juvenile delinquency cases, or that Gallegos' case is in anywise on the same footing with Haley v. Ohio, \n332 \nU.S. 596\n (1948), or the other cases cited by the majority.\n\nAs the Court says, \"the totality of circumstances\" is the only guide we have in confession cases. However, in view of the hop, skip, and jump fashion in which the Court deals with them here, I believe it is first necessary to detail the facts.\n\nThe record through the testimony of Officer Chism, a special juvenile officer, shows that on Thursday evening, January 1, he was investigating the assault on Mr. Smith,\n1\n an 80-year-old man, when he noticed three boys who appeared to fit the description furnished him of the ones involved. The three, who were sitting on the curb outside of Dutchman's Inn, were the Gallegos brothers: petitioner Robert (14), Charles (12), and Richard (8). The officer, who was alone and in street clothes, stopped his car across the street from the inn. He approached the boys, told them he was a police officer, and asked them to come over and sit in his car. They did so and the officer asked them about the Smith assault. Richard orally confessed, and the petitioner \"admitted he had a \n\n[370 \nU.S. 49, 57]\n\u00a0\n part in it.\" Officer Chism then took the boys to Juvenile Hall where the petitioner again admitted his participation, as did his youngest brother, Richard. Both stated that the third brother, Charles, had nothing to do with the matter, but that their cousin, Eddie Martinez, had accompanied them. Charles, having been cleared of any involvement in the assault, was taken home that very evening by Officer Chism, who told Mrs. Gallegos that the petitioner and Richard were being held at Juvenile Hall and that visiting hours were on Monday and Thursday evenings. He also informed her of her sons' right to counsel.\n\nThe next evening, January 2, Officer Chism talked to the petitioner, Richard, and Martinez, who by this time was also at Juvenile Hall. As the officer took notes,\n2\n petitioner again described his participation in the assault on Mr. Smith in the following manner as narrated by Officer Chism at the trial:\n\n\"[After his participation in an assault on a Mr. Kruhd,] he proceeded down to 18th and Curtis Street where he was shining shoes . . . . [U]pon seeing an old man, who was later identified as Robert F. Smith, he followed him to a hotel on 18th street. . . . [H]e . . . was with his younger brother, Richard, and one Eddie Martinez. . . . They followed the old man to the hotel and Richard stayed downstairs and watched out for cops. He and Eddie went upstairs and they lost track of the old man; they asked several if they had seen his grandfather come in, that he had just come in and was drunk . . . [and] a man told . . . [them] he just went down the hallway, and upon knocking on the door a man opened the door and he told him he was looking for his grandfather, that he was drunk, and the man told \n\n[370 \nU.S. 49, 58]\n\u00a0\n him the old man next door had just come in. He said upon knocking on the other door someone told him to come in, that he opened the door and he seen it was the man he was looking for. . . . [A]t that time Eddie Martinez asked the old man for a drink of water and when the old man brought the water Eddie grabbed him and he, Robert, hit the old man about the head and face with a shoe brush; that when the old man fell to the floor he took a knife and held it to the old man's throat and took his billfold out [of] his back pocket. . . . [T]hey all left then and went to the Twenty-third Street Viaduct where he gave Eddie $3.00 and he kept $10.00 to split between him and Richard and they then went home . . . .\"\n\n\n That same evening, January 2, at 11:30 p. m., Mrs. Gallegos attempted to visit her two sons at Juvenile Hall but was again informed that visiting hours were 7 p. m. to 8 p. m. on Mondays and Thursdays. At the trial she testified that she made no effort to see her sons on the next visiting day, which was Monday, but waited until Thursday, January 8.\n\nThe record shows that on January 3 the officer filed in the juvenile court a detailed report of the arrest and petitioner's confessions together with a petition charging petitioner with juvenile delinquency. This was supplemented on the 5th by the report of the Kruhd assault and Kruhd's identification of petitioner and the other boys. The officer followed, as he was obliged to do, the juvenile court law of Colorado which provides for commitment in Juvenile Hall, report to the juvenile judge who supervises the Hall and its inmates, and the filing of a delinquency petition.\n\nFor the first few days at Juvenile Hall petitioner was placed in \"security,\" which meant that he did not participate in the school program. The uncontradicted testimony \n\n[370 \nU.S. 49, 59]\n\u00a0\n of the Hall Superintendent was that the decision to keep the petitioner out of the program was made by his unit supervisor in order to size up the boy, who had been charged with a serious crime, before placing him in the regular activities with the others. During this time he had all his meals with the other boys and conversed with his younger brother who was held in another ward. Although the petitioner did not testify at the trial in the presence of the jury, he admitted at a hearing held to determine the admissibility of the formal confession that he was only questioned three times between January 1 and January 7 and that no threats or physical coercion was used at any time.\n\nOn January 7 the police department sent a man over to formalize the earlier confessions. Officer Miller, who took the confession, testified that he told petitioner of the possibility of murder charge, warned him that he did not have to make a statement, and told him that he could have his parents and an attorney present if he desired. Petitioner indicated that he did not so desire, and a formal confession was taken which was substantially identical to the statement given on January 2, as related by Officer Chism in his testimony. The confession was typed, and Officer Chism took it over to Juvenile Hall for petitioner to sign. He testified that petitioner read it aloud before signing it. Above his signature was the admission that the confession was made voluntarily and upon warning that it could be used against him.\n\nOn January 16 the three assailants were committed to the Industrial School by the juvenile court. Upon the death of Mr. Smith, petitioner on information was tried for murder. As noted above, the evidence included testimony of his admissions upon arrest and his confession on January 2, as well as the formal confession of January 7. These were admitted after independent findings of \n\n[370 \nU.S. 49, 60]\n\u00a0\n voluntariness by the trial judge and jury. The latter was instructed that in determining whether petitioner freely and voluntarily made the confessions it was to take into account \"the age, maturity, physical and mental condition of the defendant, the length of his confinement, his opportunity or lack of opportunity to seek friendly or professional aid, the advice or lack of advice given him as to his constitutional rights, and all other facts and circumstances surrounding such confession.\"\n\nBefore discussing the admissibility of the formal confession of January 7, I must first comment on the Court's treatment of the earlier confessions, viz., those of January 1 and 2. Although the Court carefully refrains from holding these confessions inadmissible under due process standards, its innuendo that they were acquired \"in callous disregard of this boy's constitutional rights\" cannot pass unexposed. In regard to these confessions, the test of voluntariness as evidenced by the \"totality of circumstances\" leads the Court not to question them. Here there were no \"secret inquisitorial processes\" or compulsion of any kind as the Court envisions in relation to the confession of January 7. The Court's only criticism is that petitioner \"would have no way of knowing what the consequences of his confession were without advice as to his rights . . . .\"\n3\n The truth of the matter is that the singular circumstance pointed out by the Court has never been thought to render a confession inadmissible. See Culombe v. Connecticut, \n367 \nU.S. 568, 577\n-602 (1961) (opinion of MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER). \n\n[370 \nU.S. 49, 61]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Court is overturning petitioner's conviction because it flows in part from the formal confession of January 7. I cannot draw from this record a conclusion that this confession was involuntary. Petitioner freely admitted in testimony before the trial judge that he was not threatened or physically coerced in any way and that he was not intensively questioned. Moreover, prior to the formal confession he was told that he did not have to make a statement and warned of the possibility of a murder charge, as well as informed that he could have an attorney and his parents present. Officer Chism's testimony as to this matter was documented by the confession itself which recites that it was voluntary and given after notice that it could be used against him.\n\nPetitioner was never placed in solitary confinement, as might be implied from the Court's opinion, but was merely kept out of the organized activities until the unit supervisor could determine whether his full-time participation would have an adverse effect on others. And even under this schedule he had all his meals with the other boys and conversed freely with them.\n\nNor was petitioner \"cut off\" from contact with lawyers or adults and \"made accessible only to the police.\" His mother made no effort to obtain an attorney although informed of the right to do so.\n4\n And she was not prevented from seeing him but was merely asked to comply with reasonable visiting regulations. She was informed on two occasions that she could see him Monday, January 5, two days before the formal confession which the Court finds invalid, but she did not attempt to do so. And petitioner himself passed up the offer to confer with his parents and an attorney before making this confession.\n\nIn support of the above factors indicating that the confession of January 7 was voluntary is the undeniable fact \n\n[370 \nU.S. 49, 62]\n\u00a0\n that petitioner admitted on January 1 his participation in the assault and confessed in detail thereto on January 2. Both of these statements occurred prior to the events which the Court finds to have coerced the confession of January 7. I am hard pressed to understand how one could conclude that the police found it expedient to coerce the January 7 confession or that the events discussed by the Court rendered it involuntary when five days earlier a substantially identical confession was made in the absence of the \"coercive\" events.\n\nAs I have noted, in light of these facts I cannot conclude that this confession was involuntary. A fortiori, I could not determine, as the Court must, that so clear a case of coercion was made out that three prior findings that the confession was voluntary - including one by the jury which was specifically instructed to consider each of the factors relied on by the majority - can be reversed. I have carefully examined the cases upon which the Court relies and can find not one among them which in the least is apposite. There were no \"secret inquisitorial processes\" as in Chambers v. Florida, \n309 \nU.S. 227\n (1940). There Chambers, a Negro, for a week after arrest was kept incommunicado, moved from one jail to another, constantly questioned, and was finally subjected to around-the-clock interrogation by a relay of from 4 to 10 persons. Nor does Leyra v. Denno, \n347 \nU.S. 556\n (1954), in any way resemble this case. There the accused had requested a doctor in order to get relief from a painful sinus attack. The police brought in a psychiatrist who by subtle means induced him to confess after an hour or two of questioning. The state court found this confession invalid because of mental coercion. However, at the second trial subsequent confessions were admitted in evidence. This Court held that the psychiatric inducement used to extract the first confession poisoned and invalidated the subsequent ones. Likewise, the reference of the Court to Chief Justice \n\n[370 \nU.S. 49, 63]\n\u00a0\n Hughes' statement in Brown v. Mississippi, \n297 \nU.S. 278, 285\n (1936), concerning the \"element of compulsion which is condemned by the Fifth Amendment,\" is misleading and inapposite. \"The question in this case,\" he said in Brown with his usual conciseness, \"is whether convictions, which rest solely upon confessions shown to have been extorted by officers of the State by brutality and violence, are consistent with the due process of law required by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\" Id., at 279. Brown and the other suspects, the Chief Justice pointed out, had been stripped, laid over chairs and beaten with a leather strap with buckles until their backs were cut to pieces and they confessed. Nor does the holding in Ashcraft v. Tennessee, \n322 \nU.S. 143\n (1944), have any bearing on this case. It also involved \"prosecutors serving in relays\" keeping a person under continuous cross-examination for 36 hours without rest or sleep. Nor can it, in my view, be said that Spano v. New York, \n360 \nU.S. 315\n (1959), has any weight under the facts here. In that case continuous, all-night cross-examination by four officers, the refusal of repeated requests to consult his counsel, together with the use of an old friend who was a fledgling police officer as bait to break down the accused, led us to invalidate the confession. And in Malinski v. New York, \n324 \nU.S. 401\n (1945), the accused was stripped of his clothing and his request for counsel ignored while he remained in solitary confinement and without food until, led to believe that he was going to get a \"shellacking,\" he confessed from apparent fear of his jailors. Finally, I see no similarity in Haley v. Ohio, \n332 \nU.S. 596\n (1948), the last case cited by the Court. There a 15-year-old boy never before in trouble was questioned \"through the dead of night\" by five to six policemen in relays of one or two each and then only was led to confess by being shown alleged statements of two confederates incriminating him. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 49, 64]\n\u00a0\n Haley does not indicate that youth alone is sufficient to render a juvenile's confession inadmissible. Here we do not have any of the factors which led to the comment: \"What transpired would make us pause for careful inquiry if a mature man were involved.\" Id., at 599.\n\nI regret that without support from prior cases and on the basis of inference and conjecture not supported in the record the Court upsets this conviction.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] At this time Smith was still alive. He died on January 26, and the murder prosecution here at issue followed.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] These notes were signed by petitioner.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] There is no basis for the Court's suggestion that the officers improperly failed to bring petitioner before the juvenile judge when they first arrested him.

Patterson argued the cause for the United States. With him on the briefs were Solicitor General Cox, Assistant Attorney General Miller, J. William Doolittle and Beatrice Rosenberg.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner, an accountant whose business included acting for other in federal income tax matters, was charged in a thirty-five-count indictment with violations of 26 U.S.C. 7206 (2), 18 U.S.C. 1001, and 18 U.S.C. 495, in that he had allegedly falsified his clients' returns ( 7206 (2)), forged their endorsements on government tax-refund checks ( 495), and, by endorsing such checks, had made false statements as to a matter within the jurisdiction of a government agency ( 1001). The jury convicted on thirty-one counts and acquitted on four others. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 650, 651]\n\u00a0\n On appeal, 291 F.2d 586, 597, the judgment of conviction was set aside as to twenty-nine counts, and a new trial ordered, because the Court of Appeals found that evidence used by the Government in support of these counts had been illegally seized. The judgment as to the remaining two counts (Nos. 21 and 22), charging the petitioner with having forged the endorsements of Daniel H. Bartfield and Charline R. Bartfield on two government refund checks (18 U.S.C. 495), was affirmed.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nIt was stipulated at the trial that petitioner had endorsed in his own handwriting the two checks, made out to:\n\n  \"Daniel H & Charlene R Bartfield  c\/o R Milo Gilbert  519 Taft Building  Hollywood 28 Calif\"\n\n\n in the following manner:\n\n  \"Daniel H. Bartfield  Charline R. Bartfield  R. Milo Gilbert, Trustee\"\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 650, 652]\n\u00a0\n Petitioner claimed that a written power of attorney, allegedly signed by both Bartfields in his office, authorized him to endorse tax-refund checks, and that \"Trustee\" after his name served to designate the particular bank account where he deposited and held all client-refunds until December of each year, against the possibility of there being a refund adjustment and until his contingent fee was settled. The Bartfields acknowledged that the signatures on the power of attorney were theirs, but disclaimed recollection of signing the instrument, and denied that they ever authorized petitioner orally or in writing to receive or endorse checks.\n3\n\u00a0\n\n\n On these premises the Court of Appeals, concluding that the evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to find that petitioner had endorsed the checks without authority (a conclusion which for present purposes we accept), held that one who endorses a government check by signing the name of the payee and then his own, as agent, when in fact he has no such authority, is guilty of forgery under 495. We granted certiorari to consider the correctness of that view of the statute. \n368 \nU.S. 816\n. While not mentioned in the petition for certiorari, though discussed in the briefs on the merits, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, after the Court of Appeals' decision in the present case, held that \"forgery\" under 495 does not embrace a purported, but misrepresented, agency endorsement (hereafter called simply an \"agency endorsement\"). Selvidge v. United States, 290 F.2d 894. For reasons given in this opinion we agree with the Tenth Circuit. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 650, 653]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nAt the outset we are met with the Government's suggestion that the statutory construction question need not be faced in this case. Before the Court of Appeals, as in the petition for certiorari, it was assumed by all that the two checks (which after the trial and before the case reached this Court had for some reason become mislaid) had been endorsed \"by R. Milo Gilbert, Trustee.\" (Emphasis added.) That was a mistaken assumption for, as the checks themselves show (supra, p. 651), there was no \"by\" before \"R. Milo Gilbert, Trustee.\"\n\nArguing that the jury might have found that the word \"Trustee\" after Gilbert's signature did not purport to indicate an agency endorsement, but was merely intended as a designation for routing the checks for deposit in one of Gilbert's \"client\" bank accounts, the Government suggests that a plain case of forgery is made out, and the agency-endorsement question is not in truth presented by the record.\n\nWe cannot so easily dispose of the case. For accepting the premise that the jury could have found that petitioner did not purport to act in a representative capacity when he endorsed the checks, it was surely also permissible for the jury to find that petitioner had purported to make an agency endorsement in both instances, and we are thus left to speculate on which theory its verdict in fact rested. Indeed the record before us seems to indicate that this aspect of the case was tried, at least primarily, on an agency-endorsement theory. The trial judge's instructions to the jury on this phase of the case were at best opaque. Having refused to instruct the jury that an agency endorsement was not forgery under 495,\n4\n he at \n\n[370 \nU.S. 650, 654]\n\u00a0\n no point undertook to explain the difference between an agency and a nonagency endorsement.\n5\n Nor can we perceive any force in the Government's further suggestion that the jury's verdict on these two counts might have rested simply on the theory that in describing himself as \"Trustee\" the petitioner had made a fictitious endorsement, in that he had never occupied that status. Since the charge was that petitioner had forged the names of the Bartfields, not of their agent, this is but another way of describing the agency-endorsement version of the transaction.\n\nIn this posture of things the Government's proposal that we bypass decision of the question that brought the case here must be rejected. If an agency endorsement \n\n[370 \nU.S. 650, 655]\n\u00a0\n does not constitute forgery under 495, the petitioner is at least entitled to a new trial under proper jury instructions.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nThe original predecessor of 495 was enacted in 1823, 3 Stat. 771, and in respects here pertinent has throughout the intervening years been in substantially the same form as 495. There is no significant legislative history illuminating 495 or any of its predecessors. In deciding whether \"forges\" under 495 embraces agency endorsements, it is therefore important to inquire, as the Government recognizes, into the common-law meaning of forgery at the time the 1823 statute was enacted. For in the absence of anything to the contrary it is fair to assume that Congress used that word in the statute in its common-law sense.\n\nIn 1847 it was decided in the English case of Regina v. White, 2 Car. & K. 404, 175 Eng. Rep. 167 (Nisi Prius, Book 6), that \"indorsing a bill of exchange under a false assumption of authority to indorse it per procuration, is not forgery, there being no false making.\"\n6\n 2 Car. & K., at 412, 175 Eng. Rep., at 170 (Nisi Prius, Book 6). This to be sure was some twenty-four years after the 1823 predecessor of 495 came on the books. The Government says that this English decision should be regarded as but an ill-advised and temporary departure from the earlier common law which was \"soon recognized\" and remedied by the passage of the Forgery Act of 1861, 24 & 25 Vict., c. 98, 24, defining forgery to include \n\n[370 \nU.S. 650, 656]\n\u00a0\n unauthorized signings \"per procuration,\" with intent to defraud.\n7\n The Government draws from earlier English authority, 2 East, Pleas of the Crown, 850-859 (1803); 1 Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown, c. 70; Coke, Third Institute (1797 ed.) 169; 4 Blackstone, Commentaries, 247, the conclusion that agency endorsements did constitute forgery under the common law as it existed when the 1823 American statute was passed.\n\nThis view cannot readily be accepted. The fifteen judges who participated in Regina v. White unanimously decided that case as they did only after considering the earlier English authorities. Such of those authorities as are now relied on by the Government are by no means as clear as the Government would have them. Thus Lord East's comments, supra, at p. 852, were: \"Forgery at common law denotes a false making (which includes every alteration of or addition to a true instrument), a making malo animo, of any written instrument for the purpose of fraud and deceit. . . . [The ancient and modern authorities] all consider the offence as consisting in the false and fraudulent making or altering of such and such instruments.\" (Emphasis in original.) Coke,\n8\n Hawkins,\n9\n and \n\n[370 \nU.S. 650, 657]\n\u00a0\n Blackstone,\n10\n who are also cited by the Government, are no more persuasive towards the Government's view. The more inclusive definition of forgery contained in the English statutes, supra, p. 655 and note 7, proves not that Regina v. White was mistaken in its view of the common law but only that a broader definition was deemed desirable by Parliament. And finally, the Regina v. White view of forgery at common law was early accepted in a federal case as representing the English common law. In re Extradition of Tully, 20 F. 812. The same view of forgery has since been followed in most of the state and federal courts in this country. See, e. g., People v. Bendit, 111 Cal. 274, 276-280, 43 P. 901, 902; Pasadena Investment Co. v. Peerless Casualty Co., 132 Cal. App. 2d 328, 331, 282 P.2d 124, 125; State v. Lamb, 198 N.C. 423, 425-426, 152 S. E. 154, 155-156; Dexter Horton Nat. Bank v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 149 Wash. 343, 346-351, 270 P. 799, 800-802; Greathouse v. United States, 170 F.2d 512, 514; Marteney v. United States, 216 F.2d 760, 763-764.\n\nThe foregoing considerations combine to lead us to the conclusion that \"forge\" in 495 should not be taken to include an agency endorsement. So the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has held in Selvidge v. United States, supra, the only case in the lower federal courts \n\n[370 \nU.S. 650, 658]\n\u00a0\n squarely dealing with the point,\n11\n and we perceive no sound reason for rejecting its conclusion. We find no more persuasive than did the Court of Appeals in Selvidge (290 F.2d, at 896 and note 2) the scattered federal cases relied on by the Government in support of the opposite view.\n12\n Nor are we impressed with the argument that \"forge\" in 495 should be given a broader scope than its common-law meaning because contained in a statute aimed at protecting the Government against fraud.\n13\n Other federal statutes are ample enough to protect the Government against fraud and false statements. See 18 U.S.C. 1001-1026. Still further, it is significant that cases construing \"forge\" under other federal statutes have generally drawn a distinction between false or fraudulent statements and spurious or fictitious makings. See, e. g., Greathouse v. United States, supra (construing 18 U.S.C. 2314); Wright v. United States, 172 F.2d 310, 311-312 (construing 18 U.S.C. 2314); Marteney v. United States, supra (construing 18 U.S.C. 2314); United States v. Carabasi, 292 F.2d 362, 364 (construing 7 U.S.C. 1622 (h)). Where the \"falsity lies in the representation of facts, not in the genuineness of execution,\" it is not forgery. Marteney v. United States, supra, at 763-764. Of course, Congress could \n\n[370 \nU.S. 650, 659]\n\u00a0\n broaden the concept of \"federal\" forgery by statutory definition. We hold only that it has not yet done so.\n\nWe conclude that petitioner's conviction cannot be sustained upon this record. However, since we are not prepared at this stage to say that the Government might not be entitled to succeed on these two counts of the indictment upon the theory that petitioner never signed the Bartfields' names in a representative capacity, we think the way should be left open for a retrial of them under proper jury instructions, in conjunction with the other counts already remanded by the Court of Appeals, within a reasonable time. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated and the case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BLACK, MR. JUSTICE CLARK, and MR. JUSTICE STEWART dissent, believing that one who endorses a check in the name of the payee without authority to do so is guilty of forgery under 18 U.S.C. 495, whether or not the forger falsely purports to have signed the payee's name as an authorized agent.\n\nMR.

U.S.(1962)\nNo. 40\nArgued: October 15, 1962Decided: December 3, 1962\n\n\n\n\n Appellants, two incorporated common carriers by motor vehicle and their stockholders, applied to the Interstate Commerce Commission under 5 (2) of the Interstate Commerce Act for approval of a merger of the two corporations. Acting under 5 (7), the Commission initiated an investigation into the possibility of a violation of 5 (4), and the two proceedings were consolidated. After hearings and further proceedings, the Commission found that informal de facto management and control of the two corporations in a common interest had been unlawfully effectuated in violation of 5 (4); it denied approval of the merger; ordered the violation terminated; and ordered one of the individual appellants to divest himself of his stock in one of the corporations. A suit by appellants to enjoin and set aside the Commission's orders was dismissed by the District Court, on the ground that the orders were reasonable and supported by substantial evidence. Held: The order denying approval of the merger is affirmed; but the judgment is reversed in part, and the case is remanded for further proceedings. Pp. 116-131.\n\n (a) On the record in this case, the Commission was justified in concluding that the two appellant common carriers by motor vehicle were in fact being managed and controlled in a common interest. Pp. 117-122.\n\n\n (b) Section 5 (4) is not limited to the proscription of holding companies and other corporate devices; it applies to the accomplishment or effectuation of control or management in a common interest of two or more carriers, \"however such result is attained\"; and the Commission's conclusion that the informal de facto relationships found to exist in this case resulted in control or management of the two corporations in a common interest which violated 5 (4) is sustained. Pp. 122-126.\n\n\n (c) The Commission did not act arbitrarily in denying approval of the proposed merger because of the violation of 5 (4), and its order denying such approval is affirmed. Pp. 127-129. \n\n[371 \nU.S. 115, 116]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n (d) Since the record contains no evidence that the parties were heard on the issue of divestiture or that proper standards were applied in determining that it was the appropriate remedy for the violation of 5 (4) found to exist in this case, the judgment of the District Court is reversed in part, and the case is remanded for further proceedings. Pp. 129-131.\n\n\n 196 F. Supp. 351, affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n\nLoyd M. Starrett, by special leave of Court, pro hac vice, argued the cause for appellants. With him on the briefs was Henry E. Foley.\n\nLionel Kestenbaum argued the cause for the United States et al. With him on the briefs were Solicitor General Cox, Assistant Attorney General Loevinger, Robert W. Ginnane and James Y. Piper.\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case concerns disapproval by the Interstate Commerce Commission of a proposed merger on the ground that \"control and management in a common interest\" over the two applicant-carriers had been unlawfully effectuated prior to the merger application in violation of 5 (4) of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended, 54 Stat. 907, 49 U.S.C. 5 (4).\n1\n\u00a0\n\nThe applicant-carriers are L. Nelson & Sons Transportation Co. and Gilbertville Trucking Co., both of whom are certificated by the Commission as common carrier motor carriers. The principal stockholders of Nelson Co. are two half brothers, Charles Chilberg and Clifford Nelson; Gilbertville Co. is wholly owned by a third brother, Kenneth Nelson.\n\nThe merger application was filed October 6, 1955, by the two carriers and their stockholders pursuant to 5 (2) of \n\n[371 \nU.S. 115, 117]\n\u00a0\n the Act. Two and a half months later the Commission initiated an investigation into the possibility of a 5 (4) violation pursuant to authority granted by 5 (7) of the Act. The two proceedings were consolidated for hearing. The trial examiner determined that 5 (4) was being violated, but recommended that the merger be approved on the ground that the violation was neither intentional nor flagrant. Division 4 affirmed the finding of a violation, but disapproved the merger, and ordered the violation terminated. 75 M. C. C. 45. On reconsideration, the full Commission affirmed the Division, but further ordered that Kenneth Nelson divest himself of Gilbertville Co. 80 M. C. C. 257. A suit before a three-judge United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts to enjoin and set aside the Commission's orders was dismissed on the ground that the orders were reasonable and supported by substantial evidence. 196 F. Supp. 351. An appeal was taken to this Court contesting (1) the finding of a 5 (4) violation, (2) the denial of the merger, and (3) the order of divestiture. We noted probable jurisdiction. \n368 \nU.S. 983\n.\n\nThe factual issue in this case turns upon the development of family, management, and operational relationships between Nelson, Gilbertville, and a third carrier, R. A. Byrnes, Inc., which is owned by the principal stockholders of Nelson.\n\nThe Nelson transportation business was first organized in 1930 as a partnership. In 1947 it was incorporated as L. Nelson & Sons Transportation Co. and stock issued to Mrs. Nelson (formerly Mrs. Chilberg) and four of her seven children (including Kenneth Nelson, Clifford Nelson, and Charles Chilberg). Upon Mrs. Nelson's death in 1950, equal numbers of shares of her stock in Nelson Co. were devised to her seven children. In 1951, Kenneth Nelson sold his original shares received in 1947 to Charles Chilberg and Clifford Nelson, and agreed to sell to them \n\n[371 \nU.S. 115, 118]\n\u00a0\n the remainder to which he was entitled on distribution of the estate. The distribution and transfer were made on January 23, 1953. Since that date, Charles and Clifford have been the principal stockholders in Nelson Co. Charles is now president and treasurer; Clifford is secretary and assistant treasurer.\n\nUpon the sale of his stock in 1951, Kenneth Nelson resigned as an officer and director of Nelson Co. However, he kept his office at Nelson Co. headquarters in Ellington, Connecticut, and was retained by the company as a \"free-lance tariff consultant.\" In such capacity he was paid approximately $15,000 in 1952 and $13,000 in 1953. While he claims to have been an independent contractor, his only client was Nelson Co. In the third week of January 1953, Kenneth Nelson wrote to Nelson Co.'s accountant, Mr. Sanol Solomon, requesting advice on the acquisition of Gilbertville Trucking Co. Soon thereafter Kenneth began negotiations with Gilbertville's owner, and on March 3, 1953, took over control. Since July 1953, all the stock in Gilbertville has been controlled by Kenneth.\n\nIn April of 1954 Charles Chilberg and Clifford Nelson obtained temporary authority from the Commission to take over the operations of R. A. Byrnes, Inc.; their acquisition of Byrnes stock was approved in August 1956.\n\nThe routes of these three carriers form a cohesive network along the eastern seaboard from Massachusetts to the District of Columbia. Gilbertville is presently certificated by the Commission as a common carrier for general commodities over regular and irregular routes between points in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New York City. Byrnes is certificated as a common carrier for general commodities over irregular routes between New York City, Philadelphia, the District of Columbia, and points adjacent to these cities. It is also certificated as a contract carrier of canned goods in Massachusetts, \n\n[371 \nU.S. 115, 119]\n\u00a0\n Connecticut, and Rhode Island. Nelson is certificated as a common carrier for textile commodities over irregular routes between points in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and areas adjacent to New York and Philadelphia. It is also certificated for general commodities in intrastate traffic in Connecticut and Massachusetts. Thus, the Gilbertville and Byrnes general-commodity routes complement each other perfectly and overlap to a considerable degree the textile routes of Nelson.\n\nSoon after his acquisition of Gilbertville, Kenneth Nelson instituted a number of permanent changes in the carrier's operations tending to integrate the terminal facilities of Nelson and Gilbertville; he received where necessary the cooperation of Nelson Co. Kenneth obtained permission from the Commission to move the business records and head offices of the acquired company from Gilbertville, Massachusetts, the place of incorporation, to Ellington, Connecticut, and took over the second floor of the Nelson Co. office building. Where possible Gilbertville used the Nelson terminals, subletting from Nelson in Ellington, Connecticut; New York City; Newton, Massachusetts; and Woonsocket, Rhode Island. Its only other terminal was at Gilbertville, Massachusetts. In seven cities, Gilbertville and Nelson were listed under the same telephone number, and they shared interterminal telephone lines. Almost identical changes took place in 1954 upon Commission approval of Charles Chilberg and Clifford Nelson's acquisition of Byrnes. Byrnes' offices were moved from Mullica Hill, New Jersey, to the Nelson Co. headquarters in Ellington, Connecticut; Byrnes shared the Nelson terminal in New York; it listed under the Nelson telephone number; it shared interterminal telephone lines. Since the Byrnes changes were the direct result of control and management in a common interest of Byrnes and Nelson in the hands of Charles and Clifford, it \n\n[371 \nU.S. 115, 120]\n\u00a0\n might be inferred that the Gilbertville changes were similarly indicative of control and management in a common interest of Nelson and Gilbertville.\n\nFurther substantiation of this terminal integration is provided by a fourth corporation, Bergson Company, a real estate corporation formed to receive the residual properties of Mrs. Linnea Nelson's estate. Bergson owns the terminals leased to Nelson Co. at Philadelphia, Ellington, Woonsocket, and Newton, three of which are sublet to Gilbertville. Since Bergson is owned in equal shares by all seven children, all of whom are directors, it provides a direct corporate tie-in between Kenneth Nelson and his brothers.\n\nWhile it is not unusual for independent carriers to share terminal facilities, as indeed Gilbertville and Nelson do with unrelated carriers in New York and Woonsocket, the repetition of such practices throughout their respective systems makes their alleged independence suspect. When these practices are then supplemented by further day-to-day practices integrating business, equipment, and managerial policies, the Commission is justified in concluding the carriers are in fact being managed and controlled in a common interest. Such additional practices are readily found in the record of this case.\n\nMost significant is the equipment interdependence between Nelson and Gilbertville. When acquired for $35,000 in 1953, Gilbertville had a deficit about equal to the purchase price, assets of only $69,000, and a 1953 operating revenue of only $75,000. By 1956 Kenneth Nelson had increased the operating revenue to a seven month figure of $444,777. This impressive growth was made in the face of a continual short-term credit squeeze and lack of working capital and equipment. Nelson Co., however, was operating in a declining textile market in the Northeast with highly periodic demands for carriage. As a result, Nelson had a fluctuating overcapacity in \n\n[371 \nU.S. 115, 121]\n\u00a0\n equipment which was leased only to Gilbertville and occasionally Byrnes. Kenneth Nelson estimated that Gilbertville had from one to six tractor-trailer units on trip-lease from Nelson Co. every day and up to five other pieces of equipment on permanent lease, an amount equal at times to over one-half of Gilbertville's own carriage capacity. Added to this equipment interdependence between Nelson and Gilbertville were certain interlining practices.\n2\n Gilbertville interlined between 25% and 30% of its business. Over one-third of this interline business was with Nelson Co. and Byrnes, the majority being in truckload quantities. Owing to its equipment shortage, Gilbertville interlined with Nelson pursuant to a practice whereby a trip-lease was made out at the start of a run to take effect at the point of transfer to Gilbertville routes so that the Nelson tractor-trailer operated throughout the trip; moreover, the same driver might stay with the unit, changing employers at the point of transfer.\n3\n\u00a0\n\n[371 \nU.S. 115, 122]\n\u00a0\n\n\nFinally, the record includes evidence that on four occasions Commission employees discovered on highway spot checks that one of the carriers carried small shipments belonging to the other; that Nelson did about one-quarter of the Gilbertville repairs; and that Charles Chilberg and Kenneth Nelson each exercised managerial control over employees of both Nelson and Gilbertville.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nThis evidence is sufficient to show that Nelson and Gilbertville were in fact being controlled and managed in a common interest to a considerable degree. If 5 (4) was intended by Congress to reach such de facto relationships, the Commission was warranted in concluding the section was being violated.\n\n\nI.\n\n\nSection 5 (4) is part of a comprehensive legislative scheme designed to place ownership, management, and operational control over common carriers within the regulatory jurisdiction of the Commission. Simply, 5 (2) (a) gives the Commission power to authorize and approve the \n\n[371 \nU.S. 115, 123]\n\u00a0\n joint operation of properties belonging to two or more common carriers or the merger of such carriers; 5 (4) then declares,\n\n \"It shall be unlawful for any person, except as provided in paragraph (2), to enter into any transaction within the scope of subparagraph (a) thereof, or to accomplish or effectuate, or to participate in accomplishing or effectuating, the control or management in a common interest of any two or more carriers, however such result is attained, whether directly or indirectly, by use of common directors, officers, or stockholders, a holding or investment company or companies, a voting trust or trusts, or in any other manner whatsoever. . . . As used in this paragraph . . . the words `control or management' shall be construed to include the power to exercise control or management.\"\n\n\n The complementary character of these two sections was discussed at some length in United States v. Marshall Transport Co., \n322 \nU.S. 31\n. As originally enacted in the Emergency Railroad Transportation Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 217, 5 (4) was applicable only to railroads; it was extended to cover motor carriers in the Transportation Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 905, 907-908. As the appellants correctly state, Congress, in passing 5 (4) and the supplementary 5 (5) and (6),\n5\n was primarily concerned with \n\n[371 \nU.S. 115, 124]\n\u00a0\n reaching the elaborate corporate devices used to centralize control over the railroads \"without commission supervision and in defiance of the will of Congress.\"\n6\n Although Congress had intended the Transportation Act of 1920 to provide complete supervision, the Act proved inadequate \n\n[371 \nU.S. 115, 125]\n\u00a0\n to reach the holding company system.\n7\n On the basis of this history, the appellants argue that 5 (4) is limited to proscription of corporate devices and will not reach the informal relationships shown on this record.\n\nSuch a narrow interpretation of the statute, however, confuses the particular manifestation of the problem with which Congress was faced in 1933 with the ultimate congressional intention of effectuating the Commission's jurisdiction under 5 (2). On its face, 5 (4) proscribes not just corporate and legal devices, but control effectuated \"in any other manner whatsoever.\" Any doubt as to the scope of this phrase was removed when Congress added the definition of \"control\" to 1 (3) (b) of the Act in the Transportation Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 899-900. This section states that for purposes of 5 and other sections, \"control\" \"shall be construed to include actual as well as legal control, whether maintained or exercised through or by reason of the method of or circumstances surrounding organization or operation . . . .\" We have construed this language to encompass every type of control in fact and have left to the agency charged with enforcement the determination from the facts whether \"control\" exists, subject to normal standards of review. Marshall Transport Co., supra, p. 38; Alleghany Corp. v. Breswick & Co., \n353 \nU.S. 151, 163\n-165; Rochester Telephone Corp. v. United States, \n307 \nU.S. 125, 145\n-146. In this manner, the Commission may adapt 5 (4) to the actualities and current practices of the industry involved and apply it to the extent it feels necessary to protect its jurisdiction under 5 (2) without having to return to Congress for additional authority every time industry practices change.\n\nA cursory glance at Commission experience shows the type of informal practices in the motor carrier industry which the Commission has decided are covered by 5 (4) \n\n[371 \nU.S. 115, 126]\n\u00a0\n and must first be approved under 5 (2). Typical of these practices have been attempts by active carriers to effectively lease the routes of a dormant carrier by interlining and trip-leasing their equipment continuously over the dormant carrier's routes, e. g., Nigro Freight Lines, Inc. - Purchase - Coady Trucking Co., 90 M. C. C. 113; attempts by carriers to acquire other carriers by supplying funds to allegedly independent third-party purchasers, e. g., Black - Investigation of Control - Colony Motor Transportation, 75 M. C. C. 275; Coldway Food Express, Inc. - Control and Merger - Foodway Express, Inc., 87 M. C. C. 123; attempts by inactive owners to allow an employee of another carrier to manage and merge operations of the two carriers, e. g., Gate City Transport Co. - Control - Square Deal Cartage Co., 87 M. C. C. 591. In the present case, the trial examiner held that the facts in this record \"require a finding\" of control and management in a common interest in violation of 5 (4). Division 4, after a similar review of the facts, concurred. On reconsideration, the full Commission affirmed the finding and conclusion of the examiner and Division 4. Judicial review of this conclusion is limited to consideration of whether it has a rational basis and is supported by substantial evidence. United States v. Pierce Auto Lines, Inc., \n327 \nU.S. 515\n; Mississippi Barge Line Co. v. United States, \n292 \nU.S. 282, 286\n-287.\n8\n After our review of the facts and statutory sections involved, we detect no reason to disturb this finding.\n9\n\u00a0\n\n[371 \nU.S. 115, 127]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nHowever, even admitting a 5 (4) violation, the appellants protest as arbitrary the denial of their application for approval of the proposed merger of Nelson and Gilbertville. Section 5 (2) provides that a transaction within its scope is to be approved if found to be \"consistent with the public interest.\" The statute entrusts the Commission with the duty to decide what considerations other than those specifically mentioned in 5 (2) (c) shall be given weight. Cf. McLean Trucking Co. v. United States, \n321 \nU.S. 67, 86\n-88; Schwabacher v. United States, \n334 \nU.S. 182, 193\n. As in the case of an original application for a certificate, the Commission has chosen to give weight to an applicant's fitness. E. g., Transamerican Freight Lines, Inc. - Control and Merger - The Cumberland Motor Express Corp., 75 M. C. C. 423, 428; cf. Interstate Commerce Act, 207, 49 Stat. 551, 49 U.S.C. 307. Integral to a determination of fitness is the applicant's willingness and ability to fulfill its obligations to \n\n[371 \nU.S. 115, 128]\n\u00a0\n the Commission, considerations which may be demonstrated in part by past or continuing violations of Commission regulations. E. g., Powell - Purchase - Rampy, 57 M. C. C. 597. This has not been contested by the appellants, and its relevance to a finding of consistency with the public interest is self-evident. Nor do they dispute the principle recently stated by the Commission in Central of Georgia R. Co. Control, 307 I. C. C. 39, 43, that a 5 (4) violation may alone bar approval of a merger unless, \"upon consideration of all the facts, it clearly appears that the public interest will be served best by such approval.\" Rather, they contend that in this case the Commission refused to consider all the facts presented and, in effect, made a 5 (4) violation an automatic bar to approval of a subsequent merger. To support this allegation, the appellants point to the undisputed findings of the trial examiner that the violation in this case was neither willful, flagrant, nor the result of persistent disregard for regulation. They compare these findings with past Commission holdings that violations will be overlooked in the absence of willfulness, e. g., Gate City Transport Co. - Control - Square Deal Cartage Co., supra, and conclude that the rule applied in the present case must have been automatic.\n\nHowever, even an automatic rule is not necessarily arbitrary. As already noted, 5 (4) is integral to the success of the regulatory scheme. To approve a merger in the face of a 5 (4) violation may encourage others whose merger may or may not be consistent with the public interest to either present the Commission with a fait accompli or avoid its jurisdiction altogether. As the Commission pointed out in Central of Georgia, if such practices were encouraged, \"our administration of the statute in the public interest would be seriously hindered, if not defeated.\" 307 I. C. C., at 44. This additional interest in the proper administration of the statute places \n\n[371 \nU.S. 115, 129]\n\u00a0\n upon the applicant a heavier burden than may be the case for other regulatory violations, and mere lack of willfulness or alleged innocence need not suffice.\n\nIn fact, the Commission's rule is not automatic and will give way to a clear showing of public interest in approval. However, the appellants cannot attack the Commission's order under even this less stringent rule since they made no clear showing of a public interest in approval such as a public need for the merged service or for larger consolidated carriers. The order denying the merger is therefore affirmed.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nThe Commission's final order requires Kenneth Nelson to divest himself of his stock in Gilbertville Co. in order to terminate the 5 (4) violation. No other reference to divestiture can be found. In view of his recommendation that the merger be approved, the trial examiner made no findings or recommendations on a remedy for the violation. Division 4, upon denial of the merger, simply ordered that each of the applicants is hereby \"required to terminate the violation.\" On reconsideration, the full Commission reinstated Division 4's order, but added, without explanation in its report, the order to divest. The District Court attempted to provide the rationale by suggesting that divestiture was so perfectly suited to the nature of the violation, an unlawful acquisition, that no explanation was necessary.\n\nThere is little question that divestiture is within the scope of the Commission's power since, with respect to a 5 (4) violation, it may order any party to \"take such action as may be necessary, in the opinion of the Commission, to prevent continuance of such violation.\" 5 (7). Where the unlawful control is the result of an acquisition, divestiture may be the only effective remedy. However, as 5 (7) itself implies, the Commission's power is corrective, \n\n[371 \nU.S. 115, 130]\n\u00a0\n not punitive. The justification for the remedy is the removal of the violation.\n\nThe use of equitable powers to expunge a statutory violation has been fully developed in the context of the antitrust laws and is, in many respects, applicable to 5 (7). The \"most drastic, but most effective\" of these remedies is divestiture. And \"[i]f the Court concludes that other measures will not be effective to redress a violation, and that complete divestiture is a necessary element of effective relief, the Government cannot be denied the latter remedy because economic hardship, however severe, may result.\" United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., \n366 \nU.S. 316, 326\n-327. Our duty is to give \"complete and efficacious effect to the prohibitions of the statute\" with as little injury as possible to the interests of private parties or the general public. United States v. American Tobacco Co., \n221 \nU.S. 106, 185\n. As these cases indicate, the choice of remedy is as important a decision as the initial construction of the statute and finding of a violation. The court or agency charged with this choice has a heavy responsibility to tailor the remedy to the particular facts of each case so as to best effectuate the remedial objectives just described. Cf. Hecht Co. v. Bowles, \n321 \nU.S. 321, 329\n-331.\n\nAs 5 (7) expressly states, the Commission is charged with choosing the proper remedy in this case. Judicial review is accordingly limited. \"It extends no further than to ascertain whether the Commission made an allowable judgment in its choice of the remedy.\" Jacob Siegel Co. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, \n327 \nU.S. 608, 612\n. But prerequisite to such review is evidence that a judgment was in fact made, that the parties were heard on the issue, that the proper standards were applied. We find no such evidence in this record. Rather we are faced with evidence that the statutory violation occurred not just from Kenneth Nelson's act of acquiring Gilbertville, \n\n[371 \nU.S. 115, 131]\n\u00a0\n but from the acquisition plus subsequent practices integrating the management and operations of Nelson and Gilbertville, practices that could conceivably be discontinued without divestiture. In addition the trial examiner found that the violation was not willful and that the parties' experience in this proceeding would make them more responsive to regulation in the future.\n\nBy referring to these mitigating considerations, we have no intention of prejudging the Commission or implying that divestiture would be unwarranted after proper treatment of the issue. These considerations merely indicate that a doubt can be raised and that a remand to the Commission is not purely academic for the sake of procedural regularity. When the Commission has exercised its judgment and issued its considered opinion, the propriety of the remedy chosen will be ripe for review. Jacob Siegel Co. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, supra; Administrative Procedure Act. 8 (b), 60 Stat. 242, 5 U.S.C. 1007 (b).\n\nThe judgment of the District Court is reversed in part and the case remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n\n    It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. 1 et seq., is hereinafter referred to as \"the Act\" or by the section number alone.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] \"Interlining\" is the practice whereby a carrier, whose certificated routes do not reach the shipment destination, transfers the shipment to another carrier for delivery. \"Interchanging\" is a form of interlining whereby the two interlining carriers switch trailers at the point of transfer. An interchange is most common where the shipment involves a truckload quantity, and the exchange of trailers obviates the necessity of unloading the shipment from the trailer of the transferor and loading it on the trailer of the transferee. The trailer taken in exchange for the shipment-trailer may be either empty or loaded with an interline shipment in the other direction. A further form of interlining involves the use of a trip-lease for the transferee's leg of the journey. There the shipment-trailer is taken by the transferee, but no trailer is given in exchange; instead the transferor will lease the shipment-trailer to the transferee for the completion of the trip.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Commission employee Edward D. Shea testified that Gilbertville's terminal manager, John Kashady, had informed him that both these practices were regularly employed. Gilbertville records also indicate that Gilbertville lists the names of all Nelson drivers and keeps their doctor's certificates on file. Other records indicate that \n\n[371 \nU.S. 115, 122]\n\u00a0\n Nelson drivers are often hired by Gilbertville during the same week and sometimes on the same day. The trip-lease arrangement is also supported by the fact that the majority of Nelson-Gilbertville interlining is at Monson, Connecticut, where Gilbertville Co. keeps only an open lot and, when possible, an empty, unguarded trailer for the receipt of less-than-truckload shipments. Kenneth Nelson's testimony on these practices is ambiguous but, if anything, supports their occurrence.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Edward D. Shea testified that he observed Charles Chilberg hire and dispatch a Gilbertville driver at Newton. He also testified that he observed Kenneth Nelson receive a teletype message in the Nelson Co. offices in Ellington, Connecticut, and direct Nelson Co. employees. The incident is disputed on the ground that Shea did not hear all the remarks made. On the other hand, it is to be noted that Kenneth Nelson refused to turn over upon request the teletype message he received on that occasion, an action in violation of Commission regulations.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Section 5 (4) is supplemented by 5 (5) and (6) to cover specific instances where control over another carrier is accomplished with the aid of an intermediary. Section 5 (5) provides in part that control or management in a common interest is conclusively presumed whenever a person \"affiliated\" with a carrier joins with that carrier to acquire, or on his own acquires, control over another carrier. Section 5 (6) then provides that: \"For the purposes of this section a person shall be held to be affiliated with a carrier if, by reason of the relationship of such person \n\n[371 \nU.S. 115, 124]\n\u00a0\n to such carrier . . ., it is reasonable to believe that the affairs of any carrier of which control may be acquired by such person will be managed in the interest of such other carrier.\" Parenthetically, 5 (6) states that the relationship may be shown \"by reason of the method of, or circumstances surrounding organization or operation . . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The Committee reports on these sections prior to their passage in the Emergency Railroad Transportation Act of 1933 stated their purpose as follows: \"These paragraphs have been planned in the light of what has already been done through myriad devices without commission supervision and in defiance of the will of Congress. . . . The provisions of paragraph [(4)] . . . would be of little effect unless the language contained therein were construed to include control or management effectuated or exercised indirectly through the use of legal devices such as holding companies, voting trusts, and combinations of affiliated interests. It is therefore intended by the provisions of paragraphs [(5)], [(6)] . . . to make sure that paragraph [(4)] . . . covers such types of control and management.\" S. Rep. No. 87, 73d Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 9-10; H. R. Rep. No. 193, 73d Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 16-17. The House manager of the bill similarly observed, 77 Cong. Rec. 4857: \"The important point is that unifications and groupings of railroads have been accomplished entirely without supervision by the Commission and without any opportunity to consider the question of public interest. . . . It is to correct this condition, and to prevent through the use of holding companies and other devices the defeat of the congressional will, that this bill has been drawn.\" Concrete examples of the devices Congress intended to reach are found in the testimony of Committee counsel Mr. Walter Splawn and Interstate Commerce Commissioner Joseph Eastman during the Hearings on H. R. 9059 before the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 72d Cong., 1st Sess., at 21-25, 34, 48-50, 61, 69-74 (1932).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Hearings, op. cit., supra, note 6, pp. 16-19, 24-26; H. R. Rep. No. 650, 66th Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 63-64 (1920).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] In Rochester Telephone Corp. v. United States, supra, pp. 145-146, this Court gave the following test for reviewing a similar finding of \"control\" by the Federal Communications Commission as that word is used in the Federal Communications Act, 48 Stat. 1064, 47 U.S.C. 152 (b): \"This is an issue of fact to be determined by the special circumstances of each case. So long as there is warrant in the record for the judgment of the expert body it must stand.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] In view of the direct finding of a 5 (4) violation by the Commission and our determination that such a finding was warranted by \n\n[371 \nU.S. 115, 127]\n\u00a0\n the statute and evidence, we find it unnecessary to consider the Commission's alternative holding that Kenneth Nelson was \"affiliated\" with Nelson within the meaning of 5 (6) and is therefore presumed to have effectuated control or management in a common interest pursuant to 5 (5) when he acquired Gilbertville. The appellants attack the opinion of the District Court on the ground that there are variations between its statement of facts and the findings of the Commission. Such variations are insignificant in light of the fact that the court then quotes the findings of the Commission giving record citations for each statement. The appellants also contend that when the District Court found certain of the Commission's findings to be \"trivial\" and \"irrelevant,\" it should have remanded for further findings. However, as the court itself pointed out, its disagreements with the Commission were minor and did not affect the substance of the Commission's ultimate finding of a violation. Cf. Communist Party v.

United States, \n289 \nU.S. 553\n, this Court held that the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the United States Court of Claims were neither confined in jurisdiction nor protected in independence by Article III of the Constitution, but that both had been created by virtue of other, substantive, powers possessed by Congress under Article I. The Congress has since pronounced its disagreement by providing as to each that \"such court is hereby declared to be a court established under article III of the Constitution of the United \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 532]\n\u00a0\n States.\"\n1\n The petitioners in these cases invite us to reaffirm the authority of our earlier decisions, and thus hold for naught these congressional pronouncements, at least as sought to be applied to judges appointed prior to their enactment.\n\nNo. 242 is a suit brought by individual employees in a New York state court to recover damages for breach of a collective bargaining agreement, and removed to the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York by the defendant employer on the ground of diversity of citizenship. The employees' right to recover was sustained by a divided panel of the Court of Appeals, in an opinion by Judge J. Warren Madden, then an active judge of the Court of Claims sitting by designation of the Chief Justice of the United States under 28 U.S.C. 293 (a).\n2\n No. 481 is a criminal prosecution instituted in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and resulting in a conviction for armed robbery. The trial was presided over by Judge Joseph R. Jackson, a retired judge of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals sitting by similar designation.\n3\n The petitioner's application for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 533]\n\u00a0\n in forma pauperis, respecting the validity of this designation and alleged trial errors, was upheld by this Court last Term, \n366 \nU.S. 712\n; we are now asked to review the Court of Appeals' affirmance of his conviction. Because of the significance of the \"designation\" issue for the federal judicial system, we granted certiorari in the two cases, \n368 \nU.S. 814, 815\n, limited to the question whether the judgment in either was vitiated by the respective participation of the judges named.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nThe claim advanced by the petitioners, that they were denied the protection of judges with tenure and compensation guaranteed by Article III, has nothing to do with the manner in which either of these judges conducted himself in these proceedings. No contention is made that either Judge Madden or Judge Jackson displayed a lack of appropriate judicial independence, or that either sought by his rulings to curry favor with Congress or the Executive. Both indeed enjoy statutory assurance of tenure and compensation,\n5\n and were it not for the explicit provisions of Article III we should be quite unable to say that either judge's participation even colorably denied the petitioners independent judicial hearings.\n\nArticle III, 1, however, is explicit and gives the petitioners a basis for complaint without requiring them to point to particular instances of mistreatment in the record. It provides:\n\n \"The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 534]\n\u00a0\n Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services, a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.\"\n6\n\u00a0\n\n\n Apart from this provision, it is settled that neither the tenure nor salary of federal officers is constitutionally protected from impairment by Congress. Crenshaw v. United States, \n134 \nU.S. 99, 107\n-108; cf. Butler v. Pennsylvania, 10 How. 402, 416-418. The statutory declaration, therefore, that the judges of these two courts should serve during good behavior and with undiminished salary, see note 5, supra, was ineffective to bind any subsequent Congress unless those judges were invested at appointment with the protections of Article III. United States v. Fisher, \n109 \nU.S. 143, 145\n; see McAllister v. United States, \n141 \nU.S. 174, 186\n. And the petitioners naturally point to the Bakelite and Williams cases, supra, as establishing that no such constitutional protection was in fact conferred.\n\nThe distinction referred to in those cases between \"constitutional\" and \"legislative\" courts has been productive of much confusion and controversy. Because of the highly theoretical nature of the problem in its present context,\n7\n we would be well advised to decide these cases on narrower grounds if any are fairly available. But for reasons that follow, we find ourselves unable to do so. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 535]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nNo challenge to the authority of the judges was filed in the course of the proceedings before them in either case. The Solicitor General, who submitted briefs and arguments for the United States, has seized upon this circumstance to suggest that the petitioners should be precluded by the so-called de facto doctrine from questioning the validity of these designations for the first time on appeal.\n\nWhatever may be the rule when a judge's authority is challenged at the earliest practicable moment, as it was in United States v. American-Foreign S. S. Corp., \n363 \nU.S. 685\n, in other circumstances involving judicial authority this Court has described it as well settled \"that where there is an office to be filled and one acting under color of authority fills the office and discharges its duties, his actions are those of an officer de facto and binding upon the public.\" McDowell v. United States, \n159 \nU.S. 596, 602\n. The rule is founded upon an obviously sound policy of preventing litigants from abiding the outcome of a lawsuit and then overturning it if adverse upon a technicality of which they were previously aware. Although a United States Attorney may be permitted on behalf of the public to upset an order issued upon defective authority, Frad v. Kelly, \n302 \nU.S. 312\n, a private litigant ordinarily may not. Ball v. United States, \n140 \nU.S. 118, 128\n-129.\n\nThe rule does not obtain, of course, when the alleged defect of authority operates also as a limitation on this Court's appellate jurisdiction. Ayrshire Collieries Corp. v. United States, \n331 \nU.S. 132\n (three-judge court); United States v. Emholt, \n105 \nU.S. 414\n (certificate of divided opinion). In other circumstances as well, when the statute claimed to restrict authority is not merely technical \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 536]\n\u00a0\n but embodies a strong policy concerning the proper administration of judicial business, this Court has treated the alleged defect as \"jurisdictional\" and agreed to consider it on direct review even though not raised at the earliest practicable opportunity. E. g., American Construction Co. v. Jacksonville, T. & K. W. R. Co., \n148 \nU.S. 372, 387\n-388.\n\nA fortiori is this so when the challenge is based upon nonfrivolous constitutional grounds. In McDowell v. United States itself, supra, at 598-599, the Court, while holding that any defect in statutory authorization for a particular intracircuit assignment was immunized from examination by the de facto doctrine, specifically passed upon and upheld the constitutional authority of Congress to provide for such an assignment. And in Lamar v. United States, \n241 \nU.S. 103, 117\n-118, the claim that an intercircuit assignment violated the criminal venue restrictions of the Sixth Amendment and usurped the presidential appointing power under Art. II, 2, was heard here and determined upon its merits, despite the fact that it had not been raised in the District Court or in the Court of Appeals or even in this Court until the filing of a supplemental brief upon a second request for review.\n\nThe alleged defect of authority here relates to basic constitutional protections designed in part for the benefit of litigants. See O'Donoghue v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 516, 532\n-534. It should be examinable at least on direct review, where its consideration encounters none of the objections associated with the principle of res judicata, that there be an end to litigation. At the most is weighed in opposition the disruption to sound appellate process entailed by entertaining objections not raised below, and that is plainly insufficient to overcome the strong interest of the federal judiciary in maintaining the constitutional plan of separation of powers. So this Court has concluded \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 537]\n\u00a0\n on an analogous balance struck to protect against intruding federal jurisdiction into the area constitutionally reserved to the States: Whether diversity of citizenship exists may be questioned on direct review for the first time in this Court. Mansfield, C. & L. M. R. Co. v. Swan, \n111 \nU.S. 379, 382\n; City of Gainesville v. Brown-Crummer Investment Co., \n277 \nU.S. 54, 59\n. We hold that it is similarly open to these petitioners to challenge the constitutional authority of the judges below.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nThe Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia found it unnecessary to reach the question whether Judge Jackson enjoyed constitutional security of tenure and compensation. It held that even if he did not, Congress might authorize his assignment to courts in the District of Columbia, by virtue of its power \"To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever\" over the District. Art. I, 8, cl. 17. The Solicitor General, in support of that ruling, argues here that because the criminal charge against petitioner Lurk was violation of a local statute, D.C. Code, 1961, 22-2901, rather than of one national in application, its trial did not require the assignment of an Article III judge.\n\nThe question thus raised is itself of constitutional dimension, and one which we need not reach if an Article III judge was in fact assigned. In the companion case, No. 242, the necessity for such a judge is uncontested. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit sat to determine a question of state contract law presented for its decision solely by reason of the diverse citizenship of the litigants.\n8\n Authority for the Federal Government to \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 538]\n\u00a0\n decide questions of state law exists only by virtue of the Diversity Clause in Article III. Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, \n304 \nU.S. 64\n; see Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., 18 How. 272 284. For this reason, the question whether Judge Madden enjoyed constitutional independence is inescapably presented. Since decision of that question involves considerations bearing directly upon the constitutional status of Judge Jackson, we deem it appropriate to dispose of both cases on the same grounds, without at present intimating any view as to the correctness of the holding below by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nThe next question is whether the character of the judges who sat in these cases may be determined without reference to the character of the courts to which they were originally appointed. If it were plain that these judges were invested upon confirmation with Article III tenure and compensation, it would be unnecessary for present purposes to consider the constitutional status of the Court of Claims and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.\n\nNo such course, however, appears to be open. The statutes under which Judge Madden and Judge Jackson were appointed speak of service only on those courts. 28 U.S.C. 171, 211. They were not, as were the judges selected for the late Commerce Court, appointed as \"additional circuit judges,\" Act of June 18, 1910, c. 309, 36 Stat. 539, 540, whose tenure might be constitutionally secured regardless of the fortunes of their courts. See 50 Cong. Rec. 5409-5418 (1913); Donegan v. Dyson, \n269 \nU.S. 49\n; Frankfurter and Landis, The Business of the Supreme Court (1927), 168-173. It is true that at the time of Judge Jackson's appointment there was in force a statute authorizing assignment of Court of Customs and Patent Appeals judges to serve on the courts of the \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 539]\n\u00a0\n District of Columbia. Act of September 14, 1922, c. 306, 5, 42 Stat. 837, 839. At that time, however, before the O'Donoghue decision, there seems to have been a consensus that the courts of the District were not confined or protected by Article III; as late as 1930, this Court regarded it as \"recognized that the courts of the District of Columbia are not created under the judiciary article of the Constitution but are legislative courts . . . .\" Federal Radio Comm'n v. General Electric Co., \n281 \nU.S. 464, 468\n; and see Katz, Federal Legislative Courts, 43 Harv. L. Rev. 894, 899-903 (1930). The 1922 Act cannot therefore be viewed ex proprio vigore as conferring Article III status on judges subsequently appointed to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.\n9\n\u00a0\n\nA more novel suggestion is that the assignment statute itself, 28 U.S.C. 291-296, authorized the Chief Justice to appoint inferior Article III judges in the course of designating them for service on Article III courts.\n10\n See Shartel, Federal Judges - Appointment, Supervision, and Removal - Some Possibilities under the Constitution, 28 Mich. L. Rev. 485 (1930); cf. Ex parte Siebold, \n100 \nU.S. 371, 397\n-398; Rice v. Ames, \n180 \nU.S. 371, 378\n. But we need not consider the constitutional questions involved in this suggestion, for the statute does not readily lend itself \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 540]\n\u00a0\n to such a construction. If nothing else, the authority given the Chief Justice in 28 U.S.C. 295 to revoke assignments previously made is wholly inconsistent with a reading of the statute as empowering him to appoint inferior Article III judges. Judges assigned by the Chief Justice who are not previously endowed with constitutional security of tenure and compensation thus can gain nothing by the designation.\n11\n\u00a0\n\nIt is significant that Congress did not enact the present broad assignment statute until after it had declared the Court of Claims and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals to be constitutional courts. Act of August 25, 1958, 72 Stat. 848. A major purpose of these declarations was to eliminate uncertainty whether regular Article III judges might be assigned to assist in the business of those courts when disability or disqualification made it difficult for them to obtain a quorum.\n12\n Those doubts, suggested by dicta in Ex parte Bakelite Corp., \n279 \nU.S. 438, 460\n, would be expanded rather than allayed were we to hold that the judges of the Court of Claims and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals enjoy the protections of Article III while leaving at large the status of those courts. For these various reasons, the constitutional quality of tenure and compensation extended \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 541]\n\u00a0\n Judges Madden and Jackson at the time of their confirmation must be deemed to have depended upon the constitutional status of the courts to which they were primarily appointed.\n\n\nIV.\n\n\n\nIn determining the constitutional character of the Court of Claims and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, as we are thus led to do, we may not disregard Congress' declaration that they were created under Article III. Of course, Congress may not by fiat overturn the constitutional decisions of this Court, but the legislative history of the 1953 and 1958 declarations makes plain that it was far from attempting any such thing. Typical is a statement in the 1958 House Report that the purpose of the legislation was to \"declare which of the powers Congress was intending to exercise when the court was created.\" H. R. Rep. No. 2349, 85th Cong., 2d Sess. 3 (1958); accord, H. R. Rep. No. 695, 83d Cong., 1st Sess. 3, 5, 7 (1953); and see S. Rep. No. 275, 83d Cong., 1st Sess. 2 (1953), substituted for S. Rep. No. 261, 83d Cong., 1st Sess. 2 (1953); 99 Cong. Rec. 8943, 8944 (1953) (remarks of Senator Gore).\n\n\"Subsequent legislation which declares the intent of an earlier law,\" this Court has noted, \"is not, of course, conclusive in determining what the previous Congress meant. But the later law is entitled to weight when it comes to the problem of construction.\" Federal Housing Administration v. Darlington, Inc., \n358 \nU.S. 84, 90\n; accord, New York, P. & N. R. Co. v. Peninsula Exchange, \n240 \nU.S. 34, 39\n. Especially is this so when the Congress has been stimulated by decisions of this Court to investigate the historical materials involved and has drawn from them a contrary conclusion. United States v. Hutcheson, \n312 \nU.S. 219, 235\n-237. As examination of the House and Senate Reports makes evident, that is what occurred \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 542]\n\u00a0\n here. E. g., S. Rep. No. 2309, 85th Cong., 2d Sess. 2-3 (1958); H. R. Rep. No. 695, 83d Cong., 1st Sess. 3-5 (1953).\n\n\n At the time when Bakelite and Williams were decided, the Court did not have the benefit of this congressional understanding. The Williams case, for example, arose under the Legislative Appropriation Act of June 30, 1932, c. 314, 107 (a) (5), 47 Stat. 382, 402, which reduced the salary of all judges \"except judges whose compensation may not, under the Constitution, be diminished during their continuance in office.\" Mr. Justice Sutherland, who wrote the Court's opinions in both Williams and O'Donoghue, was plainly disadvantaged by the absence of congressional intimation as to which judges of which courts were to be deemed exempted. See O'Donoghue v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 516, 529\n.\n\nIn the Bakelite case, to be sure, Mr. Justice Van Devanter said of an argument drawn from tenuous evidence of congressional understanding that it \"mistakenly assumes that whether a court is of one class or the other depends on the intention of Congress, whereas the true test lies in the power under which the court was created and in the jurisdiction conferred.\" \n279 \nU.S., at 459\n. Yet he would hardly have denied that explicit evidence of legislative intendment concerning the factors he thought controlling may be relevant and indeed highly persuasive. In any event, the Bakelite dictum did not embarrass the Court in deciding O'Donoghue, where it looked searchingly at \"congressional practice\" to determine what classification that body \"recognizes.\" \n289 \nU.S., at 548\n-550. We think the forthright statement of understanding embraced in the 1953 and 1958 declarations may be taken as similarly persuasive evidence for the problem now before us.\n\nTo give due weight to these congressional declarations is not of course to compromise the authority or responsibility \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 543]\n\u00a0\n of this Court as the ultimate expositor of the Constitution. The Bakelite and Williams decisions have long been considered of questionable soundness. See, e. g., Brown, The Rent in Our Judicial Armor, 10 G. W. L. Rev. 127 (1941); Hart and Wechsler, The Federal Courts and the Federal System (1953), 348-351; 1 Moore, Federal Practice (2d ed. 1961), 71 n. 21. They stand uneasily next to O'Donoghue, much of whose reasoning in sustaining the Article III status of the District of Columbia superior courts seems applicable to the Court of Claims and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals. In Pope v. United States, \n323 \nU.S. 1, 13\n-14, where the Solicitor General argued at length against the continued vitality of Bakelite and Williams, their authority was regarded as an open question.\n\nFurthermore, apart from this Court's considered practice not to apply stare decisis as rigidly in constitutional as in nonconstitutional cases, e. g., United States v. South Buffalo R. Co., \n333 \nU.S. 771, 774\n-775; see Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., \n285 \nU.S. 393, 405\n-408 and n. 1-3 (Brandeis, J., dissenting), there is the fact that Congress has acted on its understanding and has provided for assignment of judges who have made decisions that are now said to be impeachable. In these circumstances, the practical consideration underlying the doctrine of stare decisis - protection of generated expectations - actually militates in favor of reexamining the decisions. We are well-advised, therefore, to regard the questions decided in those cases as entirely open to reconsideration.\n\n\nV.\n\n\n\nThe Constitution nowhere makes reference to \"legislative courts.\" The power given Congress in Art. I, 8, cl. 9, \"To constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court,\" plainly relates to the \"inferior Courts\" provided for in Art. III, 1; it has never been relied on for establishment of any other tribunals. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 544]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe concept of a legislative court derives from the opinion of Chief Justice Marshall in American Insurance Co. v. Canter, 1 Pet. 511, dealing with courts established in a territory. A cargo of cotton salvaged from a wreck off the coast of Florida had been purchased by Canter at a judicial sale ordered by a court at Key West invested by the territorial legislature with jurisdiction over cases of salvage. The insurers, to whom the property in the cargo had been abandoned by the owners, brought a libel for restitution, claiming in part that the prior decree was void because not rendered in a court created by Congress, as required for the exercise of admiralty jurisdiction under Article III. Chief Justice Marshall for the Court swept this objection aside by noting that the Superior Courts of Florida, which had been created by Congress, were staffed with judges appointed for only four years, and concluded that Article III did not apply in the territories:\n\n \"These Courts, then, are not constitutional Courts,  in which the judicial power conferred by the Constitution  on the general government, can be deposited.  They are incapable of receiving it. They are legislative  Courts, created in virtue of the general right  of sovereignty which exists in the government, or in  virtue of that clause which enables Congress to make  all needful rules and regulations, respecting the territory  belonging to the United States.\" 1 Pet., at  546.\n\n\n By these arresting observations the Chief Justice certainly did not mean to imply that the case heard by the Key West court was not one of admiralty jurisdiction otherwise properly justiciable in a Federal District Court sitting in one of the States. Elsewhere in the opinion he distinctly referred to the provisions of Article III to show that it was such a case. 1 Pet., at 545. All the Chief Justice meant, and what the case has ever after been \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 545]\n\u00a0\n taken to establish, is that in the territories cases and controversies falling within the enumeration of Article III may be heard and decided in courts constituted without regard to the limitations of that article;\n13\n courts, that is, having judges of limited tenure and entertaining business beyond the range of conventional cases and controversies.\n\nThe reasons for this are not difficult to appreciate so long as the character of the early territories and some of the practical problems arising from their administration are kept in mind. The entire governmental responsibility in a territory where there was no state government to assume the burden of local regulation devolved upon the National Government. This meant that courts had to be established and staffed with sufficient judges to handle the general jurisdiction that elsewhere would have been exercised in large part by the courts of a State.\n14\n But when the territories began entering into statehood, as they soon did, the authority of the territorial courts over matters of state concern ceased; and in a time when the size of the federal judiciary was still relatively small, that left the National Government with a significant \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 546]\n\u00a0\n number of territorial judges on its hands and no place to put them. When Florida was admitted as a State, for example, Congress replaced three territorial courts of general jurisdiction comprising five judges with one Federal District Court and one judge.\n15\n\u00a0\n\nAt the same time as the absence of a federal structure in the territories produced problems not foreseen by the Framers of Article III, the realities of territorial government typically made it less urgent that judges there enjoy the independence from Congress and the President envisioned by that article. For the territories were not ruled immediately from Washington; in a day of poor roads and slow mails, it was unthinkable that they should be. Rather, Congress left municipal law to be developed largely by the territorial legislatures, within the framework of organic acts and subject to a retained power of veto.\n16\n The scope of self-government exercised under these delegations was nearly as broad as that enjoyed by the States, and the freedom of the territories to dispense with protections deemed inherent in a separation of governmental powers was as fully recognized.\n17\n\u00a0\n\nAgainst this historical background, it is hardly surprising that Chief Justice Marshall decided as he did. It would have been doctrinaire in the extreme to deny the right of Congress to invest judges of its creation with authority to dispose of the judicial business of the territories. It would have been at least as dogmatic, having recognized the right, to fasten on those judges a guarantee \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 547]\n\u00a0\n of tenure that Congress could not put to use and that the exigencies of the territories did not require. Marshall chose neither course; conscious as ever of his responsibility to see the Constitution work, he recognized a greater flexibility in Congress to deal with problems arising outside the normal context of a federal system.\n\nThe same confluence of practical considerations that dictated the result in Canter has governed the decision in later cases sanctioning the creation of other courts with judges of limited tenure. In United States v. Coe, \n155 \nU.S. 76, 85\n-86, for example, the Court sustained the authority of the Court of Private Land Claims to adjudicate claims under treaties to land in the territories, but left it expressly open whether such a course might be followed within the States. The Choctaw and Chickasaw Citizenship Court was similarly created to determine questions of tribal membership relevant to property claims within Indian territory under the exclusive control of the National Government. See Stephens v. Cherokee Nation, \n174 \nU.S. 445\n; Ex parte Joins, \n191 \nU.S. 93\n; Wallace v. Adams, \n204 \nU.S. 415\n. Upon like considerations, Article III has been viewed as inapplicable to courts created in unincorporated territories outside the mainland, Downes v. Bidwell, \n182 \nU.S. 244, 266\n-267; Balzac v. Porto Rico, \n258 \nU.S. 298, 312\n-313; cf. Dorr v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 138, 145\n, 149, and to the consular courts established by concessions from foreign countries, In re Ross, \n140 \nU.S. 453, 464\n-465, 480.\n18\n\u00a0\n\nThe touchstone of decision in all these cases has been the need to exercise the jurisdiction then and there and for a transitory period. Whether constitutional limitations on the exercise of judicial power have been held inapplicable has depended on the particular local setting, \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 548]\n\u00a0\n the practical necessities, and the possible alternatives. When the peculiar reasons justifying investiture of judges with limited tenure have not been present, the Canter holding has not been deemed controlling. O'Donoghue v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 516, 536\n-539.\n\nSince the conditions obtaining in one territory have been assumed to exist in each, this Court has in the past entertained a presumption that even those territorial judges who have been extended statutory assurances of life tenure and undiminished compensation have been so favored as a matter of legislative grace and not of constitutional compulsion. McAllister v. United States, \n141 \nU.S. 174, 186\n.\n19\n By a parity of reasoning, however, the presumption should be reversed when Congress creates courts the continuing exercise of whose jurisdiction is unembarrassed by such practical difficulties. See Mookini v. United States, \n303 \nU.S. 201, 205\n. As the Bakelite and Williams opinions recognize, the Court of Claims and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals were created to carry into effect powers enjoyed by the National Government over subject matter - roughly, payment of debts and collection of customs revenue - and not over localities. What those opinions fail to deal with is whether that distinction deprives American Insurance Co. v. Canter of controlling force.\n\nThe Bakelite opinion did not inquire whether there might be such a distinction. After sketching the history of the territorial and consular courts, it continued at once:\n\n  \"Legislative courts also may be created as special  tribunals to examine and determine various matters, \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 549]\n\u00a0\n  arising between the government and others, which  from their nature do not require judicial determination  and yet are susceptible of it.\" \n279 \nU.S., at 451\n.\n\n\n Since in the Court's view the jurisdiction conferred on both the Court of Claims and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals included \"nothing which inherently or necessarily requires judicial determination,\"\n20\n both could have been and were created as legislative courts.\n\nWe need not pause to assess the Court's characterization of the jurisdiction conferred on those courts, beyond indicating certain reservations about its accuracy.\n21\n Nor need we now explore the extent to which Congress may commit the execution of even \"inherently\" judicial business to tribunals other than Article III courts. We may and do assume, for present purposes, that none of the jurisdiction vested in our two courts is of that sort, so that all of it might be committed for final determination to non-Article III tribunals, be they denominated legislative courts or administrative agencies.\n\nBut because Congress may employ such tribunals assuredly does not mean that it must. This is the crucial \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 550]\n\u00a0\n non sequitur of the Bakelite and Williams opinions. Each assumed that because Congress might have assigned specified jurisdiction to an administrative agency, it must be deemed to have done so even though it assigned that jurisdiction to a tribunal having every appearance of a court and composed of judges enjoying statutory assurances of life tenure and undiminished compensation. In so doing, each appears to have misunderstood the thrust of the celebrated observation by Mr. Justice Curtis, that\n\n \". . . there are matters, involving public rights,  which may be presented in such form that the judicial  power is capable of acting on them, and which  are susceptible of judicial determination, but which  congress may or may not bring within the cognizance  of the courts of the United States, as it may deem  proper.\" Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land &  Improvement Co., 18 How. 272, 284.\n\n\n This passage, cited in both the Bakelite and Williams opinions,\n22\n plainly did not mean that the matters referred to could not be entrusted to Article III courts. Quite the contrary, the explicit predicate to Justice Curtis' argument was that such courts could exercise judicial power over such cases. For the very statute whose authorization of summary distress proceedings was sustained in the Murray case, also authorized the distrainee to bring suit to arrest the levy against the United States in a Federal District Court. And as to this, the author of the opinion stated, just before his more trenchant remark quoted above:\n\n\"The United States consents that this fact of indebtedness may be drawn in question by a suit against them. Though they might have withheld \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 551]\n\u00a0\n their consent, we think that, by granting it, nothing which may not be a subject of judicial cognizance is brought before the court.\"\n23\n\u00a0\n\n\n Thus Murray's Lessee, far from furnishing authority against the proposition that the Court of Claims is a constitutional court, actually supports it.\n\nTo deny that Congress may create tribunals under Article III for the sole purpose of adjudicating matters that it might have reserved for legislative or executive decision would be to deprive it of the very choice that Mr. Justice Curtis insisted it enjoys. Of course possession of the choice, assuming it is coextensive with the range of matters confided to the courts,\n24\n subjects those courts to the continuous possibility that their entire jurisdiction may be withdrawn. See Williams v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 553, 580\n-581. But the threat thus facing their independence is not in kind or effect different from that sustained by all inferior federal courts. The great constitutional compromise that resulted in agreement upon Art. III, 1, authorized but did not obligate Congress to create inferior federal courts. I Farrand, The Records of the Federal Convention (1911), 118, 124-125; The Federalist, No. 81 (Wright ed. 1961), at 509 (Hamilton). Once created, they passed almost a century without exercising any very significant jurisdiction. Warren, New Light on the History of the Federal Judiciary Act of 1789, 37 Harv. L. Rev. 49, 65-70 (1923); Frankfurter, Distribution of Judicial Power Between United States and State Courts, 13 Cornell L. Q. 499 (1928). Throughout this period and beyond it up to today, they remained constantly subject to jurisdictional curtailment. Turner v. Bank of North America, 4 Dall. 8, 10 note (Chase, J.); \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 552]\n\u00a0\n Cary v. Curtis, 3 How. 236, 245; Sheldon v. Sill, 8 How. 441, 449; Kline v. Burke Construction Co., \n260 \nU.S. 226, 233\n-234. Even if it should be conceded that the Court of Claims or the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals is any more likely to be supplanted, we do not think the factor of constitutional significance.\n25\n\u00a0\n\nWhat has been said should suffice to demonstrate that whether a tribunal is to be recognized as one created under Article III depends basically upon whether its establishing legislation complies with the limitations of that article; whether, in other words, its business is the federal business there specified and its judges and judgments are allowed the independence there expressly or impliedly made requisite. To ascertain whether the courts now under inquiry can meet those tests, we must turn to examine their history, the development of their functions, and their present characteristics.\n\n\nVI.\n\n\n\nA. Court of Claims. - The Court of Claims was created by the Act of February 24, 1855, c. 122, 10 Stat. 612, primarily to relieve the pressure on Congress caused by the volume of private bills. As an innovation the court was at first regarded as an experiment, and some of its creators were reluctant to give it all the attributes of a court by making its judgments final; instead it was authorized to hear claims and report its findings of fact and opinions to Congress, together with drafts of bills designed to carry its recommendations into effect. 7, 10 Stat. 613; see Cong. Globe, 33d Cong., 2d Sess. 70-72 (1854) (remarks of Senators Brodhead and Hunter). From the outset, however, a majority of the court's proponents insisted that its judges be given life tenure as a means of assuring independence \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 553]\n\u00a0\n of judgment, and their proposal won acceptance in the Act. 1, 10 Stat. 612; see Cong. Globe, 33d Cong., 2d Sess. 71, 108-109 (Senator Hunter); 72 (Senator Clayton); 106 (Senator Brodhead); 110 (Senator Pratt); 114, 902 (the votes). Indeed there are substantial indications in the debates that Congress thought it was establishing a court under Article III. Cong. Globe, 33d Cong., 2d Sess. 108-109 (Senator Hunter); 110-111 (Senator Pratt); 111 (Senator Clayton); 113 (Senators Stuart and Douglas).\n\nBy the end of 1861, however, it was apparent that the limited powers conferred on the court were insufficient to relieve Congress from the laborious necessity of examining the merits of private bills. In his State of the Union message that year, President Lincoln recommended that the legislative design to provide for the independent adjudication of claims against the United States be brought to fruition by making the judgments of the Court of Claims final. The pertinent text of his address is as follows, Cong. Globe, 37th Cong., 2d Sess., Appendix, p. 2:\n\n \"It is as much the duty of Government to render  prompt justice against itself, in favor of citizens,  as it is to administer the same between private  individuals. The investigation and adjudication of  claims, in their nature belong to the judicial department  . . . . It was intended by the organization of  the Court of Claims mainly to remove this branch of  business from the Halls of Congress; but while the  court has proved to be an effective and valuable  means of investigation, it in great degree fails to  effect the object of its creation, for want of power  to make its judgments final.\"\n\n\n By the Act of March 3, 1863, c. 92, 5, 12 Stat. 765, 766, Congress adopted the President's recommendation and made the court's judgments final, with appeal to the \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 554]\n\u00a0\n Supreme Court provided in certain cases. The significance of this nearly contemporaneous enactment for the light it sheds on the aims of the 1855 Congress is apparent.\n\nThere was one further impediment. Section 14 of the 1863 Act, 12 Stat. 768, provided that \"no money shall be paid out of the treasury for any claim passed upon by the court of claims till after an appropriation therefor shall be estimated for by the Secretary of the Treasury.\" In Gordon v. United States, 2 Wall. 561, this Court refused to review a judgment of the Court of Claims because it construed that section as giving the Secretary a revisory authority over the court inconsistent with its exercise of judicial power. Congress promptly repealed the offensive section, Act of March 17, 1866, c. 19, 1, 14 Stat. 9, once again exhibiting its purpose to liberate the Court of Claims from itself and the Executive. Thereafter, the Supreme Court promulgated rules governing appeals from the court, 3 Wall. vii-viii, and took jurisdiction under them for the first time in De Groot v. United States, 5 Wall. 419.\n\nThe early appeals entertained by the Court furnish striking evidence of its understanding that the Court of Claims had been vested with judicial power. In De Groot the court had been given jurisdiction by special bill only after the passage of two private bills had failed to produce agreement by administrative officials upon adequate recompense. This Court was thus presented with a vivid illustration of the ways in which the same matter might be submitted for resolution to a legislative committee, to an executive officer, or to a court, Murray's Lessee, supra, and nevertheless accepted appellate jurisdiction over what was, necessarily, an exercise of the judicial power which alone it may review. Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 174-175.\n\nAfter the repeal of 14, the Court was quick to protect the Court of Claims' judgments from executive revision. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 555]\n\u00a0\n In United States v. O'Grady, 22 Wall. 641, a judgment had been diminished by the Secretary of the Treasury in an amount equal to a tax assertedly due, although the United States had not pleaded a set-off as it was entitled by the 1863 Act to do.\n26\n The Court of Claims and this Court on appeal held the deduction unwarranted in law, with the following pertinent closing observation:\n\n \"Should it be suggested that the judgment in question was rendered in the Court of Claims, the answer to the suggestion is that the judgment of the Court of Claims, from which no appeal is taken, is just as conclusive under existing laws as the judgment of the Supreme Court, until it is set aside on a motion for a new trial.\"\n27\n\u00a0\n\n\n Like views abound in the early reports. In United States v. Union Pacific R. Co., \n98 \nU.S. 569, 603\n, for example, referring to Article III, the Court said:\n\n \"Congress has, under this authority, created the district courts, the circuit courts, and the Court of Claims, and vested each of them with a defined portion of the judicial power found in the Constitution.\"\n\n\n Such remained the view of the Court as late as Miles v. Graham, \n268 \nU.S. 501\n, decided in 1925. There it was held, on the authority of Evans v. Gore, \n253 \nU.S. 245\n, that the salary of a Court of Claims judge appointed even after enactment of the taxing statute in question was not subject to such diminution. Although the case was afterwards overruled on this point, O'Malley v. Woodrough, \n307 \nU.S. 277, 283\n, what is of continuing interest is the \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 556]\n\u00a0\n Court's reliance in Miles upon Evans v. Gore, where Mr. Justice Van Devanter for the Court devoted six full pages to recitation of the importance of the guarantees of tenure and salary contained in Article III.\n28\n How it was possible to say in Bakelite, \n279 \nU.S., at 455\n, that the Court in Miles, decided only five years after Evans and with copious quotation from it, was unaware of the crucial question whether Article III extended its protection to a judge of the Court of Claims, is very difficult to understand.\n\nIn actuality, the Court's pre-Bakelite view of the Court of Claims is supported by the evidence of increasing confidence placed in that tribunal by Congress. The Tucker Act, 1, 24 Stat. 505 (1887), now 28 U.S.C. 1491, greatly expanded the jurisdiction of the court by authorizing it to adjudicate\n\n\"All claims founded upon the Constitution of the United States or any law of Congress, except for pensions, or upon any regulation of an Executive Department, or upon any contract, express or implied, with the Government of the United States, or for damages, liquidated or unliquidated, in cases not sounding in tort, in respect of which claims the party would be entitled to redress against the United States either in a court of law, equity, or admiralty if the United States were suable . . . .\"\n\n\n All of the cases within this grant of jurisdiction arise either immediately or potentially under federal law within the meaning of Art. III, 2. Osborn v. Bank of the United States, 9 Wheat. 738, 818-819, 823-825; see Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States, \n318 \nU.S. 363\n; Federal Crop Insurance Corp. v. Merrill, \n332 \nU.S. 380\n; Mishkin, The Federal \"Question\" in the District Courts, 53 Col. L. Rev. 157, 184-196. The cases heard by the Court have \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 557]\n\u00a0\n been as intricate and far-ranging as any coming within the federal-question jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. 1331, of the District Courts. E. g., Causby v. United States, 104 Ct. Cl. 342, 60 F. Supp. 751, remanded for further findings, \n328 \nU.S. 256\n (eminent domain); Lovett v. United States, 104 Ct. Cl. 557, 66 F. Supp. 142, aff'd, \n328 \nU.S. 303\n (bill of attainder); Shapiro v. United States, 107 Ct. Cl. 650, 69 F. Supp. 205 (military due process). In none of these cases, nor in others, could it well be suggested that the Court of Claims had adjudged the issues, no matter how important to the Government, otherwise than dispassionately.\n\nIndeed there is reason to believe that the Court of Claims has been constituted as it is precisely to the end that there may be a tribunal specially qualified to hold the Government to strict legal accounting. From the beginning it has been given jurisdiction only to award damages, not specific relief. United States v. Alire, 6 Wall. 573; United States v. Jones, \n131 \nU.S. 1\n; see Schwartz and Jacoby, Government Litigation (tentative ed. 1960), 123-126. No question can be raised of Congress' freedom, consistently with Article III, to impose such a limitation upon the remedial powers of a federal court. Lauf v. E. G. Shinner & Co., \n303 \nU.S. 323, 330\n (Norris-LaGuardia Act). But far from serving as a restriction, this limitation has allowed the Court of Claims a greater freedom than is enjoyed by other federal courts to inquire into the legality of governmental action. See Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Commerce Corp., \n337 \nU.S. 682, 703\n-704; Malone v. Bowdoin, \n369 \nU.S. 643\n; Brenner, Judicial Review by Money Judgment in the Court of Claims, 21 Fed. B. J. 179 (1961).\n\n\"If there are such things as political axioms,\" said Alexander Hamilton, \"the propriety of the judicial power of a government being coextensive with its legislative, may be ranked among the number.\" The Federalist, \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 558]\n\u00a0\n No. 80 (Wright ed. 1961), at 500. His sentiments were not ignored by the Framers of Article III. The Randolph plan, which formed the basis of that article, called for establishment of a national judiciary coextensive in authority with the executive and legislative branches. IV Farrand, The Records of the Federal Convention (rev. ed. 1937), 47-48. For, as Hamilton observed, a chief defect of the Confederation had been \". . . the want of a judiciary power. Laws are a dead letter without courts to expound and define their true meaning and operation.\" The Federalist, No. 22 (Wright ed. 1961), at 197. But because of the barrier of sovereign immunity, the laws controlling governmental rights and obligations could not for years obtain a fully definitive exposition. The creation of the Court of Claims can be viewed as a fulfillment of the design of Article III.\n\n\nB. \nThe Court of Customs and Patent Appeals. - The Court of Customs Appeals, as it was first known, was established by 29 of the Customs Administrative Act of 1890, c. 407, 26 Stat. 131, as added by 28 of the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act of August 5, 1909, c. 6, 36 Stat. 11, 105, to review by appeal final decisions of the Board of General Appraisers (now Customs Court) respecting the classification and rate of duty applicable to imported merchandise. The Act was silent about the tenure of the judges, as had been the Judiciary Act of 1789, c. 20, 3, 4, 1 Stat. 73-75. The salary, first set at $10,000, was afterwards lowered to the $7,000 then being paid to circuit judges, Act of February 25, 1910, c. 62, 1, 36 Stat. 202, 214, but before the first nominations had been received or confirmed, see 45 Cong. Rec. 2959, 4003 (1910); and, although it has since been increased, it has never been diminished.\n29\n After the Bakelite case had \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 559]\n\u00a0\n been decided, Congress expressly conferred tenure during good behavior upon the court's judges, in the Tariff Act of 1930, 646, 46 Stat. 590, 762. Representative Chindblom, in supporting the measure, stated that \"when this court was established it was believed to be a constitutional court [so] that it was not necessary to fix the term.\" 71 Cong. Rec. 2043 (1929).\n\nThe debates in the Senate at the time of the court's creation bear out this observation. See 44 Cong. Rec. 4185-4225 (1909). For under the Customs Administrative Act of 1890, c. 407, 15, 26 Stat. 131, 138, review of decisions of the Board of General Appraisers had been vested in the Circuit Courts, undoubted Article III courts; it was this jurisdiction that was proposed to be transferred to the new court.\n30\n The debates accordingly concerned themselves with whether there was a need for a specialized court in the federal judicial system to deal with customs matters.\n\nAs was said some 35 years ago, \"an important phase of the history of the federal judiciary deals with the movement for the establishment of tribunals whose business was to be limited to litigation arising from a restricted \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 560]\n\u00a0\n field of legislative control.\" Frankfurter and Landis, The Business of the Supreme Court (1927), 147. In certain areas of federal judicial business there has been a felt need to obtain, first, the special competence in complex, technical and important matters that comes from narrowly focused inquiry; second, the speedy resolution of controversies available on a docket unencumbered by other matters; and, third, the certainty and definition that come from nationwide uniformity of decision. See generally id., at 146-186. Needs such as these provoked formation of the Commerce Court and the Emergency Court of Appeals. They also prompted establishment of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and its investiture with jurisdiction over customs, tariff, and patent and trademark litigation. 28 U.S.C. 1541-1543.\n\nThe parallelism with the Commerce Court is especially striking. That court was created to exercise the jurisdiction previously held by the Circuit Courts to review orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Mann-Elkins Act of June 18, 1910, c. 309, 36 Stat. 539. It was needed, so its sponsors believed, to afford uniform, expert, and expeditious judicial review. See President Taft's message to Congress, 45 Cong. Rec. 379 (1910), in the course of which he stated:\n\n \"Reasons precisely analogous to those which induced the Congress to create the court of customs appeals by the provisions in the tariff act of August 5, 1909, may be urged in support of the creation of the commerce court.\"\n\n\n When disfavor with the court caused its abolition three years later, Act of October 22, 1913, c. 32, 38 Stat. 208, 219, it was decided in Congress after extensive debate that the judges then serving on it were protected in tenure by Article III, and they were thereafter assigned to sit on \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 561]\n\u00a0\n other constitutional courts. See, e. g., 48 Cong. Rec. 7994 (1912) (remarks of Senator Sutherland); and see Donegan v. Dyson, \n269 \nU.S. 49\n.\n\nThe Emergency Court of Appeals was similarly created, by the Act of January 30, 1942, c. 26, 56 Stat. 23, to exercise exclusive equity jurisdiction to determine the validity of regulations, price schedules, and orders issued by the wartime Office of Price Administration.\n31\n Its Article III status was recognized in Lockerty v. Phillips, \n319 \nU.S. 182, 187\n-188.\n\nOf course the judges of those courts were appointed as judges of inferior federal courts generally, or drawn from among those previously appointed as such. See p. 538 and note 11, supra. But by 1942 at least, when the latter court was created, Congress was well aware of the doubt created by the Bakelite and Williams decisions whether Article III judges could sit on non-Article III tribunals. Its action in authorizing judges of the District Courts and Courts of Appeals to sit on the Emergency Court thus reflects its understanding that that court was being created under Article III.\n\nSuch an understanding parallels that of previous Congresses since the adoption of the Constitution. Congress has never been compelled to vest the entire jurisdiction provided for in Article III upon inferior courts of its creation; until 1875 it conferred very little of it indeed. See pp. 551-552, supra. The Court of Customs and Patent Appeals therefore fits harmoniously into the federal judicial system authorized by Article III. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 562]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nVII.\n\n\n\nArticle III, 2 provides in part:\n\n \"The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority; . . - to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party . . . .\"\n\n\n The cases heard by the Court of Claims and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals all arise under federal law, as we have seen; they are also cases in which the United States is a party. But in Williams v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 553, 572\n-578, far from making of that circumstance a further proof that the Court of Claims exercises the judicial power contemplated by Article III, this Court held that it did not because that article, so it was said, does not make justiciable controversies to which the United States is a party defendant.\n\nThe Court's opinion dwelt in part upon the omission of the word \"all\" before \"Controversies\" in the clause referred to. To derive controlling significance from this semantic circumstance seems hardly to be faithful to John Marshall's admonition that \"it is a constitution we are expounding.\" McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 407. But it would be needlessly literal to suppose that the Court rested its holding on this point. Rather it deemed controlling the rule, \"well settled and understood\" at the time of the Constitutional Convention, that \"the sovereign power is immune from suit.\" \n289 \nU.S., at 573\n. Accordingly it becomes necessary to reconsider whether that principle has the effect claimed of rendering suits against the United States nonjusticiable in a court created under Article III. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 563]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAt least one touchstone of justiciability to which this Court has frequently had reference is whether the action sought to be maintained is of a sort \"recognized at the time of the Constitution to be traditionally within the power of courts in the English and American judicial systems.\" United Steelworkers v. United States, \n361 \nU.S. 39, 44\n, 60 (FRANKFURTER, J., concurring). There can be little doubt that that test is met here. Suits against the English sovereign by petition of liberate, monstrans de droit, and other forms of action designed to gain redress against unlawful action of the Crown had been developed over several centuries and were well-established before the Revolution. See 9 Holdsworth, History of English Law, 7-45 (1926). Similar provisions for judicial remedies against themselves were made by the American States immediately after the Revolution. E. g., 9 Laws of Va. 536, 540 (1778) (Hening 1821); see Higginbotham's Executrix v. Commonwealth, 25 Gratt. 627, 637-638 (Va. 1874). This history was known by Congress when it established the Court of Claims, see Cong. Globe, 33d Cong., 2d Sess. 73 (1854) (remarks of Senator Pettit), and undoubtedly was familiar to the Framers of the Constitution, most of them lawyers.\n\nHamilton's views, quoted in the Williams case, \n289 \nU.S., at 576\n, are not to the contrary. To be sure, Hamilton argued that \"the contracts between a nation and individuals are only binding on the conscience of the sovereign, and have no pretensions to a compulsive force. They confer no right of action, independent of the sovereign will.\" The Federalist, No. 81 (Wright ed. 1961), at 511. But that is because there was no surrender of sovereign immunity in the plan of the convention;\n32\n so \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 564]\n\u00a0\n that, for suits against the United States, it remained \"inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individual without its consent.\" Ibid. (Emphasis in original.) In this sense, and only in this sense, is Article III's extension of judicial competence over controversies to which the United States is a party ineffective to confer jurisdiction over suits to which it is a defendant. For \"behind the words of the constitutional provisions are postulates which limit and control.\" Monaco v. Mississippi, \n292 \nU.S. 313, 322\n. But once the consent is given, the postulate is satisfied, and there remains no barrier to justiciability. Cf. Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 383-385.\n\nSo the Court had given itself to understand before Williams was decided. In United States v. Louisiana, \n123 \nU.S. 32, 35\n, it held maintainable under Article III a suit brought in the Court of Claims by a State against the United States with Congress' consent. And in Minnesota v. Hitchcock, \n185 \nU.S. 373, 384\n, which reaffirmed that ruling, the Court said:\n\n\"This is a controversy to which the United States may be regarded as a party. It is one, therefore, to which the judicial power of the United States extends. It is, of course, under that clause a matter of indifference whether the United States is a party plaintiff or defendant.\"\n\n\n Further in the same opinion, \n185 \nU.S., at 386\n, the Court significantly remarked:\n\n \"While the United States as a government may not be sued without its consent, yet with its consent it may be sued, and the judicial power of the United States extends to such a controversy. Indeed, the whole jurisdiction of the Court of Claims rests upon this proposition.\" \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 565]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n To deny that proposition now would be to call into question a large measure of the jurisdiction exercised by the United States District Courts. Under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 410 (a), 60 Stat. 842, 843-844 (1946), as amended, 28 U.S.C. 1346 (b), those courts have been empowered to determine the tort liability of the United States in suits brought by individual plaintiffs. In so doing, they exercise functions akin to those of the Court of Claims, as is evidenced by the statutory authorization of appeals to that court from their judgments, with the consent of the appellee. 412 (a) (2), 60 Stat. 844-845 (1946), as amended, 28 U.S.C. 1504.\n\nIn truth the District Courts have long been vested with substantial portions of the identical jurisdiction exercised by the Court of Claims. The Tucker Act, 2, 24 Stat. 505 (1887), as amended, 28 U.S.C. 1346 (a) (2), gives them concurrent jurisdiction over the suits it authorizes, when the amount in controversy is less than $10,000. Under that Act a District Court sits \"as a court of claims,\" United States v. Sherwood, \n312 \nU.S. 584, 591\n, and affords the same rights and privileges to suitors against the United States. Bates Manufacturing Co. v. United States, \n303 \nU.S. 567, 571\n. See generally Schwartz and Jacoby, Government Litigation (tentative ed. 1960), 109-111.\n\nThere have been and are further statutory indications that Congress regards the two courts interchangeably. In 1921, Mr. Justice Brandeis compiled a list of 17 statutes passed during World War I, permitting suits against the United States for the value of property seized for use in the war effort, and authorizing them to be instituted in either the Court of Claims or one of the District Courts. United States v. Pfitsch, \n256 \nU.S. 547, 553\n n. 1. Today, 28 U.S.C. 1500 gives litigants an election to sue the United States as principal in the Court of Claims or to \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 566]\n\u00a0\n pursue their claims against its agents in any other court including the District Courts. See National Cored Forgings Co. v. United States, 132 Ct. Cl. 11, 132 F. Supp. 454. In addition, by the Act of September 13, 1960, 1, 2 (a), 74 Stat. 912, Congress added 1406 (c) and 1506 to Title 28 of the United States Code, providing for transfer between the Court of Claims and any District Court when a suit within one court's exclusive jurisdiction is brought mistakenly in another.\n\nThese evidences of congressional understanding that suits against the United States are justiciable in courts created under Article III may not be lightly disregarded. Nevertheless it is probably true that Congress devotes a more lively attention to the work performed by the Court of Claims, and that it has been more prone to modify the jurisdiction assigned to that court. It remains to consider whether that circumstance suffices to render non-judicial the decision of claims against the United States in the Court of Claims.\n\nFirst. Throughout its history the Court of Claims has frequently been given jurisdiction by special act to award recovery for breach of what would have been, on the part of an individual, at most a moral obligation. E. g., 45 Stat. 602 (1928), as amended, 25 U.S.C. 651-657; Indians of California v. United States, 98 Ct. Cl. 583, 599. Congress has waived the benefit of res judicata, Cherokee Nation v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 476, 486\n, and of defenses based on the passage of time, United States v. Alcea Band of Tillamooks, \n329 \nU.S. 40, 45\n-46; United States v. Central Eureka Mining Co., \n357 \nU.S. 155\n.\n\nIn doing so, as this Court has uniformly held, Congress has enlisted the aid of judicial power whose exercise is amenable to appellate review here. United States v. Alcea Band of Tillamooks, supra; see Colgate v. United States, \n280 \nU.S. 43, 47\n-48. Indeed the Court has held \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 567]\n\u00a0\n that Congress may for reasons adequate to itself confer bounties upon persons and, by consenting to suit, convert their moral claim into a legal one enforceable by litigation in an undoubted constitutional court. United States v. Realty Co., \n163 \nU.S. 427\n.\n\nThe issue was settled beyond peradventure in Pope v. United States, \n323 \nU.S. 1\n. There the Court held that for Congress to direct the Court of Claims to entertain a claim theretofore barred for any legal reason from recovery - as, for instance, by the statute of limitations, or because the contract had been drafted to exclude such claims - was to invoke the use of judicial power, notwithstanding that the task might involve no more than computation of the sum due. Consent judgments, the Court recalled, are nonetheless judicial judgments. See \n323 \nU.S., at 12\n, and cases cited. After this decision it cannot be doubted that when Congress transmutes a moral obligation into a legal one by specially consenting to suit, it authorizes the tribunal that hears the case to perform a judicial function.\n\nSecond. Congress has on occasion withdrawn jurisdiction from the Court of Claims to proceed with the disposition of cases pending therein, and has been upheld in so doing by this Court. E. g., District of Columbia v. Eslin, \n183 \nU.S. 62\n. But that is not incompatible with the possession of Article III judicial power by the tribunal affected. Congress has consistently with that article withdrawn the jurisdiction of this Court to proceed with a case then sub judice, Ex parte McCardle, 7 Wall. 506; its power can be no less when dealing with an inferior federal court, In re Hall, \n167 \nU.S. 38, 42\n. For as Hamilton assured those of his contemporaries who were concerned about the reach of power that might be vested in a federal judiciary, \"it ought to be recollected that the national legislature will have ample authority to make \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 568]\n\u00a0\n such exceptions, and to prescribe such regulations as will be calculated to obviate or remove [any] . . . inconveniences.\" The Federalist, No. 80 (Wright ed. 1961), at 505.\n\nThe authority is not, of course, unlimited. In 1870. Congress purported to withdraw jurisdiction from the Court of Claims and from this Court on appeal over cases seeking indemnification for property captured during the Civil War, so far as eligibility therefor might be predicated upon an amnesty awarded by the President, as both courts had previously held that it might. Despite Ex parte McCardle, supra, the Court refused to apply the statute to a case in which the claimant had already been adjudged entitled to recover by the Court of Claims, calling it an unconstitutional attempt to invade the judicial province by prescribing a rule of decision in a pending case. United States v. Klein, 13 Wall. 128. Surely no such concern would have been manifested if it had not been thought that the Court of Claims was invested with judicial power.\n33\n\u00a0\n\n\nVIII.\n\n\n\nA more substantial question relating to the justiciability of money claims against the United States arises from the impotence of a court to enforce its judgments. It was Chief Justice Taney's opinion, in Gordon v. United \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 569]\n\u00a0\n States, afterwards published at \n117 \nU.S. 697, 702\n, that the dependence of the Court of Claims upon an appropriation by Congress to carry its awards into effect negatived the possession of judicial power:\n\n \"The award of execution is a part, and an essential part of every judgment passed by a court exercising judicial power.\"\n\n\n But Taney's opinion was not the opinion of the Court. It was a memorandum of his views prepared before his death and circulated among, but not adopted by, his brethren. The opinion of the Court, correctly reported for the first time in United States v. Jones, \n119 \nU.S. 477, 478\n, makes clear that its refusal to entertain the Gordon appeal rested solely on the revisory authority vested in the Secretary of the Treasury before the repeal of 14. See also United States v. Alire, 6 Wall. 573, 576; United States v. O'Grady, 22 Wall. 641, 647; Langford v. United States, \n101 \nU.S. 341, 344\n-345 - in each of which the limitation of the Gordon decision to the difficulties caused by 14 clearly appears.\n\nNevertheless the problem remains and should be considered. Its scope has, however, been reduced by the Act of July 27, 1956, 1302, 70 Stat. 678, 694, 31 U.S.C. 724a, a general appropriation act which eliminates the need for subsequent separate appropriations to pay judgments below $100,000. A judgment creditor of this order simply files in the General Accounting Office a certificate of the judgment signed by the clerk and the chief judge of the Court of Claims, and is paid. 28 U.S.C. 2517 (a). For judgments of this dimension, therefore, there need be no concern about the issuance of execution.\n\nFor claims in excess of $100,000, 28 U.S.C. 2518 directs the Secretary of the Treasury to certify them to Congress once review in this Court has been foregone or sought and found unavailing. This, then, is the domain \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 570]\n\u00a0\n of our problem, for Art. I, 9, cl. 7, vests exclusive responsibility for appropriations in Congress,\n34\n and the Court early held that no execution may issue directed to the Secretary of the Treasury until such an appropriation has been made. Reeside v. Walker, 11 How. 272, 291.\n\nThe problem was recognized in the Congress that created the Court of Claims, where it was pointed out that if ability to enforce judgments were made a criterion of judicial power, no tribunal created under Article III would be able to assume jurisdiction of money claims against the United States. Cong. Globe, 33d Cong., 2d Sess. 113 (1854) (remarks of Senator Stuart). The subsequent vesting of such jurisdiction in the District Courts, pp. 565-566, supra, of course bears witness that at least the Congress has not thought such a criterion imperative.\n\nEver since Congress first accorded finality to judgments of the Court of Claims, it has sought to avoid interfering with their collection. Section 7 of the Act of March 3, 1863, 12 Stat. 765, 766, provided for the payment of final judgments out of general appropriations. In 1877, Congress shifted for a time to appropriating lump sums for judgments certified to it by the Secretary of the Treasury, not in order to question the judgments but to avoid the possibility that a large judgment might exhaust the prior appropriation. Act of March 3, 1877, c. 105, 19 Stat. 344, 347; see 6 Cong. Rec. 585-588 (1877). A study concluded in 1933 found only 15 instances in 70 years when Congress had refused to pay a judgment. Note, 46 Harv. L. Rev. 677, 685-686 n. 63. This historical record, surely more favorable to prevailing parties than that obtaining in private litigation, may well make us doubt whether the capacity to enforce a judgment is always indispensable for the exercise of judicial power. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 571]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Court did not think so in La Abra Silver Mining Co. v. United States, \n175 \nU.S. 423, 461\n-462, where the issue was the justiciability under Article III of a declaratory judgment action brought by the United States in the Court of Claims to determine its liability for payment of an award procured by the defendant from an international arbitral commission assertedly through fraud. See also Nashville, C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Wallace, \n288 \nU.S. 249, 263\n. Nor has it thought so when faced with the exactly analogous problem presented by suits for money between States in the original jurisdiction. That jurisdiction has been upheld, for example, in South Dakota v. North Carolina, \n192 \nU.S. 286, 318\n-321, notwithstanding the Court's recognition of judicial impotence to compel a levy of taxes or otherwise by process to enforce its award. See especially the opinions of Chief Justice Fuller and Chief Justice White at the beginning and inconclusive end of the extended litigation between Virginia and West Virginia, \n206 \nU.S. 290, 319\n (1907) and \n246 \nU.S. 565\n (1918), in which the Court asserted jurisdiction to award damages for breach of contract despite persistent and never-surmounted challenges to its power to enforce a decree.\n35\n If this Court may rely on the good faith of state governments or other public bodies to respond to its judgments, there seems to be no sound reason why the Court of Claims may not rely on the good faith of the United States. We conclude that the presence of the United States as a party defendant to suits maintained in the Court of Claims and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals does not debar those courts from exercising the judicial power provided for in Article III. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 572]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIX.\n\n\n\nAll of the business that comes before the two courts is susceptible of disposition in a judicial manner. What remains to be determined is the extent to which it is in fact disposed of in that manner.\n\nA preliminary consideration that need not detain us long is the absence of provision for jury trial of counter-claims by the Government in actions before the Court of Claims. Despite dictum to the contrary in United States v. Sherwood, \n312 \nU.S. 584, 587\n, the legitimacy of that nonjury mode of trial does not depend upon the supposed \"legislative\" character of the court. It derives instead, as indeed was also noted in Sherwood, ibid., from the fact that suits against the Government, requiring as they do a legislative waiver of immunity, are not \"suits at common law\" within the meaning of the Seventh Amendment. McElrath v. United States, \n102 \nU.S. 426, 439\n-440. The Congress was not, therefore, required to provide jury trials for plaintiffs suing in the Court of Claims; the reasonableness of its later decision to obviate the need for multiple litigation precludes a finding that its imposition of amenability to nonjury set-offs was an unconstitutional condition. Cf. Minneapolis & St. L. R. Co. v. Bombolis, \n241 \nU.S. 211\n; see 74 Harv. L. Rev. 414, 415 (1960).\n36\n\u00a0\n\nThe principal question raised by the parties under this head of the argument is whether the matters referred by Congress to the Court of Claims and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals are submitted to them in a form consonant with the limitation of judicial power to \"cases or \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 573]\n\u00a0\n controversies\" imposed by Article III. We may consider first the bulk of jurisdiction exercised by the two courts, reserving for separate treatment in the next section of this opinion two areas which may reasonably be regarded as presenting special difficulty.\n\n\"Whether a proceeding which results in a grant is a judicial one,\" said Mr. Justice Brandeis for a unanimous Court, \"does not depend upon the nature of the thing granted, but upon the nature of the proceeding which Congress has provided for securing the grant. The United States may create rights in individuals against itself and provide only an administrative remedy. It may provide a legal remedy, but make resort to the courts available only after all administrative remedies have been exhausted. It may give to the individual the option of either an administrative or a legal remedy. Or it may provide only a legal remedy. [See pp. 549-552, supra.] Whenever the law provides a remedy enforceable in the courts according to the regular course of legal procedure, and that remedy is pursued, there arises a case within the meaning of the Constitution, whether the subject of the litigation be property or status.\" Tutun v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 568, 576\n-577. (Citations omitted.)\n\n\n It is unquestioned that the Tucker Act cases assigned to the Court of Claims, 28 U.S.C. 1491, advance to judgment \"according to the regular course of legal procedure.\" Under this grant of jurisdiction the court hears tax cases, cases calling into question the statutory authority for a regulation, controversies over the existence or extent of a contractual obligation, and the like. See generally Schwartz and Jacoby, Government Litigation (tentative ed. 1960), 131-223. Such cases, which account for as much as 95% of the court's work,\n37\n form the staple \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 574]\n\u00a0\n judicial fare of the regular federal courts. There can be no doubt that, to the \"expert feel of lawyers,\" United Steelworkers v. United States, \n361 \nU.S. 39, 44\n, 60 (FRANKFURTER, J., concurring), they constitute cases or controversies.\n\nThe balance of the court's jurisdiction to render final judgments may likewise be assimilated to the traditional business of courts generally. Thus the court has been empowered to render accountings,\n38\n to decide if debts\n39\n or penalties\n40\n are due the United States, and to determine the liability of the United States for patent or copyright infringement\n41\n and for other specially designated torts.\n42\n In addition, it has been given jurisdiction to review, on issues of law including the existence of substantial evidence, decisions of the Indian Claims Commission.\n43\n Each of these cases, like those under the Tucker Act, is contested, is concrete, and admits of a decree of a sufficiently conclusive character. See Aetna Life Insurance Co. v. Haworth, \n300 \nU.S. 227, 240\n-241.\n\nThe same may undoubtedly be said of the customs jurisdiction vested in the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals by 28 U.S.C. 1541.\n44\n Contests over classification \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 575]\n\u00a0\n and valuation of imported merchandise have long been maintainable in inferior federal courts. Under R. S. 3011 (1878), suits after protest against the collector were authorized in the circuit courts. E. g., Greely's Administrator v. Burgess, 18 How. 413; Iasigi v. The Collector, 1 Wall. 375. When the Customs Administrative Act of 1890 was passed, c. 407, 26 Stat. 131, repealing that section and creating a Board of General Appraisers to review determinations of the collector, a further right of review was provided in the Circuit Courts. See De Lima v. Bidwell, \n182 \nU.S. 1, 175\n. This Court took unquestioned appellate jurisdiction from those courts on numerous occasions. E. g., United States v. Ballin, \n144 \nU.S. 1\n; Hoeninghaus v. United States, \n172 \nU.S. 622\n. It has continued to accept review by certiorari from the Court of Customs Appeals since the jurisdiction of the Circuit Courts was transferred to it in 1909. E. g., Five Per Cent. Discount Cases, \n243 \nU.S. 97\n; Barr v. United States, \n324 \nU.S. 83\n. That the customs litigation authorized by 1541 conforms to conventional notions of case or controversy seems no longer open to doubt.\n\nDoubt has been expressed, however, about the jurisdiction conferred by 28 U.S.C. 1542 and 60 Stat. 435 (1946), as amended, 15 U.S.C. 1071, to review application and interference proceedings in the Patent Office relative to patents and trademarks. Parties to those proceedings are given an election to bring a civil action to contest the Patent Office decision in a District Court under 35 U.S.C. 145, 146, or to seek review in the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals under 35 U.S.C. 141. If the latter choice is made, the Court confines its review to the evidence adduced before the Patent \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 576]\n\u00a0\n Office and to the question of law preserved by the parties; its decision \"shall be entered of record in the Patent Office and govern the further proceedings in the case.\" 35 U.S.C. 144. The codification \"omitted as superfluous\" the last sentence in the existing statute: \"But no opinion or decision of the court in any such case shall preclude any person interested from the right to contest the validity of such patent in any court wherein the same may be called in question.\" Act of July 8, 1870, c. 230, 50, 16 Stat. 198, 205; see Reviser's Note to 35 U.S.C. 144.\n\nThe latter provision was evidently instrumental in prompting a decision of this Court, at a time when review of Patent Office determinations was vested in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, that the ruling called for by the statute was not of a judicial character. Postum Cereal Co. v. California Fig Nut Co., \n272 \nU.S. 693, 699\n. That is the most that the Postum holding can be taken to stand for, as United States v. Duell, \n172 \nU.S. 576, 588\n-589, had upheld the judicial nature of the review in all other respects.\n45\n And the continuing vitality of the decision even to this extent has been seriously weakened if not extinguished by the subsequent holding in Hoover Co. v. Coe, \n325 \nU.S. 79, 88\n, sustaining the justiciability of the alternative remedy by civil action even though the Court deemed \"the effect of adjudication in equity the same as that of decision on appeal.\" See Kurland and Wolfson, Supreme Court Review of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals: Patent Office and Tariff Commission Cases, 18 G. W. L. Rev. 192, 194-198 (1950). \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 577]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAt the time when Postum was decided, the proceeding in equity against the Patent Office was cumulative rather than alternative with the review by appeal, and it seems likely that it was this feature of the statute which caused the Court to characterize the judgment of the Court of Appeals as \"a mere administrative decision.\" \n272 \nU.S., at 698\n. Thereafter Congress made the remedies alternative, Act of March 2, 1927, c. 273, 11, 44 Stat. 1335, 1336, and it was this amended jurisdiction that it later transferred to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, renaming the court in the process. Act of March 2, 1929, c. 488, 45 Stat. 1475.\n\nIt may still be true that Congress has given to the equity proceeding a greater preclusive effect than that accorded to decisions of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.\n46\n Even so, that circumstance alone is insufficient to make those decisions nonjudicial. Tutun v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 568\n, decided by the same Court as Postum and not there questioned, is controlling authority. For the Court there held that a naturalization proceeding in a Federal District Court was a \"case\" within the meaning of Article III, even though the Government was empowered by statute\n47\n to bring a later bill in equity for cancellation of the certificate.\n\nMr. Justice Brandeis, the author of the Tutun opinion, had also prepared the Court's opinion in United States v. Ness, \n245 \nU.S. 319\n, which upheld the Government's right to seek denaturalization even upon grounds known to and \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 578]\n\u00a0\n asserted unsuccessfully by it in the naturalization court.\n48\n Proceedings in that court, the opinion explained, were relatively summary, with no right of appeal, whereas the denaturalization suit was plenary enough to permit full presentation of all objections and was accompanied with appeal as of right. \n245 \nU.S., at 326\n. These differences made it reasonable for Congress to allow the Government another chance to contest the applicant's eligibility.\n\nThe decision in Tutun, coming after Ness, draws the patent and trademark jurisdiction now exercised by the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals fully within the category of cases or controversies. So much was recognized in Tutun itself, \n270 \nU.S., at 578\n, where Mr. Justice Brandeis observed:\n\n\"If a certificate is procured when the prescribed qualifications have no existence in fact, it may be cancelled by suit. `It is in this respect,' as stated in Johannessen v. United States, \n225 \nU.S. 227, 238\n, `closely analogous to a public grant of land (Rev. Stat., 2289, etc.,) or of the exclusive right to make, use and vend a new and useful invention (Rev. Stat.,  4883, etc.).'\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n Like naturalization proceedings in a District Court, appeals from Patent Office decisions under 35 U.S.C. 144 are relatively summary - since the record is limited to the evidence allowed by that office - and are not themselves subject to direct review by appeal as of right.\n49\n It \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 579]\n\u00a0\n was as reasonable for Congress, therefore, to bind only the Patent Office on appeals and to give private parties whether or not participants in such appeals a further opportunity to contest the matter on plenary records developed in litigation elsewhere. This practice but furnishes a further illustration of the specialized jurisdiction of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, akin to that of the Commerce Court, in passing upon the consistency with law of expert administrative judgments without undertaking to conclude private parties in nonadministrative litigation. We conclude that the Postum decision must be taken to be limited to the statutory scheme in existence before the transfer of patent and trademark litigation to that court.\n\n\nX.\n\n\n\nWe turn finally to the more difficult question raised by the jurisdiction vested in the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals by 28 U.S.C. 1543 to review Tariff Commission findings of unfair practices in import trade, and the congressional reference jurisdiction given the Court of Claims by 28 U.S.C. 1492 and 2509. The judicial quality of the former was called into question though not resolved in Ex parte Bakelite Corp., \n279 \nU.S. 438, 460\n-461,\n50\n while that of the latter must be taken to have been adversely decided, so far as susceptibility to Supreme Court review is concerned, by In re Sanborn, \n148 \nU.S. 222\n.\n51\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 580]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAt the outset we are met with a suggestion by the Solicitor General that even if the decisions called for by these heads of jurisdiction are nonjudicial, their compatibility with the status of an Article III court has been settled by O'Donoghue v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 516, 545\n-548. It is true that O'Donoghue upheld the authority of Congress to invest the federal courts for the District of Columbia with certain administrative responsibilities - such as that of revising the rates of public utilities\n52\n - but only such as were related to the government of the District. See Pitts v. Peak, 60 App. D.C. 195, 197, 50 F.2d 485, 487, cited and relied upon in O'Donoghue, \n289 \nU.S., at 547\n-548.\n53\n To extend that holding to the wholly nationwide jurisdiction of courts whose seat is in the District of Columbia would be to ignore the special importance attached in the O'Donoghue opinion to the need there for an independent national judiciary. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 581]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe restraints of federalism are, of course, removed from the powers exercisable by Congress within the District. For, as the Court early stated, in Kendall v. United States, 12 Pet. 524, 619:\n\n\"There is in this district, no division of powers between the general and state governments. Congress has the entire control over the district for every purpose of government; and it is reasonable to suppose, that in organizing a judicial department here, all judicial power necessary for the purposes of government would be vested in the courts of justice.\"\n\n\n Thus those limitations implicit in the rubric \"case or controversy\" that spring from the Framers' anxiety not to intrude unduly upon the general jurisdiction of state courts, see Madison's Notes of the Debates, in II Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention (1911), 45-46, need have no application in the District. The national courts here may, consistently with those limitations, perform any of the local functions elsewhere performed by state courts.\n54\n\u00a0\n\nBut those are not the only limitations embodied in Article III's restriction of judicial power to cases or controversies. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 582]\n\u00a0\n The restriction expresses as well the Framers' desire to safeguard the independence of the judicial from the other branches by confining its activities to \"cases of a Judiciary nature,\" see II Farrand, op cit., supra, at 430, and in this respect it remains fully applicable at least to courts invested with jurisdiction solely over matters of national import. Our question is whether the independence of either the Court of Claims or the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals has been so compromised by its investiture with the particular heads of jurisdiction described above as to destroy its eligibility for recognition as an Article III court.\n\nThe jurisdictional statutes in issue, 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 and 28 U.S.C. 1492, 2509, appear to subject the decisions called for from those courts to an extrajudicial revisory authority incompatible with the limitations upon judicial power this Court has drawn from Article III. See, e. g., Chicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc., v. Waterman S. S. Corp., \n333 \nU.S. 103, 113\n-114; Hayburn's Case, 2 Dall. 409. Whether they actually do so is not, however, entirely free from difficulty, and cannot in our view appropriately be decided in a vacuum, apart from the setting of particular cases in which we may gauge the operation of the statutes. For disposition of the present cases, we think it is sufficient simply to note the doubt attending the validity of the jurisdiction, and to proceed on the assumption that it cannot be entertained by an Article III court.\n\nIt does not follow, however, from the invalidity, actual or potential, of these heads of jurisdiction, that either the Court of Claims or the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals must relinquish entitlement to recognition as an Article III court. They are not tribunals, as are for example the Interstate Commerce Commission or the Federal Trade Commission, a substantial and integral part of whose business is nonjudicial. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 583]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the Court of Claims' business is composed of cases and controversies. See pp. 573-574, supra. In the past year, it heard only 10 reference cases, Annual Report of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts (1961), 318; and its recent annual average has not exceeded that figure, Pavenstedt, The United States Court of Claims as a Forum for Tax Cases, 15 Tax L. Rev. 1, 6 n. 23 (1959). The tariff jurisdiction of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals is of even less significant dimensions. In the past fiscal year, that court disposed of 41 customs cases and 112 patent or trademark cases, but heard no appeals from the Tariff Commission. Annual Report of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts (1961), 318. Indeed we are advised that in all the years since 1922, when the predecessor to 337 of the Tariff Act was first enacted, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals has entertained only six such cases.\n55\n Certainly the status of a District Court or Court of Appeals would not be altered by a mere congressional attempt to invest it with such insignificant nonjudicial business; it would be equally perverse to make the status of these courts turn upon so minuscule a portion of their purported functions.\n\nThe Congress that enacted the assignment statute with its accompanying declarations was apprised of the possibility that a re-examination of the Bakelite and Williams decisions might lead to disallowance of some of these courts' jurisdiction. See 99 Cong. Rec. 8944 (1953) (remarks of Senator Gore); 104 Cong. Rec. 17549 (1958) (remarks of Senator Talmadge). Nevertheless it chose to pass the statute. We think with it that, if necessary, the particular offensive jurisdiction, and not the courts, would fall. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 584]\n\u00a0\n\n\n   CONCLUSIONS.\n\n\n Since the Court of Claims and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals are courts created under Article III, their judges - including retired judges, Booth v. United States, \n291 \nU.S. 339, 350\n-351 - are and have been constitutionally protected in tenure and compensation. Our conclusion, it should be noted, is not an ex post facto resurrection of a banished independence. The judges of these two courts have never accepted the dependent status thrust at them by the Bakelite and Williams decisions. See, e. g., Judge Madden writing for the Court of Claims in Pope v. United States, 100 Ct. Cl. 375, 53 F. Supp. 570, rev'd, \n323 \nU.S. 1\n. The factors set out at length in this opinion, which were not considered in the Bakelite and Williams opinions, make plain that the differing conclusion we now reach does no more than confer legal recognition upon an independence long exercised in fact.\n\nThat recognition suffices to dispose of the present cases. For it can hardly be contended that the specialized functions of these judges deprive them of capacity, as a matter of due process of law, to sit in judgment upon the staple business of the District Courts and Courts of Appeals. Whether they should be given such assignments may be and has been a proper subject for congressional debate. e. g., 62 Cong. Rec. 190-191, 207-209 (1921), but once legislatively resolved it can scarcely rise to the dignity of a constitutional question. To be sure, a judge of specialized experience may at first need to devote extra time and energy to familiarize himself with criminal, labor relations, or other cases beyond his accustomed ken. But to elevate this temporary disadvantage into a constitutional disability would be tantamount to suggesting that the President may never appoint to the bench a lawyer whose life's practice may have been devoted to patent, tax, antitrust, or any other specialized \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 585]\n\u00a0\n field of law in which many eminently well-qualified lawyers are wont to engage. The proposition will not, of course, survive its statement.\n\nThe judgments of the Courts of Appeals are\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the decision of this case.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of July 28, 1953, 1, 67 Stat. 226, added to 28 U.S.C. 171 (Court of Claims); Act of August 25, 1958, 1, 72 Stat. 848, added to 28 U.S.C. 211 (Court of Customs and Patent Appeals).

That court had not, however, been specified for reduction by Congress; the action of the judges was understandable coming as it did after Bakelite had been decided; and under 109 of the Act, 47 Stat. 403, the Treasury was authorized to accept reductions in payment voluntarily tendered by judges whose salary was constitutionally exempt from diminution.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 30\n] 36 Stat. 106.

Id., at 468.\n\nIt is significant that all of the jurisdiction at issue in the Keller, Postum, and General Electric cases has long since been transformed into judicial business. The change with respect to review of Patent Office decisions took place, as we have seen, p. 577, supra, before the transfer of that jurisdiction to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals. Review of the Public Utilities Commission was restricted to questions of law upon the evidence before the Commission, in the Act of August 27, 1935, 2, 49 Stat. 882, D.C. Code, 1961, 43-705. See Public Utilities Comm'n v. Pollak, \n343 \nU.S. 451, 458\n. And the Act of July 1, 1930, c. 788, 46 Stat. 844, likewise made review of the Radio Commission judicial, as was recognized in Federal Radio Comm'n v. Nelson Bros.

JUSTICE CLARK, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, concurring in the result.\n\nI cannot agree to the unnecessary overruling of Ex parte Bakelite Corp., \n279 \nU.S. 438\n (1929), and Williams v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 553\n (1933). Both were unanimous opinions by most distinguished Courts,\n1\n headed in the Bakelite case by Chief Justice Taft and in Williams by Chief Justice Hughes.\n\nLong before Glidden v. Zdanok was filed, the Congress had declared the Court of Claims \"to be a court established under article III of the Constitution of the United States.\" Act of July 28, 1953, 1, 67 Stat. 226. Not that this ipse dixit made the Court of Claims an Article III court, for it must be examined in light of the congressional power exercised and the jurisdiction enjoyed, together with the characteristics of its judges. But the 1953 Act did definitely establish the intent of the Congress, which prior to that time was not clear in light of the Williams holding 20 years earlier that it was not an Article III court. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 586]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt is my belief that prior to 1953 the Court of Claims had all of the characteristics of an Article III court - jurisdiction over justiciable matters, issuance of final judgments, judges appointed by the President with consent of the Senate - save as to the congressional reference matters. It was the fact that a substantial portion of its jurisdiction consisted of congressional references that compelled the decision in Williams that it was not an Article III court and therefore the salaries of its judges could be reduced.\n2\n Since that time the Article III jurisdiction of the Court of Claims has been enlarged by including original jurisdiction under several Acts, e. g., suits against the United States for damages for unjust conviction, Act of May 24, 1938, 1-4, 52 Stat. 438, 28 U.S.C. 1495, and appellate jurisdiction over tort suits against the United States tried in the District Courts, Act of Aug. 2, 1946, 412 (a) (2), 60 Stat. 844, 28 U.S.C. 1504, and over suits before the Indian Claims Commission, Act of May 24, 1949, 89 (a), 63 Stat. 102, 28 U.S.C. 1505. In addition, the former jurisdiction over questions referred by the Executive branch was withdrawn in 1953. Act of July 28, 1953, 8, 67 Stat. 226. The result is that practically all of the court's jurisdiction \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 587]\n\u00a0\n is now comprised of Article III cases. And I read the 1953 Act as unequivocally expressing Congress' intent that this court - the jurisdiction of which was then almost entirely over Article III cases - should be an Article III court, thereby irrevocably establishing life tenure and irreducible salaries for its judges.\n\nIt is true that Congress still makes legislative references to the court, averaging some 10 a year. The acceptance of jurisdiction of either executive or legislative references calling for advisory opinions has never been honored by Article III courts. Indeed, this Court since 1793 has consistently refused so to act. Correspondence of the Justices, 3 Johnston, Correspondence and Public Papers of John Jay (1891), 486-489. Muskrat v. United States, \n219 \nU.S. 346\n (1911). I do not construe the legislative history of the 1953 Act to be so clear as to require the Court of Claims to carry on this function, which appears to be minuscule. On the contrary, the congressional mandate clearly and definitely declared the court \"to be a court established under article III.\" I would carry out that mandate. In my view the Court of Claims, if and when such a reference occurs, should with due deference advise the Congress, as this Court advised the President 169 years ago, that it cannot render advisory opinions.\n\nLikewise I find that the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals has been an Article III court since 1958. It was created by the Congress in 1909 to exercise exclusive appellate jurisdiction over customs cases. Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act of Aug. 5, 1909, 36 Stat. 11, 105-108. At that time these cases were reviewed by Circuit Courts of Appeals - clearly of Article III status - 36 Stat. 106, and they have since been considered on certiorari by this Court without suggestion that they were not \"cases\" in the Article III sense. E. g., The Five Per Cent. Discount \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 588]\n\u00a0\n Cases, \n243 \nU.S. 97\n (1917).\n3\n The Congress enlarged the jurisdiction of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals in 1922 to include appeals on questions of law from Tariff Commission findings in proceedings relating to unfair practices in the import trade. Tariff Act of 1922, 42 Stat. 943, 944. In 1929 this Court in Bakelite, supra, which involved a tariff matter, found these references to be of an advisory nature and on this basis declared the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals to be a legislative rather than an Article III court. The Bakelite decision indicates that this Court was of the impression that the tariff jurisdiction of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals would be significant. However, since that time that court has handled but four such references - and only one in the last 27 years. At about the same time that the Bakelite opinion came down, Congress transferred the appellate jurisdiction in patent and trademark cases from the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals. Act of March 2, 1929, 1, 2, 45 Stat. 1475. Thus, contrary to the apparent assumption in Bakelite, the business of that court now consists exclusively of Article III cases - with tariff references practically nonexistent (one in the last 27 years). In view of this evolution of its jurisdiction, I believe the court became an Article III court upon the clear manifestation of congressional intent that it be such. Act of Aug. 25, 1958, 1, 72 Stat. 848.\n\nAs I have indicated, supra, the handling of the tariff references - numbering only 6 in 40 years - is not an Article III court function. The Congress has declared \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 589]\n\u00a0\n the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals to be an Article III court. It should, therefore, if and when such a case arose, with due deference refuse to exercise such jurisdiction.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nI see nothing in the argument that the 1953 and 1958 Acts so changed the character of these courts as to require new presidential appointments. Congress was merely renouncing its power to terminate the functions or reduce the tenure or salary of the judges of the courts. Much more drastic changes have been made without reappointment.\n5\n And there is no significance to the fact that Judge Jackson, who presided over the Lurk trial, was not in active status in 1958 when Congress declared his court to be an Article III court. He remained in office as a judge of that court even though retired, cf. Booth v. United States, \n291 \nU.S. 339\n (1934), and his judgeship was controlled by any act concerning the jurisdiction of that court or the status of its judges.\n\nI would affirm.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Bakelite: Taft, Holmes, Van Devanter, McReynolds, Brandeis, Sutherland, Butler, Sanford and Stone. Williams: Hughes, Van Devanter, McReynolds, Brandeis, Sutherland, Butler, Stone, Roberts and Cardozo.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] \"`From the outset Congress has required it [the Court of Claims] to give merely advisory decisions on many matters. Under the act creating it all of its decisions were to be of that nature. Afterwards some were to have effect as binding judgments, but others were still to be merely advisory. This is true at the present time.'\" Williams v. United States, supra, at 569 (quoting from Ex parte Bakelite).\n\n\"Further reflection tends only to confirm the views expressed in the Bakelite opinion . . . and we feel bound to reaffirm and apply them. And, giving these views due effect here, we see no escape from the conclusion that if the Court of Customs Appeals is a legislative court, so also is the Court of Claims.\" Williams, at 571. The Bakelite decision was posited squarely on the legislative reference function. See Ex parte Bakelite, supra, 454-458.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] That its original jurisdiction was in \"cases\" in the Article III, 2, sense cannot be questioned. See In re Frischer & Co., 16 Ct. Cust. App. 191, 198 (1928); Osborn v. Bank of U.S., 9 Wheat, 738, 819 (1824); Interstate Commerce Commission v. Brimson, \n154 \nU.S. 447, 487\n (1894); Tutun v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 568, 576\n-577 (1926).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The validity of Judge Jackson's participation, as the Government points out, might also be sustained under the Act of September 14, 1922, c. 306, 5, 42 Stat. 837, 839, which provided for the assignment of judges of the Court of Customs Appeals to the courts of the District of Columbia. This Act was on the books when Judge Jackson took his seat on the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals as well as when the Lurk case was tried.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Nor does my holding carry any implication that judgments entered prior to the date of these Acts in which judges of these courts participated might be collaterally attacked. Ex parte Ward, \n173 \nU.S. 452\n (1899).\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK concurs, dissenting.\n\nThe decision in these cases has nothing to do with the character, ability, or qualification of the individuals who sat on assignment on the Court of Appeals in No. 242 and \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 590]\n\u00a0\n on the District Court in No. 481. The problem is an impersonal one, concerning the differences between an Article I court and an Article III court.\n1\n My Brother HARLAN calls it a problem of a \"highly theoretical nature.\" Far from being \"theoretical\" it is intensely practical, for it deals with powers of judges over the life and liberty of defendants in criminal cases and over vast property interests in complicated trials customarily involving the right to trial by jury.\n\nPrior to today's decision the distinction between the two courts had been clear and unmistakable. By Art. I, 8, Congress is given a wide range of powers, including \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 591]\n\u00a0\n the power \"to pay the Debts\" of the United States and the power to \"lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises.\" By Art. I, 8, Congress is also given the power \"To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers.\" Pursuant to the latter - the Necessary and Proper Clause - the Court of Claims was created \"to pay the Debts\";\n2\n and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals was created in furtherance of the collection of duties. My Brother HARLAN shows that the Court of Customs Appeals traces back to the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act of August 5, 1909, which should be proof enough that it is an administrative court, performing essentially an executive task.\n3\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 592]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn Williams v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 553\n, the Court in a unanimous decision written by Mr. Justice Sutherland held that the Court of Claims, though exercising judicial power, was an Article I court. And in Ex parte Bakelite Corp., \n279 \nU.S. 438\n, the Court in a unanimous opinion written by Mr. Justice Van Devanter held the Court of Customs Appeals to be an Article I court. Taft was Chief Justice when Ex parte Bakelite was decided. Hughes was Chief Justice when Williams v. United States was decided. I mention the two regimes that filed the unanimous opinions in those cases to indicate the vintage of the authority which decided them. Their decisions, of course, do not bind us, for they dealt with matters of constitutional interpretation which are always open. Yet no new history has been unearthed to show that the Taft and the Hughes Courts were wrong on the technical, but vitally important, question now presented.\n\nMr. Justice Van Devanter in Ex parte Bakelite marked the line between the Court of Claims and the Court of \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 593]\n\u00a0\n Customs and Patent Appeals on the one hand and the District Courts and Courts of Appeals on the other:\n\n\"Those established under the specific power given in section 2 of Article III are called constitutional courts. They share in the exercise of the judicial power defined in that section, can be invested with no other jurisdiction, and have judges who hold office during good behavior, with no power in Congress to provide otherwise. On the other hand, those created by Congress in the exertion of other powers are called legislative courts. Their functions always are directed to the execution of one or more of such powers and are prescribed by Congress independently of section 2 of Article III; and their judges hold for such term as Congress prescribes, whether it be a fixed period of years or during good behavior.\" Id., at 449.\n\n\n My Brother HARLAN emphasizes that both Judge Madden of the Court of Claims and Judge Jackson of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals \"enjoy statutory assurance of tenure and compensation\"; and so they do. But that statement reveals one basic difference between an Article III judge and an Article I judge. The latter's tenure is statutory and statutory only; Article I contains no guarantee that the judges of Article I courts have life appointments. Nor does it provide that their salaries may not be reduced during their term of office. On the other hand, the tenure of an Article III judge is during \"good behaviour\"; moreover, Article III provides that its judges shall have a compensation that \"shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.\" See O'Malley v. Woodrough, \n307 \nU.S. 277\n. To repeat, there is not a word in Article I giving its courts such protection in tenure or in salary. A constitutional amendment would be necessary to supply Article I judges with the guarantees \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 594]\n\u00a0\n of tenure and salary that Article III gives its judges. The majority attempts to evade this problem by looking to so-called \"Congressional intent\" to find the creation of an Article III court. Congress, however, has always understood that it was only establishing Article I courts when it created the Court of Claims and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals. The tenure it affixed to the judges of those tribunals was of necessity statutory only, as no mandate or requirement of Article I was involved.\n\nThe importance of these provisions to the independence of the judiciary needs no argument. Hamilton stated the entire case in The Federalist No. 79 (Lodge ed. 1908), pp. 491-493:\n\n \"Next to permanency in office, nothing can contribute more to the independence of the judges than a fixed provision for their support. The remark made in relation to the President is equally applicable here. In the general course of human nature, a power over a man's subsistence amounts to a power over his will. And we can never hope to see realized in practice, the complete separation of the judicial from the legislative power, in any system which leaves the former dependent for pecuniary resources on the occasional grants of the latter. The enlightened friends to good government in every State, have seen cause to lament the want of precise and explicit precautions in the State constitutions on this head. Some of these indeed have declared that permanent salaries should be established for the judges; but the experiment has in some instances shown that such expressions are not sufficiently definite to preclude legislative evasions. Something still more positive and unequivocal has been evinced to be requisite. The plan of the convention accordingly has provided that the judges of \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 595]\n\u00a0\n the United States shall at stated times receive for their services a compensation which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.'\n\n\n \"This, all circumstances considered, is the most eligible provision that could have been devised. It will readily be understood that the fluctuations in the value of money and in the state of society rendered a fixed rate of compensation in the Constitution inadmissible. What might be extravagant to-day, might in half a century become penurious and inadequate. It was therefore necessary to leave it to the discretion of the legislature to vary its provisions in conformity to the variations in circumstances, yet under such restrictions as to put it out of the power of that body to change the condition of the individual for the worse. A man may then be sure of the ground upon which he stands, and can never be deterred from his duty by the apprehension of being placed in a less eligible situation. The clause which has been quoted combines both advantages. The salaries of judicial officers may from time to time be altered, as occasion shall require, yet so as never to lessen the allowance with which any particular judge comes into office, in respect to him. . . .\n\n\n \"This provision for the support of the judges bears every mark of prudence and efficacy; and it may be safely affirmed that, together with the permanent tenure of their offices, it affords a better prospect of their independence than is discoverable in the constitutions of any of the States in regard to their own judges.\n\n\n \"The precautions for their responsibility are comprised in the article respecting impeachments. They are liable to be impeached for malconduct by the House of Representatives, and tried by the Senate; and, if convicted, may be dismissed from office, and \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 596]\n\u00a0\n disqualified for holding any other. This is the only provision on the point which is consistent with the necessary independence of the judicial character, and is the only one which we find in our own Constitution in respect to our own judges.\"\n\n\n We should say here what was said in Toth v. Quarles, \n350 \nU.S. 11, 17\n:\n\n \". . . the Constitution does not provide life tenure for those performing judicial functions in military trials. They are appointed by military commanders and may be removed at will. Nor does the Constitution protect their salaries as it does judicial salaries. Strides have been made toward making courts-martial less subject to the will of the executive department which appoints, supervises and ultimately controls them. But from the very nature of things, courts have more independence in passing on the life and liberty of people than do military tribunals.\"\n\n\n Tenure that is guaranteed by the Constitution is a badge of a judge of an Article III court. The argument that mere statutory tenure is sufficient for judges of Article III courts was authoritatively answered in Ex parte Bakelite Corp., supra, at 459-460:\n\n \". . . the argument is fallacious. It mistakenly assumes that whether a court is of one class or the other depends on the intention of Congress, whereas the true test lies in the power under which the court was created and in the jurisdiction conferred. Nor has there been any settled practice on the part of Congress which gives special significance to the absence or presence of a provision respecting the tenure of judges. This may be illustrated by two citations. The same Congress that created the Court of Customs Appeals made provision for five additional circuit judges and declared that they should \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 597]\n\u00a0\n hold their offices during good behavior; and yet the status of the judges was the same as it would have been had that declaration been omitted. In creating courts for some of the Territories Congress failed to include a provision fixing the tenure of the judges; but the courts became legislative courts just as if such a provision had been included.\" (Italics added.)\n\n\n Congress could make members of the Interstate Commerce Commission lifetime appointees. Yet I suppose no one would go so far as to say that a member of the Interstate Commerce Commission could be assigned to sit on the District Court or on the Court of Appeals. But if any agency member is disqualified, why is a member of another Article I tribunal, viz., the Court of Claims or the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, qualified? No distinction can be drawn based on the functions performed by the Interstate Commerce Commission and those performed by the other two legislative tribunals. In each case some adjudicatory functions are performed.\n4\n Though the judicial functions of the Interstate Commerce Commission are as distinct as those of the Court of Claims, they nevertheless derive from Article I; and they are functions that Congress can exercise directly or delegate to an agency. Williams v. United States, supra, pp. 567-571. To make the present decision turn on whether the Court of Claims and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals perform \"judicial\" functions is to adopt a false standard. The manner in which the majority reasons exposes the fallacy.\n\nThe majority says that once the United States consents to be sued all problems of \"justiciability\" are satisfied; and \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 598]\n\u00a0\n that Congress has broad powers to convert \"moral\" obligations into \"legal\" ones enforceable by \"constitutional\" courts. The truth is, I think, that the dimensions of Article III can be altered only by the amending process, not by legislation. Congress can create as respects certain claims a limited \"justiciability.\" But if \"justiciability\" in the \"constitutional\" sense is involved, then there must be trial by jury assuming, as my Brother HARLAN does, that the claim is for recovery for torts or some other compensable injury. To repeat, it does not advance analysis by calling the function a \"judicial\" one (see Pope v. United States, \n323 \nU.S. 1, 12\n), for both Article I courts and Article III courts perform functions of that character. The crucial question on this phase of the problems is the manner in which that judicial power is to be exercised.\n\nAs Mr. Justice Brandeis made clear in Tutun v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 568, 576\n-577, an administrative remedy may be \"judicial.\" The question here is different; it is whether the procedures utilized by the tribunal must comport with those set forth in the Bill of Rights and in the body of the Constitution. Yet who would maintain that in an administrative action for damages a jury trial was necessary?\n\nJudges of the Article III courts work by standards and procedures which are either specified in the Bill of Rights or supplied by well-known historic precedents. Article III courts are law courts, equity courts, and admiralty courts\n5\n - all specifically named in Article III. They sit \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 599]\n\u00a0\n to determine \"cases\" or \"controversies.\" But Article I courts have no such restrictions. They need not be confined to \"cases\" or \"controversies\" but can dispense legislative largesse. See United States v. Tillamooks, \n329 \nU.S. 40\n; \n341 \nU.S. 48\n. Their decisions may affect vital interests; yet like legislative bodies, zoning commissions, and other administrative bodies they need not observe the same standards of due process required in trials of Article III \"cases\" or \"controversies.\" See Bi-Metallic Co. v. Colorado, \n239 \nU.S. 441\n. That is what Chief Justice Marshall meant when he said in American Ins. Co. v. Canter, 1 Pet. 511, 545-546, that an Article I court (in that case a territorial court) could make its adjudications without regard to the limitations of Article III. On the other hand, as the Court in O'Donoghue v. United States, supra, at 546, observed, Article III courts could not be endowed with the administrative and legislative powers (or with the power to render advisory opinions) which Article I tribunals or agencies exercise.\n\nIn other words, the question, apart from the constitutional guarantee of tenure and the provision against diminution of salary, concerns the functions of the particular tribunal. Article III courts have prescribed for them constitutional standards some of which are in the Bill of Rights, while some (as for example those concerning bills of attainder and ex post facto laws) are in the body of the Constitution itself. Article I courts, on the other hand, are agencies of the legislative or executive branch. Thus while Article III courts of law must sit with a jury in suits where the value in controversy exceeds $20, the Court of Claims - an Article I court - is not so confined by the Seventh Amendment. The claims which \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 600]\n\u00a0\n it hears are claims with respect to which the Government has agreed to be sued. As the Court said in McElrath v. United States, \n102 \nU.S. 426, 440\n, since the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims is permissive only, Congress can prescribe the rules and the procedures to be followed in pursuing claims against the Government. Likewise, the Court of Customs Appeals hears appeals that \"include nothing which inherently or necessarily requires judicial determination, but only matters the determination of which may be, and at times has been, committed exclusively to executive officers.\" Ex parte Bakelite Corp., supra, at 458.\n\nThe judicial functions exercised by Article III courts cannot be performed by Congress nor delegated to agencies under its supervision and control.\n6\n The bill of \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 601]\n\u00a0\n attainder is banned by Art. I, 9. If there is to be punishment, courts (in the constitutional sense) must administer it. As we stated in United States v. Lovett, \n328 \nU.S. 303, 317\n:\n\n \"Those who wrote our Constitution well knew the danger inherent in special legislative acts which take away the life, liberty, or property of particular named persons because the legislature thinks them guilty of conduct which deserves punishment. They intended to safeguard the people of this country from punishment without trial by duly constituted courts.\"\n\n\n Moreover, when an Article III court of law acts, there is a precise procedure that must be followed:\n\n\"An accused in court must be tried by an impartial jury, has a right to be represented by counsel, he must be clearly informed of the charge against him, the law which he is charged with violating must have been passed before he committed the act charged, he must be confronted by the witnesses against him, he must not be compelled to incriminate himself, he cannot twice be put in jeopardy for the same offense, and even after conviction no cruel and unusual punishment can be inflicted upon him.\" Id., 317-318. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 602]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n On the civil side there is not only the right to trial by jury in suits at common law where the value in controversy exceeds $20 but there is also the mandate of the Seventh Amendment directing that \"no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.\"\n\nNeither of these limitations is germane to litigation in the Court of Claims or in the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals. Those courts, moreover, exercise no criminal jurisdiction, no admiralty jurisdiction, no equity jurisdiction.\n\nAs noted, the advisory opinion is beyond the capacity of Article III courts to render. Muskrat v. United States, \n219 \nU.S. 346\n. Yet it is part and parcel of the function of legislative tribunals.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nThus I cannot say, as some do, that the distinction between the two kinds of courts is a \"matter of language.\"\n8\n The majority over and again emphasizes the declaration by Congress that each of the courts in question is an Article III court. It seems that the majority tries to gain momentum for its decision from those congressional declarations. This Court, however, is the expositor of the meaning of the Constitution, as Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, held; and a congressional enactment in the field of Article III is entitled to no greater weight than in other areas. The declarations by Congress that these legislative tribunals are Article III \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 603]\n\u00a0\n courts\n9\n would be determinative only if Congress had the power to modify or alter the concepts that radiate throughout Article III and throughout those provisions of the Bill of Rights that specify how the judicial power granted by Article III shall be exercised.\n\nAn appointment is made by the President and confirmed by the Senate in light of the duties of the particular office. Men eminently qualified to sit on Article I tribunals or agencies are not picked or confirmed in light of their qualifications to preside at jury trials or to process on appeal the myriad of constitutional and procedural problems involved in Article III \"cases\" or \"controversies.\" A President who sent a name to the Senate for the Interstate Commerce Commission or Federal Trade Commission might never dream of entrusting the nominee with the powers of an Article III judge. The tasks are so different, the responsibilities and the qualifications so diverse that it is difficult for one who knows the federal system to see how in the world of practical affairs these offices are interchangeable.\n\nIn the Senate debate on the Court of Customs Appeals, Senator Cummins stated that the judges who were to man it were to become tariff \"experts\" whose judicial business would be \"confined to the matter of the duties on imports.\" 44 Cong. Rec. 4185. Senator McCumber, who spoke for the Committee, emphasized the technical nature of the work of those judges and the unique specialization of their work.\n\n\"The law governing the development of the human intellect is such that constant study of a particular question necessarily broadens and expands and intensifies and deepens the mind on that particular subject. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 604]\n\u00a0\n Any man who has gone over even the cotton schedule will understand how delicate questions will arise; how complex those questions must necessarily be, and how necessary it will be to have judges who will possess technical knowledge upon that subject; and a technical knowledge can only be obtained by a constant daily study of those questions. For that second reason it was thought best to have a court whose whole attention, whose whole life work, should be given to that particular subject.\" Id., at 4199.\n\n\n Could there be any doubt that the late John J. Parker, rejected by the Senate for this Court, would have been confirmed for one of these Article I courts?\n\nIt is said that Congress could separate law and equity and create federal judges who, though Article III judges, sit entirely on the equity side. If Congress can do that, it is said that Congress can divide up all judicial power as it chooses and by making tenure permanent allow judges to be assigned from an Article I to an Article III court. The fact that Article III judicial power may be so divided as to produce judges with no experience in the trial of jury cases or in the review of them on appeal is no excuse for allowing legislative judges to be imported into the important fields that Article III preserves and that are partly safeguarded by the Bill of Rights and partly represented by ancient admiralty practice\n10\n and equity procedures. Federal judges named to Article III courts are picked in light of the functions entrusted to them. No one knows whether a President would have appointed to an Article III court a man he named to an Article I court.\n\nMy view is that we subtly undermine the constitutional system when we treat federal judges as fungible. If members of the Court of Claims and of the Court of Customs \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 605]\n\u00a0\n and Patent Appeals can sit on life-and-death cases in Article III courts, so can a member of any administrative agency who has a statutory tenure that future judges sitting on this Court by some mysterious manner may change to constitutional tenure. With all deference, this seems to me to be a light-hearted treatment of Article III functions.\n11\n Men of highest quality chosen as Article I judges might never pass muster for Article III courts when tested by their record of tolerance for minorities \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 606]\n\u00a0\n and for their respect of the Bill of Rights - neither of which is as crucial to the performance of the duties of those who sit in Article I courts as it is to the duties of Article III judges.\n\nIn sum, judges who do not perform Article III functions, who do not enjoy constitutional tenure and whose salaries are not constitutionally protected against diminution during their term of office cannot be Article III judges.\n\nJudges who perform \"judicial\" functions on Article I courts do not adjudicate \"cases\" or \"controversies\" in the sense of Article III. They are not bound by the requirements of the Seventh Amendment concerning trial by jury.\n\nJudges who sit on Article I courts are chosen for administrative or allied skills, not for their qualifications to sit in cases involving the vast interests of life, liberty, or property for whose protection the Bill of Rights and the other guarantees in the main body of the Constitution, including the ban on bills of attainder and ex post facto laws, were designed. Judges who might be confirmed for an Article I court might never pass muster for the onerous and life-or-death duties of Article III judges.\n\nFor these reasons I would reverse the judgments below.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The District Court of the District of Columbia, like the \"inferior courts\" established by Congress under Art. III, 1, of the Constitution, is an Article III court (O'Donoghue v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 516\n), even though it possesses powers that Article III courts could not exercise. Congress, acting under its plenary power granted by Art. I, 8, to legislate for the District of Columbia, has from time to time vested in the courts of the District administrative and even legislative powers. See, e. g., Keller v. Potomac Electric Co., \n261 \nU.S. 428, 440\n-443 (review of rate making); Postum Cereal Co. v. California Fig Nut Co., \n272 \nU.S. 693, 698\n-701 (patent and trademark appeals); Federal Radio Comm'n v. General Electric Co., \n281 \nU.S. 464, 467\n-468 (review of radio station licensing; cf. Radio Comm'n v. Nelson Bros. Co., \n289 \nU.S. 266, 274\n-278). Congress has also authorized District Court judges to appoint members of the Board of Education. D.C. Code, 31-101.\n\nIn O'Donoghue v. United States, supra, at 545, the Court said:\n\n\"The fact that Congress, under another and plenary grant of power, has conferred upon these courts jurisdiction over non-federal causes of action, or over quasi-judicial or administrative matters, does not affect the question. In dealing with the District, Congress possesses the powers which belong to it in respect of territory within a state, and also the powers of a state.\"\n\n\n The eighteenth-century courts in this country performed many administrative functions. See Pound, Organization of Courts (1940), pp. 88-89. The propriety of the union of legislative and judicial powers in a state court was assumed in Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line, \n211 \nU.S. 210\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] \"Legislative courts also may be created as special tribunals to examine and determine various matters, arising between the government and others, which from their nature do not require judicial determination and yet are susceptible of it. The mode of determining matters of this class is completely within congressional control. Congress may reserve to itself the power to decide, may delegate that power to executive officers, or may commit it to judicial tribunals.\n\n\"Conspicuous among such matters are claims against the United States. These may arise in many ways and may be for money, lands or other things. They all admit of legislative or executive determination, and yet from their nature are susceptible of determination by courts; but no court can have cognizance of them except as Congress makes specific provision therefor. Nor do claimants have any right to sue on them unless Congress consents; and Congress may attach to its consent such conditions as it deems proper, even to requiring that the suits be brought in a legislative court specially created to consider them.\n\n\n\"The Court of Claims is such a court. It was created, and has been maintained, as a special tribunal to examine and determine claims for money against the United States. This is a function which belongs primarily to Congress as an incident of its power to pay the debts of the United States. But the function is one which Congress has a discretion either to exercise directly or to delegate to other agencies.\" Ex parte Bakelite Corp., \n279 \nU.S. 438, 451\n-452.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] \"The Court of Customs Appeals was created by Congress in virtue of its power to lay and collect duties on imports and to adopt any \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 592]\n\u00a0\n appropriate means of carrying that power into execution. The full province of the court under the act creating it is that of determining matters arising between the Government and others in the executive administration and application of the customs laws. These matters are brought before it by appeals from decisions of the Customs Court, formerly called the Board of General Appraisers. The appeals include nothing which inherently or necessarily requires judicial determination, but only matters the determination of which may be, and at times has been, committed exclusively to executive officers. True, the provisions of the customs laws requiring duties to be paid and turned into the Treasury promptly, without awaiting disposal of protests against rulings of appraisers and collectors, operate in many instances to convert the protests into applications to refund part or all of the money paid; but this does not make the matters involved in the protests any the less susceptible of determination by executive officers. In fact their final determination has been at times confided to the Secretary of the Treasury, with no recourse to judicial proceedings.\" Ex parte Bakelite Corp., supra, note 2, at 458.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The Interstate Commerce Commission has long entered reparation orders directing carriers to pay shippers specified sums of money plus interest for excessive and unreasonable rates. See Meeker v. Lehigh Valley R. Co., \n236 \nU.S. 434\n; II Sharfman, The Interstate Commerce Commission (1931), pp. 387-388.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] As respects admiralty, Chief Justice Marshall said in American Ins. Co. v. Canter, 1 Pet. 511, 545:\n\n\"If we have recourse to that pure fountain from which all the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts is derived, we find language employed which cannot well be misunderstood. The Constitution declares, that `the judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority; to \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 599]\n\u00a0\n all cases affecting ambassadors, or other public ministers, and consuls; to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.'\n\n\n\"The Constitution certainly contemplates these as three distinct classes of cases . . . .\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The limitations on Article III courts that distinguish them from Article I courts were stated by Chief Justice Vinson in National Insurance Co. v. Tidewater Co., \n337 \nU.S. 582, 629\n-630, in words that have, I think, general acceptance, though on the precise issue he wrote in dissent:\n\n\"In Keller v. Potomac Electric Co., \n261 \nU.S. 428\n (1923), where this Court had before it an Act under which the courts of the District of Columbia were given revisory power over rates set by the Public Utilities Commission of the District, the appellee sought to sustain the appellate jurisdiction given this Court by the Act on the basis that `Although Art. III of the Constitution limits the jurisdiction of the federal courts, this limitation is subject to the power of Congress to enlarge the jurisdiction, where such enlargement may reasonably be required to enable Congress to exercise the express powers conferred upon it by the Constitution.' 261 U.S. at 435. There, as here, the power relied upon was that given Congress to exercise exclusive jurisdiction over the District of Columbia, and to make all laws necessary and proper to carry such powers into effect. But this Court clearly and unequivocally rejected the contention that Congress could thus extend the jurisdiction of constitutional courts, citing the note to Hayburn's Case, 2 Dall. 409, 410 (1792); United States v. Ferreira, 13 How. 40, note, p. 52 (1851), and Gordon v. United States, \n117 \nU.S. 697\n (1864). These and other decisions of \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 601]\n\u00a0\n this Court clearly condition the power of a constitutional court to take cognizance of any cause upon the existence of a suit instituted according to the regular course of judicial procedure, Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), the power to pronounce a judgment and carry it into effect between persons and parties who bring a case before it for decision, Muskrat v. United States, \n219 \nU.S. 346\n (1911); Gordon v. United States, supra, the absence of revisory or appellate power in any other branch of Government, Hayburn's Case, supra; United States v. Ferreira, supra, and the absence of administrative or legislative issues or controversies, Keller v. Potomac Electric Co., supra; Postum Cereal Co. v. California Fig Nut Co., \n272 \nU.S. 693\n (1927).\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] See 28 U.S.C. 1492, giving the Court of Claims power \"to report to either House of Congress on any bill referred to the court by such House.\" And see 28 U.S.C. 2509, 2510. 28 U.S.C. 1542 gave the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals a kind of administrative review over certain decisions of the patent office. And see note 2, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] See H. R. Rep. No. 2348, 84th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 3.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] See Act of July 28, 1953, 67 Stat. 226 (Court of Claims); Act of July 14, 1956, 70 Stat. 532 (Customs Court); Act of August 25, 1958, 72 Stat. 848 (Court of Customs and Patent Appeals).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] See The Lottawanna, 21 Wall. 558, 575; The Osceola, \n189 \nU.S. 158\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] The Court does great mischief in today's opinions. The opinion of my Brother HARLAN stirs a host of problems that need not be opened. What is done will, I fear, plague us for years.\n\nFirst, that opinion cites with approval Ex parte McCardle, 7 Wall. 506, in which Congress withdrew jurisdiction of this Court to review a habeas corpus case that was sub judice, and then apparently draws a distinction between that case and United States v. Klein, 13 Wall. 128, where such withdrawal was not permitted in a property claim. There is a serious question whether the McCardle case could command a majority view today. Certainly the distinction between liberty and property (which emanates from this portion of my Brother HARLAN'S opinion) has no vitality even in terms of the Due Process Clause.\n\nSecond, Postum Cereal Co. v. California Fig Nut Co., \n272 \nU.S. 693\n, is apparently overruled. Why this is done is not apparent. That case ruled on the question whether a ruling on a Patent Office determination was \"judicial.\" Whether it was or not is immaterial because, as already noted, Article I courts, like Article III courts, exercise \"judicial\" power. The only relevant question here is whether a court that need not follow Article III procedures is nonetheless an Article III court.\n\nThird, it is implied that Congress could vest the lower federal courts with the power to render advisory opinions. The character of the District Court in the District of Columbia has been differentiated from the other District Courts by O'Donoghue v. United States, supra, in that the former is, in part, an agency of Congress to perform Article I powers. How Congress could transform regular Article III courts into Article I courts is a mystery. Certainly we should not decide such an important issue so casually and so unnecessarily. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 530, 607]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","72":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGLUCKSTERN v.

HEMPSTEAD(1962)\nNo. 78\nArgued: Decided: May 14, 1962\n\n\n\n\n The individual appellant owned a 38-acre tract within the Town of Hempstead on which the corporate appellant had been mining sand and gravel continuously since 1927. During the first year the excavation reached the water table, leaving a water-filled crater which had since been widened and deepened until it became a 20-acre lake with an average depth of 25 feet, around which the Town had expanded until, within a radius of 3,500 feet, there were more than 2,200 homes and 4 public schools with a combined enrollment of 4,500 pupils. In 1958 the Town amended its ordinance regulating such excavations so as to prohibit any excavating below the water table. Although this concededly prohibited the beneficial use to which the property had previously been devoted, a state court granted the Town an injunction to enforce this prohibition. Held: On the record in this case, appellants have not sustained the burden of showing that the depth limitation is so onerous and unreasonable as to result in a taking of their property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Pp. 590-598.\n\n 9 N. Y. 2d 101, 172 N. E. 2d 562, affirmed.\n\nMilton I. Newman argued the cause for appellants. With him on the briefs were John J. Bennett and Edward M. Miller.\n\nWilliam C. Mattison argued the cause for appellee. With him on the briefs were Richard P. Charles and Mario Matthew Cuomo.\n\nJohn F. Lane and Jerome Powell filed a brief for the National Crushed Stone Association, as amicus curiae, urging reversal.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe Town of Hempstead has enacted an ordinance regulating dredging and pit excavating on property within its limits. Appellants, who engaged in such operations \n\n[369 \nU.S. 590, 591]\n\u00a0\n prior to the enactment of the ordinance, claim that it in effect prevents them from continuing their business and therefore takes their property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The trial court held that the ordinance was a valid exercise of the town's police power, 19 Misc. 2d 176, 189 N. Y. S. 2d 577, and the Appellate Division affirmed, 9 App. Div. 2d 941, 196 N. Y. S. 2d 573. The New York Court of Appeals in a divided opinion affirmed. 9 N. Y. 2d 101, 172 N. E. 2d 562. We noted probable jurisdiction, \n366 \nU.S. 942\n, and having heard argument we now affirm the judgment.\n\nAppellant Goldblatt owns a 38-acre tract within the Town of Hempstead. At the time of the present litigation appellant Builders Sand and Gravel Corporation was mining sand and gravel on this lot, a use to which the lot had been put continuously since 1927. Before the end of the first year the excavation had reached the water table leaving a water-filled crater which has been widened and deepened to the point that it is now a 20-acre lake with an average depth of 25 feet. The town has expanded around this excavation, and today within a radius of 3,500 feet there are more than 2,200 homes and four public schools with a combined enrollment of 4,500 pupils.\n\nThe present action is but one of a series of steps undertaken by the town in an effort to regulate mining excavations within its limits. A 1945 ordinance, No. 16, provided that such pits must be enclosed by a wire fence and comply with certain berm and slope requirements. Although appellants complied with this ordinance, the town sought an injunction against further excavation as being violative of a zoning ordinance. This failed because appellants were found to be \"conducting a prior non-conforming use on the premises . . . .\" 135 N. Y. L. J., issue 52, p. 12 (1956). The town did not appeal. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 590, 592]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn 1958 the town amended Ordinance No. 16 to prohibit any excavating below the water table\n1\n and to impose an affirmative duty to refill any excavation presently below that level. The new amendment also made the berm, slope, and fence requirements more onerous.\n\nIn 1959 the town brought the present action to enjoin further mining by the appellants on the grounds that they had not complied with the ordinance, as amended, nor acquired a mining permit as required by it.\n2\n Appellants contended, inter alia, that the ordinance was unconstitutional because (1) it was not regulatory of their business but completely prohibitory and confiscated their property without compensation, (2) it deprived them of the benefit of the favorable judgment arising from the previous zoning litigation, and (3) it constituted ex post facto legislation. However, the trial court did not agree, and the appellants were enjoined from conducting further operations on the lot until they had obtained a permit and had complied with the new provisions of Ordinance No. 16.\n\nConcededly the ordinance completely prohibits a beneficial use to which the property has previously been devoted. However, such a characterization does not tell us whether or not the ordinance is unconstitutional. It is an oft-repeated truism that every regulation necessarily speaks as a prohibition. If this ordinance is otherwise a valid exercise of the town's police powers, the fact that it deprives the property of its most beneficial use does not render it unconstitutional. Walls v. Midland Carbon Co., \n254 \nU.S. 300\n (1920); Hadacheck v. Sebastian, 239 U.S. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 590, 593]\n\u00a0\n 394 (1915); Reinman v. Little Rock, \n237 \nU.S. 171\n (1915); Mugler v. Kansas, \n123 \nU.S. 623\n (1887); see Laurel Hill Cemetery v. San Francisco, \n216 \nU.S. 358\n (1910). As pointed out in Mugler v. Kansas, supra, at 668-669:\n\n\"[T]he present case must be governed by principles that do not involve the power of eminent domain, in the exercise of which property may not be taken for public use without compensation. A prohibition simply upon the use of property for purposes that are declared, by valid legislation, to be injurious to the health, morals, or safety of the community, cannot, in any just sense, be deemed a taking or an appropriation of property for the public benefit. Such legislation does not disturb the owner in the control or use of his property for lawful purposes, nor restrict his right to dispose of it, but is only a declaration by the State that its use by any one, for certain forbidden purposes, is prejudicial to the public interests. . . . The power which the States have of prohibiting such use by individuals of their property as will be prejudicial to the health, the morals, or the safety of the public, is not - and, consistently with the existence and safety of organized society, cannot be - burdened with the condition that the State must compensate such individual owners for pecuniary losses they may sustain, by reason of their not being permitted, by a noxious use of their property, to inflict injury upon the community.\"\n\n\n Nor is it of controlling significance that the \"use\" prohibited here is of the soil itself as opposed to a \"use\" upon the soil, cf. United States v. Central Eureka Mining Co., \n357 \nU.S. 155\n (1958), or that the use prohibited is arguably not a common-law nuisance, e. g., Reinman v. Little Rock, supra. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 590, 594]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThis is not to say, however, that governmental action in the form of regulation cannot be so onerous as to constitute a taking which constitutionally requires compensation. Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, \n260 \nU.S. 393\n (1922); see United States v. Central Eureka Mining Co., supra. There is no set formula to determine where regulation ends and taking begins. Although a comparison of values before and after is relevant, see Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, supra, it is by no means conclusive, see Hadacheck v. Sebastian, supra, where a diminution in value from $800,000 to $60,000 was upheld. How far regulation may go before it becomes a taking we need not now decide, for there is no evidence in the present record which even remotely suggests that prohibition of further mining will reduce the value of the lot in question.\n3\n Indulging in the usual presumption of constitutionality, infra, p. 596, we find no indication that the prohibitory effect of Ordinance No. 16 is sufficient to render it an unconstitutional taking if it is otherwise a valid police regulation.\n\nThe question, therefore, narrows to whether the prohibition of further excavation below the water table is a valid exercise of the town's police power. The term \"police power\" connotes the time-tested conceptional limit of public encroachment upon private interests. Except for the substitution of the familiar standard of \"reasonableness,\" this Court has generally refrained from announcing any specific criteria. The classic statement of the rule in Lawton v. Steele, \n152 \nU.S. 133, 137\n (1894), is still valid today:\n\n\"To justify the State in . . . interposing its authority in behalf of the public, it must appear, first, that \n\n[369 \nU.S. 590, 595]\n\u00a0\n the interests of the public . . . require such interference; and, second, that the means are reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the purpose, and not unduly oppressive upon individuals.\"\n\n\n Even this rule is not applied with strict precision, for this Court has often said that \"debatable questions as to reasonableness are not for the courts but for the legislature . . . .\" E. g., Sproles v. Binford, \n286 \nU.S. 374, 388\n (1932).\n\nThe ordinance in question was passed as a safety measure, and the town is attempting to uphold it on that basis. To evaluate its reasonableness we therefore need to know such things as the nature of the menace against which it will protect, the availability and effectiveness of other less drastic protective steps, and the loss which appellants will suffer from the imposition of the ordinance.\n\nA careful examination of the record reveals a dearth of relevant evidence on these points. One fair inference arising from the evidence is that since a few holes had been burrowed under the fence surrounding the lake it might be attractive and dangerous to children. But there was no indication whether the lake as it stood was an actual danger to the public or whether deepening the lake would increase the danger. In terms of dollars or some other objective standard, there was no showing how much, if anything, the imposition of the ordinance would cost the appellants. In short, the evidence produced is clearly indecisive on the reasonableness of prohibiting further excavation below the water table.\n\nAlthough one could imagine that preventing further deepening of a pond already 25 feet deep would have a de minimis effect on public safety, we cannot say that such a conclusion is compelled by facts of which we can take notice. Even if we could draw such a conclusion, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 590, 596]\n\u00a0\n we would be unable to say the ordinance is unreasonable; for all we know, the ordinance may have a de minimis effect on appellants. Our past cases leave no doubt that appellants had the burden on \"reasonableness.\" E. g., Bibb v. Navajo Freight Lines, \n359 \nU.S. 520, 529\n (1959) (exercise of police power is presumed to be constitutionally valid); Salsburg v. Maryland, \n346 \nU.S. 545, 553\n (1954) (the presumption of reasonableness is with the State); United States v. Carolene Products Co., \n304 \nU.S. 144, 154\n (1938) (exercise of police power will be upheld if any state of facts either known or which could be reasonably assumed affords support for it). This burden not having been met, the prohibition of excavation on the 20-acre-lake tract must stand as a valid police regulation.\n\nWe now turn our attention to the remainder of the lot, the 18 acres surrounding the present pit which have not yet been mined or excavated. Appellants themselves contend that this area cannot be mined. They say that this surface space is necessary for the processing operations incident to mining and that no other space is obtainable. This was urged as an important factor in their contention that upholding the depth limitation of the ordinance would confiscate the entire mining utility of their property. However, we have upheld the validity of the prohibition even on that supposition. If the depth limitation in relation to deepening the existing pit is valid, it follows a fortiori that the limitation is constitutionally permissible as applied to prevent the creation of new pits. We also note that even if appellants were able to obtain suitable processing space the geology of the 18-acre tract would prevent any excavation. The water table, appellants admit, is too close to the ground surface to permit commercial mining in the face of the depth restrictions of the ordinance. The impossibility of further mining \n\n[369 \nU.S. 590, 597]\n\u00a0\n makes it unnecessary for us to decide to what extent the berm and slope of such excavation could be limited by the ordinance.\n\nAppellants' other contentions warrant only a passing word. The claim that rights acquired in previous litigation are being undermined is completely unfounded. A successful defense to the imposition of one regulation does not erect a constitutional barrier to all other regulation. The first suit was brought to enforce a zoning ordinance, while the present one is to enforce a safety ordinance. In fact no relevant issues presented here were decided in the first suit.\n4\n We therefore do not need to consider to what extent such issues would have come under the protective wing of due process.\n\nAppellants also contend that the ordinance is unconstitutional because it imposes under penalty of fine and imprisonment such affirmative duties as refilling the existing excavation and the construction of a new fence. This claim is founded principally on the constitutional prohibitions against bills of attainder and ex post facto legislation.\n5\n These provisions are severable, both in nature and by express declaration, from the prohibition against further excavation. Since enforcement of these provisions was not sought in the present litigation, this Court under well-established principles will not at this time undertake to decide their constitutionality. E. g., Ohio Tax Cases, \n232 \nU.S. 576, 594\n (1914); cf. United States v. Raines, \n362 \nU.S. 17\n (1960). That \n\n[369 \nU.S. 590, 598]\n\u00a0\n determination must await another day. We pass only on the provisions of the ordinance here invoked, not on probabilities not now before us, and to that extent the judgment is\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the decision of this case.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Specifically the ordinance provides that \"[n]o excavation shall be made below two feet above the maximum ground water level at the site.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Under the ordinance the town may deny a permit if the proposed excavation will violate any of the provisions of the ordinance.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] There is a similar scarcity of evidence relative to the value of the processing machinery in the event mining operations were shut down.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Although it was adjudicated that at that time appellants had made substantial improvements on the lot, this fact would not be indicative of the loss appellants would presently suffer if the mine were closed; perhaps the improvements are commercially salable.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The appellee asserts that these grounds were not properly preserved below. Due to our disposition of these arguments, it is unnecessary to reach this question. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 590, 599]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","74":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGOLDLAWR, INC. v. HEIMAN(1962)\nNo. 101\nArgued: March 19, 1962Decided: April 30, 1962\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner brought this private antitrust action for treble damages and other relief under 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and 4 of the Clayton Act in a Federal District Court in Pennsylvania. On a motion to dismiss on grounds of improper venue and want of personal jurisdiction over the defendants, that Court found that venue was improperly laid as to two of the corporate defendants because they were not inhabitants of, \"found\" or transacting business in Pennsylvania; but, instead of dismissing the action, it used its authority under 28 U.S.C. 1406 (a) to transfer the case to the Southern District of New York, where venue was proper because the defendants could be found and transacted business there and personal jurisdiction over them could be obtained by service of process under 12. These two corporate defendants then moved the Federal District Court in New York to dismiss the action on the ground that the District Court in Pennsylvania did not have personal jurisdiction over them and, therefore, lacked power under 1406 (a) to transfer the action. Held: Section 1406 (a) is not limited to cases in which the transferring court has personal jurisdiction over the defendants, and the District Court in Pennsylvania acted within its authority.

With him on the brief was Richard B. Dannenberg. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 463, 464]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis private antitrust action for treble damages and other relief under 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act\n1\n and 4 of the Clayton Act\n2\n was brought by the petitioner against a number of defendants in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. After hearings on a motion to dismiss the action on grounds of improper venue and lack of personal jurisdiction over the defendants, the Pennsylvania District Court agreed that venue was improperly laid as to two of the corporate defendants\n3\n because they were neither inhabitants of, \"found\" nor transacting business in Pennsylvania, these being the alternative prerequisites for venue under 12 of the Clayton Act.\n4\n That court refused to dismiss the action as to these defendants, however, choosing instead to use its authority under 28 U.S.C. 1406 (a) to transfer it to the Southern District of New York where, because the defendants could be found and transacted business, venue was proper and personal jurisdiction could be obtained over them by service of process under 12. These two corporate defendants then appeared in the New York District Court and moved to have the case dismissed by that court on the ground that the Pennsylvania District Court had not had personal jurisdiction over them and, lacking such personal jurisdiction, it had not had power under 1406 (a) to transfer the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 463, 465]\n\u00a0\n action.\n5\n The New York District Court granted this motion on the ground asserted,\n6\n and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, with Judge Hincks dissenting, affirmed on the same ground.\n7\n Because this decision presented a conflict with the uniform course of decisions previously made on this same question by other Courts of Appeal,\n8\n we granted certiorari.\n9\n\u00a0\n\nSection 1406 (a), under which the Pennsylvania District Court transferred this case, provides:\n\n \"The district court of a district in which is filed a case laying venue in the wrong division or district shall dismiss, or if it be in the interest of justice, transfer such case to any district or division in which it could have been brought.\"\n\n\n Nothing in that language indicates that the operation of the section was intended to be limited to actions in which the transferring court has personal jurisdiction over the defendants. And we cannot agree that such a restrictive interpretation can be supported by its legislative history \n\n[369 \nU.S. 463, 466]\n\u00a0\n - either that relied upon by the Court of Appeals\n10\n or any other that has been brought to our attention. The problem which gave rise to the enactment of the section was that of avoiding the injustice which had often resulted to plaintiffs from dismissal of their actions merely because they had made an erroneous guess with regard to the existence of some elusive fact of the kind upon which venue provisions often turn. Indeed, this case is itself a typical example of the problem sought to be avoided, for dismissal here would have resulted in plaintiff's losing a substantial part of its cause of action under the statute of limitations merely because it made a mistake in thinking that the respondent corporations could be \"found\" or that they \"transact . . . business\" in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n11\n The language and history of 1406 (a), both as originally enacted\n12\n and as amended in 1949,\n13\n show a congressional purpose to provide as effective a remedy as possible to avoid precisely this sort of injustice.\n\nThe language of 1406 (a) is amply broad enough to authorize the transfer of cases, however wrong the plaintiff may have been in filing his case as to venue, whether the court in which it was filed had personal jurisdiction over the defendants or not. The section is thus in accord with the general purpose which has prompted many of the procedural changes of the past few years - that of removing whatever obstacles may impede an expeditious and orderly adjudication of cases and controversies \n\n[369 \nU.S. 463, 467]\n\u00a0\n on their merits. When a lawsuit is filed, that filing shows a desire on the part of the plaintiff to begin his case and thereby toll whatever statutes of limitation would otherwise apply. The filing itself shows the proper diligence on the part of the plaintiff which such statutes of limitation were intended to insure. If by reason of the uncertainties of proper venue a mistake is made, Congress, by the enactment of 1406 (a), recognized that \"the interest of justice\" may require that the complaint not be dismissed but rather that it be transferred in order that the plaintiff not be penalized by what the late Judge Parker aptly characterized as \"time-consuming and justice-defeating technicalities.\"\n14\n It would at least partially frustrate this enlightened congressional objective to import ambiguities into 1406 (a) which do not exist in the language Congress used to achieve the procedural reform it desired.\n\nThe Court of Appeals erred in upholding the District Court's order dismissing this action as to these two corporate defendants. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is accordingly\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the decision of this case.\n\nMR.

Heiman's motion was granted on this ground and on a second entirely independent ground. The Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal as to Heiman on both grounds and the petitioner did not seek certiorari as to the second and independent ground.

JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE STEWART joins, dissenting.\n\nThe notion that a District Court may deal with an in personam action in such a way as possibly to affect a defendant's substantive rights without first acquiring jurisdiction over him is not a familiar one in federal \n\n[369 \nU.S. 463, 468]\n\u00a0\n jurisprudence. No one suggests that Congress was aware that 28 U.S.C. 1406 (a) might be so used when it enacted that statute. The \"interest of justice\" of which the statute speaks and which the Court's opinion emphasizes in support of its construction of 1406 (a) is assuredly not a one-way street. And it is incongruous to consider, as the Court's holding would seem to imply, that in the \"interest of justice\" Congress sought in 1406 (a) to deal with the transfer of cases where both venue and jurisdiction are lacking in the district where the action is commenced, while neglecting to provide any comparable alleviative measures for the plaintiff who selects a district where venue is proper but where personal jurisdiction cannot be obtained.\n*\n\u00a0\n\nIn these circumstances I think the matter is better left for further action by Congress, preferably after the Judicial Conference of the United States has expressed its views on the subject. Cf. Miner v. Atlass, \n363 \nU.S. 641, 650\n-652. Meanwhile, substantially for the reasons elaborated in the opinion of Judge Moore, 288 F.2d 579, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] In an ordinary diversity suit, for example, a plaintiff may bring suit in the judicial district where he resides. 28 U.S.C. 1391 (a). But if he is unable to get personal service on the defendant in the territory defined by Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 4 (f), his suit will be dismissed. See Robertson v. Railroad Labor Board, \n268 \nU.S. 619\n; cf. Mississippi Publishing Corp. v. Murphree, \n326 \nU.S. 438, 442\n-443.

Graham for the Port of Seattle.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case is here on a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania which we granted (\n366 \nU.S. 943\n) because its decision (402 Pa. 411, 168 A. 2d 123) seemed to be in conflict with United States v. Causby, \n328 \nU.S. 256\n. The question is whether respondent \n\n[369 \nU.S. 84, 85]\n\u00a0\n has taken an air easement over petitioner's property for which it must pay just compensation as required by the Fourteenth Amendment. Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, \n166 \nU.S. 226, 241\n. The Court of Common Pleas, pursuant to customary Pennsylvania procedure, appointed a Board of Viewers to determine whether there had been a \"taking\" and, if so, the amount of compensation due. The Board of Viewers met upon the property; it held a hearing, and in its report found that there had been a \"taking\" by respondent of an air easement over petitioner's property and that the compensation payable (damages suffered) was $12,690. The Court of Common Pleas dismissed the exceptions of each party to the Board's report. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided, by a divided vote, that if there were a \"taking\" in the constitutional sense, the respondent was not liable.\n\nRespondent owns and maintains the Greater Pittsburgh Airport on land which it purchased to provide airport and air-transport facilities. The airport was designed for public use in conformity with the rules and regulations of the Civil Aeronautics Administration within the scope of the National Airport Plan provided for in 49 U.S.C. 1101 et seq. By this Act the federal Administrator is authorized and directed to prepare and continually revise a \"national plan for the development of public airports.\" 1102 (a). For this purpose he is authorized to make grants to \"sponsors\" for airport development. 1103, 1104. Provision is made for apportionment of grants for this purpose among the States. 1105. The applications for projects must follow the standards prescribed by the Administrator. 1108.\n\nIt is provided in 1108 (d) that: \"No project shall be approved by the Administrator with respect to any airport unless a public agency holds good title, satisfactory to the Administrator, to the landing area of such airport or the site therefore, or gives assurance satisfactory \n\n[369 \nU.S. 84, 86]\n\u00a0\n to the Administrator that such title will be acquired.\" The United States agrees to share from 50% to 75% of the \"allowable project costs,\" depending, so far as material here, on the class and location of the airport. 1109.\n\nAllowable costs payable by the Federal Government include \"costs of acquiring land or interests therein or easements through or other interests in air space . . . .\" 1112 (a) (2).\n\nRespondent executed three agreements with the Administrator of Civil Aeronautics in which it agreed, among other things, to abide by and adhere to the Rules and Regulations of C. A. A. and to \"maintain a master plan of the airport,\" including \"approach areas.\" It was provided that the \"airport approach standards to be followed in this connection shall be those established by the Administrator\"; and it was also agreed that respondent \"will acquire such easements or other interests in lands and air space as may be necessary to perform the covenants of this paragraph.\" The \"master plan\" laid out and submitted by respondent included the required \"approach areas\"; and that \"master plan\" was approved. One \"approach area\" was to the northeast runway. As designed and approved, it passed over petitioner's home which is 3,250 feet from the end of that runway. The elevation at the end of that runway is 1,150.50 feet above sea level; the door sill at petitioner's residence, 1,183.64 feet; the top of petitioner's chimney, 1,219.64 feet. The slope gradient of the approach area is as 40 is to 3,250 feet or 81 feet, which leaves a clearance of 11.36 feet between the bottom of the glide angle and petitioner's chimney.\n\nThe airlines that use the airport are lessees of respondent; and the leases give them, among other things, the right \"to land\" and \"take off.\" No flights were in violation of the regulations of C. A. A.; nor were any flights \n\n[369 \nU.S. 84, 87]\n\u00a0\n lower than necessary for a safe landing or take-off. The planes taking off from the northeast runway observed regular flight patterns ranging from 30 feet to 300 feet over petitioner's residence; and on let-down they were within 53 feet to 153 feet.\n\nOn take-off the noise of the planes is comparable \"to the noise of a riveting machine or steam hammer.\" On the let-down the planes make a noise comparable \"to that of a noisy factory.\" The Board of Viewers found that \"The low altitude flights over plaintiff's property caused the plaintiff and occupants of his property to become nervous and distraught, eventually causing their removal therefrom as undesirable and unbearable for their residential use.\" Judge Bell, dissenting below, accurately summarized the uncontroverted facts as follows:\n\n \"Regular and almost continuous daily flights, often several minutes apart, have been made by a number of airlines directly over and very, very close to plaintiff's residence. During these flights it was often impossible for people in the house to converse or to talk on the telephone. The plaintiff and the members of his household (depending on the flight which in turn sometimes depended on the wind) were frequently unable to sleep even with ear plugs and sleeping pills; they would frequently be awakened by the flight and the noise of the planes; the windows of their home would frequently rattle and at times plaster fell down from the walls and ceilings; their health was affected and impaired, and they sometimes were compelled to sleep elsewhere. Moreover, their house was so close to the runways or path of glide that as the spokesman for the members of the Airlines Pilot Association admitted `If we had engine failure we would have no course but to plow into your house.'\" 402 Pa. 411, 422, 168 A. 2d 123, 128-129. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 84, 88]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n We start with United States v. Causby, supra, which held that the United States by low flights of its military planes over a chicken farm made the property unusable for that purpose and that therefore there had been a \"taking,\" in the constitutional sense, of an air easement for which compensation must be made. At the time of the Causby case, Congress had placed the navigable airspace in the public domain, defining it as \"airspace above the minimum safe altitudes of flight prescribed\" by the C. A. A. 44 Stat. 574. We held that the path of the glide or flight for landing or taking off was not the downward reach of the \"navigable airspace.\" \n328 \nU.S., at 264\n. Following the decision in the Causby case, Congress redefined \"navigable airspace\" to mean \"airspace above the minimum altitudes of flight prescribed by regulations issued under this chapter, and shall include airspace needed to insure safety in take-off and landing of aircraft.\" 72 Stat. 739, 49 U.S.C. 1301 (24). By the present regulations\n1\n the \"minimum safe altitudes\" within the meaning of the statute are defined, so far as relevant here, as heights of 500 feet or 1,000 feet, \"[e]xcept where necessary for take-off or landing.\" But as we said in the Causby \n\n[369 \nU.S. 84, 89]\n\u00a0\n case, the use of land presupposes the use of some of the airspace above it. \n328 \nU.S., at 264\n. Otherwise no home could be built, no tree planted, no fence constructed, no chimney erected. An invasion of the \"superadjacent airspace\" will often \"affect the use of the surface of the land itself.\" \n328 \nU.S., at 265\n.\n\nIt is argued that though there was a \"taking,\" someone other than respondent was the taker - the airlines or the C. A. A. acting as an authorized representative of the United States. We think, however, that respondent, which was the promoter, owner, and lessor\n2\n of the airport, was in these circumstances the one who took the air easement in the constitutional sense. Respondent decided, subject to the approval of the C. A. A., where the airport would be built, what runways it would need, their direction and length, and what land and navigation easements would be needed. The Federal Government takes nothing; it is the local authority which decides to build an airport vel non, and where it is to be located. We see no difference between its responsibility for the air easements necessary for operation of the airport and its responsibility for the land on which the runways were built. Nor did the Congress when it designed the legislation for a National Airport Plan. For, as we have already noted, Congress provided in 49 U.S.C. 1109 for the payment to the owners of airports, whose plans were approved by the Administrator, of a share of \"the allowable project costs,\" including the \"costs of acquiring land or interests therein or easements through or other interests in air space.\" 1112 (a) (2). A county that designed and constructed a bridge would not have a usable facility unless it had at least an easement over the land necessary for the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 84, 90]\n\u00a0\n approaches to the bridge. Why should one who designs, constructs, and uses an airport be in a more favorable position so far as the Fourteenth Amendment is concerned? That the instant \"taking\" was \"for public use\" is not debatable. For respondent agreed with the C. A. A. that it would operate the airport \"for the use and benefit of the public,\" that it would operate it \"on fair and reasonable terms and without unjust discrimination,\" and that it would not allow any carrier to acquire \"any exclusive right\" to its use.\n\nThe glide path for the northeast runway is an necessary for the operation of the airport as is a surface right of way for operation of a bridge, or as is the land for the operation of a dam. See United States v. Virginia Electric Co., \n365 \nU.S. 624, 630\n. As stated by the Supreme Court of Washington in Ackerman v. Port of Seattle, 55 Wash. 2d 401, 413, 348 P.2d 664, 671, \". . . an adequate approach way is as necessary a part of an airport as is the ground on which the airstrip, itself, is constructed . . . .\" Without the \"approach areas,\" an airport is indeed not operable. Respondent in designing it had to acquire some private property. Our conclusion is that by constitutional standards it did not acquire enough.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Regulation 60.17, entitled \"Minimum safe altitudes,\" provides:\n\n\"Except when necessary for take-off or landing, no person shall operate an aircraft below the following altitudes:\n\n\n\"(a) Anywhere.

See Burton v. Wilmington Parking Auth., \n365 \nU.S. 715\n.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER concurs, dissenting.\n\nIn United States v. Causby,\n1\n the Court held that by flying its military aircraft frequently on low landing and takeoff flights over Causby's chicken farm the United States had so disturbed the peace of the occupants and so frightened the chickens that it had \"taken\" a flight easement from Causby for which it was required to pay \"just compensation\" under the Fifth Amendment. Today the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 84, 91]\n\u00a0\n Court holds that similar low landing and takeoff flights, making petitioner Griggs' property \"undesirable and unbearable for . . . residential use,\" constitute a \"taking\" of airspace over Griggs' property - not, however, by the owner and operator of the planes as in Causby, but by Allegheny County, the owner and operator of the Greater Pittsburgh Airport to and from which the planes fly. Although I dissented in Causby because I did not believe that the individual aircraft flights \"took\" property in the constitutional sense merely by going over it and because I believed that the complexities of adjusting atmospheric property rights to the air age could best be handled by Congress, I agree with the Court that the noise, vibrations and fear caused by constant and extremely low over-flights in this case have so interfered with the use and enjoyment of petitioner's property as to amount to a \"taking\" of it under the Causby holding. I cannot agree, however, that it was the County of Allegheny that did the \"taking.\" I think that the United States, not the Greater Pittsburgh Airport, has \"taken\" the airspace over Griggs' property necessary for flight.\n2\n While the County did design the plan for the airport, including the arrangement of its takeoff and approach areas, in order to comply with federal requirements it did so under the supervision of and subject to the approval of the Civil Aeronautics Administrator of the United States.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nCongress has over the years adopted a comprehensive plan for national and international air commerce, regulating in minute detail virtually every aspect of air transit - from construction and planning of ground facilities to \n\n[369 \nU.S. 84, 92]\n\u00a0\n safety and methods of flight operations.\n4\n As part of this overall scheme of development, Congress in 1938 declared that the United States has \"complete and exclusive national sovereignty in the air space above the United States\"\n5\n and that every citizen has \"a public right of freedom of transit in air commerce through the navigable air space of the United States.\"\n6\n Although in Causby the Court held that under the then existing laws and regulations the airspace used in landing and takeoff was not part of the \"navigable airspace\" as to which all have a right of free transit, Congress has since, in 1958, enacted a new law, as part of a regulatory scheme even more comprehensive than those before it, making it clear that the \"airspace needed to insure safety in take-off and landing of aircraft\" is \"navigable airspace.\"\n7\n Thus Congress has not only appropriated the airspace necessary for planes to fly at high altitudes throughout the country but has also provided the low altitude airspace essential for those same planes to approach and take off from airports. These airspaces are so much under the control of the Federal Government that every takeoff from and every landing at \n\n[369 \nU.S. 84, 93]\n\u00a0\n airports such as the Greater Pittsburgh Airport is made under the direct signal and supervisory control of some federal agent.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nIn reaching its conclusion, however, the Court emphasizes the fact that highway bridges require approaches. Of course they do. But if the United States Highway Department purchases the approaches to a bridge, the bridge owner need not. The same is true where Congress has, as here, appropriated the airspace necessary to approach the Pittsburgh airport as well as all the other airports in the country. Despite this, however, the Court somehow finds a congressional intent to shift the burden of acquiring flight airspace to the local communities in 49 U.S.C. 1112, which authorizes reimbursement to local communities for \"necessary\" acquisitions of \"easements through or other interests in airspace.\" But this is no different from the bridge-approach argument. Merely because local communities might eventually be reimbursed for the acquisition of necessary easements does not mean that local communities must acquire easements that the United States has already acquired. And where Congress has already declared airspace free to all - a fact not denied by the Court - pretty clearly it need not again be acquired by an airport. The \"necessary\" easements for which Congress authorized reimbursement in 1112 were those \"easements through or other interests in air space\" necessary for the clearing and protecting of \"aerial approaches\" from physical \"airport hazards\"\n9\n - a duty explicitly placed on the local communities by the statute ( 1110) and by their contract with the Government. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 84, 94]\n\u00a0\n There is no such duty on the local community to acquire flight airspace. Having taken the airspace over Griggs' private property for a public use, it is the United States which owes just compensation.\n\nThe construction of the Greater Pittsburgh Airport was financed in large part by funds supplied by the United States as part of its plan to induce localities like Allegheny County to assist in setting up a national and international air-transportation system. The Court's imposition of liability on Allegheny County, however, goes a long way toward defeating that plan because of the greatly increased financial burdens (how great one can only guess) which will hereafter fall on all the cities and counties which till now have given or may hereafter give support to the national program. I do not believe that Congress ever intended any such frustration of its own purpose.\n\nNor do I believe that Congress intended the wholly inequitable and unjust saddling of the entire financial burden of this part of the national program on the people of local communities like Allegheny County. The planes that take off and land at the Greater Pittsburgh Airport wind their rapid way through space not for the peculiar benefit of the citizens of Allegheny County but as part of a great, reliable transportation system of immense advantage to the whole Nation in time of peace and war. Just as it would be unfair to require petitioner and others who suffer serious and peculiar injuries by reason of these transportation flights to bear an unfair proportion of the burdens of air commerce, so it would be unfair to make Allegheny County bear expenses wholly out of proportion to the advantages it can receive from the national transportation system. I can see no justification at all for throwing this monkey wrench into Congress' finely tuned national transit mechanism. I would affirm the state court's judgment holding that the County of Allegheny has not \"taken\" petitioner's property.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \n328 \nU.S. 256\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] We are not called on to pass on any question of \"taking\" under the Pennsylvania Constitution or laws.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 60 Stat. 174-176, as amended, 49 U.S.C. 1108, 1110.

Held: The District Court's findings of fact relative to the existence of a demise charter were not clearly erroneous, and the Court of Appeals erred in reversing its judgment.

JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner, a longshoreman, was injured while unloading the M\/V Carib, of Dominican registry, when a shackle broke causing one of the ship's booms to fall upon and severely injure him. He brought this suit in admiralty to recover damages resulting from the unseaworthy condition of the ship. The libel was in rem against the Carib and in personam against respondent Pichirilo, her owner. The defense was that the Carib \n\n[369 \nU.S. 698, 699]\n\u00a0\n had been demised to petitioner's employer, Bordas & Company, at all times pertinent hereto, including the time when the unseaworthy condition arose. The United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, where the Carib lay, held against the ship and the respondent Pichirilo, finding there was no such demise, and judgment for $30,000 was awarded. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Carib was under a demise to petitioner's employer, which relieved the owner of personal responsibility for unseaworthiness, and that the Carib was not liable in rem because no personal responsibility could be visited upon either the owner or the charterer.\n1\n 290 F.2d 812. There being a conflict on the latter point between the Courts of Appeals, see Grillea v. United States, 232 F.2d 919 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1956), we granted certiorari, \n368 \nU.S. 895\n.\n2\n Concluding that the District Court's findings relative to the operative facts of a demise charter party were not clearly erroneous, we hold that the Court of Appeals erred in reversing its judgment.\n\nTo create a demise the owner of the vessel must completely and exclusively relinquish \"possession, command, and navigation\" thereof to the demisee. United States v. Shea, \n152 \nU.S. 178\n (1894); Leary v. United States, 14 Wall. 607 (1872); Reed v. United States, 11 Wall. 591 (1871). See generally Gilmore & Black, The Law of Admiralty, 215-219; Robinson, Admiralty, 593-601; Scrutton, Charterparties (16th ed., McNair & Mocatta), \n\n[369 \nU.S. 698, 700]\n\u00a0\n 4-7. It is therefore tantamount to, though just short of, an outright transfer of ownership. However, anything short of such a complete transfer is a time or voyage charter party or not a charter party at all. While a demise may bring about a change in the respective legal obligations of the owner and demisee, ibid., we need not decide here whether it relieves the owner of his traditional duty to maintain a seaworthy vessel, for under our view of the record the trial court's determination that there was no demise charter party must stand.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nThe owner who attempts to escape his normal liability for the unseaworthiness of his vessel on the ground that he has temporarily been relieved of this obligation has the burden of establishing the facts which give rise to such relief. Thus, assuming arguendo that a demise charter party would isolate the owner from liability, the owner has the burden of showing such a charter. This burden is heavy, for courts are reluctant to find a demise when the dealings between the parties are consistent with any lesser relationship. E. g., Reed v. United States, supra, at 601. To establish a demise the owner in the instant case offered only the testimony of the director-partner of the claimed demisee, petitioner's employer.\n4\n He testified that his company had complete control over and responsibility for the operation of the Carib, in consideration of which the owner was paid $200 monthly. He explained that his company's agreement with the owner was \"a kind of charter, because it does not comply with the regular provisions of a charter party. I pay the seamen, food, repair, maintenance, drydocking; which in a regular charter party are excluded.\" To negate the existence of a demise the petitioner offered the deposition \n\n[369 \nU.S. 698, 701]\n\u00a0\n of the Captain of the Carib, who testified simply that he was employed by the owner. On the basis of this evidence the trial court found that the owner \"was at all times mentioned in the libel . . . in possession and control of the vessel M\/V `CARIB.'\" In addition that court pointed out that the only witness offered to prove the existence of a demise had admitted there was no charter and that the Captain of the vessel had testified he was working for the owner, not Bordas & Co. The Court of Appeals in reversing thought the trial court had been misled as to the legal significance of the testimony and that this, as opposed to a refusal to believe the testimony of the owner's witness, had prompted it to conclude there was no charter.\n\nIt is true, as the Court of Appeals pointed out, that the equivocation by the witness for the owner on the nature of his company's arrangement is not inconsistent with the existence of a demise charter party, for the very elements he thought made the arrangement \"a kind of charter\" are inherent in a demise charter party. See authorities cited, p. 699, supra. And it is equally true the fact that the Captain is employed by the owner is not fatal to the creation of a demise charter party, for a vessel can be demised complete with captain if he is subject to the orders of the demisee during the period of the demise. United States v. Shea, supra, at 190; Robinson, op. cit., supra, 594-595. If we were convinced, as was the Court of Appeals, that the trial court's action was colored by a misunderstanding of such legal principles, we would have to remand, as the Court of Appeals should have, for further findings by the trial court on the credibility of the owner's witness. E. g., Kweskin v. Finkelstein, 223 F.2d 677, 679 (C. A. 7th Cir. 1955). However, we have concluded that the trial court clearly disbelieved the testimony offered by respondent to establish a demise charter party. The trial judge not only found that respondent \n\n[369 \nU.S. 698, 702]\n\u00a0\n was in complete possession and control of the vessel, which in and of itself indicates disbelief in the witness' testimony, but upon the conclusion of the trial pointedly stated that he did not \"believe that Bordas is the operator of the boat.\" This factual finding, rather than being tainted by an admission as to the legal relationship between the parties, appears to flow from the court's interpretation of the Captain's testimony. And to the extent this finding was based on such testimony, it cannot be said to have been influenced by an erroneous concept of a demise charter party. For as we read the record the Captain's testimony was sufficiently ambiguous for the trial court to reasonably construe it - as the court did - as saying he remained subject to the owner's control during the period of the alleged demise. Viewed in this light the testimony, of course, negates the existence of a demise. The determination of the factual content of ambiguous testimony is for the trial court, and such determination can be set aside on review only if \"clearly erroneous.\" United States v. National Association of Real Estate Boards, \n339 \nU.S. 485, 495\n-496 (1950).\n\nThe \"clearly erroneous\" rule of civil actions is applicable to suits in admiralty in general, McAllister v. United States, \n348 \nU.S. 19, 20\n (1954); see Roper v. United States, \n368 \nU.S. 20, 23\n (1961), and to the existence of the operative facts of a demise charter party in particular, Gardner v. The Calvert, 253 F.2d 395, 399 (C. A. 3d Cir. 1958). Under this rule an appellate court cannot upset a trial court's factual findings unless it \"is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\" United States v. United States Gypsum Co., \n333 \nU.S. 364, 395\n (1948). A refusal to credit the uncorroborated testimony of the director-partner, who obviously was not disinterested in the outcome of the litigation, would not be considered clearly erroneous. See, e. g., United States v. Oregon State Medical Society, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 698, 703]\n\u00a0\n \n343 \nU.S. 326, 339\n (1952); Mayer v. Zim Israel Navigation Co., 289 F.2d 562, 563 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1960). This is especially so when such testimony is prompted by leading questions as was the case here.\n5\n A fortiori the refusal to accept such testimony, disputed as it was by the testimony of the Captain, cannot be considered clearly erroneous.\n\nSince the trial court's determination that there was no demise charter party is not clearly erroneous, its holding that the owner is liable in personam and the vessel in rem must be reinstated. The case is therefore remanded to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings consistent with this opinion including the resolution of any questions it might have left unanswered on the assumption that there was no liability.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the decision of this case.\n\nMR.

The Yaka, 307 F.2d 203 (1962).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Similarly, we do not pass on whether the vessel can be held liable in rem when neither the demisee nor the owner is personally liable.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Our view of the case makes it unnecessary to determine whether a demise charter party can be created without a written document.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] At one point the judge interrupted the direct examination of the witness to point out he could not \"give any credit to a witness answering leading questions.\"\n\nMR.

COMMISSIONER(1962)\nNo. 224\nArgued: February 27, 1962Decided: May 21, 1962\n\n\n\n\n The Internal Revenue Code of 1939 permits a taxpayer to deduct, through amortization, the premium he has paid in purchasing corporate bonds, and 125 provides that the amount to be amortized \"shall be determined . . . with reference to the amount payable on maturity or on earlier call date.\" In 1953, prior to December 1, taxpayers purchased at a premium corporate bonds which were callable on 30 days' notice, either at a \"general call price\" or at a lower \"special call price,\" and elected on their 1953 income tax returns to claim deductions for bond premiums computed with reference to the 30-day call period and the special call price. Held: They were entitled to do so, since the special call price at which the bonds here involved could be redeemed from a limited sinking fund and from other special funds made available upon the occurrence of certain contingent events was an \"amount payable . . . on earlier call date\" within the meaning of 125, and there was no basis in the statute, in the legislative history or in the Commissioner's prior interpretations of the statute for a distinction between a reference to a general or special call price in computing amortizable bond premiums under the 1939 Code. Pp. 673-688.\n\n 289 F.2d 69, reversed.\n\nTheodore Tannenwald, Jr. argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the briefs was David Alter. Horace S. Manges was on the petition.\n\nStephen J. Pollak argued the cause for respondent. With him on the briefs were Solicitor General Cox, Assistant Attorney General Oberdorfer, Meyer Rothwacks, Douglas A. Kahn and Wayne G. Barnett.\n\nA brief urging reversal was filed by William Waller, as amicus curiae. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 672, 673]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nDespite the seemingly complex factual composition of the two cases consolidated herein,\n1\n this opinion deals with a relatively simple question of taxation: The extent to which a taxpayer may deduct, through amortization under the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, the premium he has paid in purchasing corporate bonds. In 1953, prior to December 1, the petitioners purchased fully taxable utility bonds at a premium above maturity value.\n2\n The bonds were callable at the option of the issuer at either a general or special call price, and at either price they were callable upon 30 days' notice. The term \"general call price\" is used to designate the price at which the issuer may freely and unconditionally redeem all or any portion of the outstanding bonds from its general funds. The lower, \"special call price,\" is the amount the issuer would pay if the bonds were redeemed with cash from certain specially designated funds.\n3\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 672, 674]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn computing net income, the 1939 Code permits a taxpayer to deduct, through amortization, the premium he has paid in purchasing corporate bonds.\n4\n Section 125 of the Code, set forth in pertinent part in the margin,\n5\n provides \n\n[369 \nU.S. 672, 675]\n\u00a0\n that the amount of bond premium to be amortized \"shall be determined . . . with reference to the amount payable on maturity or on earlier call date.\" Pursuant to this Section, the petitioners elected to claim on their 1953 income tax returns a deduction for bond premium amortization computed with reference to the special redemption price and to the 30-day redemption period appearing in the bond indentures. The respondent did not question the petitioners' use of the 30-day amortization period, but he disallowed the computation based upon the special redemption price and recomputed the amount of bond premium using the higher, general call price.\n6\n The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit \n\n[369 \nU.S. 672, 676]\n\u00a0\n affirmed the Tax Court's orders sustaining the Commissioner's deficiency determination. 289 F.2d 69. However, in cases presenting the identical legal issue, the Courts of Appeals for the Third (Evans v. Dudley, 295 F.2d 713) and Sixth (United States v. Parnell, 272 F.2d 943, affirming 187 F. Supp. 576) Circuits allowed amortization taken with reference to the special redemption prices.\n7\n To resolve this conflict, we granted certiorari. \n368 \nU.S. 812\n. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 672, 677]\n\u00a0\n\n\nBond premium is the amount a purchaser pays in buying a bond that exceeds the face or call value of the bond.\n8\n When a bond sells at a premium, it is generally because the interest it bears exceeds the rate of return on similar securities in the current market. For the right to receive this higher interest rate the purchaser of a bond pays a premium price when making the investment. However, interest is taxable to the recipient, and when a premium has been paid the actual interest received is not a true reflection of the bond's yield, but represents in part a return of the premium paid. It was to give effect to this principle that Congress in 1942 enacted Section 125 of the 1939 Code,\n9\n which for the first time provided for amortization of bond premium for tax purposes. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 672, 678]\n\u00a0\n\n\nBy providing that amortization could be taken with reference to the \"amount payable on maturity or on earlier call date\" (emphasis added), Congress recognized that bonds are generally subject to redemption by the issuer prior to their maturity. In electing to allow amortization with reference to the period the bonds might actually be outstanding, Congress, through the words to which we have lent emphasis, provided that a bondholder could amortize bond premium with reference to any date named in the indenture at which the bond might be called.\n10\n\u00a0\n\nA bond indenture might contain any number of possible call dates, but we need only to be concerned in this case with the issuer's right to call the bonds on 30 days' notice at either a general or special call price. Unquestionably, both general and special redemption provisions have a legitimate, though distinct, business purpose, and both were in widespread use well before the enactment of Section 125. The general call price is employed when the issuer finds that the current rate of interest on marketable securities is substantially lower than what it is paying on \n\n[369 \nU.S. 672, 679]\n\u00a0\n an outstanding issue. The issuer may then call the bonds at the general price and, following redemption, may refinance the obligation at the lower, prevailing rate of interest. In contrast, the provision for special funds from which bonds may be redeemed at the special call price, serves an entirely different purpose. Bond indentures normally require the issuer to protect the underlying security of the bonds by maintaining the mortgaged property and by insuring that its value is not impaired. This is done, first, through the maintenance of a special sinking fund, to which the issuer is obligated to make periodic payments, and, secondly, through the maintenance of other special funds, to which are added the proceeds from a sale or destruction of mortgaged property, or from its loss through a taking by eminent domain.\n11\n Although the issuer normally reserves an alternative to maintaining these special funds with cash, circumstances may dictate that the only attractive option from a business standpoint is the payment of cash and, to prevent the accumulation of this idle money, the indenture provides that the issuer may use it to redeem outstanding bonds at a special call price. It is evident that just as prevailing market conditions may render redemption at the special call price unlikely at a given time, the same or different market conditions may also cause redemption at the general call price equally unlikely,\n12\n particularly in an expanding \n\n[369 \nU.S. 672, 680]\n\u00a0\n industry such as utilities. During the period the petitioners held their bonds, none were called at either price, but the risk incurred that they would be called was present with equal force as to both the general and special call provisions. The market for bonds reflects that risk, and the Section of the Code we are asked to interpret takes cognizance of that market reality.\n\nTurning to the specific problem in the instant case, we are asked to determine whether the special price at which the bonds may be redeemed by the issuer from the limited sinking fund account and from the other special funds made available upon the occurrence of certain contingent events (see note 3, supra) is an \"amount payable . . . on earlier call date\" within the meaning of Section 125. For the reasons stated below, we answer this question affirmatively and hold that there is no basis either in the statute, in the legislative history, or in the respondent's own prior interpretations of the statute, for a distinction between reference to a general or special call price in computing amortizable bond premiums under the 1939 Code.\n\nFirst, we note that the Government has made certain important concessions which lighten considerably the task before us. It does not question the right of the petitioners to amortize bond premium with reference to the 30-day call period, nor does it question amortization to the general call price.\n13\n In addition, in requesting a rule \n\n[369 \nU.S. 672, 681]\n\u00a0\n which will apply to the \"generality of cases,\"\n14\n it professes to have abandoned its argument below which became the rationale of the Second Circuit in holding against the taxpayers, that the statute calls for an analysis into the \"likelihood of redemption\" before amortization at a special call price will be permitted.\n15\n Moreover, the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 672, 682]\n\u00a0\n Government does not contend that the transactions entered into by the petitioners were a sham without any business purpose except to gain a tax advantage.\n16\n Rather, the Government's position in this Court is that before an \"earlier call date\" is established with reference to the special call price, the taxpayer must show that \"there is an ascertainable date on which the issuer will become entitled to redeem [a particular] bond at its option.\" The Government asserts that it is not enough that the issuer has the right to call some bonds at the special redemption price. Rather, \"[i]t must have the right to call the particular bond for which amortization is claimed, for otherwise that bond has no `earlier call date.'\" The Government's primary reason for urging this interpretation of Section 125 is that the statute has created a tax loophole of major dimension that should be closed short of allowing the deduction sought in this case. While this assertion might have been persuasive in securing enactment of the amendments to the statute made subsequent to the time the transactions involved here took place (see discussion, infra), it may not, of course, have any impact upon our interpretation of the statute under review. We are bound by the meaning of the words used by Congress, taken in light of the pertinent legislative history. In neither do we find support for the Government's interpretation.\n\nThis Court was first called upon to construe Section 125 in 1950 in Commissioner v. Korell, \n339 \nU.S. 619\n. The \n\n[369 \nU.S. 672, 683]\n\u00a0\n taxpayer there had purchased bonds at a premium which reflected in large part not a higher yield of interest, but, rather, the attractiveness of the convertible feature of the bonds. The bonds were callable on 30 days' notice and the taxpayer amortized the premium accordingly. In contesting the deduction thus taken, the Commissioner contended that Section 125, in establishing a deduction for \"amortizable bond premium,\" did not include premium paid for the conversion privilege. In rejecting this contention, the Court made it clear that Section 125 was not enacted solely to enable a bondholder to amortize \"true premium,\" but that by \"the clear and precise avenue of expression actually adopted by the Congress\" (\n339 \nU.S., at 625\n), the legislation was adopted with \"no distinctions based upon the inducements for paying the premium.\" (Id., at 628.)\n\nThe decision in Korell led to congressional re-examination of Section 125, and the enactment of Section 217 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1950 (64 Stat. 906), which eliminated amortization of bond premiums attributable to a conversion feature. However, response to the Korell decision was specifically limited to the convertible bond situation; no further change was made in the statute which would reflect on its interpretation in the case before us.\n17\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 672, 684]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn 1954, in enacting the successor to Section 125, Section 171 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C., 1958 ed.), Congress again took cognizance of the tax benefit in question, and determined to eliminate the abuses inherent in permitting amortization with reference to 30-day call periods. Thus Congress further narrowed the loophole by providing that the premium on callable bonds could be amortized to the nearest call date only if such date was more than three years from the date of the original issue of the securities. With particular relevance to the Government's argument in the instant case, it is worthy of note that Congress understood the operation of the statute to the taxpayer's advantage, but limited correction of the abuses inherent in it to elimination of the quick write-off. The House Report accompanying H. R. 8300, which was to become the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, stated (H. R. Rep. No. 1337, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. 26):\n\n \"Under existing law, a bond premium may be amortized with reference to the amount payable on maturity or on earlier call date, at the election of the taxpayer. In the case of bonds with a very short call feature, such as those providing for call at any time on 30-day notice, the entire premium may be deducted in the year of purchase.\n\n\n \"This provision has given rise to tax-avoidance opportunities. Substantial bond issues have been made subject to a 30-day call, permitting the purchaser to take an immediate deduction for the entire premium against ordinary income. Where the call feature is nominal or inoperative this permits a \n\n[369 \nU.S. 672, 685]\n\u00a0\n deduction for an unreal loss, since the market value of the bonds ordinarily remains fairly stable over considerable periods. The bonds may then be resold after 6 months subject to long-term capital gain treatment. The writeoff of premium thus affords a gratuitous tax saving, equivalent to the conversion of a corresponding amount of ordinary income into capital gain. This process may be repeated indefinitely.\n\n\n \"To curb this type of abuse, your committee's bill provides that the premium on callable bonds may be amortized to the nearest call date only if such date is more than 3 years from the date of original issue of the securities. This provision will apply only to bonds issued after January 22, 1951, and acquired after January 22, 1954.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n Not only did Congress fail to make the distinction between general and special call provisions urged by the respondent, but it expressly recognized that deductions could be taken under Section 125 with reference to a call date that was \"nominal or inoperative.\" It did not remotely imply that a showing of a right to call all or any part of the outstanding bonds was necessary for operation of the statute. Furthermore, the change that it did adopt was to operate prospectively only.\n\nFinally, in 1958, by adoption of Section 13 of the Technical Amendments Act of 1958, 72 Stat. 1610, Congress eliminated entirely the right to amortize to call date, permitting amortization to be taken only over the period to maturity.\n18\n Again, the legislative change was prospective \n\n[369 \nU.S. 672, 686]\n\u00a0\n only and again no distinction was made with respect to general and special call dates or with respect to a right to call all or a part of the outstanding bonds.\n\nPersuasive evidence that we are correct in our interpretation of Section 125, as bolstered by its legislative history and subsequent amendments, may be found in the respondent's own prior construction of the statute. As is true with the language of the statute itself, the respondent's regulations contained not the slightest hint of the distinction urged upon us here. The Commissioner defined \"earlier call date\" in Treas. Reg. 118, 39.125 (b)-2 (see note 10, supra) as any call date prior to maturity, specified in the bond. The regulations in effect in 1953 give no support to the Government's present contention that the taxpayer must show an unconditional right in the issuer to call the outstanding bonds at a particular redemption price before amortization with reference to that price would be permitted. Furthermore, although the petitioners are not entitled to rely upon unpublished private rulings which were not issued specifically to them,\n19\n such rulings do reveal the interpretation put upon the statute by the agency charged with the responsibility of administering the revenue laws. And, because the Commissioner ruled, in letters addressed to taxpayers requesting them, that amortization with reference to a special call price was proper under the statute,\n20\n we have \n\n[369 \nU.S. 672, 687]\n\u00a0\n further evidence that our construction of allowable bond premium amortization is compelled by the language of the statute.\n21\n\u00a0\n\nA firmly established principle of statutory interpretation is that \"the words of statutes - including revenue acts - should be interpreted where possible in their ordinary, everyday senses.\" Crane v. Commissioner, \n331 \nU.S. 1, 6\n.\n22\n The statute in issue here, in plain and ordinary language, evidences a clear congressional intent to allow amortization with reference to any call date named in the indenture. Under such circumstances we are not at liberty, notwithstanding the apparent tax-saving windfall bestowed upon taxpayers, to add to or alter the words employed to effect a purpose which does not appear on the face of the statute. Moreover, the legislative history, too, is persuasive evidence that the statute, as it appeared \n\n[369 \nU.S. 672, 688]\n\u00a0\n in 1953 when these deductions were taken, allowed the deduction refused these taxpayers. Simply stated, an informed Congress enacted Section 125 with full realization of the existence and operation of special call provisions, but chose not to make any distinction between them and general redemption rights. Neither did the Commissioner. Nevertheless, the Government now urges this Court to do what the legislative branch of the Government failed to do or elected not to do. This, of course, is not within our province.\n23\n\u00a0\n\n    The judgments are reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the decision of this case.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] We have before us two cases which originated in the Tax Court: Estate of Gourielli v. Commissioner, 33 T. C. 357, and Goldfarb v. Commissioner, 33 T. C. 568. The cases were consolidated on appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and one opinion was filed by that court. Estate of Gourielli v. Commissioner, 289 F.2d 69. Petitioner Hanover Bank is the executor of the estate of Mr. Gourielli, who passed away since the commencement of this action.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The bonds involved in the Gourielli case were Appalachian Electric Power Company, 1981 series, bonds, which decedent and his wife purchased for $117.50 per $100 face value, and which were later sold for $115.50. The bonds in Goldfarb were Arkansas Power & Light Company, 30-year, Eighth Series, bonds, which petitioners purchased at an average price of $110.50 per $100 face amount, and which were later sold at an average price of $105.40. The total purchases in the two cases were $540,000 (Gourielli) and $500,000 (Goldfarb) face amount; the purchase prices were paid in cash in both cases.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] In addition to a \"sinking fund\" into which the indenture required Appalachian to deposit during each annual period an amount (in \n\n[369 \nU.S. 672, 674]\n\u00a0\n cash or property additions of an equivalent amount) equal to one percent of the bond issue, the special funds in the case of the Appalachian bonds were: (1) a released property and insurance fund, to which deposits were required only upon a loss by casualty or by a release of mortgaged properties securing the bonds; and (2) a maintenance fund, to which deposits were required only when Appalachian failed to expend a stated percentage of its revenues on maintenance or improvements. The special funds in the case of the Arkansas bonds were made up from the same type contributions as above, plus additions made to an eminent domain fund if and when mortgaged property was taken from the company by eminent domain proceedings.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Internal Revenue Code of 1939 (26 U.S.C., 1952 ed.):\n\n\"SEC. 23. DEDUCTIONS FROM GROSS INCOME.\n\n\n\"In computing net income there shall be allowed as deductions:\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n\n\"(v) [as added by 126 (a), Revenue Act of 1942, c. 619, 56 Stat. 798] BOND PREMIUM DEDUCTION. - In the case of a bondholder, the deduction for amortizable bond premium provided in section 125.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] This Section was also added by the Revenue Act of 1942, supra, note 4, 126 (b). Entitled \"Amortizable Bond Premium,\" it reads in pertinent part as follows:\n\n\"(a) GENERAL RULE. - In the case of any bond, as defined in subsection (d), the following rules shall apply to the amortizable bond premium (determined under subsection (b)) on the bond for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1941:\n\n.  .  .  .  .\n\n\n\n\"(b) AMORTIZABLE BOND PREMIUM. -\n\n\n\"(1) AMOUNT OF BOND PREMIUM. - For the purposes of paragraph (2), the amount of bond premium, in the case of the holder of any bond, shall be determined with reference to the amount of the basis (for determining loss on sale or exchange) of such bond, and with reference to the amount payable on maturity or on earlier call date, with adjustments proper to reflect unamortized bond premium with respect to the bond, for the period prior to the date as of which \n\n[369 \nU.S. 672, 675]\n\u00a0\n subsection (a) becomes applicable with respect to the taxpayer with respect to such bond.\n\n\n\"(2) AMOUNT AMORTIZABLE. - The amortizable bond premium of the taxable year shall be the amount of the bond premium attributable to such year.\n\n\n\"(3) METHOD OF DETERMINATION. - The determinations required under paragraphs (1) and (2) shall be made -\n\n\n\"(A) in accordance with the method of amortizing bond premium regularly employed by the holder of the bond, if such method is reasonable;\n\n\n\"(B) in all other cases, in accordance with regulations prescribing reasonable methods of amortizing bond premium, prescribed by the Commissioner with the approval of the Secretary.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] At the time of the deduction in Gourielli, the schedule appearing in the Appalachian bond indenture provided that the bonds could be redeemed at a general call price of 105 3\/8 or a special call price of 102 3\/8. The petitioners' basis was $117.50 (see supra, note 2) and therefore amortization of premium with reference to the two prices would result in a deduction of $64,831.07 or $83,056.07, respectively. The difference in these amounts, $18,225.00, was the amount disallowed by the respondent. By a similar recomputation with reference to the schedule of redemption prices appearing in the Arkansas bond indenture (105.36 as compared to 101.36), the respondent reduced the deduction in Goldfarb by $27,175.00. The actual tax deficiency in each case was considerably less ($14,200.92 and $14,708.16, respectively), of course, because disallowance of the larger premium \n\n[369 \nU.S. 672, 676]\n\u00a0\n resulted in a corresponding increase in the petitioners' basis which had been adjusted pursuant to Section 113 (b) (1) (H) of the Code when the premium was amortized. This increase in basis resulted in a smaller short-term capital gain (the petitioners held the bonds less than six months) than had been reported by petitioners in their 1953 returns. The decrease in tax due on the capital gain was offset against the amount of amortization disallowed to arrive at the petitioners' actual tax deficiencies in issue here.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] In addition to the Third and Sixth Circuits' cases, the First and Seventh Circuits have also allowed deductions of bond premium amortization taken with reference to special redemption prices. In the First Circuit: Fabreeka Products Co. v. Commissioner, 294 F.2d 876, vacating and remanding 34 T. C. 290; Sherman v. Commissioner, 34 T. C. 303; and Friedman v. Commissioner, 34 T. C. 456. In the Seventh Circuit: Gallun v. Commissioner, 297 F.2d 455, reversing 1960 P-H T. C. Memo. Dec. \u00a7 60,104; and Maysteel Products, Inc., v. Commissioner, 287 F.2d 429, reversing 33 T. C. 1021. In each of these cases the taxpayer had purchased bonds at a premium, amortized that premium to the special call price, and thereafter made a distribution of the bonds which entailed a double tax deduction (e. g., a gift to charity). In each case the Court of Appeals allowed the double deduction. Although the precise issue presented in the instant case was not expressly decided in these latter cases, due to the fact that the Commissioner did not choose to challenge the use of the special call price as against the general call price for determining the amount of the premium, the allowance of the amortization to the special redemption price impliedly places the First and Seventh Circuits in accord with the Third and Sixth Circuits.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] See the authorities collected in Commissioner v. Korell, \n339 \nU.S. 619, 627\n, n. 10. The Court in Korell, a case also involving an interpretation of Section 125 (see discussion, pp. 682-683, infra), concluded (\n339 \nU.S., at 627\n): \"We adopt the view that `bond premium' in 125 means any extra payment, regardless of the reason therefor . . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Commissioner v. Korell, \n339 \nU.S. 619, 621\n. See 1 Hearings before House Committee on Ways and Means on Revenue Revision of 1942, 77th Cong., 2d Sess. 90 (1942). The House Committee noted the recommendation made in the hearings that the difference between yield and the actual interest rate be treated as a return of capital and not as a capital loss (H. R. Rep. No. 2333, 77th Cong., 2d Sess. 47):\n\n\"Under existing law, bond premium is treated as a capital loss sustained by the owner of the bond at the time of disposition or maturity and periodical payments on the bond at the nominal or coupon rate are treated in full as interest. The want of statutory recognition of the sound accounting practice of amortizing premium leads to incorrect tax results which in many instances are so serious that provision should be made for their avoidance.\"\n\n\n However, in rejecting the Government's argument in Korell, supra, that Congress intended to confine the deduction only to premium paid for a higher-than-market interest rate, the Court stated (\n339 \nU.S., at 626\n-627):\n\n\"At most, [the Commissioner's] presentation of the legislative materials suggests that Congress may have had the bondholder who was \n\n[369 \nU.S. 672, 678]\n\u00a0\n seeking a higher interest rate primarily in mind; but it does not establish that Congress in fact legislated with reference to him exclusively. [Citation omitted.] Congress, and the Treasury in advising Congress, may well have concluded that the best manner of affording him relief and correcting the inequitable treatment of bondholders whose interest receipts were taxable, was to define the scope of the amendment by reference to types of bonds rather than causes of premium payment.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Congress' intent in this regard was expressly noted by the respondent in enacting Treas. Reg. 118, 39.125 (b)-2:\n\n\"Callable and convertible bonds. (a) The fact that a bond is callable . . . does not, in itself, prevent the application of section 125. . . . The earlier call date may be the earliest call date specified in the bond as a day certain, the earliest interest payment date if the bond is callable at such date, the earliest date at which the bond is callable at par, or such other call date, prior to maturity, specified in the bond as may be selected by the taxpayer. . . .\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] See generally Evans v.

In fact, the petitioners point out in their brief here that in recent years more bonds have been called at the special redemption price than at the general price. See also Evans v. Dudley, 295 F.2d 713, 716.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] Allowing a 30-day amortization period is in accord with the decision of the Court in Korell where, although the point was not argued by the Government, the taxpayer had amortized the premium \n\n[369 \nU.S. 672, 681]\n\u00a0\n with reference to the 30-day period provided in the indenture. In its brief in the instant case the Government states:\n\n\". . . [W]e concede that it is now too late to challenge the amortization of the premium on bonds subject to an unlimited right of redemption on 30 days' notice. Not only has the consistent administrative practice, culminating in a published ruling, been to allow such amortization, but Congress, in narrowing such deductions in the 1954 Code and prohibiting them entirely after 1957, expressly acknowledged that the prior law permitted that treatment. . . . Accordingly, we did not challenge in the lower courts and do not challenge here petitioners' right to amortization of the premium on the basis of the general right of the issuer to redeem the bonds at any time upon 30 days' notice.\"\n\n\n See also Int. Rev. Rul. 56-398, 1956-2 Cum. Bull. 984, where the respondent, in a published ruling, acquiesced in a 30-day amortization period under the 1939 Code.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] This concession also conforms to the pronouncement in Korell (\n339 \nU.S., at 625\n): \"Congress was legislating for the generality of cases.\" See also Evans v. Dudley, 295 F.2d 713, 716; Parnell v. United States, 187 F. Supp. 576, 579, aff'd, 272 F.2d 943.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit stated (289 F.2d 69, 74): \"We do not think that . . . in 125 of the Code . . . [Congress] meant to include an amount payable on a call at a `special' price of which there was no real possibility during the period for which the amortization is being taken and the deduction claimed.\" And (289 F.2d, at 72): \". . . [T]he hazard that any significant number of petitioners' bonds would be called during [the] period was infinitesimal.\" In so holding, the Court accepted the Government's argument below that \"[t]he taxpayer is not entitled to compute his amortizable bond premium deduction . . . with reference to the `special' call price . . . because . . . such a call was so contingent and unlikely that there was no realistic call date at the `special' call price . . . .\"\n\nIn contrast, the Government states in its brief here: \". . . [O]ur position is not dependent upon the particular market conditions or \n\n[369 \nU.S. 672, 682]\n\u00a0\n the actual probabilities that a right of redemption will be exercised. . . . [W]e agree with petitioners that the question . . . should not be dependent upon a finding in each case of the actual `likelihood' that any particular redemption right will be exercised.\" As to the futility in attempting to apply a \"likelihood of redemption\" standard, see note 12, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] Cf. Knetsch v. United States, \n364 \nU.S. 361\n; Gregory v. Helvering, \n293 \nU.S. 465\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] The legislation simply provided:\n\n\"In no case shall the amount of bond premium of a convertible bond include any amount attributable to the conversion features of the bond.\"\n\n\n Where, as in the case before us, a question of interpretation of Section 125 is presented lying outside the scope of the 1950 Amendment, Korell retains its full vitality. Thus, it is worth noting that the Government's \"right to call\" approach advocated in the case at bar would result in a sub silentio overruling of Korell to the extent that in the latter case the right of the bondholder to exercise his conversion option at any time through the expiration of the notice period of a call defeated completely the issuer's \"right\" to call and redeem \n\n[369 \nU.S. 672, 684]\n\u00a0\n even a single bond. In the instant case, however, neither party disputes the fact that at least some of the bonds could have been called at the special price and that if the issuer exercised his right so to call them the bondholder would have had no choice but to turn over the bonds and forfeit the premium paid for them.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] The 1958 Amendment literally permits amortization to an earlier call date but only if it results in a smaller amortization deduction than would amortization to maturity, which, for all practical purposes, effectively eliminates the privilege of calling to an earlier call date.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] See, e. g., Commissioner v. P. G. Lake, Inc., \n356 \nU.S. 260, 265\n-266, n. 5; Automobile Club v. Commissioner, \n353 \nU.S. 180\n; Helvering v. New York Trust Co., \n292 \nU.S. 455, 467\n-468.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] For example, the record in the instant case contains a copy of the following letter to a taxpayer from the respondent's office (we quote the relevant portion):\n\n\"Gentlemen:\n\n.   .   .   .  .\n\n\n\n\"The Appalachian Electric Power Company 3 3\/4% bonds, 1981 Series, are callable in whole or in part through May of 1953 at 105 5\/8. They are also callable for sinking fund through funds derived from \n\n[369 \nU.S. 672, 687]\n\u00a0\n maintenance or sale of property at any time upon thirty days notice through May 31, 1954 at 102 3\/8. You request to be advised whether the above-mentioned ruling of July 30, 1952, means that such bonds may be amortized down to 102 3\/8 or whether it means that they can only be amortized down to 105 5\/8 through May of 1953.\n\n\n\"Upon the basis of the information on file in this office, it is the opinion of this office that a taxpayer electing to amortize the premium on Appalachian Electric Power Company bonds in accordance with section 125 of the Code may use the regular redemption price of 105 5\/8 or the special redemption price of 102 3\/8.\n\n    \"Very truly yours, [etc.] . . .\"\n\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 21\n] In 1956, three years after the deductions in the present case were taken, the Commissioner - reversing the position he had previously and uniformly adhered to in a series of private rulings - for the first time announced that amortization of bond premium under Section 125 of the 1939 Code was to be limited to premium in excess of a general call price and could not include premium in excess of a lower special call price, except where an actual call was made at the latter price.

CHERRY MEAT PACKERS(1962)\nNo. 435\nArgued: Decided: December 17, 1962\n\n\n\n\n A Federal District Court rendered a judgment against petitioner, a defunct corporation, and denied a motion for a new trial while its general counsel, to whom had been delegated sole responsibility for all corporate decisions with respect to pending litigation, was in Mexico and could not be reached. Within the 30-day period for appeal permitted under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 73 (a), petitioner's local counsel applied to the District Court for an extension of time within which to appeal. The District Court granted an extension of two weeks, and notice of appeal was filed within that time. The Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal, on the ground that no showing of \"excusable neglect based on a failure of a party to learn of the entry of the judgment,\" within the meaning of Rule 73 (a), had been made to the District Court, that there was no basis for waiving the 30-day rule and that, therefore, the appeal was untimely filed. Held: Since petitioner had relied on the District Court's ruling extending the time within which to appeal and petitioner would suffer a hardship if it were set aside, the Court of Appeals should have let it stand. Pp. 215-217.\n\n 303 F.2d 609, judgment vacated and case remanded.\n\nHarlan L. Hackbert for petitioner.\n\nJohn J. Kelly, Jr. for respondent.\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\nThe petition for writ of certiorari is granted and the judgment is vacated. Petitioner, a presently defunct interstate motor carrier which had its principal place of business in California, sued respondent, a shipper, in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois for underpayment of freight charges. Respondent counterclaimed for damages to its freight. Local trial counsel was engaged for the suit by petitioner's general counsel in \n\n[371 \nU.S. 215, 216]\n\u00a0\n Los Angeles. The trial court ultimately dismissed petitioner's complaint and entered judgment for respondent for $11,347.52 on its counterclaim. Petitioner filed a motion for new trial, which was denied on June 28, 1961. On that date petitioner's general counsel, who by virtue of the fact that petitioner was winding up its business during 1961 had been delegated sole responsibility for all corporate decisions with respect to pending litigation, was vacationing in Mexico and could not be reached. He did not return to this country until July 20. In view of trial counsel's inability to contact the general counsel in order to ask whether to appeal, he instead came before the District Court in Illinois on July 13, stated his problem, and asked for an extension of time within which to appeal beyond the 30-day limit prescribed by Fed. Rules Civ. Proc., 73 (a), an extension which by the terms of the rule is limited to a period \"not exceeding 30 days from the expiration of the original time herein prescribed.\" Opposing counsel, having been given notice, was present. The motion judge granted an extra two weeks, until August 11. Notice of appeal was filed on August 11. The Court of Appeals initially denied a motion of respondent to dismiss the appeal, and called for briefs on the merits. The court thereafter reconsidered and dismissed the appeal, holding that a showing of \"excusable neglect based on a failure of a party to learn of the entry of the judgment,\" Fed. Rules Civ. Proc., 73 (a), had not been made out to the motion judge, that there was hence no basis for waiving the 30-day limit, and that the appeal was untimely filed and had to be dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 303 F.2d 609.\n\nThe District Court properly entertained the motion here in question to extend petitioner's time to appeal to the Court of Appeals before the initial 30 days allowed for docketing the appeal had elapsed. Fed. Rules Civ. Proc., 73 (a), which governs here, is not limited to motions \n\n[371 \nU.S. 215, 217]\n\u00a0\n made after the 30 days have expired. See 7 Moore, Federal Practice (2d ed. 1955), \u00a7 73.093.; North Umberland Mining Co. v. Standard Acc. Ins. Co., 193 F.2d 951, 952 (C. A. 9th Cir. 1952); Plant Economy, Inc., v. Mirror Insulation Co., 308 F.2d 275, 276-277 (C. A. 3d Cir. 1962). The standard applicable on such a motion, whether it is made before or after the 30 days have run, is that the movant must show \"excusable neglect based on a failure of a party to learn of the entry of the judgment,\" Fed. Rules Civ. Proc., 73 (a). Compare 7 Moore, supra, \u00a7 73.093.; Notes of Advisory Committee on 1946 Amendments to Rule 73 (a), quoted in 7 Moore, supra, \u00a7 73.015., at p. 3111; Knowles v. United States, 260 F.2d 852, 854 (C. A. 5th Cir. 1958). In view of the obvious great hardship to a party who relies upon the trial judge's finding of \"excusable neglect\" prior to the expiration of the 30-day period and then suffers reversal of the finding, it should be given great deference by the reviewing court. Whatever the proper result as an initial matter on the facts here, the record contains a showing of unique circumstances sufficient that the Court of Appeals ought not to have disturbed the motion judge's ruling. The judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals so that petitioner's appeal may be heard on its merits.\n\nMR.

FREIGHT-WAYS(1962)\nNo. 37\nArgued: October 11, 1962Decided: November 19, 1962\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner brought a common law action in a Federal District Court against respondent, a common carrier by motor vehicle, to recover the difference between charges made by respondent at its established interstate rate and lower charges established by its intrastate rate on shipments from Buffalo, N. Y., to New York City. Petitioner alleged that it made the shipments without specifying the routes and that respondent violated its duty by shipping the goods over its established interstate route at its higher rate rather than over its established intrastate route at its lower rate. The Interstate Commerce Commission found that the practice was unreasonable. Held: The complaint stated a cause of action upon which relief could be granted, and such right of action was saved by 216 (j) of the Motor Carrier Act. T. I. M. E. Inc. v. United States, \n359 \nU.S. 464\n, distinguished. Pp. 84-89.\n\n 293 F.2d 205, reversed.\n\nHarry Teichner argued the cause and filed briefs for petitioner.\n\nWilfred R. Caron argued the cause for respondent. With him on the briefs was Milton D. Goldman.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis is an action by a shipper to recover from a motor carrier the difference in rate charges resulting from a practice of the latter of carrying unrouted intrastate shipments on its interstate routes at higher rates than those applicable to its available intrastate routes. The District Court for the Southern District of New York stayed the action awaiting a finding by the Interstate Commerce Commission \n\n[371 \nU.S. 84, 85]\n\u00a0\n as to the reasonableness of the practice. The Commission found it unreasonable\n*\n under the Motor Carrier Act, 49 U.S.C. 301-327, and subsequently the District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that the Act neither provided any reparation remedy nor preserved one at common law. 187 F. Supp. 722. The Court of Appeals, one judge dissenting, affirmed on the same grounds. 293 F.2d 205. Each court bottomed its decision upon T. I. M. E. Inc. v. United States, \n359 \nU.S. 464\n (1959). Having some doubts as to the appositeness of that case and because of the importance of the question in the administration of the Act, we granted certiorari. \n368 \nU.S. 951\n. We have concluded that T. I. M. E. Inc., supra, does not control the issue here and therefore reverse the judgments. \n\n[371 \nU.S. 84, 86]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe petitioner alleges that between January 1, 1953, and February 1, 1955, it delivered numerous shipments of foam rubber pads to respondent, a common carrier by motor vehicle, for transportation from Buffalo, N. Y., to New York City. It claims that while the shipments were tendered without specifying the routes of shipment the respondent, contrary to its duty as a common carrier, shipped the pads over its interstate route at the higher tariff that it had on file with the Interstate Commerce Commission rather than over its intrastate route at the lower tariff that it had on file with the Public Service Commission of New York. Excess charges in the sum of $10,000 have been collected by respondent for which petitioner prays judgment.\n\nThe sole issue before us is whether the complaint states a cause of action upon which the District Court may grant relief. The gist of the action as alleged is that the shipper had the common-law right and the carrier owed it the duty to ship the pads over the cheapest available route, no adequate justification for not so doing being shown. Nevertheless, petitioner says, the carrier in derogation of this responsibility transported the pads at the higher rate and subjected the shipper to the $10,000 damage.\n\nNo attack is made upon either of the carrier's published tariffs - both are admittedly reasonable. The controversy hinges entirely upon whether the carrier violated its duty to the shipper in selecting the interstate route and the accompanying higher rate which subjected the shipper to the loss, i. e., the difference between the two lawful rates. We believe that the complaint stated a justiciable cause of action. The issue here is a far cry from that in T. I. M. E. Inc. v. United States, supra. There the question, as stated by the Court, was, \"Can a shipper of goods by a certificated motor carrier challenge \n\n[371 \nU.S. 84, 87]\n\u00a0\n in post-shipment litigation the reasonableness of the carrier's charges which were made in accordance with the tariff governing the shipment?\" \n359 \nU.S. 464, 465\n. The Court determined that such an attack was foreclosed by the \"saving clause\" of the Act, 216 (j), 49 U.S.C. 316 (j), as being inconsistent with the statutory scheme of regulation. We emphasized the built-in protections given shippers against unreasonable rates, at pp. 478-480, citing the 30-day-notice provision of the Act, 217 (c), as well as the power granted the Commission under 216 (g) to suspend rates for seven months. The Court concluded that those remedies amply protected the shipper and that the allowance of a judicial remedy would result in undercutting the stability of the rate structure which the statutory procedures sought to insure.\n\nHere the challenge is directed not at the \"reasonableness\" of the rates but at the carrier's misrouting practice. The question, therefore, is not one of rates but of routes. The determination of rail carriers' routing practices has long been within the primary jurisdiction of the Commission. Northern Pacific R. Co. v. Solum, \n247 \nU.S. 477\n (1918). This jurisdiction is the more important in the case of motor carrier routing where alternative routes are greater in both number and variety. Furthermore, selection of the route is usually made on an ad hoc basis, precluding preshipment determination of its reasonableness. Unlike rate making there is no statutory procedure by which routing practices may be challenged in advance of shipment. Nor is the shipper by truck accorded even the right given the shipper by rail, under 49 U.S.C. 15 (8), to select and request a particular route of the carrier. In view of these weighty statutory differences between rate making and routing practices the survival of a damage claim for misrouting appears entirely consistent with the Act. It, therefore, meets the proviso of the \"saving clause\" as well as the teaching of T. I. M. E. Inc. \n\n[371 \nU.S. 84, 88]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThis conclusion is buttressed by the fact that the allowance here of a damage action nowise hampers the efficient administration of the Act, unlike the allowance of such an action as to unreasonable rates. A misrouting claim does not jeopardize the stability of tariffs or of certificated routes, the sole issue being whether the carrier routed the shipment over the cheapest available route, or made a showing of adequate justification for not doing so. Moreover, the allowance of misrouting actions would have a healthy deterrent effect upon the utilization of misrouting practices in the motor carrier field, which, in turn, would minimize \"cease and desist\" proceedings before the Commission. Finally, and not to be overlooked, the absence of any judicial remedy places the shipper entirely at the mercy of the carrier, contrary to the overriding purpose of the Act. The allowance of such actions would, on the contrary, give neither an unfair advantage.\n\nThose who contend that no judicial remedy is available place much weight on the fact that, as we have said, the Interstate Commerce Commission has primary jurisdiction in routing practices. We put no significance in whether one tags the claim as \"overcharges\" as Commissioner Eastman apparently did in his testimony before the Senate, see T. I. M. E. Inc., supra, at 477-478, n. 18, or whether it is a proceeding involving the \"reasonableness\" of routing practices. In either case the problem is one originally within the jurisdiction of the Commission. To say, however, that such primary jurisdiction compels the conclusion that the courts are without power to award damages in every instance where the Commission may not award reparations by no means follows. Indeed, the doctrine of primary jurisdiction is designed to apply \"where a claim is originally cognizable in the courts, and . . . enforcement of the claim requires the resolution of issues . . . placed within the special competence of an \n\n[371 \nU.S. 84, 89]\n\u00a0\n administrative body . . . .\" United States v. Western Pacific R. Co., \n352 \nU.S. 59, 64\n (1956); see Davis, Administrative Law Treatise, 19.01 (1958). The practice of the Commission in making such determination in the first instance, even though it has no power to award reparations in a given case, has long been exercised, Bell Potato Chip Co. v. Aberdeen Truck Line, 43 M. C. C. 337, 343 (1944), and is supported by a long line of cases. See Thompson v. Texas Mexican R. Co., \n328 \nU.S. 134\n (1946), and cases there cited. Be this as it may, the survival of a judicial remedy under the saving clause of 216 (j) cannot be determined on the presence or absence in the Commission of primary jurisdiction to decide the basic question on which relief depends. Survival depends on the effect of the exercise of the remedy upon the statutory scheme of regulation. According to 216 (j), if the remedy is inconsistent with that scheme it does not survive. In T. I. M. E. Inc., we found inconsistencies and hence no judicial remedy survived. Here, as we have indicated, rather than running interference against the Act the exercise of the judicial remedy supports its overall purposes and is nowise inconsistent with the congressional scheme embodied within its four corners. The remedy, therefore, survives and the judgment is\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] 302 I. C. C. 173. Respondent brought an action against the United States and the Commission in the District Court for the District of New Jersey, seeking to set aside the report and the cease-and-desist order entered by the Commission. After the complaint was filed the Commission amended its disposition by striking out the cease-and-desist order, leaving only its declaratory findings as to past practices. The three-judge court, relying upon our decision in United States v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n337 \nU.S. 426\n (1949), held that as a three-judge court it had no authority to adjudicate the controversy since no order was under attack. 170 F. Supp. 848. Decision in the action is now held in abeyance by a single judge pending disposition of this litigation. Thus the litigation has been bifurcated into two District Courts, whose further proceedings may yet be separately appealable. This might have been avoided had the District Court for the Southern District of New York followed this Court's admonition that \"the courts, while retaining the final authority to expound the statute, should avail themselves of the aid implicit in the agency's superiority in gathering the relevant facts and in marshaling them into a meaningful pattern,\" Federal Maritime Board v. Isbrandtsen Co., \n356 \nU.S. 481, 498\n (1958), rather than relying upon the shipper to file an adversary proceeding with the Commission.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE STEWART and MR. JUSTICE WHITE join, dissenting.\n\nWith deference, I consider that the T. I. M. E. case, \n359 \nU.S. 464\n, plainly controls this one. That it does control is not and could hardly be gainsaid to the extent that the complaint purports to allege a statutory cause of action, that is, one based on the terms of the Motor Carrier Act itself. T. I. M. E., at 468-472. However, construing \n\n[371 \nU.S. 84, 90]\n\u00a0\n the complaint as alleging also a common-law cause of action, the Court holds that such an action is \"not inconsistent\" with the Motor Carrier Act and is therefore preserved by 216 (j) of the statute.\n\nThe Court's decision rests primarily on the significance it accords to the existence of certain administrative procedures available to shippers to challenge rates in advance of their application, see 216 (g) and 217 (c) of the Act, and the lack of such protective remedies in the case of routing practices. In addition, three further considerations are asserted to support its conclusion: (1) a misrouting claim does not jeopardize the stability of tariffs or of certificated routes, whereas to permit actions attacking the reasonableness of rates would hamper the efficient administration of the Act; (2) the allowance of misrouting actions will deter misrouting practices and decrease the number of \"cease and desist\" proceedings before the I. C. C.; (3) the absence of any judicial remedy would put the shipper entirely at the mercy of the carrier, contrary to the purpose of the Motor Carrier Act. This reasoning, I submit, entirely misconceives the basis of the T. I. M. E. decision.\n\nThe result reached in T. I. M. E. basically rested on two interdependent considerations: (1) the courts may not adjudicate a matter over which the Commission has been given primary jurisdiction, \n359 \nU.S., at 473\n-474; (2) since the Commission must decide whether a rate is reasonable and Congress has denied it the authority to award reparations for past unreasonable charges, to allow a judicial remedy for recovery of past rate charges would \"permit the I. C. C. to accomplish indirectly what Congress has not chosen to give it the authority to accomplish directly,\" id., at 475.\n\nBoth of these factors are present here. There can be no doubt that under 216 (b) and (e) of the Interstate Commerce Act the Commission has primary jurisdiction \n\n[371 \nU.S. 84, 91]\n\u00a0\n over the complained of misrouting practices,\n1\n as indeed the Commission's action taken with respect to these very practices, Hewitt-Robins, Inc., v. Eastern Freight-Ways, Inc., 302 I. C. C. 173, and the Court's opinion in this case show. Nor is it suggested that the Commission possesses any reparations authority with respect to such misrouting. The conjunction of these factors thus brings T. I. M. E., decided only four Terms ago, into full play.\n\n1. It is true that in this instance the Act does not contain certain protective provisions as in the case of rate making. This cannot, however, serve to distinguish T. I. M. E., whose determination of the congressional purpose underlying the Motor Carrier Act was based on considerations that stand quite independently of the impact of particular provisions of the statute. It should also be noted that the absence of such provisions does not mean that carriers may follow misrouting practices with impunity. Section 212 (a) of the Act provides that the Commission may, on its own initiative or on complaint, suspend or revoke certificates, permits, or licenses for willful failure to comply with any provision of the Act or any order or regulation of the Commission. Under 216 (e) the Commission may order the termination of an unjust practice and prescribe the lawful practice to be followed. Section 222 (a) imposes fines for violations of the Act, and 222 (b) confers jurisdiction on the District Courts to enjoin violations of the Act when application is made by the Commission. \n\n[371 \nU.S. 84, 92]\n\u00a0\n\n\n2. If the issue as to the reasonableness of a routing practice is referred to the Commission, a procedure the Court recognizes as essential, allowance of a judicial remedy for misrouting will not jeopardize the stability of tariffs or of certificated routes. But the suggestion that such a danger was presented by a court action challenging unreasonable rates and that this contributed to the decision in T. I. M. E. is manifestly untenable. It was conceded there, as of course it had to be under prior decisions of this Court,\n2\n that the primary jurisdiction doctrine compelled referral to the Commission of all issues as to the reasonableness of the rates. Since even if a judicial remedy were allowed the Commission would have been the tribunal deciding the basic question, the course of decision would have been uniform and there would not have been, any more than here, interference with the Commission's functioning in the area of its special competence or any threat to the stability of the rate structure. Moreover, the possibility that rate actions might constitute a threat to the rate structure through stimulating excessive litigation could hardly have been regarded as a significant factor in T. I. M. E., for it was there observed that only a handful of actions to recover for unreasonable charges had been brought in the previous 24 years. \n359 \nU.S., at 479\n. And if the Court now believes that to have been a relevant consideration in T. I. M. E., it should certainly be of greater weight with respect to misrouting claims, which are likely to arise more frequently because, as the Court points out, \"selection of the route is usually made on an ad hoc basis, precluding preshipment determination of its reasonableness.\"\n3\n\u00a0\n\n[371 \nU.S. 84, 93]\n\u00a0\n\n\n3. Finally, as to the suggestions that actions such as this should be allowed because of their incidental deterrent effect on misrouting practices and in the interest of justice to shippers, it need only be said that these are matters for the Congress.\n4\n Our duty is to apply the statute as we find it.\n\nI would affirm.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 216 (b) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. 316 (b), provides in pertinent part: \"It shall be the duty of every common carrier of property by motor vehicle . . . to . . . observe . . . reasonable . . . practices . . . relating to or connected with the transportation of property in interstate . . . commerce.\" Section 216 (e) provides that whenever \"the Commission shall be of the opinion that any . . . practice . . . is or will be unjust or unreasonable . . . it shall determine . . . the lawful . . . practice.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See, e. g., Texas & Pacific R.

UNITED STATES(1962)\nNo. 68\nArgued: December 5, 1961Decided: January 22, 1962\n\n\n\n\n In a Federal District Court, petitioner was convicted of two federal crimes and sentenced to imprisonment. He was represented by counsel both at the trial and when sentence was imposed; but, before imposing sentence, the judge failed to comply with the requirement of Rule 32 (a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure that he afford petitioner an opportunity to make a statement in his own behalf. Petitioner took no appeal; but five years later he moved under 28 U.S.C. 2255 to vacate the sentence because of the judge's failure to comply with Rule 32 (a). Held:\n\n 1. Failure to follow the formal requirements of Rule 32 (a) is not of itself an error that can be raised by collateral attack under 28 U.S.C. 2255. Pp. 425-429.\n\n\n 2. Though petitioner denominated his motion as one brought under 28 U.S.C. 2255, it may be considered as a motion to correct an illegal sentence under Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure; but the narrow function of that Rule is to permit correction of an illegal sentence, not to re-examine errors occurring at the trial or other proceedings prior to the imposition of sentence. P. 430.\n\n\n 282 F.2d 352, affirmed.\n\nCurtis R. Reitz, by appointment of the Court, \n365 \nU.S. 841\n, argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner.\n\nJulia P. Cooper argued the cause for the United States. With her on the briefs were Solicitor General Cox, Assistant Attorney General Miller, Richard J. Medalie and Beatrice Rosenberg.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nIn 1954 a jury in a Federal District Court found the petitioner guilty of transporting a kidnapped person in interstate commerce in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1201, and \n\n[368 \nU.S. 424, 425]\n\u00a0\n of transporting a stolen automobile in interstate commerce in violation of 18 U.S.C. 2312. The petitioner was represented by court-appointed counsel at his trial. When, with counsel, he appeared before the District Judge for sentencing, the petitioner was not asked whether he wished to make a statement in his own behalf. The District Judge, after noting his familiarity with the petitioner's character and history, imposed consecutive prison sentences of twenty years and three years for the two offenses of which the jury had found the petitioner guilty. There was no appeal.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nThe present litigation began in 1959 with the filing of a motion to vacate sentence under 28 U.S.C. 2255. Among various grounds for relief asserted, the motion alleged that the petitioner at the time of sentencing had been \"denied the right under Rule 32 (a) of Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Title 18 U.S.C. to have the opportunity to make a statement in his own behalf and to present any information in mitigation of punishment.\" The District Court denied the motion without explicitly discussing the Rule 32 (a) claim. 186 F. Supp. 441. The Court of Appeals affirmed, per curiam, 282 F.2d 352. We granted certiorari \"limited to the question of whether petitioner may raise his claim under Federal Criminal Rule 32 (a) in the proceeding which he has now brought.\" \n365 \nU.S. 841\n.\n\nRule 32 (a) in pertinent part provides: \"Before imposing sentence the court shall afford the defendant an opportunity to make a statement in his own behalf and to \n\n[368 \nU.S. 424, 426]\n\u00a0\n present any information in mitigation of punishment.\" The meaning of this Rule was before the Court last Term in Green v. United States, \n365 \nU.S. 301\n. Although there was no Court opinion in the Green case, eight members of the Court concurred in the view that Rule 32 (a) requires a district judge before imposing sentence to afford every convicted defendant an opportunity personally to speak in his own behalf. There thus remains no doubt as to what the Rule commands. Moreover, the present record makes clear that this petitioner was not given an express opportunity to make a personal statement at the time he was sentenced. This case, therefore, is totally unembarrassed by any such factual controversy as divided the Court in Green. The only issue presented is whether a district court's failure explicitly to afford a defendant an opportunity to make a statement at the time of sentencing furnishes, without more, grounds for a successful collateral attack upon the judgment and sentence.\n2\n We hold that the failure to follow the formal requirements of Rule 32 (a) is not of itself an error that can be raised by collateral attack, and we accordingly affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\nSection 2255 of Title 28, U.S.C., provides that a prisoner in custody under sentence of a federal court may file a motion in the \"court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence.\" The statute states four grounds upon which such relief may be claimed: (1) \"that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States;\" (2) \"that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence;\" (3) \"that the sentence was in excess of the \n\n[368 \nU.S. 424, 427]\n\u00a0\n maximum authorized by law;\" and (4) that the sentence \"is otherwise subject to collateral attack.\"\n3\n\u00a0\n\nThe circumstances which led Congress in 1948 to enact this legislation were reviewed in detail by Chief Justice Vinson, writing for the Court in United States v. Hayman, \n342 \nU.S. 205\n. It is unnecessary to review again here this legislative history, with which Chief Justice Vinson, as Chairman of the Judicial Conference of the United States, was particularly familiar. Suffice it to say that it conclusively appears from the historic context in which 2255 was enacted that the legislation was intended simply to provide in the sentencing court a remedy exactly commensurate with that which had previously been available by habeas corpus in the court of the district where the prisoner was confined.\n4\n See Heflin v. United States, \n358 \nU.S. 415, 421\n (concurring opinion).\n\n  \"[A] review of the history of Section 2255 shows that it was passed at the instance of the Judicial Conference to meet practical difficulties that had arisen in administering the habeas corpus jurisdiction of the federal courts. Nowhere in the history of Section 2255 do we find any purpose to impinge upon prisoners' rights of collateral attack upon their convictions. On the contrary, the sole purpose was to minimize the difficulties encountered in habeas corpus hearings by affording the same rights in \n\n[368 \nU.S. 424, 428]\n\u00a0\n another and more convenient forum.\" United States v. Hayman, \n342 \nU.S., at 219\n. (Emphasis added.)\n5\n\u00a0\n\n\n The failure of a trial court to ask a defendant represented by an attorney whether he has anything to say before sentence is imposed is not of itself an error of the character or magnitude cognizable under a writ of habeas corpus. It is an error which is neither jurisdictional nor constitutional. It is not a fundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice, nor an omission inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure. It does not present \"exceptional circumstances where the need for the remedy afforded by the writ of habeas corpus is apparent.\" Bowen v. Johnston, \n306 \nU.S. 19, 27\n. See Escoe v. Zerbst, \n295 \nU.S. 490\n; Johnson v. Zerbst, \n304 \nU.S. 458\n; Walker v. Johnston, \n312 \nU.S. 275\n; Waley v. Johnston, \n316 \nU.S. 101\n.\n\nIn Sunal v. Large, \n332 \nU.S. 174\n, the Court held that the remedy of habeas corpus was unavailable in circumstances far more compelling than are presented here. There the petitioners at their criminal trial had been denied an opportunity to present a defense which subsequent decisions of this Court had held should clearly have been available to them. What was said in that case is apposite here:\n\n \"We are dealing here with a problem which has radiations far beyond the present cases. The courts which tried the defendants had jurisdiction over their persons and over the offense. They committed an error of law . . . . That error did not go to the jurisdiction of the trial court. Congress, moreover, \n\n[368 \nU.S. 424, 429]\n\u00a0\n has provided a regular, orderly method for correction of all such errors by granting an appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals and by vesting us with certiorari jurisdiction. It is not uncommon after a trial is ended and the time for appeal has passed to discover that a shift in the law or the impact of a new decision has given increased relevance to a point made at the trial but not pursued on appeal. . . . If in such circumstances, habeas corpus could be used to correct the error, the writ would become a delayed motion for a new trial, renewed from time to time as the legal climate changed. Error which was not deemed sufficiently adequate to warrant an appeal would acquire new implications. . . . Wise judicial administration of the federal courts counsels against such course, at least where the error does not trench on any constitutional rights of defendants nor involve the jurisdiction of the trial court.\" \n332 \nU.S., at 181\n-182.\n\n\n It is to be noted that we are not dealing here with a case where the defendant was affirmatively denied an opportunity to speak during the hearing at which his sentence was imposed. Nor is it suggested that in imposing the sentence the District Judge was either misinformed or uninformed as to any relevant circumstances. Indeed, there is no claim that the defendant would have had anything at all to say if he had been formally invited to speak. Whether 2255 relief would be available if a violation of Rule 32 (a) occurred in the context of other aggravating circumstances is a question we therefore do not consider. We decide only that such collateral relief is not available when all that is shown is a failure to comply with the formal requirements of the Rule.\n6\n\u00a0\n\n[368 \nU.S. 424, 430]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt is suggested that although the petitioner denominated his motion as one brought under 28 U.S.C. 2255, we may consider it as a motion to correct an illegal sentence under Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n7\n This is correct. Heflin v. United States, \n358 \nU.S. 415, 418\n, 422. But, as the Rule's language and history make clear, the narrow function of Rule 35 is to permit correction at any time of an illegal sentence, not to re-examine errors occurring at the trial or other proceedings prior to the imposition of sentence.\n8\n The sentence in this case was not illegal. The punishment meted out was not in excess of that prescribed by the relevant statutes, multiple terms were not imposed for the same offense, nor were the terms of the sentence itself legally or constitutionally invalid in any other respect.\n9\n\u00a0\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In an earlier motion filed under 28 U.S.C. 2255 the petitioner claimed that he had been prevented by government agents from appealing the judgment of conviction. The District Court denied the motion. The Court of Appeals set aside the District Court's order and directed that a hearing be had on the motion. 256 F.2d 957. After a hearing before a different district judge, the motion was again denied. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 268 F.2d 203.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The majority of the Court in the Green case did not decide whether the issue of a Rule 32 (a) violation could be raised on collateral attack, or whether such a violation \"would constitute an error per se rendering the sentence illegal.\" \n365 \nU.S., at 303\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] \"A prisoner in custody under sentence of a court established by Act of Congress claiming the right to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack, may move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence.\" 28 U.S.C. 2255.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See Parker, Limiting the Abuse of Habeas Corpus, 8 F. R. D. 171.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The Courts of Appeals, at least since the Hayman decision, appear to have consistently understood the substantive scope of 2255 to be the same as that of habeas corpus. See, e. g., Larson v. United States, 275 F.2d 673 (C. A. 5th Cir.); Black v. United States, 269 F.2d 38 (C. A. 9th Cir.); Taylor v. United States, 229 F.2d 826, 832 (C. A. 8th Cir.); Kreuter v. United States, 201 F.2d 33, 35 (C. A. 10th Cir.).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] See Van Hook v. United States, \n365 \nU.S. 609\n, for the relief afforded on direct appeal in a case where the sentencing judge disregarded the mandate of Rule 32 (a).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Rule 35 provides in pertinent part: \"The court may correct an illegal sentence at any time.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] As has been pointed out, Rule 35 \"was a codification of existing law and was intended to remove any doubt created by the decision in United States v. Mayer, \n235 \nU.S. 55, 67\n, as to the jurisdiction of a District Court to correct an illegal sentence after the expiration of the term at which it was entered.\" Heflin v. United States, \n358 \nU.S., at 422\n (concurring opinion).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Compare Heflin v. United States, supra. In that case Rule 35 was invoked in a situation where we unanimously recognized that the only issue was whether \"the sentence imposed was illegal on its face.\" \n358 \nU.S., at 418\n (Court opinion), 422 (concurring opinion). Heflin involved the imposition of separate consecutive sentences for a single offense.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN concur, dissenting.\n\nThe petitioner James Hill brought this proceeding to vacate two sentences under which he is imprisoned in a federal penitentiary, alleging that the sentences are \n\n[368 \nU.S. 424, 431]\n\u00a0\n illegal because the trial judge who imposed them had not given him the opportunity required by Rule 32 (a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure \"to make a statement in his own behalf and to present any information in mitigation of punishment.\" Conceding that the sentences thus challenged were imposed without according petitioner his right to speak, the Court nonetheless denies relief under Rule 35's provision for the correction of \"illegal\" sentences on the ground that the sentences though imposed in flat violation of Rule 32 (a), were not \"illegal\" within the special meaning which the majority now ascribes to that word for the purposes of Rule 35.\n1\n The basic explanation offered for this drastic contraction of the ordinary meaning of the word \"illegal\" is this single statement in the Court's opinion:\n\n\"The punishment meted out was not in excess of that prescribed by the relevant statutes, multiple terms were not imposed for the same offense, nor were the terms of the sentence itself legally or constitutionally invalid in any other respect.\"\n\n\n That statement to me amounts to something less than an entirely satisfactory justification for such a begrudging interpretation of Rule 35.\n\nThe Court's holding certainly finds no support in the language of Rule 35. That Rule, although painstakingly drawn by lawyers and approved both by Judges and by the Congress, simply provides for the correction of an \"illegal sentence\" without regard to the reasons why that sentence is illegal and contains not a single word to support \n\n[368 \nU.S. 424, 432]\n\u00a0\n the Court's conclusion that only a sentence illegal by reason of the punishment it imposes is \"illegal\" within the meaning of the Rule. I would have thought that a sentence imposed in an illegal manner - whether the amount or form of the punishment meted out constitutes an additional violation of law or not - would be recognized as an \"illegal sentence\" under any normal reading of the English language.\n2\n And precisely this sort of common-sense understanding of the language of Rule 35 has prevailed generally among the lower federal courts that deal with questions of the proper interpretation and application of these Rules as an everyday matter. Those courts have expressed their belief that, even where the punishment imposed upon a defendant is entirely within the limits prescribed for the crime of which he was convicted, a sentence imposed in a prohibited manner - as, for example, a sentence imposed upon an absent defendant in violation of the command of Rule 43 that a defendant be present at sentencing\n3\n - is an \"illegal sentence\" subject to correction under Rule 35.\n4\n\u00a0\n\n[368 \nU.S. 424, 433]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Court's contrary decision today, however, was perhaps foreshadowed last Term by the narrow scope given to Rule 32 (a) when the issue of the meaning of that Rule came before us for the first time in Green v. United States.\n5\n That case, like this one, involved an attempt to vacate a sentence as \"illegal\" under Rule 35 on the ground that the trial judge had failed to accord the defendant his right to make a statement before sentencing. The record there showed merely that the trial judge, in the presence of both the defendant and his counsel, had asked generally, \"Did you want to say something?\" and that, in response to this question, the attorney rather than the defendant had spoken. Recognizing that the right accorded by Rule 32 (a) is a personal right which must be extended to the defendant himself, the Court nonetheless denied relief, largely upon the view expressed by four members of the Court that: \"A record, certainly this record, unlike a play, is unaccompanied with stage directions which may tell the significant cast of the eye or the nod of the head. It may well be that the defendant himself was recognized and sufficiently apprised of his right to speak and chose to exercise this right through his counsel.\"\n6\n This conclusion was reached in spite of the fact that the Government's brief before this Court expressly conceded that Green had not been personally afforded an opportunity to speak.\n\nBut even in Green, not one member of the Court went so far as even to intimate - unless such an intimation was implicit in the concurring opinion of MR. JUSTICE STEWART\n7\n - that a sentence undeniably imposed in disregard \n\n[368 \nU.S. 424, 434]\n\u00a0\n of the legal right of a defendant to speak for himself would not be an \"illegal sentence.\" Four members of the Court - THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN and I - expressly stated the view that such a sentence could be corrected under Rule 35's provision for the correction of \"illegal\" sentences. And four other members of the Court, in an opinion written by MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, emphasized the importance of the right of the defendant to speak for himself, saying: \"The most persuasive counsel may not be able to speak for a defendant as the defendant might, with halting eloquence, speak for himself.\"\n8\n Although it is true that these latter four members of the Court joined in refusing to set aside the sentence in that case, their stated ground was: \"The defendant has failed to meet his burden of showing that he was not accorded the personal right which Rule 32 (a) guarantees, and we therefore find that his sentence was not illegal.\"\n9\n In the light of all these statements, it is not surprising that the Courts of Appeals for both the First and the Fifth Circuits have regarded the combined opinions in Green as requiring the correction of sentences as illegal when the defendant is able \"to meet his burden of showing that he was not accorded the personal right which Rule 32 (a) guarantees.\"\n10\n\u00a0\n\nI think that a due observance of the requirements of Rule 32 (a), resting as they do upon the anciently recognized right of a defendant to speak to the court before sentence is imposed, is important to the proper administration of justice in the federal courts. And it seems to me that the Court is mistaken in thinking that the importance of that right is not reflected in this very case, for I cannot agree with the Court's conclusion that \"there is \n\n[368 \nU.S. 424, 435]\n\u00a0\n no claim that the defendant would have had anything at all to say if he had been formally invited to speak.\" According to the petitioner's brief, the denial of his right to speak was particularly injurious to him here because he had several previous convictions which presumably were known to the sentencing judge.\n11\n In this connection, he says: \"Petitioner has been and is presently seeking collateral relief from those judgments and, indeed, has already had one set aside. This mitigating evidence, if known to the sentencing court, might have a profound impact upon the sentence imposed.\"\n\nMore importantly, however, whether the right to speak before sentence would have been of value to petitioner in this particular case or not, the right is one recognized by a rule which has the force of law and a sentence imposed in violation of law is plainly \"illegal.\" If the Court is unhappy with the wording of Rule 35 - a wording adopted by the Court itself and submitted to Congress for approval as required by law - whatever change is necessary to bring the Rule into conformity with the Court's present preferences should be incorporated into the explicit language of the Rule and submitted to Congress for its approval. I would reverse this case and remand it to allow the District Court to resentence petitioner after granting him his right to speak under Rule 32 (a).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Petitioner's attack upon his sentences was originally brought as a motion under 28 U.S.C. 2255. Since I agree with the Court that a motion under 2255 must, where appropriate, also be considered as a motion under Rule 35, and because I think petitioner is plainly entitled to relief under that Rule, I find it unnecessary to consider the question discussed by the Court as to whether petitioner is also entitled to relief under 2255.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] This does not of course mean that Rule 35 permits attack upon a sentence based upon mere trial errors. Rule 35 applies to any \"illegal sentence,\" not to any illegal conviction, and thus by its terms the Rule protects only those rights which a defendant retains even if the judgment of guilt against him is proper.

He disclaimed any intention to rely on his privilege against self-incrimination; but he claimed that the questions were not pertinent to any activity which the Committee was authorized to investigate, that they were asked for purposes of \"exposure\" and that they might aid the prosecution of criminal charges then pending against him in a state court and thus violate his rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. These objections were overruled; but petitioner persisted in his refusal to answer. For such refusal, he was convicted of a violation of 2 U.S.C. 192, which makes it a misdemeanor for any person summoned as a witness by either House of Congress or a committee thereof to refuse to answer any question pertinent to the question under inquiry. Held: The questions which petitioner refused to answer were clearly within the proper scope of the Committee's inquiry; the record does not support a conclusion that they were asked merely for the sake of \"exposure\" or to aid in the pending state criminal trial; the mere fact that answers to the questions might have been used against petitioner in the pending state criminal trial did not make this conviction violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment; and the conviction is sustained.

JUSTICE STEWART join.\n\nAfter a trial without a jury, petitioner was found guilty on all 18 counts of an indictment charging him with having violated 2 U.S.C. 192\n1\n by refusing to answer pertinent questions put to him on June 27, 1958, by the Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor or Management Field, commonly known as the McClellan Committee. He was sentenced to six months' imprisonment and fined $500. The judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, without opinion. We granted certiorari to consider petitioner's constitutional challenges to his conviction. \n365 \nU.S. 866\n.\n\nThe McClellan Committee was established by the Senate in 1957\n\n\n\n\"to conduct an investigation and study of the extent to which criminal or other improper practices or activities are, or have been, engaged in in the field of labor-management relations or in groups or organizations \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 601]\n\u00a0\n of employees or employers to the detriment of the interests of the public, employers or employees, and to determine whether any changes are required in the laws of the United States in order to protect such interests against the occurrence of such practices or activities.\" S. Res. 74, 85th Cong., 1st Sess. (1957).\n2\n\u00a0\n\n\n Pursuing an investigative pattern which in 1957 and the the forepart of 1958 had disclosed misuse of union funds for the personal benefit of various union officials,\n3\n the Committee on June 4, 1958, began hearings at Washington, D.C., into the affairs of various organizations, including the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America of which the petitioner was president. Initially, the Committee sought to inquire into the personal financial interests of petitioner and other officials of the Carpenters Union in the World Wide Press, a New York publishing house owned by one Maxwell Raddock, which was publisher of the \"Trade Union Courier.\" More especially the Committee wished to learn whether union funds had been misused in the publication by the Press of a biography of petitioner's father, entitled \"The Portrait of an American Labor Leader, William L. Hutcheson.\" Senator McClellan, Chairman of the Committee, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 602]\n\u00a0\n announced that the petitioner and Raddock would both be called to testify.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nOn June 25 Raddock testified as to the affairs of the \"Trade Union Courier\" and the publication of the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 603]\n\u00a0\n Hutcheson book.\n5\n On the following day, however, he claimed the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination with respect to another matter to which the Committee had turned. That matter related to the possible use of union funds or influence to \"fix\" a 1957 criminal investigation, conducted in Lake County, Indiana, by a state grand jury, into an alleged scheme to defraud the State of Indiana, in which petitioner and two other officials of the Carpenters Union, O. William Blaier and Frank M. Chapman, were allegedly implicated.\n\nThe alleged scheme to defraud had been revealed in testimony given before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Public Works during May and June 1957. That testimony had disclosed that in June 1956 the petitioner, Blaier, and Chapman had together bought, in their individual capacities, certain real property in Lake County for $20,000, and had shortly thereafter sold it, at a profit of $78,000, to the State of Indiana for highway construction purposes, pursuant to an agreement whereby a deputy in the Indiana Right-of-Way Department was paid one-fifth of that profit.\n6\n The ensuing grand jury proceeding had been terminated in August 1957 without any indictment having been found, with an announcement by the county prosecutor, Metro Holovachka, that \"jurisdiction\" over the matter was lacking in Lake County, and that the entire $78,000 profit had been returned to the State. Thereafter, in February 1958, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 604]\n\u00a0\n the petitioner, Blaier, and Chapman were indicted in adjoining Marion County on this transaction.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nIt is apparent from the questioning of Raddock by the chief counsel for the McClellan Committee that the Committee had information indicating that Raddock, the petitioner, Blaier, and several officials of the Teamsters Union had been involved in a plan whereby Holovachka had been induced to drop the Lake County grand jury investigation, and Committee counsel explained to Raddock that the Committee was interested to learn whether union funds or influence had been used for that purpose.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nIn addition to Raddock, whose self-incrimination plea with respect to all questions relating to that episode was respected by the Committee, Blaier, and two witnesses connected with an Indiana Local of the Teamsters Union, Michael Sawochka its secretary-treasurer and Joseph P. Sullivan its attorney, were also examined before the Committee on June 26. Sawochka and Sullivan each refused to answer any questions relating to the termination of the Lake County grand jury proceedings, Sawochka basing his refusal on the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, and Sullivan invoking the attorney-client privilege insofar as the questions related to any discussions with Sawochka. Both claims were honored by the Committee.\n\nBlaier, who was asked no questions regarding the Lake County real estate transaction itself,\n9\n refused to answer the question whether he had made \"any arrangements for \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 605]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Max Raddock to fix any case for you in Indiana.\" He asserted that the question \"relates solely to a personal matter, not pertinent to any activity which this committee is authorized to investigate and . . . it might aid the prosecution in the case in which I am under indictment.\" The Committee Chairman, without ruling on the objection, stated that the witness might claim the privilege against self-incrimination. Although Blaier did not thereafter do so, he was never directed by the Committee to answer this question.\n10\n\u00a0\n\nThe last witness who was examined by the Committee on this phase of its investigation was the petitioner, who was called on June 27. He answered questions concerning the publication by Raddock of the biography of petitioner's father, commissioned by the Carpenters Union at a total expense of $310,000. When the inquiry turned to the subject of the Lake County grand jury investigation, however, petitioner refused to answer any questions. Being under the same indictment as Blaier and represented by the same counsel, petitioner's grounds for refusal were the same as those which had been advanced the day before by Blaier: \"it [the question] relates solely to a personal matter, not pertinent to any activity which this committee is authorized to investigate, and also it \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 606]\n\u00a0\n relates or might be claimed to relate to or aid the prosecution in the case in which I am under indictment and thus be in denial of due process of law.\"\n11\n No claim of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination was made at any stage. This objection, upon which the petitioner stood throughout this phase of his interrogation, was overruled by the Committee, and petitioner was directed, and refused to answer, each of the 18 questions constituting the subject matter of the indictment upon which he has been convicted.\n12\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 607]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe many arguments now made to us in support of reversal are reducible to two constitutional challenges. First, it is contended that questioning petitioner on any matters germane to the state criminal charges then pending against him was offensive to the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Second, it is argued that the Committee invaded domains constitutionally reserved to the Executive and the Judiciary, in that its inquiry was simply aimed at petitioner's \"exposure\" and served no legislative purpose. For reasons now to be discussed we decide that neither challenge is availing.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\n   Due Process.\n\n\n The Committee's interrogation is said to have been fundamentally unfair in two respects: (1) it placed the petitioner in a position where, save for silence, his only choice lay between prejudicing his defense to the state indictment, and committing perjury; and (2) it was a \"pretrial\" of the state charges before the Committee. The first of these propositions rests on two premises respecting Indiana law, which we accept for the purposes of the ensuing discussion: admissions of an attempt to \"fix\" the grand jury investigation could have been used against petitioner in the state trial as evidence of consciousness of guilt (see, e. g., Davidson v. State, 205 Ind. 564, 569, 187 N. E. 376, 378); a claim of the federal self-incrimination \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 608]\n\u00a0\n privilege before that Committee could also have been so used, at least to impeach petitioner's testimony had he taken the stand at the state trial (see Crickmore v. State, 213 Ind. 586, 592-593, 12 N. E. 2d 266, 269).\n\nThe contention respecting Indiana's future use of incriminatory answers at once encounters an obstacle in Hale v. Henkel, \n201 \nU.S. 43\n, and United States v. Murdock, \n284 \nU.S. 141\n. Those cases establish that possible self-incrimination under state law is not a ground for refusing to answer questions in a federal inquiry; accordingly, the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination will not avail one so circumstanced. Manifestly, this constitutional doctrine is no less relevant here either because the petitioner was actually under, and not merely threatened with, state indictment at the time of his appearance before the Committee, or because of the likelihood that the Committee would have respected, even though not required to do so under existing law, a privilege claim had one been made.\n\nRecognizing this obstacle, petitioner asks us to overrule Hale and Murdock, asserting that both decisions rested on misapprehensions as to earlier American and English law.\n13\n But we need not consider those contentions, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 609]\n\u00a0\n for petitioner never having claimed the Fifth Amendment privilege before the Committee, this aspect of his due process challenge is not open to him now. This is not a case like Quinn v. United States, \n349 \nU.S. 155\n, or Emspak v. United States, \n349 \nU.S. 190\n, where there is doubt whether that privilege was invoked by the witness. \"If,\" as was noted in Emspak, at 195, \"the witness intelligently and unequivocally waives any objection based on the Self-Incrimination Clause, or if the witness refuses a committee request to state whether he relies on the Self-Incrimination Clause, he cannot later invoke its protection in a prosecution for contempt for refusing to answer that question.\" In this instance, the petitioner, with counsel at his side, unequivocally and repeatedly disclaimed any reliance on the Fifth Amendment privilege.\n14\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 610]\n\u00a0\n\n\nPetitioner cannot escape the effect of his waiver by arguing, as he does, that his refusals to answer were based on \"due process\" grounds, and not upon a claim of \"privilege.\" We agree, of course, that a congressional committee's right to inquire is \"subject to\" all relevant \"limitations placed by the Constitution on governmental action,\" including \"the relevant limitations of the Bill of \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 611]\n\u00a0\n Rights,\" Barenblatt v. United States, \n360 \nU.S. 109, 112\n; that such limitations go beyond the protection of the self-incrimination clause of the Fifth Amendment, id., 111-112, and that nonreliance on one such limitation does not preclude reliance on another. But it is surely equally clear that where, as here, the validity of a particular constitutional objection depends in part on the availability of another, both must be adequately raised before the inquiring committee if the former is to be fully preserved for review in this Court.\n\nTo hold otherwise would enable a witness to toy with a congressional committee in a manner obnoxious to the rule that such committees are entitled to be clearly apprised of the grounds on which a witness asserts a right of refusal to answer. Emspak v. United States, supra, at 195; cf. Barenblatt v. United States, supra, at 123-124. The present case indeed furnishes an apt illustration of this. Pursuant to its policy of respecting Fifth Amendment privilege claims with respect to \"state\" self-incrimination (even though with Hale and Murdock still on the books it need not have done so), the Committee was at pains to discover whether petitioner's due process objection included a privilege claim. Had he made such a claim, there is little doubt but that the Committee would have honored it. It was only after petitioner's express disclaimer of the privilege that the Committee proceeded to disallow his due process objection. Now to consider that the self-incrimination aspect of petitioner's due process claim is still open to him would in effect require us to say that, despite petitioner's unequivocal disclaimer, the Committee should nonetheless have taken his due process objection as subsuming also a privilege claim.\n15\n We cannot so consider the situation. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 612]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe also find untenable the contention that possible use in the state trial of a claim of the federal privilege against self-incrimination either excused petitioner from asserting it before the Committee or furnishes independent support for his due process challenge. Whether or not, as is intimated by the Government, but, for obvious reasons, not by the petitioner, the State's use of such a claim directly or for impeachment purposes might be preventable, need not now be considered. For if such a proposition is arguable in the face of Twining v. New Jersey, \n211 \nU.S. 78\n, and Adamson v. California, \n332 \nU.S. 46, 51\n, let alone Knapp v. Schweitzer, \n357 \nU.S. 371\n; Feldman v. United States, \n322 \nU.S. 487\n; Hale v. Henkel, supra, and United States v. Murdock, supra, its consideration should in any event await another day. The appropriate time for that, had the petitioner in this instance claimed the privilege before the Committee, would have been upon review of his state conviction, when we would have known exactly what use, if any, the State had made of the federal claim. To thwart the exercise of legitimate congressional power, on the basis of conjecture that a State may later abuse an individual's reliance upon federally assured rights, would require of us a constitutional adjudication contrary to well-established principles of ripeness and justifiability. Cf. United Public Workers v. Mitchell, \n330 \nU.S. 75, 89\n-90.\n\nThere remains for discussion on the due process challenge, the contention that the Committee's inquiry was a \"pretrial\" of the state indictment. Insofar as this proposition suggests that the congressional inquiry infected the later state proceedings, the answer to it is found in what we have just said respecting the contention \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 613]\n\u00a0\n that a claim of self-incrimination before the Committee could have been used in the state proceedings. If the Committee's public hearings rendered petitioner's state trial unfair, such a challenge should not be dealt with at this juncture. The proper time for its consideration would be on review of the state conviction. To determine it now would require us to pass upon the claim in the dark, since we are entirely ignorant of what transpired at the state trial.\n\nNor can it be argued that the mere pendency of the state indictment ipso facto constitutionally closed this avenue of interrogation to the Committee. \"It may be conceded that Congress is without authority to compel disclosures for the purpose of aiding the prosecution of pending suits; but the authority of that body, directly or through its committees, to require pertinent disclosures in aid of its own constitutional power is not abridged because the information sought to be elicited may also be of use in such suits.\" Sinclair v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 263, 295\n. It would be absurd to suggest that in establishing this committee the Congress was actuated by a purpose to aid state prosecutions, still less that of this particular individual. The pertinency of the observation in Sinclair is not lessened by the circumstance that in this instance the state proceeding involved was criminal, rather than civil. Cf. Delaney v. United States, 199 F.2d 107, 114.\n16\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 614]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\n   Exposure.\n\n\n There is also no merit to petitioner's contention that the Committee undertook simply \"to expose\" petitioner \"for the sake of exposure,\" Watkins v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 178, 200\n. The origins of the McClellan Committee, and the products of its endeavors, both belie that challenge, and nothing in the record of the present hearings points to a contrary conclusion.\n\nIt cannot be gainsaid that legislation, whether civil or criminal, in the labor-management field is within the competence of Congress under its power to regulate interstate \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 615]\n\u00a0\n commerce. The Committee's general legislative recommendations, made at the conclusion of its First Interim Report, S. Rep. No. 1417, 85th Cong., 2d Sess. 450-453 (1958), were embodied in two remedial statutes enacted by Congress: the Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act of 1958, 72 Stat. 997, and the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, 73 Stat. 519. The enactment of the first of these statutes is attributable primarily to the findings and recommendations of several Subcommittees of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, S. Rep. No. 1440, 85th Cong., 2d Sess. 2-3 (1958). But passage of the bill was stimulated by the information then being gathered at hearings of the McClellan Committee. See 104 Cong. Rec. 7054, 7197-7198, 7233, 7337-7338, 7483, 7509-7510, 7521 (1958). \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 616]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 was a direct response to the need for remedial federal legislation disclosed by the testimony before the McClellan Committee. This is made clear not by imprecise inferences drawn from legislative history; the proof is in the statute itself. Section 2(b) of the Act declares it to be a finding of Congress \"from recent investigations in the labor and management fields, that there have been a number of instances of breach of trust, corruption, disregard of the rights of individual employees, and other failures to observe high standards of responsibility and ethical conduct which require further and supplementary legislation.\" 73 Stat. 519. The Senate and House Reports lean heavily on findings made by the McClellan Committee to justify particular provisions in the proposed bills. See S. Rep. No. 187, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. 2, 6, 9, 10, 13-17 (1959); H. R. Rep. No. 741, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. 1, 2, 6, 9, 11-13, 76, 83 (1959).\n\nThe resolution which gave birth to this Committee, when considered in light of the fruits of its labors, proves beyond any doubt \"that the committee members . . . [were] serving as the representatives of the parent assembly in collecting information for a legislative purpose.\" Watkins v. United States, supra, at 200. This is not a case involving an indefinite and fluctuating delegation which permits a legislative committee \"in essence, to define its own authority, to choose the direction and focus of its activities.\" Id., at 205. This Committee was directed to investigate \"criminal or other improper practices . . . in the field of labor-management relations.\" Deciding whether acts that are made criminal by state law ought also to be brought within a federal prohibition, if, as here, the subject is a permissible one for federal regulation, turns entirely on legislative inquiry. And it is this inquiry in which the Senate was engaged when it assigned the fact-finding duty to the Select Committee \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 617]\n\u00a0\n on Improper Activities in the Labor or Management Field.\n\nMoreover, this record is barren of evidence indicating that the Committee, for reasons of its own, undertook to \"expose\" this petitioner.\n\nFirst: The transcript discloses a most scrupulous adherence to the announced Committee policy of not asking a witness under state indictment any questions \"on the subject matter involved in the indictment.\" Note 9, supra. This particular indictment related solely to activity in which petitioner and others had been engaged in their individual capacities, not on behalf of any labor organization. The Committee's concern was not whether petitioner had in fact defrauded the State of Indiana of $78,000 in concluding a dishonest sale or whether he had personally corrupted a state employee. Its interest, which was entirely within the province entrusted to it by the Senate, was to discover whether and how funds of the Brotherhood of Carpenters or of the Teamsters Union\n17\n had been used in a conspiracy to bribe a state prosecutor to drop charges made against individuals who were also officers of the Brotherhood of Carpenters, and whether the influence of union officials had been exerted to that end. If these suspicions were founded, they would have supported remedial federal legislation for the future, even though they might at the same time have warranted a separate state prosecution for obstruction of justice, or \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 618]\n\u00a0\n been usable at the trial of the Marion County indictment as evidence of consciousness of guilt. Supra, pp. 607-608. But surely a congressional committee which is engaged in a legitimate legislative investigation need not grind to a halt whenever responses to its inquiries might potentially be harmful to a witness in some distinct proceeding, Sinclair v. United States, supra, at 295, or when crime or wrongdoing is disclosed, McGrain v. Daugherty, \n273 \nU.S. 135, 179\n-180.\n\nSecond: The information sought to be elicited by the Committee was pertinent to the legislative inquiry. The Committee was investigating whether and how union funds had been misused, in the interest of devising a legislative scheme to deal with irregular practices. Because of petitioner's refusal to answer questions, and because of the similar refusal by other witnesses to testify with regard to the Lake County grand jury proceedings, the Committee was not able to learn whether union funds or influence had been used to persuade Holovachka to drop those proceedings.\n\nPetitioner contends that the Committee's finding in its Second Interim Report that Raddock had been \"used by Hutcheson as a fixer in an attempt to head-off the indictment of Hutcheson [and others] . . .\" shows that his testimony was not needed for any purpose other than to prejudice or embarrass him. But this overlooks the fact that the Committee had been able to obtain no information whatever on the Lake County grand jury proceedings from any of the other witnesses by reason of their refusals to testify on the subject.\n18\n Moreover, it does not lie with \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 619]\n\u00a0\n this Court to say when a congressional committee should be deemed to have acquired sufficient information for its legislative purposes.\n\nThird: The Committee's interrogation was within the express terms of its authorizing resolution. If the Committee was to be at all effective in bringing to Congress' attention certain practices in the labor-management field which should be subject to federal prohibitions, it necessarily had to ask some witnesses questions which, if truthfully answered, might place them in jeopardy of state prosecution. Unless interrogation is met with a valid constitutional objection \"the scope of the power of [congressional] inquiry . . . is as penetrating and far-reaching as the potential power to enact and appropriate under the Constitution.\" Barenblatt v. United States, supra, at 111. And it is not until the question is asked that the interrogator can know whether it will be answered or will be met with some constitutional objection. To deny the Committee the right to ask the question would be to turn an \"option of refusal\" into a \"prohibition of inquiry,\" 8 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed.) 2268, and to limit congressional inquiry to those areas in which there is not the slightest possibility of state prosecution for information that may be divulged. Such a restriction upon congressional investigatory powers should not be countenanced.\n\nThe three episodes upon which the petitioner relies as evidencing a Committee departure from these legitimate congressional concerns fall far short of sustaining what is sought to be made of them. The first of these is the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 620]\n\u00a0\n Committee counsel's statement at the outset of the hearings explaining \"the subject matter being inquired into,\" in the course of which he referred to the real estate transaction involved in the Marion County indictment, and explained the Committee's interest in finding out whether union funds or influence had been used in bringing to an end the Lake County grand jury investigation of the matter.\n19\n The propriety of such an inquiry has already been discussed. Pp. 617-618, supra.\n\nThe second episode is the Chairman's statement to the effect that all the facts as to the Lake County proceedings had \"not been developed by the committee\"; that further \"exposure\" of them \"should be made\"; and that the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 621]\n\u00a0\n Committee stood ready to \"assist and help\" Indiana if it chose to interest itself in the matter.\n20\n We can see nothing in this statement, which was made after the Committee's inquiry had ended, beyond a perfectly normal offer on the part of the Chairman to put the Committee transcript at the disposal of the Indiana law enforcement authorities if they wished to avail themselves of it.\n21\n\u00a0\n\nThe final occurrence is the so-called Committee \"finding\" as to petitioner's alleged use of Raddock as a \"fixer\" to \"head-off\" an indictment by the Lake County grand jury. Whatever the basis for that \"finding\" (cf. note 18, supra), we must say that its mere inclusion in an official report to the Senate of the Committee's activities\n22\n furnishes \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 622]\n\u00a0\n a slender reed indeed for a charge that that Committee was engaged in unconstitutional \"exposure.\"\n\nIn conclusion, it is appropriate to observe that just as the Constitution forbids the Congress to enter fields reserved to the Executive and Judiciary, it imposes on the Judiciary the reciprocal duty of not lightly interfering with Congress' exercise of its legitimate powers. Having scrutinized this case with care, we conclude that the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the decision of this case.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \" 192.

(1958) (hereinafter Hearings), is as follows:\n\n\"The committee will hear witnesses today on the operations of Mr. Maxwell Raddock, owner of the World Wide Press, a large New York printing plant, and publisher of the Trade Union Courier.\n\n\n\"Witnesses will be called to testify as to financial interests and investments in the World Wide Press by labor organizations and certain labor officials and the unorthodox manner in which bonds of the company were issued and handled.\n\n\n\"The committee will also inquire into the propriety of labor officials' having financial interests in Maxwell Raddock's company at the same time that they invested considerable sums of their union's funds in the plant that prints the Trade Union Courier and in subscriptions to that paper.\n\n\n\"The manner in which advertisements were solicited by the Trade Union Courier has been the subject of investigation by the committee staff. The committee is particularly interested in whether solicitors employed by the Trade Union Courier represented it as the organ of the AFL-CIO as well as making other false representations.\n\n\n\"Preliminary investigation by the staff has disclosed certain financial transactions of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters which require explanation.\n\n\n\"One of these transactions involves very large expenditures in the publication of a book entitled, `The Portrait of an American Labor Leader, William L. Hutcheson.'\n\n\n\"Maurice Hutcheson, who is now president of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, and Mr. Raddock will be questioned about this matter.\n\n\n\"The Chair may say that during the existence of this committee we have had much information and a great deal of testimony regarding the misuse of union funds, regarding personal financial gain and benefit and profit and expenditure of such funds by union officials, and we are still pursuing that aspect of labor-management relations.\n\n\n\"We have also had considerable evidence of collusion between \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 603]\n\u00a0\n management and union officials where they both profit at the expense of the men who work and pay the dues.\n\n\n\"In this particular instance, there is indication that the union membership have again been imposed upon by transactions that have occurred that we will look into as the evidence unfolds before us.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Hearings, 11932-11995, 12000-12006.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Investigation of Highway Right-of-Way Acquisition - State of Indiana, Hearings before a Subcommittee of the Committee on Public Works, U.S. Senate, 85th Cong., 1st Sess.

Hearings, 12060.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] The Committee's chief counsel stated that the question did not relate to the subject matter of the state indictment but \"to steps taken in a later conspiracy to present [prevent?] an indictment in Lake County, Ind.\" Hearings, 12074. Blaier's attorney argued that the answer could be used by the prosecution in the Indiana case to prove the continuation of the conspiracy. Whether the question involved the state indictment or not, the Committee's counsel conceded that Blaier might \"not want to answer the questions on the grounds it may tend to incriminate him, but not because he is under indictment or that I am asking questions dealing with the indictment.\" The chairman ruled, \"It may be a borderline case. I am unable to determine it at this time. The witness can exercise his privilege.\" Hearings, 12074.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] Hearings, 12115.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] Count 1: \"Has he [Mr. Raddock] received from the union payment for acts performed in your behalf and for you as an individual?\" Count 2: \"Have you, unrelated to this offense charged in the indictment now against you, engaged the services of Mr. Raddock, and have you paid him out of union funds for the performance of those services, to aid and assist you in avoiding or preventing an indictment from being found against you or for being criminally prosecuted for any other offense other than that mentioned in this indictment?\" Count 3: \"Did you engage the services of Mr. Raddock and pay him for those services out of union funds, to contact, either directly or indirectly, the county prosecuting attorney, Mr. Holovachka, given name Metro, in Lake County, Gary, Ind.?\" Count 4: \"Have you paid Max C. Raddock out of union funds for personal services rendered to you at any time within the past 5 years?\" Count 5: \"Have you used union funds to pay Max C. Raddock for any services rendered to you personally, wholly disassociated from any matters out of which the pending criminal charge arose?\" Count 6: \"Was he there [in Chicago] on union business for which the union had the responsibility for payment?\" Count 7: \"Was Mr. Raddock paid on that trip, the expenses of his paid by union funds while he was on union business?\" Count 8: \"You were out in Chicago at the same time?\" Count 9: \"Were your expenses on that Chicago trip paid by the union?\" Count 10: \"Were you out in Chicago at that time on union business?\" Count 11: \"Do you know Mr. James Hoffa?\" Count 12: \"Did you make an arrangement with Mr. Hoffa that he was to perform tasks for you in return for your support on the question of his being ousted from the A.

Henkel and United States v. Murdock were founded on a misreading of an earlier decision of this Court, United States v. Saline Bank, 1 Pet. 100, which was delivered by Chief Justice Marshall. It is argued that Saline Bank stands for the proposition that the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination may be invoked in a federal court if the information divulged may aid a state prosecution. It is abundantly clear, however, that Saline Bank stands for no constitutional principle whatever. It was merely a reassertion of the ancient equity rule that a court of equity will not order discovery that may subject a party to criminal prosecution. In fact, the decision was cited in support of that proposition by an esteemed member of the very Court that decided the case. 2 Story, Commentaries on Equity, 1494, n. 1 (1836).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] Typical of such disclaimers are the following:\n\n\"The CHAIRMAN. I understand, it very clear now, that you are not invoking the fifth amendment privilege?\n\n\n\"Mr. HUTCHESON. That is right, sir, I am not invoking it.\n\n\n\"The CHAIRMAN. You are not exercising that privilege?\n\n\n\"Mr. HUTCHESON. No, sir.\n\n\n\"The CHAIRMAN. You are challenging the question and the jurisdiction of the committee for the reasons you have stated and for those reasons only?\n\n\n\"Mr. HUTCHESON. Yes, sir.\n\n\n\"The CHAIRMAN. All right. We have a clear understanding about that.\" Hearings, 12116.\n\n\n\"The CHAIRMAN. And, again, not invoking the privilege of the fifth amendment, you stand only and solely upon the statement you have read?\" [See pp. 605-606, supra.]\n\n\n\"Mr. HUTCHESON. Yes, sir.\n\n\n\"The CHAIRMAN. And you are not exercising the privilege that, by answering, a truthful answer might tend to incriminate you?\n\n\n\"(Witness conferred with counsel.)\n\n\n\"Mr. HUTCHESON. No, sir.\" Hearings, 12117.\n\n\n Further disclaimers of the same tenor will be found at Hearings, 12119, 12121-12122, and 12124. Petitioner did not explain at the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 610]\n\u00a0\n hearings why he went to such pains to avoid any appearance of invoking the privilege against self-incrimination. However, the following colloquy between petitioner and a member of the Committee sheds some light on his motivation:\n\n\"Senator ERVIN. Mr. Chairman, may I ask one or two questions along that line and then I will subside?\n\n\n\"Mr. Hutcheson, you are familiar with the provisions of the AFL-CIO ethical code concerning officers of affiliated unions who invoke the fifth amendment; aren't you?\n\n\n\"Mr. HUTCHESON. Yes, sir.\n\n\n\"Senator ERVIN. In that connection I would like to state that this is my opinion of the law, though it may not be your counsel's. The only reason for recognizing the right that a man may not testify concerning matters involved in an indictment against him arises out of the fact that the indictment is probably the strongest kind of evidence that anything he may say in reference to it may be construed to incriminate him, and that the only reason that a man has a right to refrain from answering matters about an indictment is the fact that what he may say about those matters may tend to incriminate him.\n\n\n\"Therefore, Mr. Hutcheson, don't you realize that what you are doing is that you are seeking to avoid an expressed violation? In other words, you are seeking to get the benefit of the fifth amendment without invoking it so that you will not run the risk of committing an offense against the ethical code of the A. F. of L.-CIO?\n\n\n\"(The witness conferred with his counsel.)\n\n\n\"Mr. HUTCHESON. Sir, I have been following the advice of counsel on the grounds outlined by me.\n\n\n\"Senator ERVIN. Well, you are concerned that there shall be no actual or apparent violation on your part of the provisions of the A. F. of L.-CIO code of ethics concerning union officers who invoke the fifth amendment when asked about their official conduct, aren't you?\n\n\n\"Mr. HUTCHESON. Yes, sir.\" Hearings, 12124-12125.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] While the Committee did not press Blaier to answer questions relating to the Lake County grand jury proceedings after he had refused to do so on the same grounds as those advanced by the petitioner, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 612]\n\u00a0\n there is nothing to indicate that this resulted from the Committee's understanding that those grounds included a claim of the Fifth Amendment privilege.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] The suggestion made in dissent that the questions which petitioner refused to answer were \"outside the power of a committee to ask\" (post, p. 638) under the Due Process Clause because they touched on matters then pending in judicial proceedings cannot be accepted for several reasons. First: The reasoning underlying this proposition is that these inquiries constituted a legislative encroachment on the judicial function. But such reasoning can hardly be limited to inquiries that may be germane to existing judicial proceedings; it would surely apply as well to inquiries calling for answers that might be used to the prejudice of the witness in any future judicial \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 614]\n\u00a0\n proceeding. If such were the reach of \"due process\" it would turn a witness' privilege against self-incrimination into a self-operating restraint on congressional inquiry, see 8 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed.), 2268; p. 20, infra, and would in effect pro tanto obliterate the need for that constitutional protection.\n\nSecond: The only decision relied on in support of this broad proposition is Kilbourn v. Thompson, \n103 \nU.S. 168\n, which because of its \"loose language\" has been severely discredited, e. g., United States v. Rumely, \n345 \nU.S. 41, 46\n, and which cannot well be taken to stand for the pervasive principles for which it is presently relied on. (Post, pp. 630, 632-636.) At most, Kilbourn is authority for the proposition that Congress cannot constitutionally inquire \"into the private affairs of individuals who hold no office under the government\" when the investigation \"could result in no valid legislation on the subject to which the inquiry referred.\" \n103 \nU.S., at 195\n. The tangible fruits of the labors of the McClellan Committee (pp. 615-617, infra) show that such is not the case here.\n\nThird: It hardly seems an impairment of \"individual liberties protected by the Bill of Rights\" (post, p. 630) to limit a witness who makes such a \"due process\" objection to the scope of the privilege against self-incrimination granted by the Fifth Amendment. If neither the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the State from using the witness' answer nor the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibits the Federal Government from asking the question, it is difficult to understand \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 615]\n\u00a0\n how it can be said that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibits the inquiry because any answer may be used by a State.\n\nFourth: It should be noted that although this congressional inquiry was related to the subject matter of the state indictment, the questions that were asked of the petitioner did not bear directly on his guilt or innocence of the state charges. Indiana's concern was not with whether union funds or influence had been misused; indeed there is no suggestion that the alleged bribery of the Indiana highway official was consummated with funds other than the personal profits reaped by the petitioner and others from their unlawful transactions. On the other hand, Congress' concern was whether, on some later date, union funds had been used to stifle criminal proceedings that had been brought against the petitioner personally. How such payments were made, if they were in fact made, would certainly be a consideration in the establishment of a federal reporting and disclosure system for union funds.\n\nFinally, \"the least possible power adequate to the end proposed\" phrase in Anderson v. Dunn, 6 Wheat. 204, 231 (post, pp. 632, 636, 638) scarcely bears upon the issue presented by this case. That expression was used in the Anderson case not in connection with anything having to do with the permissible scope of congressional inquiry, but solely with respect to \"the extent of the punishing power\" inherently possessed by the Congress. Id., at 230-231.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] The Committee had information tending to show that the Teamsters Union, with whose officers petitioner was friendly, purchased for $40,000 some real estate in Gary, Indiana, worth approximately $3,800. The seller in this transaction was a corporation which then proceeded to purchase Holovachka's interest in another failing corporation for an amount substantially in excess of its value. See Second Interim Report of the Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor or Management Field, S. Rep. No. 621, pt. 2, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. 558-560 (1959).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] The meagerness of the Committee's finding on this subject stands in marked contrast to its findings on the Hutcheson biography, with respect to which the petitioner and the other witnesses had testified with comparative freedom. Whereas 17 pages of the Second Interim Report are devoted to summarizing the evidence regarding the publication of the biography, only six pages related to the Lake County \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 619]\n\u00a0\n proceedings. Second Interim Report of the Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor or Management Field, S. Rep. No. 621, pt. 2, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. 533-550, 554-560 (1959). It is relevant to observe in this regard that ten of the questions with respect to which the petitioner was subsequently indicted related to the possible use of union funds for the purpose of suppressing the Lake County grand jury proceeding. See note 12, Counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 14, 17.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] In relevant part this statement was:\n\n\"We are inquiring into the situation in connection with the presentation before the grand jury in Lake County, Ind.; the intervention by certain union officials into that matter, and the part that was played by Mr. Hutcheson himself, Mr. Sawochka, the secretary-treasurer of local 142 of the Teamsters, and Mr. James Hoffa, the international president of the Teamsters.\n\n\n\"The CHAIRMAN. Is there some information that either union funds were used in the course of these transactions or that the influence of official positions of high union officials was used in connection with this alleged illegal operation?\n\n\n\"Mr. KENNEDY. We have information along both lines, Mr. Chairman, not only the influence but also in connection with the expenditure of union funds.\n\n .  .  .  .   .\n\n\n\n\"The CHAIRMAN. That is the interest of this committee in a transaction of this kind or alleged transaction of this kind, to ascertain again whether the funds or dues money of union members is being misappropriated, improperly spent, or whether officials in unions are using their position to intimidate, coerce, or in any way illegally promote transactions where the public interest is involved.\n\n\n\"Mr. Raddock, you have heard a background statement. That is not evidence, but it is information, however, which the committee has, regarding this matter out there. The committee is undertaking to inquire into this in pursuit of the mandate given to it by the resolution creating the committee.\" Hearings, 12021.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] The full statement was:\n\n\"The testimony further indicates that certain high officials of both the Teamsters and the Carpenters Union, two of the largest unions in the country, with the help and assistance of Mr. Raddock were involved in a conspiracy to subvert justice in the State of Indiana.\n\n\n\"All the facts regarding this conspiracy undoubtedly have not been developed by the committee.\n\n\n\"Further exposure we believe can and should be made. We will be glad to assist and help law enforcement officials in the State of Indiana if they determine that they would interest themselves in the matter.\" Hearings, 12132.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 21\n] At the contempt trial Senator McClellan explained his statement as follows:\n\n\"Our legislative function had been performed in seeking information regarding crimes and improper activities. Some evidence had been presented indicating the possibility of a further crime involving this defendant possibly and officers of another large union. It has been our practice to cooperate with state and federal officials where any evidence is developed before us with respect to a crime having been committed. Our legislative purpose is to search out and find if crime has been committed.\n\n\n\"My statement here is to the effect that if the state officials desired to pursue any testimony that we had developed, we would cooperate with them and make the record available to them.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 22\n] Second Interim Report, S. Rep. No. 621, pt. 2, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. 592 (1959).\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, concurring in the result.\n\nI join in the judgment affirming the Court of Appeals, but not in my Brother HARLAN'S opinion.\n\nThe Select Committee assured petitioner that it would respect his reliance upon his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, but petitioner deliberately and explicitly chose not to exercise that privilege. In that circumstance, the case is not one for reconsideration of Hale v. Henkel, \n201 \nU.S. 43\n, and United States v. Murdock, \n284 \nU.S. 141\n. I adhere, however, to my view that in a proper case we should reconsider the holdings of Hale and Murdock that, in a federal proceeding, possible incrimination under state law presents no basis for invoking the Fifth Amendment privilege. See Knapp v. Schweitzer, \n357 \nU.S. 371, 381\n (concurring opinion); see also Cohen v. Hurley, \n366 \nU.S. 117, 154\n (dissenting opinion).\n\nThe petitioner's constitutional claims find no support, in my view, in Kilbourn v. Thompson, \n103 \nU.S. 168\n. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 623]\n\u00a0\n That case involved a congressional inquiry into the settlement of a claim against a bankrupt firm. The settlement was said to threaten depletion of the bankrupt estate to the injury of other creditors, including the United States. The Court held that the subject matter was outside legislative cognizance because it was a matter inherently and historically for adjustment by the judicial branch, and because there was no hint of a legislative purpose to be served by the inquiry - \"it could result in no valid legislation on the subject to which the inquiry referred.\" \n103 \nU.S., at 195\n.\n\nThe congressional inquiry before us here is in sharp contrast to that in Kilbourn. The Select Committee was seeking factual material to aid in the drafting and adopting of remedial legislation to curb misuse by union officials of union funds - unquestionably a proper legislative purpose. The pending Marion County indictment did not involve misuse of union funds but the alleged bribery of a state official in connection with a sale of land to the State. However, the congressional inquiry and the state prosecution crossed paths when the Committee learned that union funds might have been used in a corrupt attempt to forestall an earlier indictment in another county, Lake, for the same alleged bribery. It seems to me obvious that the Committee's interrogation of the petitioner about the use of union funds to forestall that indictment did not stray beyond the range of the Committee's valid legislative purpose. It may be that, under Indiana law, evidence of the attempt, although not essential, would be admissible at the trial under the Marion County indictment.\n1\n But this hardly converts the Committee's \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 624]\n\u00a0\n inquiry about the attempt into a legislative rehearsal of the trial of the Marion County indictment, bringing the inquiry within Kilbourn's condemnation of legislative usurpation of judicial functions.\n\nWhen a congressional inquiry and a criminal prosecution cross paths, Congress must accommodate the public interest in legitimate legislative inquiry with the public interest in securing the witness a fair trial. Whether a proper accommodation has been made must be determined from the vantage point of the time of petitioner's appearance before the Committee.\n\nAny thought that some of our recent decisions, e. g., Barenblatt v. United States, \n360 \nU.S. 109\n; Wilkinson v. United States, \n365 \nU.S. 399\n; Braden v. United States, \n365 \nU.S. 431\n, weakened the vitality of our holding in Watkins v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 178, 187\n, that the congressional power of inquiry is not \"an end in itself; it must be related to, and in furtherance of, a legitimate task of the Congress,\" is dispelled by today's strong expression of continued adherence to that vital principle. Investigation conducted solely to aggrandize the investigator or punish the investigated, either by publicity or by prosecution, is indefensible - it exceeds the congressional power: exposure for the sake of exposure is not legislative inquiry.\n\n\"[T]he power to investigate must not be confused with any of the powers of law enforcement . . . .\" Quinn v. United States, \n349 \nU.S. 155, 161\n; see United States v. Icardi, 140 F. Supp. 383. On the other hand, so long as the subject matter is not in \"an area in which Congress is forbidden to legislate,\" Quinn, supra, at 161, the mere fact that the conduct under inquiry may have some relevance to the subject matter of a pending state indictment cannot absolutely foreclose congressional inquiry. Surely it cannot be said that a fair criminal trial and a full power of inquiry are interests that defy accommodation. The \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 625]\n\u00a0\n courts, responsible for protecting both these vital interests, will give the closest scrutiny to assure that indeed a legislative purpose was being pursued and that the inquiry was not aimed at aiding the criminal prosecution. Even within the realm of relevant inquiry, there may be situations in which fundamental fairness would demand postponement of inquiry until after an immediately pending trial, or the taking of testimony in executive session - or that the State grant a continuance in the trial. On what is before us now, I think that the facts fail to show that this inquiry was unable to proceed without working a serious likelihood of unfairness. Examining the challenged questioning in the full context of the congressional inquiry and its relevance to legislation in process, leads me to conclude that petitioner was not questioned for exposure's sake.\n\n\n The Select Committee began its hearings in 1957. The Committee engaged from the start in gathering facts which led to the conclusion that legislation requiring labor organizations to report and disclose various matters about their operation was necessary. The Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, 73 Stat. 519, resulted. Many features of that statute stem from facts learned by the Select Committee's examination into the affairs of several labor organizations, though the drafting was the work of the Senate Subcommittee on Labor and the House Subcommittee on Labor-Management Relations.\n2\n The Subcommittees and their parent Standing Committees framed the statute after considering the Select Committee's findings. See, e. g., S. Rep. No. 1684, 85th Cong., 2d Sess. 1 (1958); S. Rep. No. 187, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. 2 (1959); H. R. Rep. No. 741, 86th Cong., 1st \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 626]\n\u00a0\n Sess. 1 (1959); see also S. Doc. No. 10, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. 1 (1959). The bills reported out by those Committees recited that their purpose was \"[t]o provide for the reporting and disclosure of certain financial transactions and administrative practices of labor organizations and employers, to prevent abuses in the administration of trusteeships by labor organizations, to provide standards with respect to the election of officers of labor organizations . . . .\" The second paragraph of the Preamble to the bills included the following: \"The Congress further finds, from recent investigations in the labor and management fields, that there have been a number of instances of breach of trust, corruption, disregard of the rights of individual employees, and other failures to observe high standards of responsibility and ethical conduct which require further and supplementary legislation . . . .\" S. 1555 and H. R. 8342, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. (1959); see also S. 3974, 85th Cong., 2d Sess. (1958).\n\nAt the opening of the Select Committee's hearings on February 26, 1957, the Chairman, Senator McClellan, noted petitioner's union as one of those that the Committee intended to investigate. Hearings, 2. Although the Committee's hearings during the 16 months before they reached petitioner were very full, they had touched upon the affairs of only a few unions, and petitioner's was only the fourth union inquired into with a particular view toward discovering modes of misusing union funds. See Hearings, at 2581, 3221, 7512, and 11786. Petitioner was subpoenaed on May 20, 1958, to appear before the Committee on June 2; his own appearance was put off to June 27, although testimony of other witnesses was taken commencing on June 4. Three months before he was subpoenaed, the state indictment against him was handed up, on February 18, 1958. He was not tried until November 1960, about 29 months after his appearance before the Committee. At the time he appeared, the questioning \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 627]\n\u00a0\n was directly relevant to the Committee's efforts to inform itself and Congress and to secure legislation within congressional power to enact, aimed at correcting just such evils as those about which petitioner was questioned. Earlier in June 1958, a labor-management reporting and disclosure bill, the Kennedy-Ives Bill, was reported out by the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare and passed by the Senate, but in August it failed of passage in the House. 104 Cong. Rec. 10657, 11486-11487, 18287-18288. Therefore a bill was reintroduced on January 20, 1959, now known as the Kennedy-Ervin Bill. In introducing it, Senator Kennedy read a letter from ex-Senator Ives which said: \"[The bill] is designed to meet the objectives set forth in the report of the Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor or Management Field.\" 2 N. L. R. B., Legislative History of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, p. 968. The Senate Subcommittee on Labor then conducted intensive hearings on that and alternative bills.\n3\n In opening those hearings, Senator Kennedy said \"We expect further recommendations from the McClellan committee in its second annual report, and we expect to have the advice of an expert panel on labor law revision which will form the basis of further hearings and another bill later this year.\"\n4\n Reliance on the work of the Select Committee was evident and significant in those hearings. Hearings before the House Subcommittee began after the conclusion of the hearings by the Senate Subcommittee, and continued into June.\n5\n Spirited debate over the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 628]\n\u00a0\n merits of the proposed legislation continued throughout that session of Congress until enactment as the Act of September 14, 1959, Pub. L. 86-257. Section 2 (b) of the declaration of findings, purposes, and policy incorporates the above-quoted findings of the second paragraph of the Kennedy-Ervin Bill. It was not until 14 months after passage that petitioner was tried.\n\nThe questioning of petitioner comes into focus against this background of an inquiry begun by the Select Committee more than a year before petitioner's indictment and continued by both the Select Committee and the Senate and House Labor Subcommittees well after petitioner's appearance, all aimed at and culminating in legislation. In this light, petitioner's interrogation emerges as but one step in the process of fact-gathering to establish the necessity for and the nature of remedial legislation, and I cannot say that it was an unnecessary step, or that the record supports a conclusion that the Select Committee questioned petitioner to affect his state trial.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] We are informed that the petitioner was convicted under the indictment at a trial held some 29 months after his appearance before the Committee, but we are not informed whether the Committee proceedings were part of the State's proofs or otherwise affected the trial. Clearly, however, any contention as to unfairness in his state trial must abide review of that conviction.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The Select Committee's membership throughout included two members of the Senate Subcommittee on Labor, Senators Kennedy and Goldwater, who participated actively in the work of both Committees.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Hearings before the Subcommittee on Labor of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, on Labor-Management Reform Legislation, 86th Cong., 1st Sess.

(March through June 1959).\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS joins, dissenting.\n\nThis case highlights the problem of defining constitutional limitations upon congressional committees endowed with compulsory process. And because I firmly believe that continued sanction of investigative powers leading to abridgment of individual rights seriously impairs the intent of the Framers of our Bill of Rights, I dissent from MR. JUSTICE HARLAN'S treatment of the constitutional issue presented here. That issue may be simply stated: Is it a violation of the constitutional guarantee of due process of law for a legislative committee, under the circumstances of this case, to inquire into matters for which the witness is about to be tried under a pending criminal indictment? \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 629]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe petitioner, already indicted and awaiting trial in a state court, was subpoenaed to testify before a congressional committee investigating union activity and union funds. When the questioning led to matters concerning facts upon which the state indictment was based,\n1\n the dilemma the petitioner found facing him was this: if he answered truthfully his answers might aid the pending prosecution;\n2\n if he answered falsely, he could have been prosecuted for perjury;\n3\n and, if he relied on the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination, that fact could be admitted against him in the state criminal trial.\n4\n MR. JUSTICE HARLAN'S opinion now holds that petitioner's dilemma had a fourth horn; he may also be sent to jail for refusing to choose imposition of one of these penalties. I believe that neither the Constitution nor our past decisions allow Congress to enlist the aid of the federal courts to do to this man what four members of the Court permit. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 630]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn 1821 this Court held for the first time in Anderson v. Dunn, 6 Wheat. 204, that although the Constitution did not expressly grant to Congress the power to conduct investigations, such a power, within legislative competence, could be implied because it is inherent in the lawmaking process. This investigative function of Congress is, of course, entirely independent of the judicial branch of the Government in strict separation-of-power terms. However, Congress, no less than other branches of the Government, is bound to safeguard individual liberties protected by the Bill of Rights, and it is the duty of the courts to insure that the specific guarantees of liberty are preserved for witnesses before a legislative body just as they are guarded for the benefit of defendants in a criminal court trial. This duty cannot be performed nor can the judicial conscience be stilled by a kind of hand-washing statement that a legislative committee (in some instances a committee of a single person delegated with full investigative power) may finally determine for the courts, not only the importance and relevancy of a matter under investigation, but also that the committee has the constitutional power to ask the questions it wants to ask at the moment. A full Court decided in Kilbourn v. Thompson, \n103 \nU.S. 168\n, that the courts must ultimately determine who shall be sent to jail and that only the courts may determine whether questions asked by a committee are within Congress' constitutional power of inquiry.\n5\n And in our more recent cases, \"[t]he \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 631]\n\u00a0\n central theme,\" as we stated in Watkins v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 178, 195\n, has been \"the application of the Bill of Rights as a restraint upon the assertion of governmental power in this form.\"\n6\n This includes all provisions of the Bill of Rights - the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, as well as that Amendment's protection against self-incrimination.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN'S opinion fails to recognize that the essence of petitioner's contention is that largely because of this Court's decisions in Hale v. Henkel, \n201 \nU.S. 43\n, and United States v. Murdock, \n284 \nU.S. 141\n, the interrogation on matters for which he had already been indicted was a violation of due process. Cf. Aiuppa v. United States, 201 F.2d 287, 300. The duty of courts to safeguard an individual's personal liberty and to protect him from being compelled to answer questions outside the constitutional power of Congress, to which I have referred above, is particularly pertinent when Congress has enlisted the aid of the federal courts to protect itself against contumacious conduct and recalcitrant witnesses. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 632]\n\u00a0\n 2 U.S.C. 192. In fulfilling their responsibilities under this statute the courts may not simply assume that every congressional investigation is constitutionally conducted merely because it is shown that great national interests lie in passing needed legislation.\n7\n To do so would be to abdicate the responsibility placed by the Constitution upon the judiciary to insure that no branch of the Government transgresses constitutional limitations. See Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137.\n\nAccommodation of the congressional need for particular information with the individual and national interest in assuring dispassionate protection for witnesses against unconstitutional encroachment upon their individual rights has proved to be an arduous task throughout this Nation's history. One principle, however, formulated to keep congressional power of punishment to compel testimony within the very narrowest of limits, seems to have withstood erosion by the passage of time and the ever-increasing complexities in carrying out the legislative function. That principle is that in exercising its power to compel testimony, Congress must utilize \"[t]he least possible power adequate to the end proposed.\" Anderson v. Dunn, 6 Wheat. 204, 230-231. And, in Kilbourn v. Thompson, supra, decided in 1880, this Court had occasion to emphasize the narrowness of this congressional power. In my opinion, the latter case is more like the instant one than any other in our reports and I believe the principles upon which it was decided call for a reversal of the conviction of petitioner here.\n8\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 633]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt is important, I believe, to reiterate the basic concept enunciated there: that it is for the courts, and not for Congress, in insuring to all persons the safeguards of the Bill of Rights, to establish the constitutional standards which must be observed before people in this country can legally be sent to prison. The case arose in this manner: While a United States District Court, pursuant to its competent jurisdiction, was administering the estate of the bankrupt firm of Jay Cook & Company, which owed money to the United States Government, the House of Representatives passed a resolution to investigate a settlement made by the trustee. The basis for this action was that the settlement allegedly would be to the disadvantage of creditors, including the Government, and that the courts were powerless to afford adequate relief \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 634]\n\u00a0\n because of the settlement. Kilbourn was subpoenaed to appear as a witness and to bring records, papers and maps \"pertinent to the question under inquiry.\" Kilbourn refused and was convicted by the House of contempt. In holding that the House had exceeded its power, a unanimous Court forcefully announced restrictions upon the congressional power to punish for contempt and, at the same time, made it emphatically clear that those restrictions are equally applicable to the congressional power to compel testimony. Thus, when a committee attempts to exercise an extraordinary and unwarranted assumption of judicial power, this Court must strike it down, just as it has done in a situation in which the power to investigate infringed upon powers of law enforcement agencies. Cf. Quinn v. United States, \n349 \nU.S. 155, 161\n.\n\nWhen the circumstances of the instant case are compared to those which prompted the Court to void the conviction in Kilbourn, a striking similarity emerges. Indeed, the major difference in the circumstances of the two cases - that is, that this case involves a criminal indictment pending against the witness while Kilbourn involved only a civil suit - would seem to make this case even stronger than Kilbourn. The Court's chief reliance for holding that Congress exceeded its powers in the Kilbourn case was that the transactions into which Congress inquired were pending in a court, that the investigation was one \"judicial in its character, and could only be properly and successfully made by a court of justice\"; and, since the inquiry \"related to a matter wherein relief or redress could be had only by a judicial proceeding, . . . that the power attempted to be exercised was one confined by the Constitution to the judicial and not to the legislative department of the government.\" Kilbourn v. Thompson, supra, at 192-193. The Court summed up its view of the circumstances that showed an absence of congressional power to ask Kilbourn the questions it did with \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 635]\n\u00a0\n this statement: \"The matter was still pending in a court, and what right had the Congress of the United States to interfere with a suit pending in a court of competent jurisdiction?\"\n\nIn this case the particular subject of the Committee's inquiry to which the petitioner objected was whether he had in the past been unfaithful to his union in administering its funds. An indictment was then pending against petitioner in a court of competent jurisdiction charging him with using those same funds for an unlawful purpose.\n9\n The congressional committee, just as the House in Kilbourn, had no power to grant the union relief or redress of any kind for that alleged breach of trust by petitioner. So far as Congress was concerned in Kilbourn, the differences between Jay Cook and its creditors were held to be their \"private affair\" about which Congress could not compel a witness to answer; thus, a pending civil case was enough to bar inquiries concerning the transactions in that litigation. There is far more reason, it seems to me, to apply that principle to this case where Congress attempts to compel a witness to supply testimony which could be used to help convict him of a crime.\n\nIn so viewing this matter I do not overlook the argument in MR. JUSTICE HARLAN'S opinion that this particular testimony was relevant to the congressional investigation of the handling of union funds by their officers in order to help Congress decide if it should enact legislation \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 636]\n\u00a0\n in this field, and, if so, what kind of legislation it should enact. Conceding that under Anderson and Kilbourn the Committee here had the power to ask general questions along this line, it does not follow that it could make detailed inquiries about the conduct of a witness that related specifically to a crime with which he was already charged and for which he was soon to be tried in a court of competent jurisdiction.\n10\n Not only would it be contrary to the holding in Kilbourn to conclude otherwise, but it is incomprehensible to me how it can be urged that Congress needed the details of how petitioner committed this alleged crime in order to pass general legislation about union funds. It would be hard, indeed, I believe, to make rational proof that to refuse to Congress the power to compel testimony from a witness about a matter for which he is about to be tried criminally, would invade the area of \"[t]he least possible power adequate\" to enable Congress to legislate about union officers and union funds.\n\nIn my view, it is not a satisfactory approach to problems involving principles of constitutional dimension to look first to the interests of the Government and, if they loom large in the particular instance, to go no further. The countervailing principles embodied in our Bill of Rights do not demand attention only when the governmental interest lacks compulsion. The Bill of Rights demands much more than that. In judging whether Congress has used \"[t]he least possible power adequate to the end proposed,\" the courts must assure that any possible infringement on personal rights be minimized. In this determination the courts must consider factors such as the degree of need of the investigating committee for \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 637]\n\u00a0\n the particular information requested and whether the Committee is able to get the desired information from some evidentiary source other than from a witness presently under criminal indictment on a charge relating to those very facts. The fact that in this case Indiana appears to have had sufficient evidence to secure an indictment against the petitioner is adequate indication that independent sources of information were easily available to the Committee by which it could have obtained the very information it sought here without jeopardizing the constitutional rights of the petitioner by asking him about it. Moreover, it cannot be argued with persuasion that Congress would be met with an insurmountable barrier in gathering needed information if a defendant in a pending criminal trial could not be compelled to answer questions before a legislative committee relevant to that indictment. Congress has shown that it has at its command means for removing any such barrier. See Adams v. Maryland, \n347 \nU.S. 179\n.\n\nThe process through which the result has been reached in MR. JUSTICE HARLAN'S opinion seems to me to ignore the very reasons the Bill of Rights was incorporated into our Constitution. Those provisions were adopted as, and are intended to be, restraints upon actions by the Government which trespass upon personal liberties reserved to the individual in our society. If, as I believe, the Constitution has barred the Government from proceeding in a particular instance, despite the conceded validity of its interest in the testimony, the courts are duty bound to stand fast against any impairment of the individual's guaranteed rights. Congress cannot, by imposing upon the courts the responsibility for committing persons to jail for contempt of its committees, expect or require the courts to apply lower standards than are compelled by the Bill of Rights, any more than it could direct the courts to suppress those same rights in judicial proceedings. The \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 638]\n\u00a0\n Bill of Rights, not Congress, establishes the standards which must be observed before people in this country may legally be sent to jail. A congressional committee has the power to compel testimony to aid it in shaping legislation, but it does not have the power merely to publicize a citizen's shortcomings or to aid a State in convicting him of crime. I consider a procedure which pinions a citizen within a dilemma such as was created by the circumstances of this case, and which goes beyond \"[t]he least possible power\" adequate to accomplish Congress' constitutionally permissible ends, a direct encroachment upon rights secured by due process of law. To send this man to jail for his refusal to answer questions that, because of the circumstances of this case, are outside the power of a committee to ask is, as Kilbourn v. Thompson held, a plain denial of that process guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment to our Federal Constitution. I would reverse the conviction.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] MR. JUSTICE HARLAN seems to question the relation of the questions asked by the Committee with the subject matter of the state indictment (see pp. 617-618, ante). Of course Congress' concern was whether union funds had been used for an unlawful purpose, whereas the State was concerned with how the funds had been unlawfully used. However, a truthful answer to the question asked by the Committee would a fortiori have answered the State's inquiry if in fact the petitioner had used union funds in violation of state law. As stated by MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN in his concurring opinion (see p. 623, ante): \". . . [T]he congressional inquiry and the state prosecution crossed paths when the Committee learned that union funds might have been used in a corrupt attempt to forestall an earlier indictment in another county . . . for the same alleged [offense].\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Davidson v. State, 205 Ind. 564, 569, 187 N. E. 376, 378.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 18 U.S.C. 1621.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Crickmore v. State, 213 Ind. 586, 592-593, 12 N. E. 2d 266, 269; State v. Schopmeyer, 207 Ind. 538, 194 N. E. 144. And, by our decisions, such a use by the state court would not be barred. Adamson v. California, \n332 \nU.S. 46\n; Twining v. New Jersey, \n211 \nU.S. 78\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] \n103 \nU.S. 168, 197\n:\n\n\"If they [the House of Congress] are proceeding in a matter beyond their legitimate cognizance, we are of opinion that this can be shown, and we cannot give our assent to the principle that, by the mere act of asserting a person to be guilty of a contempt, they thereby establish their right to fine and imprison him, beyond the power of any court or any other tribunal whatever to inquire into the grounds on which the order was made. This necessarily grows out of the nature of an \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 631]\n\u00a0\n authority which can only exist in a limited class of cases, or under special circumstances; otherwise the limitation is unavailing and the power omnipotent.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] This principle is not a new or novel one. Again in Kilbourn, the Court made this observation (\n103 \nU.S., at 190\n-191):\n\n\"It is believed to be one of the chief merits of the American system of written constitutional law, that all the powers intrusted to government, whether state or national, are divided into the three grand departments, the executive, the legislative, and the judicial. That the functions appropriate to each of these branches of government shall be vested in a separate body of public servants, and that the perfection of the system requires that the lines which separate and divide these departments shall be broadly and clearly defined. It is also essential to the successful working of this system that the persons intrusted with power in any one of these branches shall not be permitted to encroach upon the powers confided to the others, but that each shall by the law of its creation be limited to the exercise of the powers appropriate to its own department and no other.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] \"The tendency of modern decisions everywhere is to the doctrine that the jurisdiction of a court or other tribunal to render a judgment affecting individual rights, is always open to inquiry, when the judgment is relied on in any other proceeding.\" Kilbourn v. Thompson, supra, at 197-198. (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] I am certain that it will come as a great surprise to many to learn that Kilbourn has been \"severely discredited,\" as stated in MR. JUSTICE HARLAN'S opinion (p. 614, note 16, ante), and that it no longer \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 633]\n\u00a0\n stands to prevent the congressional body of our Government from encroaching upon the exercise of judicial power. The reference to United States v. Rumely, \n345 \nU.S. 41, 46\n, where MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER indicated in a dictum designed to reserve decision upon a suggested limit of Congress' investigative power, that Kilbourn contained \"loose language,\" is hardly the method this Court has chosen to overrule or \"discredit\" decisions in the past. Indeed, neither have we chosen to do so in footnotes. Moreover, MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER'S reliance in Rumely on McGrain v. Daugherty, \n273 \nU.S. 135, 170\n-171, and Sinclair v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 263\n, to support his statement that \"substantial inroads\" have been made on Kilbourn is rather confusing in light of our recent pronouncement in Watkins v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 178, 194\n, that: \"In McGrain . . . and Sinclair . . ., the Court applied the precepts of Kilbourn to uphold the authority of the Congress to conduct the challenged investigations.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\nKilbourn has also been cited favorably or without a question of its continued validity in other recent decisions of the Court: e. g., Barenblatt v. United States, \n360 \nU.S. 109, 133\n (opinion by HARLAN, J.); Tenney v. Brandhove, \n341 \nU.S. 367, 377\n (opinion by FRANKFURTER, J.: \"This Court has not hesitated to sustain the rights of private individuals when it found Congress was acting outside its legislative role. Kilbourn v. Thompson, \n103 \nU.S. 168\n.\"); Uphaus v. Wyman, \n360 \nU.S. 72, 84\n (dissenting opinion).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Contrary to the implication drawn in MR. JUSTICE HARLAN'S opinion that the principle to which I would adhere in the instant case would also apply \"to inquiries calling for answers that might be used to the prejudice of the witness in any future judicial proceeding\" (p. 613, note 16, ante), it seems obvious that nothing in this opinion gives support to such an inference. In fact, I believe a careful reading of it would make clear that it is specifically because of the pending nature of the state indictment that due process has been violated by this inquiry.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] The State's delay subsequent to the Committee's investigation in bringing the petitioner to trial seems hardly relevant to our inquiry. The speed with which the State's judicial process moves cannot justify an otherwise unconstitutional exercise of federal legislative power.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting.\n\nI agree with the Court that the questions asked petitioner by the Committee were within its competence and were pertinent to the legislative inquiry. I do not think, however, that under the circumstances disclosed, the federal courts should lend a hand in fining him or in sending him off to prison.\n\nFour months before these hearings, petitioner had been indicted in an Indiana court for felonies that involved directly or indirectly the matters concerning which the Committee questioned him. If he had refused to answer because of the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment, his plea would have been admissible in the Indiana prosecution. State v. Schopmeyer, 207 Ind. 538, 542-543, 194 N. E. 144, 146. And by our decisions (see Adamson v. California, \n332 \nU.S. 46\n) such a use would not \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 639]\n\u00a0\n be barred. So, under advice of counsel, petitioner did not refuse to answer on the ground of self-incrimination. Rather, he refused to answer on the ground that the questions might \"aid the prosecution in the case in which I am under indictment and thus be in denial of due process of law.\"\n\nThe power to hold in contempt a witness who refuses to testify before a congressional committee has a dual aspect. First is the power of either the House or the Senate to summon him and order him held in custody until he agrees to testify. This power, though not used in recent years (Watkins v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 178, 206\n), is of an ancient vintage.\n1\n But the power of either House to imprison the witness expires at the end of the session. As stated in Anderson v. Dunn, 6 Wheat. 204, 231, \". . . although the legislative power continues perpetual, the legislative body ceases to exist on the moment of its adjournment or periodical dissolution. It follows, that imprisonment must terminate with that adjournment.\"\n\nSecond is the power of the courts to punish witnesses who are recalcitrant or defiant before a congressional committee or who, when summoned, default. 2 U.S.C. 192. This law, enacted in 1857, was passed so that \"a greater punishment\" than the Congress thought it had the power to impose could be inflicted. Watkins v. United States, supra, 207, n. 45. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 640]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe deal here with the second of these powers.\n\nThe federal courts do not sit as push-button mechanisms to fine or imprison those whom Congress refers to the United States Attorney for prosecution.\n\nThere is, for example, the case where no quorum of the congressional committee is present when the witness is charged with contempt. As said in Christoffel v. United States, \n338 \nU.S. 84, 90\n, \"This not only seems to us contrary to the rules and practice of the Congress but denies petitioner a fundamental right. That right is that he be convicted of crime only on proof of all the elements of the crime charged against him. A tribunal that is not competent is no tribunal, and it is unthinkable that such a body can be the instrument of criminal conviction.\" (Italics supplied.)\n\nWe held in Slagle v. Ohio, \n366 \nU.S. 259, 265\n-266, that though a legislative committee acts within bounds, yet the form of questions asked and rulings on objections to them may be so obtuse as to make it violative of due process for courts to punish a refusal to answer.\n2\n Cf. Quinn v. United States, \n349 \nU.S. 155, 167\n-168.\n\nA court will not lend its hand to inflict punishment on a person for contempt of a congressional committee where the proceeding was fundamentally unfair.\n3\n The proceeding \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 641]\n\u00a0\n was held unfair in Watkins v. United States, supra, because it was far from clear that the questions asked by the Committee were \"pertinent\" to the question under inquiry. Id., 204-214. \"Fundamental fairness,\" we said, demands that the witness be informed \"what the topic under inquiry is and the connective reasoning whereby the precise questions asked relate to it.\" Id., at 215. Vagueness in investigatory inquiries, like vagueness in criminal statutes, may not give a witness the notice that is necessary under our standards of due process. Id., at 208.\n\nThere is, I submit, a fundamental unfairness when we make it impossible for a witness to invoke a privilege which the Constitution grants him, and then send him off to jail when the privilege we withhold would have protected him. The guarantee against self-incrimination would have given petitioner full and complete immunity but for our decisions in cases like Adamson v. California, supra, and Cohen v. Hurley, \n366 \nU.S. 117\n. Those decisions, however, make his plea of self-incrimination admissible in the pending prosecution in the Indiana court. When we say that the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment is not applicable to the States by reason of the Fourteenth Amendment, we turn a federal proceeding into a pretrial of the state prosecution, should the witness invoke his constitutional right. Since he dare not invoke it for fear of going to a state prison, he ends up in a federal prison. The result is to turn the guarantee against self-incrimination into a sham. A witness is whipsawed between state and federal agencies, having no way to escape the federal prison unless he confesses himself into a state prison.\n\nWe have at times said that this Hobson's choice granted a witness is a product of federalism. Feldman v. United States, \n322 \nU.S. 487, 493\n, was, indeed, a case where the testimony of a man compelled to testify in a state proceeding \n\n[369 \nU.S. 599, 642]\n\u00a0\n sent him to a federal prison. But the result of this line of cases is a needless consequence of federalism, and one that makes the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination a \"phrase without reality.\" Cohen v. Hurley, supra, at 132 (dissenting opinion). Why due process for the States should be different in this respect from due process for the Federal Government is a mystery. We should overrule Adamson v. California, supra, and hold that no admission made by a witness in a federal proceeding nor any refusal to testify can be used against him in a state prosecution. Until we take that course, we cannot in good conscience send a man to a federal prison who goes there solely because we deprived him of a basic constitutional guarantee.\n\nWhat we do today is consistent with our prior decisions in Hale v. Henkel, \n201 \nU.S. 43\n; United States v. Murdock, \n284 \nU.S. 141\n. Yet the result is unfair. This case, like its forebears, shows why we should rid the books of Adamson v. California, supra, and hold that the privilege against self-incrimination contained in the Fifth Amendment is applicable to the States and to the Federal Government alike.\n\nThere has never, in my view, been a satisfactory answer to the position of the first Justice Harlan that due process in the Fourteenth Amendment does not mean something different from due process in the Fifth Amendment. See Hurtado v. California, \n110 \nU.S. 516, 541\n et seq.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] As stated in Stockdale v. Hansard, 1839. 9 A. & E. 1, 114:\n\n\"The privilege of committing for contempt is inherent in every deliberative body invested with authority by the constitution. But, however flagrant the contempt, the House of Commons can only commit till the close of the existing session. Their privilege to commit is not better known than this limitation of it. Though the party should deserve the severest penalties, yet, his offence being committed the day before a prorogation, if the house ordered his imprisonment but for a week, every court in Westminster Hall and every judge of all the courts would be bound to discharge him by habeas corpus.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Sinclair v.

Bicks et al., U.S. District Judges, on petition for writ of mandamus.\n\n Having been informed by officials of the State of New York that its business of selling bottled wines and liquors for export from the United States and delivery to international airline passengers at their overseas destinations was illegal under a state statute, petitioner sued in a Federal District Court for a judgment declaring that the statute, as applied, was repugnant to the Commerce Clause, the Export-Import Clause, and the Supremacy Clause of the Federal Constitution and for an injunction against its enforcement. A request for a three-judge court under 28 U.S.C. 2281, 2284 was denied, and the single District Judge to whom it was presented simply retained jurisdiction of the cause, in order to give the state courts an opportunity to pass upon the constitutional issues presented, although there was no relevant litigation then pending in the state courts. The Court of Appeals expressed the opinion that a three-judge court should have been convened but that it was powerless to direct such action. Thereafter petitioner moved again for a three-judge court; but the motion was again denied. Held: A three-judge court should have been convened, and the case is remanded to the District Court for expeditious action in accordance with this view. Pp. 714-716.\n\n Reported below: 289 F.2d 426.\n\nCharles H. Tuttle argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs was John F. Kelly.\n\nJulius L. Sackman argued the cause for respondents.

Lefkowitz, Attorney General of New York, and Paxton Blair, Solicitor General. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 713, 714]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\nThe petitioner is in the business of selling bottled wines and liquors for export from the United States and delivery to international airline passengers at their overseas destinations. Upon advice of the Attorney General of New York, the State Liquor Authority informed the petitioner that its business was illegal under the provisions of the New York Alcoholic Beverage Control Law. The petitioner then instituted an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the respondents, members of the State Liquor Authority. The complaint asked for a judgment declaring that the state statutes, as applied, were repugnant to the Commerce Clause, the Export-Import Clause, and the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, and for an injunction restraining the State Liquor Authority from interfering with the petitioner's business.\n\nA request for a three-judge court under 28 U.S.C. 2281, 2284, was denied. Instead, the district judge to whom the request was presented simply retained jurisdiction of the cause, in order to give the state courts an opportunity to pass upon the constitutional issues presented, although there was no relevant litigation then pending in the state courts. 188 F. Supp. 434.\n\nThe petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\n1\n That court dismissed the appeal, one judge dissenting. 289 F.2d 426. Unambiguously stating its opinion that the District Court had acted erroneously, and that \"a three-judge district court should have been convened,\" the Court of Appeals was nevertheless \n\n[370 \nU.S. 713, 715]\n\u00a0\n of the view that it was powerless to take formal corrective action in light of this Court's decision in Stratton v. St. Louis S. W. R. Co., \n282 \nU.S. 10\n.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nThereafter the petitioner once again filed a motion in the District Court requesting that a statutory three-judge court be impaneled. The request was again refused upon the ground that the previous ruling made by other judges of the District Court had established \"the law of this case,\" and that the Court of Appeals' opinion that a three-judge court should be appointed was merely a \"dictum.\" 194 F. Supp. 3. We granted certiorari and a motion for leave to file a petition for a writ of mandamus. \n368 \nU.S. 812\n.\n\nWe agree with the Court of Appeals that a three-judge court should have been convened in this case. When an application for a statutory three-judge court is addressed to a district court, the court's inquiry is appropriately limited to determining whether the constitutional question raised is substantial, whether the complaint at least formally alleges a basis for equitable relief, and whether the case presented otherwise comes within the requirements of the three-judge statute. Those criteria were assuredly met here, and the applicable jurisdictional statute therefore made it impermissible for a single judge to decide the merits of the case, either by granting or by withholding relief.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nIn the Stratton case it was held that a court of appeals was precluded from reviewing on the merits a case which \n\n[370 \nU.S. 713, 716]\n\u00a0\n should have originally been determined by a court of three judges. Stratton does not stand for the broad proposition that a court of appeals is powerless ever to give any guidance when a single judge has erroneously invaded the province of a three-judge court. The Court of Appeals clearly stated its opinion that a court of three judges ought to have been convened to consider this litigation. That view was correct and should have been followed upon the petitioner's renewed motion that such a statutory court be impaneled.\n\nWe deem it unnecessary to take formal action on the petition for a writ of mandamus. The case will be remanded to the District Court for expeditious action consistent with the views here expressed. Cf. Bailey v. Patterson, \n369 \nU.S. 31, 34\n.\n\n    It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the decision of these cases.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN and MR.

Petitioner, who was counsel for the union, believed that the ex parte restraining order was invalid under state law and that the controversy was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board, and he so advised the union and also advised it that the best way to test the order was to continue picketing and, if the pickets were held in contempt, to appeal or to test any order of commitment by habeas corpus. The union followed petitioner's advice, and the court held petitioner in contempt for disobeying or resisting its restraining order. Although petitioner was given an opportunity to be heard, he was not allowed to testify in his own behalf, the proceeding being restricted to sentencing him for contempt. Held: Conviction of petitioner for contempt without a hearing and an opportunity to establish that the state court was acting in a field reserved for the National Labor Relations Board violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Smith.\n\nBen Neidlinger argued the cause for respondent. With him on the briefs was Harry Friberg.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner, a member of the Ohio bar, has been held in contempt of a state court and sentenced to jail and fined. He brought this habeas corpus proceeding in the state courts challenging, inter alia, their jurisdiction to \n\n[369 \nU.S. 689, 690]\n\u00a0\n punish him for the conduct in question. He was denied relief by the Supreme Court of Ohio on a divided vote, 172 Ohio St. 269, 175 N. E. 2d 59. We granted the petition for certiorari, \n368 \nU.S. 894\n.\n\nThe matter in dispute arose out of a management-labor controversy. The employer sought and obtained from the state court an injunction against picketing. Petitioner had been retained by the International Longshoremen's Association to represent the local involved in this labor dispute and when advised by the clerk of the court that a petition for an injunction had been requested, he said he would be ready any time for a hearing. The injunction, however, was issued ex parte. Petitioner immediately asked for a hearing; but none was granted. At the time the ex parte injunction issued, the union had on file with the National Labor Relations Board an unfair labor practice charge, but no hearing had been held on it.\n\nPetitioner, believing that under Ohio Rev. Code, 1954, 2727.06 the restraining order was invalid because it was issued without a hearing and that the controversy was properly one for the National Labor Relations Board and not for the state court, advised the union officials that the restraining order was invalid and that the best way to contest it was to continue picketing and, if the pickets were held in contempt, to appeal or to test any order of commitment by habeas corpus. The union officials agreed on that course of action and the picketing continued.\n\nPetitioner again sought to obtain a hearing on his motion to vacate the restraining order. But the judge said none could be had for a week. Thereupon petitioner and opposing counsel agreed to submit four pickets for a contempt hearing and to stipulate the facts.\n\nHe produced the four pickets the following day and the judge held them in contempt, giving them two days to purge themselves. At the end of the two days another hearing was held; the pickets did not purge themselves. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 689, 691]\n\u00a0\n Petitioner made clear at this hearing and at the earlier one that it was he who had advised the union to test the injunction by risking contempt. The judge held him in contempt for disobeying or resisting \"a lawful writ, process, order, rule, judgment, or command\" of the court. Ohio Rev. Code, 1954, 2705.02. While an opportunity was given petitioner to be heard, petitioner was not allowed to testify on his own behalf, the judge ruling that the only purpose of the hearing was to sentence petitioner.\n\nThere was a hearing in the Ohio Court of Appeals when a petition for habeas corpus was filed; and at that hearing the undisputed facts showed that the employer was engaged in interstate commerce, that when the contempt order was issued an unfair labor practice charge involving the same dispute as the picketing was pending before the National Labor Relations Board, and that the picketing which had been enjoined was peaceful picketing.\n\nRespondent argues that the controversy between the employer and the union involved no attempt to organize workers and no refusal of the employer to bargain but only the enforcement of a \"no-strike\" clause in a collective bargaining agreement which was left by Congress either to federal courts (Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills, \n353 \nU.S. 448\n) or to state courts. Teamsters Local v. Lucas Flour Co., \n369 \nU.S. 95\n.\n\nPetitioner, however, argues that the unfair labor practice charge filed with the National Labor Relations Board was based on the refusal of the employer to bargain in good faith and that the collective bargaining agreement which the employer asked the state court to enforce had been signed by unauthorized agents.\n\nWe said in In re Oliver, \n333 \nU.S. 257, 275\n, that procedural due process \"requires that one charged with contempt of court be advised of the charges against him, have a reasonable opportunity to meet them by way of defense or explanation, have the right to be represented \n\n[369 \nU.S. 689, 692]\n\u00a0\n by counsel, and have a chance to testify and call other witnesses in his behalf, either by way of defense or explanation.\"\n\nPetitioner was guilty of no misconduct that fell within the category of acts which constitute contempt in open court, where immediate punishment is necessary to prevent \"demoralization of the court's authority\" (id., at 275) or the other types of contempt considered in Brown v. United States, \n359 \nU.S. 41\n. The question was whether the state court was trenching on the federal domain. The issue thus tendered emphasizes one important function that a hearing performs. It is impossible to determine from this record whether or not the dispute was exclusively within the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board under the principles of San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, \n359 \nU.S. 236\n, and Amalgamated Association v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Board, \n340 \nU.S. 383\n. The Ohio court could not know whether it was within bounds in citing a person for contempt for violating the injunction without such a hearing. For, as Amalgamated Association v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Board, supra, held, a state court is without power to hold one in contempt\n1\n for violating an injunction that the state court had no power to enter by reason of federal pre-emption. Even if we assume that an ex parte order could properly issue as a matter of state \n\n[369 \nU.S. 689, 693]\n\u00a0\n law, it violates the due process requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment\n2\n to convict a person of a contempt of this nature without a hearing and an opportunity to establish that the state court was acting in a field reserved exclusively by Congress for the federal agency. When an activity is \"arguably\" subject to the National Board the States must defer to its \"exclusive competence,\" \"if the danger of state interference with national policy is to be averted.\" San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, supra, at 245.\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER and MR. JUSTICE WHITE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] One of the companion cases in Amalgamated Association v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Board, supra, was No. 438, United Gas Workers v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Board, in which a conviction for contempt for not obeying a restraining order issued by the state court (258 Wis. 1, 44 N. W. 2d 547) was reversed. \n340 \nU.S. 383, 386\n, 399. The opinion was written by Chief Justice Vinson who also wrote the opinion in United States v. United Mine Workers, \n330 \nU.S. 258\n. The latter case involved a restraining order of a federal court and presented no question of pre-emption of a field by Congress where, if the federal policy is to prevail, federal power must be complete.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Cf. Ex parte Bradley, 7 Wall. 364, 375; Hovey v. Elliott, \n167 \nU.S. 409\n.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE CLARK joins, dissenting in part and concurring in part.\n\nI agree that this contempt conviction must be set aside, but not for the reasons given by the Court.\n\nIn United States v. United Mine Workers, \n330 \nU.S. 258, 289\n-295, this Court held that disobedience of a temporary restraining order issued by a court whose claim to jurisdiction over the underlying proceeding is not frivolous may be punished as criminal contempt even if it is determined on appeal that such jurisdiction was lacking. This holding was not new, United States v. Shipp, \n203 \nU.S. 563\n; Howat v. Kansas, \n258 \nU.S. 181\n, and it has not been departed from since. It is the law of Ohio, Ohio Contractors Assn. v. Local 894, Hod Carriers' Union, 108 Ohio App. 395, 162 N. E. 2d 155. It was one ground of decision below, 172 Ohio St. 269, 274-275, 175 N. E. 2d 59, 62-63, and is relied on here by respondent. However, the Court in its opinion gives only a passing glance at the Mine Workers decision. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 689, 694]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe injunction petition out of which this contempt proceeding arose alleged that the posting of union pickets \"and the calling of a strike by so doing\" violated the no-strike clause of a collective bargaining agreement signed by union representatives who claimed authority to contract. The assertion of state court jurisdiction to redress violation of such an agreement has recently been upheld in Charles Dowd Box Co. v. Courtney, \n368 \nU.S. 502\n, and can hardly be deemed to have been frivolous before that decision. It does not become frivolous because an argument might be made for holding the state court powerless to issue an injunction in such a case, see Dowd Box, supra, \n368 \nU.S., at 514\n, n. 8, or because it is arguable either that no contract was concluded in this case or that the picketing did not constitute a breach of such a contract. Local 174, Teamsters Union v. Lucas Flour Co., \n369 \nU.S. 95, 101\n, makes clear that the rule stated in San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, \n359 \nU.S. 236, 245\n, ousting state courts from dealing in tort with activities even arguably subject to 7 or 8 of the National Labor Relations Act, does not apply when relief is sought for breach of an alleged collective bargaining agreement. State jurisdiction was upheld in Lucas Flour, although the activity there would have been protected by 7 if not forbidden by a contract provision whose interpretation was fairly disputed, and thus was still arguably protected.\n\nAccordingly, unless Mine Workers is distinguishable, the state court in this instance had power to punish petitioner for contempt even though it may ultimately be determined that it lacked jurisdiction over the injunction suit itself. The Court seeks to find such a distinction in the fact that Mine Workers involved a federal restraining order, whereas in Amalgamated Assn. of Bus Employees v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Board, \n340 \nU.S. 383\n, where state jurisdiction was found to be \n\n[369 \nU.S. 689, 695]\n\u00a0\n preempted by the National Labor Relations Act, a state court restraining order pendente lite was set aside. The Amalgamated case, however, did not involve an alleged breach of a labor agreement. The Mine Workers principle was neither relied on by the state court in Bus Employees nor argued here, and there is nothing in this Court's opinion in that case which suggests that the State would have been without power to reinstate the original contempt order on the basis of Mine Workers if that rule were followed in Wisconsin. Moreover, the Court's opinion in the present case does not enlighten us as to why the Mine Workers principle should not obtain in a \"preemption\" case. Indeed, I would have supposed that if a federal court can preserve the status quo pending resolution of a disputed question as to its jurisdiction, the considerations in favor of allowing a state court to take such action in the same situation are at least as strong, if not stronger.\n\nIt is suggested that the federal policy behind preemption of state jurisdiction in Labor Board cases would be frustrated if the Mine Workers rule were to be considered applicable in a case such as this. But the policy underlying the preemption doctrine cannot well be thought stronger than the policy of the Norris-LaGuardia Act. The restraining order was issued in Mine Workers despite the commands of the Norris-LaGuardia Act - a statute specifically directed towards proscribing the issuance of injunctive orders in labor disputes.\n*\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 689, 696]\n\u00a0\n\n\nPetitioner's argument that the restraining order must be ancillary to a dispute over which the court has admitted jurisdiction scarcely serves to explain either United States v. Shipp, supra, in which the Court assumed that jurisdiction of the entire controversy depended on whether the Constitution had been violated, or Howat v. Kansas, supra, in which the jurisdiction of the state court, apart from the validity of the statute attacked, was relied on only as an alternative holding. Whether a restraining order is thus ancillary or not, respect for the orderly process of law requires obedience to it until a debatable issue of jurisdiction can be authoritatively decided. United States v. United Mine Workers, supra, \n330 \nU.S., at 309\n-310 (FRANKFURTER, J., concurring). Petitioner would limit the rule to injunctive orders issued to preserve the status quo. Even so, the power of the court to act pending decision of the jurisdictional issue surely does not depend upon whether a strike has begun an hour before the complaint is filed or is to begin an hour later.\n\nNevertheless, I agree that for a different reason petitioner's conviction did not comport with the requirements of due process. For the record shows that the petitioner was deprived of an opportunity to prove that contempt proceedings against the pickets were agreed to among himself, his adversary, and the judge as the appropriate way to test the court's jurisdiction over the basic lawsuit. Petitioner offered to testify - and his proffered testimony appears not to have been disputed - that \"I was convinced that both the Judge and Mr. Ragan [opposing counsel] were aware that I had consented to bring these men before the court and stipulate the essential matters \n\n[369 \nU.S. 689, 697]\n\u00a0\n for the express purpose of testing the validity of the court's order and its jurisdiction over the subject matter.\" Yet petitioner was denied the right to present this testimony.\n\nI agree with the dissenting judge in the Ohio Court of Appeals, 47 L. R. R. M. 2230, 2233, that there is a vast difference between a defendant openly contumacious and defiant of a court order and one who disobeys the order pursuant to an understanding with court and counsel in order to test the underlying jurisdictional issues. If petitioner's contentions are true, he cannot be punished for violating the order after this agreement, and therefore he has a right to be heard. In re Oliver, \n333 \nU.S. 257, 275\n.\n\nOn this basis I agree that the state contempt order must be set aside.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] The very argument now advanced here by the majority opinion was made by Mr. Justice Murphy, dissenting, in the Mine Workers case (\n330 \nU.S., at 341\n): \"But we are acting here in the unique field of labor relations, dealing with a type of order which Congress has definitely proscribed. If we are to hold these defendants in contempt for having violated a void restraining order, we must close our eyes to the expressed will of Congress and to the whole history of equitable \n\n[369 \nU.S. 689, 696]\n\u00a0\n restraints in the field of labor disputes. We must disregard the fact that to compel one to obey a void restraining order in a case involving a labor dispute and to require that it be tested on appeal is to sanction the use of the restraining order to break strikes - which was precisely what Congress wanted to avoid.\" \n\n[369 \nU.S. 689, 698]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","99":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nIN RE KELLEY(1962)\nNo. 733\nArgued: Decided: February 19, 1962\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\nThe appeal is dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n                  QUINTON v.

At the very outset of the trial, the judge had ruled erroneously that the plaintiff's counsel could not try to prove the conspiracy charge; but, in order to comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 43 (c) and thus preserve his client's rights on appeal, petitioner in the presence of the jury persisted in asking questions intended to lay the proper foundation for offers of proof of conspiracy. The judge ordered petitioner to stop doing so; but petitioner insisted that he had a right to do so and said he would continue to do so \"unless some bailiff stops us.\" However, a recess was then called and thereafter petitioner asked no more of the forbidden questions. Held: There was nothing in this conduct sufficiently disruptive of the trial court's business to \"obstruct the administration of justice,\" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 401, and a judgment sustaining the conviction is reversed. Pp. 230-236.\n\n 294 F.2d 310, reversed.\n\nThomas C. McConnell, petitioner, argued the cause and filed briefs pro se.\n\nPhilip R. Monahan argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Cox and Assistant Attorney General Miller.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe petitioner Thomas C. McConnell, a lawyer, was summarily found guilty of contempt of court for statements made while representing the Parmelee Transportation Company in an antitrust suit for treble damages \n\n[370 \nU.S. 230, 231]\n\u00a0\n and an injunction. The complaint charged that a number of defendants had unlawfully conspired to destroy Parmelee's business by restraining and monopolizing trade in violation of the Sherman Act.\n1\n Petitioner and his co-counsel, Lee A. Freeman, had done extensive pretrial preparation on the issue of conspiracy which was the heart of their case. At the very outset of the trial, however, the district judge on his own motion refused to permit counsel to try to prove their conspiracy charge, holding that they must first prove in a wholly separate trial that defendants' actions had resulted in an economic injury to the public - an erroneous holding since we have held that the right of recovery of a plaintiff in a treble damage antitrust case does not depend at all on proving an economic injury to the public.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nCut off by the judge's erroneous ruling from trial of the basic issue of conspiracy and wishing to provide a record which would allow this ruling to be reviewed by the Court of Appeals, counsel for Parmelee asked counsel for defendants to stipulate that plaintiff would have introduced certain evidence of conspiracy had it been allowed to do so. Defense counsel refused to stipulate, however, insisting that Parmelee's counsel prepare their record by following the procedure set out in Rule 43 (c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which requires that before an offer of proof is made questions upon which the offer is based must first be asked in the presence of the jury.\n3\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 230, 232]\n\u00a0\n Unwilling to risk dismissal of their appeal for failure to follow Rule 43 (c), Parmelee's counsel proceeded to produce and question witnesses in the presence of the jury in order to lay the proper foundation for their offers of proof of conspiracy. But during the process of this questioning the judge ordered it stopped and directed that any further offers of proof be made without first having asked questions of witnesses in the presence of the jury. This ruling placed Parmelee's counsel in quite a dilemma because defense counsel was still insisting that all offers of proof be made in strict compliance with Rule 43 (c) and there was no way of knowing with certainty whether the Court of Appeals would treat the trial court's order to dispense with questions before the jury as an excuse for failure to comply with the Rule. Petitioner therefore not only sought to make clear to the court that he thought defense counsel's objection was \"right\"\n4\n but also repeatedly insisted that he be allowed to make his offers of proof in compliance with the Rule.\n5\n Following the trial the judge charged petitioner and his co-counsel Freeman in a number of specifications with being guilty of contemptuous \n\n[370 \nU.S. 230, 233]\n\u00a0\n conduct during the course of the trial. After separate hearings both lawyers were summarily found guilty by the trial judge on all specifications. Both appealed to the Court of Appeals, which reversed all of Freeman's convictions,\n6\n reversed two of petitioner McConnell's convictions, but, with Judge Duffy dissenting, sustained the conviction of petitioner on Specification 6 - the specification based on petitioner's insistence that he be allowed to make offers of proof in compliance with Rule 43 (c).\n7\n Even as to this conviction, however, the Court of Appeals held that the jail sentence imposed by the trial judge should be reduced to a fine of $100. As in Offutt v. United States,\n8\n the \"importance of assuring alert self-restraint in the exercise by district judges of the summary power for punishing contempt\" prompted us to bring the case here.\n9\n\u00a0\n\nThe statute under which petitioner was summarily convicted of contempt is 18 U.S.C. 401, which provides that:\n\n \"A court of the United States shall have power to punish by fine or imprisonment, at its discretion, such contempt of its authority, and none other, as -\n\n\n \"(1) Misbehavior of any person in its presence or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice . . . .\"\n\n\n This section is based on an Act passed in 1831\n10\n in order to correct serious abuses of the summary contempt power that had grown up and was intended as a \"drastic delimitation . . . of the broad undefined power of the inferior federal courts under the Act of 1789,\"\n11\n revealing \"a Congressional \n\n[370 \nU.S. 230, 234]\n\u00a0\n intent to safeguard Constitutional procedures by limiting courts, as Congress is limited in contempt cases, to `the least possible power adequate to the end proposed.'\"\n12\n \"The exercise by federal courts of any broader contempt power than this,\" we have said, \"would permit too great inroads on the procedural safeguards of the Bill of Rights, since contempts are summary in their nature, and leave determination of guilt to a judge rather than a jury.\"\n13\n And we held long ago, in Ex parte Hudgings,\n14\n that while this statute undoubtedly shows a purpose to give courts summary powers to protect the administration of justice against immediate interruption of court business, it also means that before the drastic procedures of the summary contempt power may be invoked to replace the protections of ordinary constitutional procedures there must be an actual obstruction of justice:\n\n \"An obstruction to the performance of judicial duty resulting from an act done in the presence of the court is, then, the characteristic upon which the power to punish for contempt must rest. This being true, it follows that the presence of that element must clearly be shown in every case where the power to punish for contempt is exerted . . . .\"\n\n\n Thus the question in this case comes down to whether it can \"clearly be shown\" on this record that the petitioner's statements while attempting to make his offers of proof actually obstructed the district judge in \"the performance of judicial duty.\"\n\nThe Court of Appeals answered this question by sustaining Specification 6 only on the basis of petitioner's \n\n[370 \nU.S. 230, 235]\n\u00a0\n last sentence in the colloquy set out in the specification. That specification reads:\n\n \"On April 27, 1960, in the presence and hearing of the jury, after the Court had instructed the attorneys for plaintiff to refrain from repeatedly asking questions on subjects which the Court had ruled [were] not admissible, in the presence of the jury as distinguished from an offer of proof outside the presence of the jury, the following occurred:\n\n\n \"`By Mr. McConnell: Now you are trying to tell us we can't ask these questions. We have a right to ask these questions, and until we are stopped from asking these questions we are going to ask them, because it is in our prerogative in doing it.\n\n\n \"`By the Court: I am now stopping you from asking the questions about conversations with Mr. Cross, because I have ruled specifically, definitely and completely that it is not an issue in this case.\n\n\n \"`By Mr. McConnell: We have a right to ask them.\n\n\n \"`By the Court: You can offer proof on it.\n\n\n \"`By Mr. McConnell: We have a right to ask questions which we offer on this issue, and Your Honor can sustain their objection to them. We don't have a right to read the answers, but we have a right to ask the questions, and we propose to do so unless some bailiff stops us.'\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n The record shows that after this colloquy petitioner's co-counsel asked for a short recess, that following this recess petitioner did not continue to ask questions which the judge had forbidden and that in fact he did not ask any more such questions again throughout the remainder of the trial. We agree with Judge Duffy who dissented below that there was nothing in petitioner's conduct sufficiently \n\n[370 \nU.S. 230, 236]\n\u00a0\n disruptive of the trial court's business to be an obstruction of justice. It is true that petitioner stated that counsel had a right to ask questions that the judge did not want asked and that \"we propose to do so unless some bailiff stops us.\" The fact remains, however, that the bailiff never had to interrupt the trial by arresting petitioner, for the simple reason that after this statement petitioner never did ask any more questions along the line which the judge had forbidden. And we cannot agree that a mere statement by a lawyer of his intention to press his legal contention until the court has a bailiff stop him can amount to an obstruction of justice that can be punished under the limited powers of summary contempt which Congress has granted to the federal courts. The arguments of a lawyer in presenting his client's case strenuously and persistently cannot amount to a contempt of court so long as the lawyer does not in some way create an obstruction which blocks the judge in the performance of his judicial duty. The petitioner created no such obstacle here.\n\nWhile we appreciate the necessity for a judge to have the power to protect himself from actual obstruction in the courtroom, or even from conduct so near to the court as actually to obstruct justice, it is also essential to a fair administration of justice that lawyers be able to make honest good-faith efforts to present their clients' cases. An independent judiciary and a vigorous, independent bar are both indispensable parts of our system of justice. To preserve the kind of trials that our system envisages, Congress has limited the summary contempt power vested in courts to the least possible power adequate to prevent actual obstruction of justice, and we think that that power did not extend to this case.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER and MR.

JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE STEWART joins, dissenting.\n\nWith respect to the contempt count that was sustained by the Court of Appeals, this case involves nothing more than an ordinary exercise of the District Court's contempt power in aid of maintaining discipline and decorum in the courtroom. The most, I think, that could appropriately be said of the conviction on this count is that petitioner's unlawyerlike conduct did not merit a jail sentence. The Court of Appeals has removed all basis for criticism on that score by reducing the sentence to a $100 fine. In other respects its opinion displays an alert regard for the undoubted fact that the contempt power should always be exercised circumspectly and dispassionately, particularly when called into play by the conduct of an attorney in the course of sharply contested litigation.\n\nI can hardly believe that the Court intends its opinion to mean that only a physical obstruction of pending judicial proceedings is punishable under 18 U.S.C. 401. For a court's power to punish summarily for contempt has always been available as a sanction against the use of abusive and insulting language in a courtroom. See, e. g., Offutt v. United States, \n348 \nU.S. 11\n; Fisher v. Pace, \n336 \nU.S. 155, 159\n-160; Ex parte Terry, \n128 \nU.S. 289, 307\n-309. And it can scarcely be supposed that Congress' enactment of 18 U.S.C. 401 was intended to abrogate this power, even as the forerunner to that section was construed in In re Michael, \n326 \nU.S. 224, 228\n. Cf. Ex parte Hudgings, \n249 \nU.S. 378, 383\n.\n\nThis routine intracircuit affair presents nothing calling for the exercise of this Court's supervisory power, and the case would have been much better left with the Court of Appeals by a denial of certiorari.\n\nI would affirm. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 230, 238]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","101":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nIN RE SHUTTLESWORTH(1962)\nNo. 1073\nArgued: Decided: February 26, 1962\n\n\n\n\n Certiorari granted; order of Court of Appeals vacated; case remanded to District Court with instructions.\n\nWilliam M.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK concurs, dissenting.\n\nI think this appeal presents substantial federal questions and that jurisdiction should be noted.\n\nUnder 269 of the New York Surrogate's Court Act (now 269-a) a Czechoslovakian beneficiary of a New York estate has been denied the power to make a gift of her interest in the estate to her niece residing in England. This result flows from a determination by the Surrogate's Court of Bronx County that under its present government conditions are such in Czechoslovakia that it is unlikely the beneficiary would be able to enjoy her interest. Therefore its use was denied her entirely, though none of it, so far as this record shows, will ever reach Czechoslovakia.\n\nCzechoslovakia, though Communist, is a sovereign state recognized by the United States. The descent and distribution \n\n[371 \nU.S. 30, 31]\n\u00a0\n of property in one state to the citizens of another state is clearly a proper subject of international relations. See Geofroy v. Riggs, \n133 \nU.S. 258\n. The Constitution by Art. I, 10, imposes severe limitations on the several States' power to affect the foreign relations of the United States. \"[C]omplete power over international affairs is in the national government and is not and cannot be subject to any curtailment or interference on the part of the several states.\" United States v. Belmont, \n301 \nU.S. 324, 331\n. Thus, if New York has, in effect, regulated an area of our international relations that should be regulated only by the Federal Government, or if the New York statute conflicts with existing federal policy, then that statute cannot be given effect. For \"[i]f state action could defeat or alter our foreign policy, serious consequences might ensue. The nation as a whole would be held to answer if a State created difficulties with a foreign power.\" United States v. Pink, \n315 \nU.S. 203, 232\n. Cf. Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419.\n\nMany areas of our law reflect the view that foreign policy can be shaped solely by the Federal Government. Our courts will not inquire into the validity of an act of a recognized foreign state (Oetjen v. Central Leather Co., \n246 \nU.S. 297\n), even though the act is attacked on the ground that it had been enacted by an unfriendly nation and is violative of United States public policy, Bernstein v. Van Heyghen Freres S. A., 163 F.2d 246; Pons v. Republic of Cuba, 294 F.2d 925. Likewise, a foreign country is immune from suit for injuries caused in its commercial transactions (Berizzi Bros. Co. v. The Pesaro, \n271 \nU.S. 562\n), even though this result is not required by international law (Restatement, Foreign Relations Law of the United States, proposed official draft, 1962, 72). But, if the Executive Department of the Federal Government indicates its views on whether \n\n[371 \nU.S. 30, 32]\n\u00a0\n immunity should be allowed, those views will control. Republic of Mexico v. Hoffman, \n324 \nU.S. 30\n.\n\nAdmittedly, the several States have traditionally regulated the descent and distribution of estates within their boundaries. This does not mean, however, that their regulations must be sustained if they impair the effective exercise of the Nation's foreign policy. See Miller, The Corporation as a Private Government in the World Community, 46 Va. L. Rev. 1539, 1542-1549. Where those laws conflict with a treaty, they must give way to the superior federal policy. See Kolovrat v. Oregon, \n366 \nU.S. 187\n. Yet, even in absence of a treaty, a State's policy may disturb foreign relations. As we stated in Hines v. Davidowitz, \n312 \nU.S. 52, 64\n: \"Experience has shown that international controversies of the gravest moment, sometimes even leading to war, may arise from real or imagined wrongs to another's subjects inflicted, or permitted, by a government.\" Certainly a State could not deny admission to a traveler from Czechoslovakia nor bar its citizens from going there. Passenger Cases, 7 How. 283; Crandall v. Nevada, 6 Wall. 35; cf. Kent v. Dulles, \n357 \nU.S. 116\n. The present restraints are not as gross an intrusion in the federal domain as those others would be. Yet they affect international relations in a persistent and subtle way. The practice of state courts in withholding remittances to legatees residing in Communist countries or in preventing them from assigning them is notorious. Chaitkin, The Rights of Residents of Russia and its Satellites to Share in Estates of American Decedents, 25 So. Calif. L. Rev. 297.\n\nThe issue is of importance to our foreign relations and I think this Court should decide whether, under existing federal policy and practice, the New York statute should be given effect. The issue was raised in No. 123, 1953 Term, where the appeal was dismissed. In re Braier, 305 N. Y. 148, 111 N. E. 2d 424, app. dism. sub nom. \n\n[371 \nU.S. 30, 33]\n\u00a0\n Kalmane v. Green, \n346 \nU.S. 802\n. JUSTICES BLACK, DOUGLAS, and BURTON voting to note jurisdiction. The question seems substantial and does not seem to be foreclosed by Clark v. Allen, \n331 \nU.S. 503\n. We should note jurisdiction and ask the Solicitor General to file a brief.\n\nA substantial question of due process is also tendered. In New York the Surrogate apparently holds no hearing but simply determines that any payments to or by people behind the \"iron curtain\" are barred by the statute. See In re Geiger, 7 N. Y. 2d 109, 164 N. E. 2d 99. But, as said by Judge Froessel (and Judge Fuld) dissenting in that case:\n\n\"Had the Surrogate held a hearing, it might well have been developed, as alleged in the petition, that the beneficiaries are `all of advanced age, who are [now] living [in Hungary] under difficult conditions and are in great need of assistance', and that monetary assistance `can be transferred to them by sending food and clothing packages to each of them. . . free of duty and of any taxation'. It might well have been further developed that these nationals have no way of leaving Hungary; that they are the very victims of the `events in Hungary' to which the Surrogate referred; that they will probably die there and never receive the benefit of their legacies if the moneys are withheld; and that there are agencies which can assure delivery of food and clothing packages in reasonable amounts to named individuals.\n\n\n \"It seems to me that the Surrogate abused his discretion in failing to grant a hearing so that these facts might have been developed and the matter decided, not on the basis of an application to pay legacies to iron-curtain country nationals, but on the application as made, namely, to allow reasonable sums of money for conversion into food and clothing \n\n[371 \nU.S. 30, 34]\n\u00a0\n packages upon a proper showing that they would reach the beneficiaries.\" 7 N. Y. 2d, at 113-114, 164 N. E. 2d, at 101-102.\n\n\n This means that no one residing in Czechoslovakia may receive or make any disposition of property under a will probated in New York, even though it is done without the intercession of the foreign government or in fact without its knowledge, and even though there is no danger of the funds being confiscated or in fact being within Czechoslovakia's reach. If New York's purpose is to preclude unfriendly foreign governments from obtaining funds that will assist their efforts hostile to this Nation's interests, as In re Getream's Estate, 200 Misc. 543, 107 N. Y. S. 2d 225, and In re Renard's Estate, 179 Misc. 885, 39 N. Y. S. 2d 968, suggest, the complete prohibition of assignments made in those countries may have some basis in reason. But, if this is the purpose behind the statute, it seemingly is an attempt to regulate foreign affairs. If the statute is designed to effectuate the testator's intent, as appellees seem to argue, it would seem to have no basis in reason.\n\nViktoria Miculka, who was a distributee of an estate of a New York decedent, assigned at the American Embassy in Prague her interest in the estate to petitioner, her niece who lives in London. There is no connection between the fund in New York and Czechoslovakia because of the fact that Victoria Miculka resides in Czechoslovakia. There is no evidence whatsoever that any of the funds will ever reach Czechoslovakia. Victoria Miculka is an old woman who will probably never leave her homeland.

Egan, ante, p. 45, but calls for separate treatment. Appellants seek the reversal of a decision of the Supreme Court of Alaska, ___ Alaska ___, 362 P.2d 901, affirming the dismissal of their petitions for injunctions against interference with their operation of fish traps in southeastern Alaska.\n\nThe Organized Village of Kake and the Angoon Community Association are corporations chartered under the Wheeler-Howard Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 984, 988, as amended, 49 Stat. 1250 (1936), 25 U.S.C. 473a, 476, 477. Kake is located on Kupreanof Island, 100 miles south of Juneau. Angoon is located on Admiralty Island, 60 miles south of Juneau. They are occupied by Thlinget or Tlinget Indians, native to Alaska.\n\nBoth communities are entirely dependent upon salmon fishing. In pursuance of a policy to create a sound fishing economy for the two groups, the United States purchased canneries and related properties for Angoon in 1948 and for Kake in 1950. Since these dates appellants have operated fish traps at specified locations in nearby waters, under permits granted by the Army Engineers to erect traps in navigable waters and by the United States Forest Service to anchor them in the Tongass National Forest. In March 1959 the Secretary of the Interior, by regulations issued under authority of the White Act, 43 Stat. 464, as amended, 48 U.S.C. 221-228, and the Alaska Statehood Act, 72 Stat. 339, permitted Angoon to operate three fish traps during the 1959 season and Kake four. 24 Fed. Reg. 2053, 2069. The following year the Secretary authorized permanent operation of these trapsites and specified one additional site for Angoon and five \n\n[369 \nU.S. 60, 62]\n\u00a0\n more for Kake for possible future authorization. 25 CFR (1961 Supp.) pt. 88.\n\nThe history of this litigation is recited in Metlakatla Indian Community v. Egan, supra. It is sufficient to note here that Alaska in 1959 threatened to enforce against Kake and Angoon her anti-fish-trap conservation law, Alaska Laws 1959, c. 17, as amended by id., c. 95; that the State seized one fish trap at Kake, arrested the President of the Kake Village Council and the foreman of the crew attempting to moor the trap, and filed informations against them; that suit was filed by both Kake and Angoon in the interim United States District Court for Alaska to enjoin this interference with their claimed fishing rights; and that the dismissal of both complaints was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Alaska.\n\nThe situation here differs from that of the Metlakatlans in that neither Kake nor Angoon has been provided with a reservation and in that there is no statutory authority under which the Secretary of the Interior might permit either to operate fish traps contrary to state law. Appellants do not rely heavily on the Secretary's regulations. Neither the White Act nor the Statehood Act, cited by the Secretary, supports a grant of immunity from state law. The White Act was a conservation and anti-monopoly measure. It authorized the Secretary to limit fishing times, places, and equipment in order to conserve fish but forbade him in so doing to create exclusive rights, even in Indians. Hynes v. Grimes Packing Co., \n337 \nU.S. 86, 122\n-123. Because the rights claimed are exclusive in the Kakes and Angoons, they cannot have been created pursuant to the White Act, even though that statute now applies, if at all, only to Indians. Moreover, the White Act gives the Secretary power only to limit fishing, not to grant rights. The Statehood Act retained \"absolute jurisdiction and control\" of Indian \n\n[369 \nU.S. 60, 63]\n\u00a0\n \"property (including fishing rights)\" in the United States, but it did not give powers of the nature claimed to the Secretary of the Interior. No other source of authority appears available. The provisions now found in 25 U.S.C. 2 and 9, referring to the President's power to prescribe regulations for effectuating statutes \"relating to Indian affairs,\" to settle accounts of \"Indian affairs,\" and concerning \"the management of all Indian affairs and of all matters arising out of Indian relations,\" derive from statutes of 1832 and 1834, 4 Stat. 564 and 4 Stat. 735, 738. In keeping with the policy of almost total tribal self-government prevailing when these statutes were passed, see pp. 71-72, infra, the Interior Department itself is of the opinion that the sole authority conferred by the first of these is that to implement specific laws, and by the second that over relations between the United States and the Indians - not a general power to make rules governing Indian conduct. United States Department of the Interior, Federal Indian Law (1958), pp. 54-55; Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law (1945), p. 102. We agree that they do not support the fish-trap regulations.\n\nBoth communities operate their traps under permits granted by the Army Corps of Engineers and by the United States Forest Service. But neither of these permits grants a right to be free of state regulation or prohibition. Like a certification by the Interstate Commerce Commission, each is simply acknowledgment that the activity does not violate federal law, and not an exemption from state licensing or police power requirements. Cf. Maurer v. Hamilton, \n309 \nU.S. 598\n; South Carolina Highway Dept. v. Barnwell Bros., \n303 \nU.S. 177\n. The Engineers have no objection under the Rivers and Harbors Act, 30 Stat. 1121, 1151, 33 U.S.C. 403, to the obstruction of navigable streams incident to the operation of fish traps at Kake and Angoon; the Forest Service has \n\n[369 \nU.S. 60, 64]\n\u00a0\n no objection to the use of National Forest land to anchor them. Neither attempted to exempt these traps from state law.\n\nAs in the companion case, certain grounds relied on by the Alaska court are no longer urged by the State. The principal dispute now concerns the meaning of 4 of the Statehood Act, in which the State disclaimed all right and title to and the United States retained \"absolute jurisdiction and control\" over, inter alia, \"any lands or other property (including fishing rights), the right or title to which may be held by any Indians, Eskimos, or Aleuts (hereinafter called natives) or is held by the United States in trust for said natives.\"\n\nThe United States in its brief amicus curiae contended that the reservation of absolute jurisdiction over Indian \"property (including fishing rights)\" ousted the State from any regulation of fishing by Indians in Alaska. Appellants urge that Congress intended to protect the Indians in their freedom to continue fishing as they had done before statehood, so that Alaska cannot interfere with the Indian fishing actually practiced at that time. They argue in addition that in using fish traps they were exercising an aboriginal right to fish that was protected by 4. The court below concluded that aboriginal rights of Alaskan natives have been extinguished, that appellants have no rights not enjoyed in common with all other Alaskans, and that 4 protects only exclusive rights given Indians by federal law.\n\nThe United States wisely abandoned its position that Alaska has disclaimed the power to legislate with respect to any fishing activities of Indians in the State. Legislative history reveals no such intention in Congress, which was concerned with the protection of certain Indian claims in existence at the time of statehood. See, e. g., Hearings Before House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs on H. R. 2535 and related bills, 84th Cong., 1st Sess. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 60, 65]\n\u00a0\n 124-131, 266-267, 381-383 (1955). But we cannot accept Alaska's contention that Indian \"property (including fishing rights)\" refers only to property owned by or held for Indians under provisions of federal law. Section 4 must be construed in light of the circumstances of its formulation and enactment. See Alaska Pacific Fisheries v. United States, \n248 \nU.S. 78, 87\n. Congress was aware that few such rights existed in Alaska. Its concern was to preserve the status quo with respect to aboriginal and possessory Indian claims, so that statehood would neither extinguish them nor recognize them as compensable. See, e. g., House Hearings, supra, 130, 384 (1955) (Delegate Bartlett); Hearings Before Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs on S. 50, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. 227 (Senator Jackson), 260-261 (1954).\n1\n\u00a0\n\nDiscussion during hearings on the 1955 House bill affords further evidence that claims not based on federal law are included. Section 205 of that bill (like 6 of the bill as enacted) authorized Alaska to select large tracts of United States land for transfer to state ownership. It was understood that the disclaimer provision left the State free to choose Indian \"property\" if it desired, but that such a taking would leave unimpaired the Indians' right \n\n[369 \nU.S. 60, 66]\n\u00a0\n to sue the United States for any compensation that might later be established to be due. See House Hearings, supra, 135 (1955) (Delegate Bartlett). Feeling that experience had shown this procedure too slow to give prompt relief to the Indians, Oklahoma's Representative Edmondson proposed to exempt Indian property from the State's selection. Id., at 381. This was rejected as virtually destroying Alaska's right to select lands. For, although Representative Edmondson pointed out that the disclaimer extended only to property owned by Indians or held in trust for them, four representatives clearly stated their belief that the disclaimer included not just the few Alaska reservations but also the aboriginal or other unproved claims in dispute, which covered most if not all of Alaska. Id., at 383 (Representatives Engle, Dawson, Metcalf, Westland).\n\n\"Fishing rights\" first appeared in a Senate bill reported in 1951, S. Rep. No. 315, 82d Cong., 1st Sess. 2. Earlier bills had mentioned only land. The fishing-rights provision is unique to Alaska, although the disclaimer is in other respects the same as in earlier statutes. See pp. 67-68, infra. It was included because fishing rights are of vital importance to Indians in Alaska. House Hearings, supra, 125 (1955) (Delegate Bartlett). The existence of aboriginal fishing rights was affirmed by the Interior Department's Solicitor in 1942, 57 I. D. 461. There was almost no discussion of \"fishing rights\" in Congress. In earlier hearings the Senate Committee was considering a suggestion by Senator Cordon that all Indian property be granted to the State, reserving the right to seek federal compensation, except for property actually occupied by Indians. Asked to describe Indian possessory rights, Governor Heintzleman portrayed a smokehouse beside a stream, 50 miles from the town where they live, visited for fishing purposes perhaps two weeks each year. Senate Hearings, supra, 137 (1954). \n\n[369 \nU.S. 60, 67]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n On a similar basis the Kakes and the Angoons have fished at the disputed locations since 1948 and 1950. It appears to be Alaskan custom that, although traps are taken from the water and replaced each year, one does not \"jump\" a trap-site. The prior claim of the first trapper is respected. See United States v. Libby, McNeil & Libby, 14 Alaska 37, 42, 107 F. Supp. 697, 700 (D. Alaska 1952); Gruening, The State of Alaska (1954), p. 171; 57 I. D. 461, 462 (1942). The Statehood Act by no means makes any claim of appellants to fishing rights compensable against the United States; neither does it extinguish such claims. The disclaimer was intended to preserve unimpaired the right of any Indian claimant to assert his claim, whether based on federal law, aboriginal right or simply occupancy, against the Government. Appellants' claims are \"property (including fishing rights)\" within 4.\n\nBecause 4 of the Statehood Act provides that Indian \"property (including fishing rights)\" shall not only be disclaimed by the State as a proprietary matter but also \"shall be and remain under the absolute jurisdiction and control of the United States,\" the parties have proceeded on the assumption that if Kake and Angoon are found to possess \"fishing rights\" within the meaning of this section the State cannot apply her law. Consequently argument has centered upon whether appellants have any such \"rights.\"\n\nThe assumption is erroneous. Although the reference to fishing rights is unique, the retention of \"absolute\" federal jurisdiction over Indian lands adopts the formula of nine prior statehood Acts. Indian lands in Arizona remained \"under the absolute jurisdiction and control\" of the United States, 36 Stat. 557, 569; yet in Williams v. Lee, \n358 \nU.S. 217, 220\n, 223, we declared that the test of whether a state law could be applied on Indian \n\n[369 \nU.S. 60, 68]\n\u00a0\n reservations there was whether the application of that law would interfere with reservation self-government. The identical language appears in Montana's admission Act, 25 Stat. 676, 677, yet in Draper v. United States, \n164 \nU.S. 240\n, the Court held that a non-Indian who was accused of murdering another non-Indian on a Montana reservation could be prosecuted only in the state courts. The Montana statute applies also to North Dakota, South Dakota, and Washington. Identical provisions are found in the Acts admitting New Mexico (36 Stat. 557, 558-559) and Utah (28 Stat. 107, 108), and in the Constitutions of Idaho (1890, Art. 21, 19) and Wyoming (1890, Art. 21, 26), which were ratified by Congress (26 Stat. 215 (Idaho); 26 Stat. 222 (Wyoming)).\n\nDraper and Williams indicate that \"absolute\" federal jurisdiction is not invariably exclusive jurisdiction. The momentum of substantially identical past admission legislation touching Indians carries the settled meaning governing the jurisdiction of States over Indian property to the Alaska Statehood Act in light of its legislative history.\n\nSection 4 of the Statehood Act contains three provisions relating to Indian property. The State must disclaim right and title to such property; the United States retains \"absolute jurisdiction and control\" over it; the State may not tax it. On the urging of the Interior Department that Alaska be dealt with as had other States, these provisions replaced an earlier section granting to the State all lands not actually possessed and used by the United States. Hearings Before a Subcommittee of the House Committee on Public Lands on H. R. 206 and H. R. 1808, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 2, 12, 14 (1947). The first and third provisions have nothing to do with this case; the second does not exclude state conservation laws from appellants' fish traps. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 60, 69]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe disclaimer of right and title by the State was a disclaimer of proprietary rather than governmental interest. It was determined, after some debate, to be the best way of ensuring that statehood would neither extinguish nor establish claims by Indians against the United States. If lands subject to the claim of Indian rights were transferred to the State, the Indians were not thereby to lose the right to make claims against the United States for damages. See Senate Hearings, supra, 286 (1954).\n\nThe provision for \"absolute jurisdiction and control\" received little attention in Congress. In the 1954 Senate hearings the Committee was considering a provision copied from the Oklahoma statute that Indian lands should remain \"subject to the jurisdiction, disposal, and control of the United States.\" Mr. Barney, on behalf of the Justice Department, urged the inclusion of such a provision in order to avoid the possibility that, under United States v. McBratney, \n104 \nU.S. 621\n, federal criminal jurisdiction over Indian reservations might be extinguished by statehood. Senators Barrett and Jackson thereupon expressed the clear desire that federal jurisdiction not be made exclusive over all disclaimed areas. Mr. Barney denied that the provision would deprive the State of \"political jurisdiction\" over disclaimed properties. Senator Cordon declared:\n\n\"The State may well waive its claim to any right or title to the lands and still have all of its political or police power with respect to the actions of people on those lands, as long as that does not affect the title to the land.\"\n\n\n Senator Jackson said: \"All that you are doing here is a disclaimer of proprietary interest,\" and Mr. Barney agreed. Senator Cordon said:\n\n\"The act of admission gives to the State of Alaska political jurisdiction, including all that is meant by \n\n[369 \nU.S. 60, 70]\n\u00a0\n the term `police power,' within its boundaries unless there be express or definitely implied, which is the same thing, a reservation of exclusive jurisdiction in the United States.\"\n\n\n Senators Barrett and Jackson and Mr. Barney agreed. Mr. Slaughter of the Interior Department pointed out that a later section of the bill, now 11, provided for \"exclusive\" federal jurisdiction over Mt. McKinley National Park. Mr. Barney, in answer to a direct question, stated that \"jurisdiction\" in the Oklahoma statute and in his proposal for Indian property did not mean exclusive jurisdiction. Senate Hearings, supra, 283-287 (1954). The bill as reported contained no provision on jurisdiction but only a disclaimer of right and title, a reservation of federal power to extinguish Indian claims as if there had been no statehood Act, and an exemption from state taxation. Id., at 331. Provisions retaining federal \"jurisdiction\" and \"absolute jurisdiction\" were considered interchangeable by at least one committee, which reported the disclaimer in an Alaska bill as \"almost identical\" with those in the preceding 13 admission Acts. S. Rep. No. 315, 82d Cong., 1st Sess. 15 (1951).\n\nMost statehood bills contained the more common phrasing \"absolute jurisdiction and control\" rather than the Oklahoma phrase. Although this was the usual language employed to retain federal power in statehood acts, the Senate Committee in 1958 out of an abundance of caution deleted the word \"jurisdiction\" in order that no one might construe the statute as abolishing state power entirely. The Committee declared that it was not its intention by the retention of federal control to make the Alaska situation any different from that prevailing in other States as to state jurisdiction over Indian lands. S. Rep. No. 1163, 85th Cong., 1st Sess. 15 (1957). The House bill, which retained the usual language, was passed \n\n[369 \nU.S. 60, 71]\n\u00a0\n first, 104 Cong. Rec. 9756, and the Senate made no amendments to the House bill because it feared that statehood might be lost once again if the House had to act on a conference report. 104 Cong. Rec. 12009-12010. Senator Jackson stated that \"the differences are of wording and language rather than policy . . . designed to define more clearly some of the jurisdictional problems involved . . . . The objective of both bills is identical. There is strong evidence that the end product of both bills would be identical.\" The Senate amendment was designed simply to make clear what an examination of past statutes and decisions makes clear also: that the words \"absolute jurisdiction and control\" are not intended to oust the State completely from regulation of Indian \"property (including fishing rights).\" \"Absolute\" in 4 carried the gloss of its predecessor statutes, meaning undiminished, not exclusive. Cf. Boston Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 41, 47\n-48. The power of Alaska over Indians, except as granted by Congress in 1958, 72 Stat. 545, is the same as that of many other States.\n\nThe relation between the Indians and the States has by no means remained constant since the days of John Marshall. In the early years, as the white man pressed against Indians in the eastern part of the continent, it was the policy of the United States to isolate the tribes on territories of their own beyond the Mississippi, where they were quite free to govern themselves. The 1828 treaty with the Cherokee Nation, 7 Stat. 311, guaranteed the Indians their lands would never be subjected to the jurisdiction of any State or Territory. Even the Federal Government itself asserted its power over these reservations only to punish crimes committed by or against non-Indians. 1 Stat. 469, 470; 2 Stat. 139. See 18 U.S.C. 1152. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 60, 72]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs the United States spread westward, it became evident that there was no place where the Indians could be forever isolated. In recognition of this fact the United States began to consider the Indians less as foreign nations and more as a part of our country. In 1871 the power to make treaties with Indian tribes was abolished, 16 Stat. 544, 566, 25 U.S.C. 71. In 1887 Congress passed the General Allotment Act, 24 Stat. 388, as amended, 25 U.S.C. 331-358, authorizing the division of reservation land among individual Indians with a view toward their eventual assimilation into our society. In 1885, departing from the decision in Ex parte Crow Dog, \n109 \nU.S. 556\n, Congress intruded upon reservation self-government to extend federal criminal law over several specified crimes committed by one Indian against another on Indian land, 23 Stat. 362, 385, as amended, 18 U.S.C. 1153; United States v. Kagama, \n118 \nU.S. 375\n. Other offenses remained matters for the tribe, United States v. Quiver, \n241 \nU.S. 602\n.\n\nThe general notion drawn from Chief Justice Marshall's opinion in Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 561; The Kansas Indians, 5 Wall. 737, 755-757; and The New York Indians, 5 Wall. 761, that an Indian reservation is a distinct nation within whose boundaries state law cannot penetrate, has yielded to closer analysis when confronted, in the course of subsequent developments, with diverse concrete situations. By 1880 the Court no longer viewed reservations as distinct nations. On the contrary, it was said that a reservation was in many cases a part of the surrounding State or Territory, and subject to its jurisdiction except as forbidden by federal law, Utah & Northern R. Co. v. Fisher, \n116 \nU.S. 28, 31\n. In Langford v. Monteith, \n102 \nU.S. 145\n, the Court held that process might be served within a reservation for a suit in territorial court between two non-Indians. In United States v. McBratney, \n104 \nU.S. 621\n, and Draper v. United States, \n164 \nU.S. 240\n, the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 60, 73]\n\u00a0\n Court held that murder of one non-Indian by another on a reservation was a matter for state law.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nThe policy of assimilation was reversed abruptly in 1934. A great many allottees of reservation lands had sold them and disposed of the proceeds. Further allotments were prohibited in order to safeguard remaining Indian properties. The Secretary of the Interior was authorized to create new reservations and to add lands to existing ones. Tribes were permitted to become chartered federal corporations with powers to manage their affairs, and to organize and adopt constitutions for their own self-government. 48 Stat. 984, 986, 987, 988. These provisions were soon extended to Alaska, 49 Stat. 1250.\n\nConcurrently the influence of state law increased rather than decreased. As the result of a report making unfavorable comparisons between Indian Service activities and those of the States, Congress in 1929 authorized the States to enforce sanitation and quarantine laws on Indian reservations, to make inspections for health and educational purposes, and to enforce compulsory school attendance. 45 Stat. 1185, as amended, 25 U.S.C. 231. See Meriam, Problem of Indian Administration (1928); H. R. Rep. No. 2135, 70th Cong., 2d Sess. (1929); Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law (1945), p. 83; United States Department of the Interior, Federal Indian Law (1958), pp. 126-127. In 1934 Congress authorized the Secretary of the Interior to enter into contracts with States for the extension of educational, medical, agricultural, and welfare assistance to reservations, 48 Stat. 596, 25 U.S.C. 452. During the 1940's several States were permitted to assert criminal jurisdiction, and sometimes civil jurisdiction as \n\n[369 \nU.S. 60, 74]\n\u00a0\n well, over certain Indian reservations. E. g., 62 Stat. 1161; 62 Stat. 1224; 64 Stat. 845; 63 Stat. 705. A new shift in policy toward termination of federal responsibility and assimilation of reservation Indians resulted in the abolition of several reservations during the 1950's. E. g., 68 Stat. 250 (Menominees); 68 Stat. 718 (Klamaths).\n\nIn 1953 Congress granted to several States full civil and criminal jurisdiction over Indian reservations, consenting to the assumption of such jurisdiction by any additional States making adequate provision for this in the future. 67 Stat. 588, 18 U.S.C. 1162, 28 U.S.C. 1360. Alaska was added to the list of such States in 1958, 72 Stat. 545. This statute disclaims the intention to permit States to interfere with federally granted fishing privileges or uses of property. Finally, the sale of liquor on reservations has been permitted subject to state law, on consent of the tribe itself. 67 Stat. 586, 18 U.S.C. 1161. Thus Congress has to a substantial degree opened the doors of reservations to state laws, in marked contrast to what prevailed in the time of Chief Justice Marshall.\n\nDecisions of this Court are few as to the power of the States when not granted Congressional authority to regulate matters affecting Indians. In Thomas v. Gay, \n169 \nU.S. 264\n, an Oklahoma territorial tax on the cattle of non-Indian lessees of reservation land was upheld on the authority of the Fisher and Maricopa decisions, supra, which permitted taxation of railroad rights-of-way. The Court conceded that because the lands on which the taxed cattle grazed were leased from Indians the tax might, in contrast to the railroad cases, have an indirect effect on Indians, but that effect was declared to be too remote to require a contrary result. In the latest decision, Williams v. Lee, \n358 \nU.S. 217\n, we held that Arizona had no jurisdiction over a civil action brought by a non-Indian against an Indian for the price of goods sold the latter on the Navajo Reservation. The applicability \n\n[369 \nU.S. 60, 75]\n\u00a0\n of state law, we there said, depends upon \"whether the state action infringed on the right of reservation Indians to make their own laws and be ruled by them,\" \n358 \nU.S., at 220\n. Another recent statement of the governing principle was made in a decision reaffirming the authority of a State to punish crimes committed by non-Indians against non-Indians on reservations: \"[I]n the absence of a limiting treaty obligation or Congressional enactment each state had a right to exercise jurisdiction over Indian reservations within its boundaries,\" New York ex rel. Ray v. Martin, \n326 \nU.S. 496, 499\n.\n\nThese decisions indicate that even on reservations state laws may be applied to Indians unless such application would interfere with reservation self-government or impair a right granted or reserved by federal law. Congress has gone even further with respect to Alaska reservations, 72 Stat. 545, 18 U.S.C. 1162, 28 U.S.C. 1360. State authority over Indians is yet more extensive over activities, such as in this case, not on any reservation. It has never been doubted that States may punish crimes committed by Indians, even reservation Indians, outside of Indian country. See Cohen, Indian Rights and the Federal Courts, 24 Minn. L. Rev. 145, 153 (1940), citing Pablo v. People, 23 Colo. 134, 46 P. 636. Even where reserved by federal treaties, off-reservation hunting and fishing rights have been held subject to state regulation, Ward v. Race Horse, \n163 \nU.S. 504\n; Tulee v. Washington, \n315 \nU.S. 681\n, in contrast to holdings by state and federal courts that Washington could not apply the laws enforced in Tulee to fishing within a reservation, Pioneer Packing Co. v. Winslow, 159 Wash. 655, 294 P. 557; Moore v. United States, 157 F.2d 760, 765 (C. A. 9th Cir.). See State v. Cooney, 77 Minn. 518, 80 N. W. 696.\n\nTrue, in Tulee the right conferred was to fish in common with others, while appellants here claim exclusive rights. But state regulation of off-reservation fishing \n\n[369 \nU.S. 60, 76]\n\u00a0\n certainly does not impinge on treaty-protected reservation self-government, the factor found decisive in Williams v. Lee. Nor have appellants any fishing rights derived from federal laws. This Court has never held that States lack power to regulate the exercise of aboriginal Indian rights, such as claimed here, or of those based on occupancy. Because of the migratory habits of salmon, fish traps at Kake and Angoon are no merely local matter.\n\nCongress has neither authorized the use of fish traps at Kake and Angoon nor empowered the Secretary of the Interior to do so. The judgment of the Supreme Court of Alaska is affirmed. However, in view of all the circumstances and in order to avoid hardship, the stay granted by MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, and continued by the Court, will remain in force until the end of the 1962 salmon fishing season, as defined in the regulations issued by the Secretary of the Interior.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In 1948 a statehood bill requiring disclaimer of \"all lands . . . owned or held by any . . . natives, the right or title to which shall have been acquired through or from the United States or any prior sovereignty,\" was favorably reported with this explanation:\n\n\"As proposed to be amended, this paragraph would preserve all existing valid native property rights in Alaska, including those derived from use or occupancy, together with all existing authority of the Congress to provide for the determination, perfection or relinquishment of native property rights in Alaska. It would neither add to nor subtract from such rights and such authority, but would simply maintain the status quo.\" H. R. Rep. No. 1731, 80th Cong., 2d Sess. 15 (1948).\n\n\n To the same effect, see H. R. Rep. No. 255, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 13 (1949).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Fisher permitted a territorial tax on a railway through Indian country, and one basis for the holding was that here discussed. The alternative ground was that the railway right-of-way had been withdrawn from the reservation, as was held in Maricopa & Phoenix R. Co. v. Arizona Territory, \n156 \nU.S. 347\n.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, while joining the opinion of the Court, dissents from an extension of the stay for reasons to be stated in an opinion.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS.\n*\n\u00a0\n\nWhen the decision in this case was announced on March 5, 1962, I noted that while I joined the opinion of the Court, I dissented from the continuation of the stay and would elaborate my views at a later time. As the decision to extend the stay was reached in Conference on March 2, 1962, there was insufficient time to prepare an opinion by the following Monday.\n\nThe stay was first granted by MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, 80 Sup. Ct. 33, to maintain the status quo while this litigation was pending. The stay was then plainly justified, as the questions presented were substantial ones. Now, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 60, 77]\n\u00a0\n however, the adjudication has been made; and the Court is unanimous in concluding that these Indians have no right to use fish traps. A stay is not needed to protect rights that may arise from future Regulations, as in the Metlakatla case, for any administrative power of the Secretary of the Interior to allow the Kake and Angoon Indians to use traps is lacking. And with all deference, a stay is not shown to be justified on any other grounds.\n\nA stay that continues in use for another season a device as nefarious as the fish trap needs potent reasons.\n\nThe destruction caused by fish traps is notorious. Mr. Justice Van Devanter, conservationist as well as jurist, described an Alaskan fish trap\n1\n designed \"to catch about 600,000 salmon in a single season,\" a trap which \"will tend materially to reduce the natural supply of fish accessible to the Indians.\" Alaska Pacific Fisheries v. United States, \n248 \nU.S. 78, 87\n. Dr. David Starr Jordan in his 1904 report of the Alaska Salmon Commission stated, \"If we consider the ultimate interests of Alaska and the permanence of her salmon fisheries, no traps should be allowed anywhere . . . .\" Gruening, The State \n\n[369 \nU.S. 60, 78]\n\u00a0\n of Alaska (1954), p. 169. Beginning in 1931 the Territorial Legislature memorialized Congress condemning the use of the fish trap because of its adverse effect on salmon and on the salmon industry. See Alaska, Sess. Laws, 1931, p. 275; Alaska, Sess. Laws, 1953, pp. 401-402; Alaska, Sess. Laws, 1955, pp. 447-448. The 1955 Resolution ended by saying:\n\n \"WHEREAS, the vast majority of Alaskans, after many decades of first hand experience and study, are convinced that no salmon conservation program can achieve lasting effect unless salmon fish traps are abolished immediately, forever, from Alaskan waters;\n\n\n \"NOW THEREFORE, your Memorialist, the Legislature of the Territory of Alaska, respectfully urges and requests that immediate legislation be enacted abolishing fish traps from the waters of the Territory of Alaska.\"\n\n\n In 1959, the Alaskan Native Brotherhood, organized to speak for the Indians,\n2\n reiterated its stand \"for complete abolition of traps.\"\n\nSenator Gruening, on March 6, 1962, issued a statement to the Associated Press which emphasized another invidious effect of the use of fish traps by the Indians:\n\n \"The 1945 Alaska Territorial Legislature, at my behest, while I was Governor, passed an Act outlawing discrimination in public establishments based on race, creed, or color. This was designed to safeguard Alaska's Native people who had been subject to such discrimination and it did so safeguard them. Secretary Seaton's action would have created an inverse discrimination against Whites deeply sowing seeds of bitterness and arousing interracial friction and antagonism which has no place in America and had disappeared in Alaska. The performance was an inexcusable pressure play. In a referendum on fish \n\n[369 \nU.S. 60, 79]\n\u00a0\n traps in 1948, 88.7% of the people of Alaska voted for trap abolition, and Angoon's vote was 49 to 9 and Kake's 123 to 6 against traps. Yet Secretary Seaton sought to force traps upon them and on the people of Alaska.\n\n\n \"The Court's decision in the Metlakatla case differs in its conclusion from the Kake and Angoon cases only because of Metlakatla's historically different and unique legal status. It leaves the course of action open to the present Secretary of Interior. It is to be hoped that both he and the people of Metlakatla, who in the 1948 referendum - though owning seven traps - voted 112 to 33 for trap abolition, will agree that privilege and discrimination based on race should finally disappear totally from the 49th State.\"\n\n\n The devastating effect of fish traps upon Alaska's economy was described by the Alaska Supreme Court:\n\n\"It has not been unusual for a single trap to catch as many as 600,000 fish in a single season. The impact of the catch of eleven traps on the fisheries of Southeastern Alaska is considerable from the point of view of conservation. The season's catch of a gill net or purse seine fisherman in the same area might run from 2,000 to 10,000 fish respectively. The discrimination against all fishermen, natives and whites alike, resulting from the Secretary's 1959 regulation, creates social problems for the state which it is powerless to remedy if the Secretary's claimed right is upheld. The intention to retain such a power over the basic industry of the state was not intimated in the wording of the Alaska Statehood Act, much less described. Such a power has never been reserved as to any other state admitted into the Union as far as this court is aware. The fisheries of Alaska, although pitifully depleted, are still its basic industry. The \n\n[369 \nU.S. 60, 80]\n\u00a0\n economy of the entire state is affected, in one degree or another, by the plentitude of the salmon in a given season. The preservation of this natural resource is vital to the state and of great importance to the nation as a whole.\" Metlakatla Indian Community v. Egan, ___ Alaska ___, 362 P.2d 901, 915.\n\n\n The fish trap is \"efficient,\"\n3\n an adjective which, by conservation standards, means that it is \"destructive.\" As Senator Gruening has said, \"Its economic and social aspects have been under unceasing attack by virtually all fishermen, by cannery men who do not own or control traps and have to depend on other types of gear for their salmon, and by the Alaska public generally.\" Gruening, The State of Alaska (1954), pp. 170-171.\n\nMoreover, the fish trap is not a selective device, taking only one type of fish. It catches everything that swims; and fish that are not \"in season\" are as irretrievably lost as are those in which the fishermen have the greatest interest.\n\nWe should not allow such a destructive device\n4\n to be employed, absent a claim of legal right or a showing of \n\n[369 \nU.S. 60, 81]\n\u00a0\n imperative need. As I have said, no such right exists subsequent to our unanimous decision of March 5, 1962. It is, of course, provided in 28 U.S.C. 2106 that in disposing of cases here for review we may not only \"affirm, modify, vacate, set aside or reverse,\" but also \"require such further proceedings to be had as may be just under the circumstances.\" But we have no reason for concluding that it would be unjust to turn these Indians to fishing with gill nets or hand lines like everyone else. All we have before us is a motion made in October 1961 to expedite a hearing in these cases. In that motion it is said:\n\n\"The 1962 fishing season in Alaska begins in July, 1962. To prepare for this fishing season, Appellants must commit large sums of money for materials and supplies, including wire, netting, and cannery equipment. A large portion of these materials must be ordered not later than January, 1962. If Appellants' right to fish with traps were not to be upheld, their investment would be wasted. Conversely, if Appellants' right to fish with traps is upheld, Appellants will be unable to fish unless substantial sums of money are committed early in 1962.\"\n\n\n Whether any sums have in fact been committed to the construction of these nefarious fish traps we do not know. Why these Indians cannot fish in the manner of all other fishermen is not apparent. Since the fishing season starts in July, they have four months from the date of our decision to prepare for it. What problems, if any, they may have in fishing without traps, we do not know. They have asked for no stay at this juncture of the litigation. We act gratuitously and without any knowledge of the actual facts. We in effect dispense to this group who have no legal rights a largesse, as if we sat as a Commission on Indian Affairs, giving a part of the public domain to this favored few. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 60, 82]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThose who know the story of the decline of the salmon\n5\n can only look with concern on any action that further depletes the supply of this choice national asset. Severe human hardship may result from the decision we handed down on March 5, 1962. But if that is true, we should \n\n[369 \nU.S. 60, 83]\n\u00a0\n require that it be shown. The disposition of these cases four months before the 1962 fishing season starts gives ample notice that new ways of earning a livelihood must be found other than the lazy man's device of the fish trap.\n6\n\u00a0\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] [This opinion was filed March 19, 1962.]\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The salmon trap is described by the Alaska Supreme Court as follows:\n\n\"A trap consists of tall stakes or mechanically driven piling extending from the shore to varying distances seaward, depending on the depth of the water. Wire or webbing is stretched across the stakes or piling from the shore to the seaward end and from the ocean bottom upward to a point above high water. Located at the seaward end is an extended wing or hook and an opening into the heart and pot. When the webbing is on the ocean bottom fish cannot pass around the trap at the shoreward end. One tendency of migrating fish is to parallel the shoreline and travel with the incoming tide. Fish stopped by the webbing of a trap will eventually follow it seaward in an attempt to by-pass the obstruction. The wing or hook is constructed so as to discourage by-passing and divert the fish into the heart and pot where they remain. With some variations in construction, floating traps adapted to deep water are commonly used and are highly productive.\" Metlakatla Indian Community v. Egan, ___ Alaska ___, 362 P.2d 901, 903.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See Federal Indian Law (Dept. of Interior, 1958), p. 963.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Those who defend the fish trap rate it as being a degree better than the purse seine. This is because the purse seine is movable and \"difficult to keep track of by the inspectors,\" while the fish trap is stationary and can be readily inspected. See Hearings before Subcommittee, Senate Committee on Fisheries, on S. 5856, 62d Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 458-459.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Those who defend the fish trap are quick to add \"provided the trap has no jigger.\" Hearings, supra, note 3, at 458. Senator Gruening describes the \"jigger\":\n\n\"The `jigger' is a lateral extension of the trap, curved or hooked, extending away from the wall of the outer `heart' into the direction from which the salmon come. It makes avoidance of the trap toward which at that point the salmon are heading almost impossible.\" Gruening, The State of Alaska (1954), p. 170.\n\n\n It is significant that the Regulations under which these Indians are now allowed to fish during the 1962 season do not bar the \"jigger\" (see 25 CFR 88.3), though the Territorial Legislature as early as 1913 had banned it. See Gruening, op. cit., supra, at 169.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] James Wickersham, delegate in Congress from Alaska, testified in 1914 as to the start of the depletion of the salmon:\n\n\"I want to call the attention of the committee to one stream which has been depleted in California, and that is the Sacramento River. The Sacramento River was one of the first rivers upon which canners put up salmon. In 1864 the first canned salmon were packed in California on the Sacramento River. In 1882 there were 200,000 cases of canned salmon put out from the Sacramento River - 48 pounds to the case, making a total of 4,800 tons of salmon canned during that year on the Sacramento River.\n\n\n\"Then it began to decrease, and it went down to 123,000; then to 90,000; then to 57,000; then to 31,000; then to 14,000; and finally in 1906 there were none put up on that river. For three or four years there were none put up, but in 1913 there were 950 cases put up on the Sacramento River. In short, that great salmon stream has been utterly destroyed and there are no fish there now, substantially.\n\n\n\"Of course, that situation resulted from several causes. It resulted from overfishing, and from putting barriers across the streams to catch the fish, and it resulted in part from mining. All these things are going to happen in Alaska. There is mining going on there now on many of these streams. All the obstacles that operated to bring about that evil in the Sacramento River will operate in Alaska as soon as they open up that country. As soon as that is done and they get to work in there, the streams there are going to be depleted.\n\n\n\"When the first Russians went to Kadiak Island, more than a century ago, they found the Karluk salmon stream surrounded by Indians. It was a great fishing spot. That stream has probably turned out more canned salmon than any other stream in Alaska. Dr. Evermann and all those who were acquainted with it say it was the greatest salmon stream in the world. I saw the fishing going on there in 1903. I know how it was done. They had at one side a great post set in the ground sufficient to hold the nets. The nets were put into big boats, and they were long nets, some of them half a mile long, I suppose, and they were carried out into the bay, and as they came around they were fastened to a rope on the shore, to which was attached a big engine, and when they got that far along \n\n[369 \nU.S. 60, 83]\n\u00a0\n the big engine pulled the nets for them. The number of fish which they caught in there is simply unbelievable, and they were pulled in by machinery. The men themselves were unable to handle big nets of that kind. They were able to handle the small nets, but when they got machinery handling the fish for them they soon destroyed that stream. Every fisherman in that region knows it is destroyed; knows that the greatest salmon stream in Alaska has been destroyed.\" Hearings before House Committee on the Territories on H. R. 11740, 63d Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 45-46. For later discussions on the plight of the salmon of the Pacific, see Hearings before Merchant Marine and Fisheries Subcommittee, Senate Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, on S. Con. Res. 35, pt. I, and on S. 502, 86th Cong., 1st Sess.; Hearings before Senate Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce on S. Con. Res. 35, S. 2586 and S. 1420, pt. II, 86th Cong., 1st Sess.\n\n\n The depletion of salmon from California to Alaska is notorious. See Dufresne, Troubled River, Field and Stream, July 1959, p. 27; Netboy, Salmon of the Pacific Northwest (1958); 1958, A Year of Surprise in Pacific Salmon Canning, Pacific Fisherman, Jan. 25, 1959, p. 81; id., Jan. 25, 1960, p. 53; id., Jan. 25, 1961, pp. 13, 23; Van Fleet, The Vanishing Salmon, Atlantic, May 1961, pp. 48, 51:\n\n\"In my estimation, the former great wealth of the salmon fishery in California is doomed. In Oregon, the main runs are badly crippled but not entirely gone. In Washington, the runs are diminished along the coast and in the waters around Puget Sound, but careful husbandry could even bring about an increase. My advice to Alaska is to heed the lesson so well portrayed in the states to the south of it.\"\n\n\n The Hearings on S. 502, supra, are replete with examples of the impact on people and on the Alaska economy of the salmon depletion. This depletion also has a serious impact on wildlife. For an account of what a scarcity of salmon means to the brown bear population, see the Hearings on S. 502, supra, at 25-26.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] \"A trap fishes in the night when the man sleeps; it employs less men than other kinds of gear; it is a labor-saving device . . . .\" Hearings on S. 5856, supra, note 3, at 389. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 60, 84]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","107":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKAVANAGH v.

After being granted a voluntary discharge in bankruptcy releasing him from the judgment debts, he applied to state authorities for restoration of his automobile registration and operator's license. This was denied, because the state statute requires satisfaction of the judgments as a condition of reinstatement and provides specifically that a discharge in bankruptcy shall not relieve a judgment debtor from this requirement. He sued in a Federal District Court to enjoin state officials from enforcing this provision, on the ground that it conflicted with 17 of the Bankruptcy Act and, therefore, was void under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution. A three-judge District Court denied relief, and he appealed directly to this Court. Held:\n\n 1. Under 28 U.S.C. 2281, this case was required to be heard and determined by a three-judge District Court, and this Court has jurisdiction of this direct appeal under 1253. Pp. 155-158.\n\n\n 2. This state statute is not unconstitutional under the Supremacy Clause because of conflict with 17 of the Bankruptcy Act. Pp. 158-174.\n\n\n 187 F. Supp. 277, affirmed.\n\nE. J. Skeen argued the cause for appellant. With him on the briefs was J. D. Skeen.\n\nGordon A. Madsen, Assistant Attorney General of Utah, argued the cause for appellee. With him on the brief was Walter L. Budge, Attorney General. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 153, 154]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case presents the rather rare claim of conflict between an otherwise valid exercise of a State's so-called police power and the overriding authority of the Bankruptcy Act.\n1\n The statute before us is Utah's Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act\n2\n - a measure directed towards promoting safety in automobile traffic by administrative and compensatory remedies calculated to restrain careless driving. Its purpose is wholly unrelated to the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act.\n\nIn June 1957, a Utah court entered judgments in damages against appellant, based on his allegedly negligent \n\n[369 \nU.S. 153, 155]\n\u00a0\n operation of an automobile. On appeal to the State's Supreme Court the judgments were affirmed. After the judgments had remained unpaid for sixty days or more, the judgment creditors requested the court clerk to forward to the Department of Public Safety certified copies of the judgments, as provided by the Safety Responsibility Act. Thereupon the Department suspended appellant's automobile registration and his operator's license. On December 31, 1959, appellant was granted a voluntary discharge in bankruptcy, releasing him from the judgment debts. He then sought restoration of his license and registration. This was denied. The Safety Responsibility Act requires satisfaction of judgments due to auto accidents as a condition of reinstatement and specifically provides that a discharge in bankruptcy shall not relieve the judgment debtor from this requirement. Appellant initiated this ancillary bankruptcy proceeding, Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, \n292 \nU.S. 234, 239\n, in the United States District Court for Utah, seeking an order requiring restoration of his privileges and a declaration that the Utah law was invalid insofar as it disrespected the discharge of the judgment debt by virtue of 17 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 35. A three-judge District Court, 28 U.S.C. 2281, upheld the statute and denied relief, 187 F. Supp. 277 (1960). The case was brought here on direct appeal, 28 U.S.C. 1253, and we noted probable jurisdiction, \n364 \nU.S. 940\n.\n\nA preliminary point of jurisdiction is noted though it was not adverted to either by the District Court or by the parties. Was this a proper case for convening a three-judge court, as it must have been to justify direct appeal to this Court? The present suit asks that state officials be \"restrained and enjoined\" from enforcing designated sections of the Utah Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act because they \"are unconstitutional and void,\" in that they are in conflict with 17 of the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 153, 156]\n\u00a0\n Bankruptcy Act and therefore necessarily violative of the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution of the United States, Art. VI. It would seem to be compellingly clear that this case falls within 2281 of Title 28 of the United States Code, which bars a suit for an injunction \"upon the ground of the unconstitutionality\" of a state statute \"unless the application therefor is heard and determined by a district court of three judges.\" This was so heard and appeal was properly brought directly here, unless invalidation of a state statute by virtue of the Supremacy Clause rests on a different constitutional basis than such invalidation because of conflict with any other clause of the Constitution, at least to the extent of reading such an implied exception into the procedure devised by 2281. Neither the language of 2281 nor the purpose which gave rise to it affords the remotest reason for carving out an unfrivolous claim of unconstitutionality because of the Supremacy Clause from the comprehensive language of 2281.\n\nBearing in mind that the requirement for District Court litigation of three judges, of whom one must be a Justice of this Court or a circuit judge, involves a serious drain upon the federal judicial manpower, \"particularly in regions where, despite modern facilities, distance still plays an important part in the effective administration of justice . . .,\" this Court has been led by a long series of decisions, in a variety of situations, to generalize that this procedural device was not to be viewed \"as a measure of broad social policy to be construed with great liberality, but as an enactment technical in the strict sense of the term and to be applied as such.\" Phillips v. United States, \n312 \nU.S. 246, 250\n-251. The Court had already held that the three-judge requirement is not to be invoked on a contingent constitutional question. International Ladies' Garment Workers v. Donnelly Co., \n304 \nU.S. 243, 251\n. The Court has been consistent in this view in dealing \n\n[369 \nU.S. 153, 157]\n\u00a0\n with claims of conflict between a state statute and a federal statute which has the constitutional right of way.\n\nBearing in mind that due regard for the healthy working of the federal judicial system demands that the three-judge court requirement be treated as \"an enactment technical in the strict sense of the term,\" we must examine the basis of the plaintiff's claim to determine whether it must come before a single judge or three judges. If in immediate controversy is not the unconstitutionality of a state law but merely the construction of a state law or the federal law, the three-judge requirement does not become operative. Such was the ruling in Ex parte Buder, \n271 \nU.S. 461\n, where the Supremacy Clause was not invoked and therefore the three-judge court was not required. In Ex parte Bransford, \n310 \nU.S. 354\n, Buder was followed. A three-judge court was not required because the issue was \"merely the construction of an act of Congress, not the constitutionality of the state enactment.\" \n310 \nU.S., at 359\n. Contrariwise, in Query v. United States, \n316 \nU.S. 486\n, the complainant sought to restrain the state officers from enforcing a state statute on the score of unconstitutionality of its threatened application. \n316 \nU.S., at 489\n. Accordingly, the requirement of a three-judge court applied. Query v. United States and Ex parte Bransford were clearly differentiated from one another in Case v. Bowles, \n327 \nU.S. 92\n, where, as in Bransford, \"the complaint did not challenge the constitutionality of the state statute but alleged merely that its enforcement would violate the Emergency Price Control Act. Consequently a three-judge court is not required.\" \n327 \nU.S., at 97\n.\n\nHere, no question of statutory construction, either of a state or a federal enactment, is in controversy. We are confronted at once with the constitutional question whether the discharge in bankruptcy of a debt ousts the police power of a State from a relevant safety measure, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 153, 158]\n\u00a0\n the indirect and episodic consequence of which may have some bearing on a discharged debt but which in no wise resuscitates it as an obligation. The general principle elucidated by Mr. Justice Cardozo in differentiating between different stages of adjudication at which issues are reached, Gully v. First National Bank, \n299 \nU.S. 109, 117\n-118, serves to guide disposition of this case as it differently did Phillips v. United States, supra. This case presents a sole, immediate constitutional question, differing from Buder, Bransford, and Case, which presented issues of statutory construction even though perhaps eventually leading to a constitutional question.\n\nThe problem of highway safety has concerned legislatures since the early years of the century. Utah, like other States, has responded to this problem by requiring the registration\n3\n and inspection\n4\n of vehicles and prescribing certain necessary equipment;\n5\n by requiring examination and licensing of operators and excluding unqualified persons from driving;\n6\n by providing comprehensive regulations of speed and other traffic conditions;\n7\n and by authorizing extraterritorial service of process on nonresident motorists involved in accidents within the State.\n8\n And, like every other State, Utah has responded by enacting a financial-responsibility law.\n\nFinancial-responsibility laws are intended to discourage careless driving or to mitigate its consequences by requiring as a condition of licensing or registration the satisfaction of outstanding accident judgments, the posting of security to cover possible liability for a past accident, or the filing of an insurance policy or other proof of ability \n\n[369 \nU.S. 153, 159]\n\u00a0\n to respond in damages in the future. By 1915 a San Francisco ordinance required a bond or liability insurance for all buses;\n9\n a number of other cities and States early enacted similar provisions.\n10\n In 1925 Massachusetts forbade the registration of any motor vehicle without proof of adequate liability insurance or other evidence of ability to satisfy a judgment. Mass. Laws 1925, c. 346. That same year the Commissioners on Uniform Laws appointed a committee to consider a uniform compulsory insurance law. Handbook of the National Conference on Uniform State Laws (1932), p. 261.\n\nUnwilling to require insurance or its equivalent from all highway users, six other States - five of them in New England - adopted within the next two years laws with the same design but limited to careless drivers. The first of these, Connecticut Acts 1925, c. 183, provided for suspension of the registration of those convicted of certain infractions relating to motor vehicles and of those causing accidents of specified gravity, requiring proof of financial responsibility as a condition to restoration. Vermont enacted a similar provision, Acts 1927, No. 81. Maine's law, Laws 1927, c. 210, and Minnesota's, Laws 1927, c. 412, 61 (b), applied only to violations.\n11\n Rhode Island, Acts 1927, c. 1040, originally required proof only after accidents resulting from violations; Acts 1929, c. 1429, required proof in addition not only of persons violating certain laws but of all minors as well. In New Hampshire, Laws 1927, c. 54, security to cover a potential judgment was required on request of the plaintiff \n\n[369 \nU.S. 153, 160]\n\u00a0\n in an accident case, if fault appeared after preliminary inquiry.\n\nIn 1929 seven States enacted laws providing for the first time that driving privileges be suspended following an adverse judgment in damages. Vermont added to her earlier statute a provision suspending privileges of anyone against whom there was an outstanding judgment based on a traffic violation until proof was made of financial responsibility. Vt. Acts 1929, No. 76. Connecticut, Maine, and Wisconsin suspended the privileges of the judgment debtor until the judgment was satisfied. Conn. Acts 1929, c. 297, 25;\n12\n Me. Laws 1929, c. 209; Wis. Laws 1929, c. 76. In Connecticut, however, suspension was only to occur if the judgment remained unpaid for sixty days, and then only \"[u]pon complaint . . . by any prevailing party\" in the lawsuit. Iowa's law was substantially similar, giving the creditor control by providing that \"a transcript of such judgment . . . may be filed\" to initiate suspension. Iowa Laws 1929, c. 118.\n13\n California required court clerks to transmit to the vehicle administrator notice of judgments unpaid for fifteen days; the debtor's license and registration were thereupon to be suspended until both the debt was discharged and proof of financial responsibility was given. Cal. Stat. 1929, c. 258, 4. New York adopted a law materially the same as California's, providing in addition that a discharge in bankruptcy should not relieve the judgment debtor of these requirements and also suspending privileges pending proof after conviction for certain violations. N. Y. Laws 1929, c. 695. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 153, 161]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAbandoning the drive for a uniform compulsory-insurance law as not then feasible, the Commissioners on Uniform Laws in 1929 began work on a more limited financial-responsibility act. As finally approved by the Conference in 1932, the Uniform Automobile Liability Security Act combined features from several of the statutes already in force. Proof of financial responsibility was required to be maintained for a minimum of three years by four classes of persons: (1) those convicted of certain violations; (2) those wishing to obtain or renew driving privileges, and who had been at fault in two accidents of specified gravity during the preceding year; (3) minors; (4) those against whom a judgment of a certain magnitude had remained unsatisfied for fifteen days. The provisions regarding judgments followed those of California and New York: the court or clerk was to forward notice of all unsatisfied judgments, and the debtor's privileges were to be suspended until both satisfaction of the obligation, to the extent of the minimum required insurance amount, and proof of future responsibility. 11 U. L. A. 125 (1938).\n\nThe Uniform Act as such was adopted only in Hawaii, Pennsylvania, and Washington;\n14\n its provisions regarding accidents and minors found little favor. Yet during the two decades following 1929 a large majority of States enacted one or another form of financial-responsibility law. Utah's first such statute, enacted in 1943, was typical of the most common enactment. Twelve other States and the District of Columbia adopted this same basic law;\n15\n and, with relatively minor modifications, it was \n\n[369 \nU.S. 153, 162]\n\u00a0\n paralleled by five more\n16\n in addition to the earlier California and New York laws. This law provided for suspension of privileges following certain convictions and after a judgment remained unpaid a specified time. Restoration in either case was conditioned on proof of future responsibility; in the case of a judgment, the debt must be discharged as well. The unpaid judgment was required to be forwarded on the initiative of the court or clerk. Six States adopted laws differing from Utah's principally in that proof of future responsibility, without satisfaction of the debt, was sufficient to terminate suspension.\n17\n In addition, most of these statutes provided \n\n[369 \nU.S. 153, 163]\n\u00a0\n that a discharge in bankruptcy should not relieve the judgment debtor from suspension.\n18\n\u00a0\n\nIndiana and Maryland in 1931, like Connecticut and Iowa before, placed control of suspension for unpaid judgments in the hands of the creditor by requiring that notice be forwarded to the administrator only on the creditor's request. Ind. Acts 1931, c. 179, 2; Md. Laws 1931, c. 498. Neither specified the effect of a discharge. Maryland's law was in other respects like that of Utah; Indiana's, which required only proof of future responsibility and not discharge for reinstatement, was replaced in 1935 by a statute on the Utah model. In Massachusetts suspension followed when the registrar was \"satisfied by such evidence as he may require\" that the judgment was sixty days unpaid. Mass. Acts 1932, c. 304.\n19\n Delaware's law was similar in this respect. Del. Laws 1931, c. 14. New Hampshire's 1937 law required proof of future responsibility following certain convictions and certain accidents but not after unpaid judgments; it required those involved in accidents not only to provide proof for the future but to deposit security to cover the past accident as well. N. H. Laws 1937, c. 161.\n20\n Provisions requiring security after accidents, but without the need of proof for the future, were adopted by a number of other States in the next few years.\n21\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 153, 164]\n\u00a0\n\n\nNew York's law, one source of most of this early legislation, underwent a gradual evolution after its enactment. In 1936 the legislature provided that if proof of future responsibility was given the maximum period of suspension should be three years.\n22\n The same year the statute was further amended to add a novel provision. If the judgment creditor consented, and if proof of future responsibility was given, a defaulting judgment debtor might continue to enjoy driving privileges for six months, and thereafter so long as consent was not withdrawn.\n23\n In 1937 it was made clear the requirement of judgment payment did not apply to insured owners or drivers.\n24\n In 1939 report of the unpaid judgment was made dependent upon request by the creditor.\n25\n Finally, in 1941, New York adopted the New Hampshire requirement of proof and security for damages arising out of certain accidents.\n26\n The 1941 law also provided, as a number of States had done before,\n27\n for payment in installments, with suspension upon default of payments.\n\nIt was against this background that the Uniform Act of 1932 was withdrawn for further study in light of the States' extensive experience. Handbook of the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (1943), p. 69. The result of this study was an entirely revised model act, indorsed by the National Conference, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 153, 165]\n\u00a0\n which now appears as Chapter 7 of the Uniform Vehicle Code of 1956.\n28\n\u00a0\n\nThe new Uniform Code reflects most of the changes wrought in New York's law from 1929 to 1941. It requires persons involved in certain accidents to deposit security to cover the past if they were not insured. It requires proof of future responsibility from those convicted of certain violations and from those owing judgments unsatisfied after thirty days. In addition, unless insured, the judgment debtor must satisfy the obligation, to the extent of the minimum amounts of financial responsibility required, before his privileges are restored. Installment payments, until default, are allowed. Bankruptcy is no release; unpaid judgments are to be reported only on request by the judgment creditor; with the creditor's consent the debtor may be permitted to drive for six months, if he shows financial responsibility, and longer until consent is revoked.\n\nThe material provisions of the new Uniform Code with respect to financial responsibility are currently in effect in twenty-one States, including Utah, and in the District of Columbia.\n29\n Fifteen other States have enacted \n\n[369 \nU.S. 153, 166]\n\u00a0\n statutes substantially similar except that unpaid judgments are reported by the court or clerk without request by the creditor.\n30\n Nine more retain statutes differing from the last foregoing principally in the absence of provisions \n\n[369 \nU.S. 153, 167]\n\u00a0\n for restoration of privileges without payment on the consent of the creditor; these are in substance the same as the common statute earlier in force in Utah, except that security is usually required in the event of accident.\n31\n Vermont's statute, requiring only proof and \n\n[369 \nU.S. 153, 168]\n\u00a0\n not payment to reinstate privileges after judgment, differs in other particulars as well.\n32\n Maine and New Hampshire make no provisions for judgments, suspending only after accidents and violations.\n33\n In Massachusetts and New York insurance or its equivalent is compulsory.\n34\n\u00a0\n\nTwenty years ago, the Court had before it the New York variant of this legislation. This provided for suspension of license and registration whenever a judgment remained unpaid for fifteen days, as certified by the county clerk on his initiative. Proof of future responsibility was required for reinstatement; unless three years had elapsed, so was satisfaction of the judgment other than by discharge in bankruptcy. In 1936 the statute was amended to terminate the suspension with creditor consent on proof of responsibility, and in \n\n[369 \nU.S. 153, 169]\n\u00a0\n 1939 to require certification of the judgment only on request by the creditor or his attorney. The Court held that this statute, as it stood before 1936, was an appropriate measure to promote highway safety and did not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Because the statute was not designed to aid collection of debts but to enforce a policy against irresponsible driving, and because this policy would be frustrated if negligent drivers could avoid the statute by \"the simple expedient of voluntary bankruptcy,\" no conflict with the Bankruptcy Act was found. The Court expressly left unanswered the claim that the amendments giving the creditor control over initiation and duration of the suspension were contrary to the Bankruptcy Act. Reitz v. Mealey, \n314 \nU.S. 33\n (1941).\n\nThe Utah law here challenged is in substance that which the Court did not have to pass on in Reitz v. Mealey, with two exceptions. Not only is the creditor permitted to initiate, lift, and restore suspension as under the New York amendments; he is also given power to restore suspension for default on payment of installments, and, if the judgment is not satisfied, the suspension is permanent rather than limited to three years. Appellant urges that the Utah creditor's added control over the license and registration procedures demonstrates that the State is acting as a collecting agent for the creditor rather than furthering an interest in highway safety, and that to make suspension perpetual rather than for three years only renders the collection pressure more effective. Do these differences make a constitutional difference, in light of the considerations that underlay the decision in the Reitz case?\n\nSection 17 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. 35, provides that \"A discharge in bankruptcy shall release a bankrupt from all of his provable debts,\" with exceptions not here material. See also 11 U.S.C. 1 (15). A \n\n[369 \nU.S. 153, 170]\n\u00a0\n discharge relieves the bankrupt \"from legal liability to pay a debt that was provable,\" Zavelo v. Reeves, \n227 \nU.S. 625, 629\n (1913); it is a valid defense in an action brought in a state court to recover the debt. A State cannot deal with the debtor-creditor relationship as such and circumvent the aim of the Bankruptcy Act in lifting the burden of debt from a worthy debtor and affording him a new start. The limitations imposed upon the States by the Act raise constitutional questions under the Supremacy Clause, Art. VI. Thus, a discharge does not free the bankrupt from all traces of the debt, as though it had never been incurred. This Court has held that a moral obligation to pay the debt survives discharge and is sufficient to permit a State to grant recovery to the creditor on the basis of a promise subsequent to discharge, even though the promise is not supported by new consideration. Zavelo v. Reeves, supra. The theory, the Court declared, is that \"the discharge destroys the remedy but not the indebtedness,\" \n227 \nU.S., at 629\n.\n35\n And in Spalding v. New York ex rel. Backus, 4 How. 21 (1846), under an earlier bankruptcy law,\n36\n the Court held that a discharge did not prevent the State from collecting a fine for contempt in violation of an injunction issued to aid in the execution of a judgment debt, although the fine was turned over to the creditor. States are not free to impose whatever sanctions they wish, other than an action of debt or assumpsit, to enforce collection of a discharged debt. But the lesson Zavelo and Spalding teach \n\n[369 \nU.S. 153, 171]\n\u00a0\n is that the Bankruptcy Act does not forbid a State to attach any consequence whatsoever to a debt which has been discharged.\n37\n\u00a0\n\nThe Utah Safety Responsibility Act leaves the bankrupt to some extent burdened by the discharged debt. Certainly some inroad is made on the consequences of bankruptcy if the creditor can exert pressure to recoup a discharged debt, or part of it, through the leverage of the State's licensing and registration power. But the exercise of this power is deemed vital to the State's well-being, and, from the point of view of its interests, is wholly unrelated to the considerations which propelled Congress to enact a national bankruptcy law. There are here overlapping interests which cannot be uncritically resolved by exclusive regard to the money consequences of enforcing a widely adopted measure for safeguarding life and safety.\n\nWhen Reitz v. Mealey was in the District Court, 34 F. Supp. 532 (N. D. N. Y. 1940), Judge Learned Hand upheld the statute, as did this Court, without deciding the validity of the creditor-control amendments; but in passing he dealt with the realities of the situation and demonstrated the thin difference they made. As for the 1936 amendment, \"The original statute in fact gave the creditor power at any time to restore the license by a complete satisfaction of the judgment; and the amendment \n\n[369 \nU.S. 153, 172]\n\u00a0\n merely added to this by enabling him to withdraw his consent, once given, after six months.\" The 1939 amendment\n\n\"merely relieved the clerk of an irksome duty. He had been obliged to find out whenever a judgment had remained unpaid for fifteen days, whether it was for damages due to negligent driving. Instead of this the amendment set up an automatic system depending upon the creditor's interest in starting the clerk into action. This distinction is, however, more apparent than real because under the section as it stood before 1939, the creditor had the same incentive and he was as likely as thereafter to advise the clerk of the judgment . . . . [T]he chance that the clerk would have acted without being prodded by the creditor must have been very remote.\" 34 F. Supp., at 535.\n\n\n This Court was of course aware of the practical pressures of the New York statute as a device to collect debts discharged in bankruptcy; the argument was pressed upon it in the dissent. Yet the statute was upheld. Why? Because the \"police power\" of a State, especially when exerted for the protection of life and limb, is as pervasive as any of the reserved powers of the States and should be respected unless there is a clear collision with a national law which has the right of way under the Supremacy Clause of Article VI. The fact that the consequences of the New York Safety Act may in fact have subjected a debtor to the payment of money of which as an obligation in the creditor-debtor relation he was quit did not lead this Court to hold that the State had intruded into the bankruptcy domain or subverted the purpose of the bankruptcy law. Why? At the heart of the matter are the complicated demands of our federalism. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 153, 173]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAre the differences between the Utah statute and that of New York so significant as to make a constitutionally decisive difference? A State may properly decide, as forty-five have done, that the prospect of a judgment that must be paid in order to regain driving privileges serves as a substantial deterrent to unsafe driving. We held in Reitz that it might impose this requirement despite a discharge, in order not to exempt some drivers from appropriate protection of public safety by easy refuge in bankruptcy.\n38\n To make suspension of privileges dependent upon the creditor's request, as twenty-one have done, and as Congress has done for the District of Columbia, is nothing more than to make explicit what happens in the real world regardless of the statutory language. Even if the creditor-request provision makes suspension more likely, we see no reason why a State may not so provide in order that the deterrent be made more effective by authorizing the party most likely to be interested in the enforcement of the sanction to set it in motion. Nor do we think in excess of their power the action of thirty-five States that have attempted, as Congress has done, to authorize the creditor to lift and restore the suspension, or the forty-three that, again as Congress, have provided that in the absence of creditor consent the suspension shall last forever unless the judgment is extinguished. To whatever extent these provisions make it more probable that the debt will be paid despite the discharge, each no less reflects the State's important deterrent interest. Congress had no thought of amending the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 153, 174]\n\u00a0\n Bankruptcy Act when it adopted this law for the District of Columbia; we do not believe Utah's identical statute conflicts with it either.\n\nUtah is not using its police power as a devious collecting agency under the pressure of organized creditors. Victims of careless car drivers are a wholly diffused group of shifting and uncertain composition, not even remotely united by a common financial interest. The Safety Responsibility Act is not an Act for the Relief of Mulcted Creditors. It is not directed to bankrupts as such. Though in a particular case a discharged bankrupt who wants to have his rightfully suspended license and registration restored may have to pay the amount of a discharged debt, or part of it, the bearing of the statute on the purposes served by bankruptcy legislation is essentially tangential.\n\nThere are no apothecary's scales by which the differences between the Utah and New York statutes can be constitutionally weighed. The matter rests in judgment. That organon of adjudication leads us to conclude that the differences are too insubstantial, too tenuous as a matter of practical reality, to reach constitutional solidity.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE WHITTAKER took no part in the decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] This Court has a number of times considered alleged conflicts between the Bankruptcy Act and state insolvency laws, or other laws designed to affect the debtor-creditor relationship as such. E. g., Pobreslo v. Joseph M. Boyd Co., \n287 \nU.S. 518\n (1933); International Shoe Co. v. Pinkus, \n278 \nU.S. 261\n (1929). See Williston, The Effect of a National Bankruptcy Law Upon State Laws, 22 Harv. L. Rev. 547 (1909). In addition, several courts have been confronted with possible conflicts between the Bankruptcy Act and other laws. E. g., Spalding v. New York ex rel. Backus, 4 How. 21 (1846) (contempt for defying injunction in aid of debt later discharged); In re Hicks, 133 F. 739 (N. D. N. Y. 1905) (fireman suspended for nonpayment of discharged debt); Public Finance Corp. v. Londeree, 200 Va. 607, 106 S.

Hearings before Subcommittee of House Committee on Appropriations, on the Judiciary, 87th Cong., 1st Sess. 204. The tendency thus reflected has not slackened with time.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART, concurring in part.\n\nFor the reasons convincingly set forth in the dissenting opinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE, I agree with him that a three-judge court should not have been convened in this case, and that consequently this appeal is not properly before us. I would therefore dismiss the appeal. Thompson v. Whittier, \n365 \nU.S. 465\n. The Court, however, holds that this appeal is properly here, and on the merits of the litigation I agree with the Court's conclusion. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 153, 175]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN, dissenting.\n\nWe are confronted here with a threshold question of jurisdiction which should, in my opinion, be dispositive of the case. The question is whether a three-judge court was properly convened for the trial of this case.\n1\n Although the issue was not considered by the courts below, and has not been raised by the parties here, it is our duty to take independent notice of such matters and to vacate and remand any decree entered by an improperly constituted court.\n2\n I cannot agree with the test formulated by the opinion of the Court because I believe that for both lower federal courts and for ourselves, it will raise more problems than it will solve, and because I do not see any basis for it either in the statute or in our prior decisions.\n\nWhen to convene a three-judge court has always been a troublesome problem of federal jurisdiction and a review of the cases involving that question illustrates the difficulties the lower federal courts have had in applying the principles formulated by this Court.\n3\n However, one rule has been clear: where a state statute is attacked as violating directly some provision of the Federal Constitution, a three-judge court must be convened.\n4\n Equally clear has been the principle that where the state statute is alleged to be inoperative because of the presence of a \n\n[369 \nU.S. 153, 176]\n\u00a0\n federal statute which the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution declares pre-emptive of the state law, a single judge may dispose of the case.\n5\n That, I submit, is precisely the situation here. A case essentially similar to ours is Case v. Bowles, \n327 \nU.S. 92\n. There the State had enacted a provision regulating the minimum price at which certain state-owned land had to be sold when disposed of by the State. When the State attempted to sell timber located on such land at a price permitted by the state enactment, the sale was sought to be enjoined on the ground that the price required by the state law exceeded the limits of the Federal Emergency Price Control Act and was therefore invalid under the Supremacy Clause. To the State's contention that the complaint stated a cause of action required to be heard by a three-judge court, this Court, speaking through MR. JUSTICE BLACK, stated:\n\n \". . . here the complaint did not challenge the constitutionality of the state statute but alleged merely that its enforcement would violate the Emergency Price Control Act. Consequently a three-judge court is not required. . . .\"\n6\n\u00a0\n\n\n So in the case before us, \"the complaint did not challenge the constitutionality of the . . . [Utah Financial Responsibility Act] but alleged that its enforcement would violate the . . . [Bankruptcy Act]. Consequently, a three-judge court . . . [was] not required.\" \n\n[369 \nU.S. 153, 177]\n\u00a0\n\n\nHowever, the Court's opinion adds an additional distinction. Its reasoning is that if there is a preliminary question of statutory construction, either of the state or federal statute alleged to be in conflict, only one judge is required. On the other hand, if the court is able to go \"directly\" to the constitutional question (i. e., whether the state statute must fall under the Supremacy Clause), three judges are required. I do not believe that there was any greater need for interpretation of the statute or of congressional purpose in Bowles than there is in determining the scope of the Bankruptcy Act in providing for the discharge of debts in the case before us. I can find no real distinction between the two cases and do not believe that one can be found in the statutes\n7\n or any place else. It would, in fact, be difficult to conceive of any case which would not call for an initial interpretation of the legislation or an inquiry into its purpose or policy before a court could determine if the state and federal statutes are in conflict.\n8\n The instant case is no exception, and, in my opinion, the Court's opinion refutes the very test which it establishes.\n9\n The difference of opinion \n\n[369 \nU.S. 153, 178]\n\u00a0\n on the merits in this case among the members of the Court stems from the meaning and purpose of 17 of the Bankruptcy Act,\n10\n and it is evident that the Court's holding in Reitz v. Mealey,\n11\n referred to by the Court in the instant case, considered the purposes of both the state legislation and the federal bankruptcy scheme. Indeed, the effect of the discharge in bankruptcy affords considerable latitude for construction, as noted by this and other courts on numerous occasions.\n12\n\u00a0\n\nMoreover, I believe that it is tacit in the Supremacy Clause itself that a preliminary inquiry must always be made into the policy behind the legislation alleged to be in conflict before a final analysis of whether the federal legislation is pre-emptive can be made.\n13\n But perhaps the most practical objection to the test formulated by the Court is that it is plainly unworkable. Application of that test by lower federal courts will, in my opinion, create additional confusion to an already difficult area of federal jurisdiction. Because I think that we should \n\n[369 \nU.S. 153, 179]\n\u00a0\n follow our past decisions,\n14\n and not impose technical and unworkable distinctions upon them, I would dismiss this case for lack of jurisdiction in this Court.\n15\n However, because the Court has held otherwise and has decided the merits of the alleged conflict, I believe it is my duty also to reach the substantive questions.\n\nOn the merits, I find myself in agreement with most of MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER'S opinion for the Court. State drivers' financial-responsibility laws intended to discourage careless driving and to promote safety in automobile traffic for the protection of its citizens are essential to the State's well-being and wide latitude, should be allowed in the formulation of such laws. Accordingly, I am reluctant to say that a State has exceeded its powers in this area. I cannot, however, agree with the Court's treatment of that portion of the Utah Act which gives to a creditor the discretion of determining if and when driving privileges may be restored by the State to a person whose license has been revoked due to his failure to satisfy a judgment incurred as a result of a previous automobile accident.\n16\n\u00a0\n\nThe essential inquiry in a case such as this is not only whether the State has acted in a field in which it has a legitimate interest to achieve goals inherent in its police power. Rather, our task is also to ascertain whether the provisions of the state act are compatible with the policy expressed in the federal legislation with which the state law is alleged to be in conflict.\n17\n If there is no escape \n\n[369 \nU.S. 153, 180]\n\u00a0\n from a finding of incompatibility, the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution demands that the conflicting state law and policy must yield to the federal statute.\n18\n This demand is made no less apparent by a determination that the state statute has been enacted pursuant to an otherwise valid exercise of state power.\n19\n\u00a0\n\nIn Reitz v. Mealey, \n314 \nU.S. 33\n, this Court upheld the New York variant of this legislation, according to the Court's opinion in the instant case, \"[b]ecause the statute was not designed to aid collection of debts but to enforce a policy against irresponsible driving, and because this policy would be frustrated if negligent drivers could avoid the statute by `the simple expedient of voluntary bankruptcy' . . . .\" Here, however, the Court decides a question that was deliberately not canvassed in Reitz, namely, the validity of the provision authorizing creditor control over restoration of the license.\n\nIn my view, the reasons expressed for upholding the New York legislation in Reitz do not apply to this authorization.\n20\n The State has a legitimate interest in requiring proof of financial responsibility from drivers \n\n[369 \nU.S. 153, 181]\n\u00a0\n who have not responded in damages for an accident; and inherent in that interest is the right to demand as a requisite to restoration of driving privileges, that all prior judgments for automobile accidents be paid.\n21\n To this extent the State advances an interest independent of the purposes of the bankruptcy laws; the interests of the federal and state governments are compatible and hence no conflict with the Federal Act exists. However, where the State relinquishes its right to demand that prior judgments be paid, and in its place authorizes the creditor, through giving or withholding his consent to determine whether the judgment debtor may be restored to his driving privileges, the purposes of the financial-responsibility laws are no longer being served. Instead of the legitimate determination to keep all negligent financially irresponsible drivers off the highways, the State is, ostensibly through its police power, giving the creditor a powerful collection device for recovery of a discharged debt.\n22\n The emphasis has been shifted to an entirely different purpose and, in my opinion, this change is crucial. The effect of the law is to authorize a private individual, for his own financial interest, to determine whether and when a bankrupt may drive on the State's highways. In departing from its legitimate interest in promoting highway \n\n[369 \nU.S. 153, 182]\n\u00a0\n safety and thus substituting the interests of individual creditors, the State brings its law into direct conflict with the policy of the federal statute which is designed to relieve bankrupt debtors from their prior financial obligations. In these circumstances I believe it is our duty to declare that portion of the state law invalid under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.\n\nThis does not mean that I would strike the entire statute; the Utah Act incorporates a separability clause\n23\n which has never been interpreted by the Supreme Court of Utah. How it would view this situation cannot be foretold, and it is not within our province to undertake to do so. At all events, no great burden would be placed on the State. All it need do is to assume in its own way its responsibilities for determining which drivers should be entrusted to use its highways rather than to delegate that power to a private judgment creditor whose debtor has been discharged of his debt by federal law.\n\nFor the reasons stated, I must dissent.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2281, providing for a three-judge court where an injunction is sought against the enforcement of a state statute upon the ground of its alleged unconstitutionality.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. v.

As to this strictly \"procedural\" provision, Judge Hand's pronouncement in the lower court's opinion in Reitz v. Mealey, 34 F. Supp. 532 (D.C. N. D. N. Y. 1940), is dispositive.

The State is in effect saying that it does not have an interest in preventing drivers who have been unable to meet their financial obligations from using the highways - as far as the State is concerned some may and others may not. The choice is delegated to the creditors. Hence, creditor X may have two outstanding judgments owing from two different individuals who have caused him damage in a highway accident. Although the State unquestionably has an equal interest in either allowing or disallowing use of the highway by these two debtors, X has the sole discretion to say to the State \"Debtor A may have his license back, but debtor B may not.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 23\n] Utah Code Ann., 1953, 41-12-40.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS concurs, dissenting.\n\nI agree that this case was properly heard by a three-judge District Court but dissent from the Court's holding that Utah may, through its Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act, enforce the payment of a judgment already discharged under the Federal Bankruptcy Act. Section 17 of the Bankruptcy Act provides that \"discharge in bankruptcy shall release a bankrupt from all of his provable debts\"\n1\n and this Court has held that a tort judgment, such as that against appellant, arising out of an automobile accident, is a provable debt within the meaning \n\n[369 \nU.S. 153, 183]\n\u00a0\n of that section.\n2\n Despite this provision, however, the Court upholds a Utah law which expressly provides that \"A discharge in bankruptcy following the rendering of any . . . judgment [arising out of an automobile accident] shall not relieve the judgment debtor\" of his obligation to pay that judgment as a condition of avoiding permanent cancellation of his driving license.\n3\n The effect of enforcement of the Utah law against this appellant is to deny him the federal immunity given by 17 of the Bankruptcy Act - an effect which makes the law of Utah rather than the law of Congress \"the supreme Law of the Land.\" This is true because the plain and inevitable effect of the Utah statutory scheme is to create a powerful weapon for collection of a debt from which this bankrupt has been released by federal law. And particularly where, as here, the bankrupt's very livelihood depends upon his retaining a driver's license, he has no real choice under this Utah statute but to make arrangements to pay his judgment creditor to avoid permanent loss of his license. That, of course, means that he must agree to pay the very debt from which he was discharged by the bankruptcy proceeding, and that he must forego the very benefits for which Congress passed the Bankruptcy Act. It also means that a Utah automobile-accident judgment creditor will be given a decided advantage over all other creditors suffering loss from the bankruptcy in that only he can prove his claim, share in the distribution of the bankrupt's estate and still, at the same time, retain the power to force the bankrupt to pay the rest of his claim.\n\nThis action of the State, which takes away the benefits conferred on the bankrupt by Congress in 17 of the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 153, 184]\n\u00a0\n Bankruptcy Act and gives special privileges to one class of creditors, cannot, in my judgment, be justified by reference to any \"complicated demands of our federalism.\" There are plenty of ways for the States to protect their highways from reckless and irresponsible drivers without running roughshod over immunities that the United States, acting through a specifically granted, exclusive federal power, has chosen to give its citizens. But even if there were not such ways, I see no reason why the Court is not required to settle this conflict between Utah law and federal law in the way that the Constitution requires all such conflicts to be decided - that is, by a simple application of the Supremacy Clause of the Federal Constitution. The Court chooses instead to uphold the law of Utah on the basis of its previous decision in Reitz v. Mealey,\n4\n a decision which I thought then and still think now to be wrong even on the much narrower statute which was sustained on much narrower grounds in that case. If this case involved the same kind of limited statute upheld in Reitz I could acquiesce on the ground that the settled construction of a federal statute should not ordinarily be disturbed.\n5\n I can see no justification, however, for expanding the holding in that case so as to uphold this statute which makes a far more serious state encroachment upon immunities granted by discharge in federal bankruptcy proceedings.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nThe Bankruptcy Act serves a highly important purpose in American life. Without the privileges it bestows on helplessly insolvent debtors to make a new start in life, many individuals would find themselves permanently \n\n[369 \nU.S. 153, 185]\n\u00a0\n crushed by the weight of obligations from which they could never hope to remove themselves and the country might, therefore, be deprived of the value of the endeavors of many otherwise useful citizens who simply would have lost their incentive for constructive work. I cannot agree with a decision which leaves the States free - subject only to this Court's veto power - to impair such an important and historic policy of this Nation as is embodied in its bankruptcy laws. I therefore respectfully dissent.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 11 U.S.C. 35.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Lewis v.

After several of the eight nonunion employees in its machine shop had complained individually about the coldness of the shop during the winter, seven of them walked out together on an extraordinarily cold day, saying that it was \"too cold to work.\" Respondent discharged them for violating a rule forbidding any employee to leave without permission of the foreman. The National Labor Relations Board found that they had acted in concert in protest against respondent's failure to provide adequate heat in their place of work and that their discharge violated 8 (a) (1) of the Act by interfering with their right under 7 to act in concert for mutual aid or protection, and it ordered respondent to reinstate them with back pay. Held: The Board correctly interpreted and applied the Act to the circumstances of this case, and the Court of Appeals should have enforced its order.

JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, with Chief Judge Sobeloff dissenting, refused to enforce an order of the National Labor Relations Board directing the respondent Washington Aluminum Company to reinstate and make whole seven employees whom the company had discharged for leaving their work in the machine shop without permission on claims that the shop was too cold to work in.\n1\n Because that decision raises important questions affecting the proper administration of the National Labor Relations Act,\n2\n we granted certiorari.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nThe Board's order, as shown by the record and its findings, rested upon these facts and circumstances. The respondent company is engaged in the fabrication of aluminum products in Baltimore, Maryland, a business having interstate aspects that subject it to regulation under the National Labor Relations Act. The machine shop in which the seven discharged employees worked was not insulated and had a number of doors to the outside that had to be opened frequently. An oil furnace located in an adjoining building was the chief source of heat for the shop, although there were two gas-fired space heaters that contributed heat to a lesser extent. The heat produced \n\n[370 \nU.S. 9, 11]\n\u00a0\n by these units was not always satisfactory and, even prior to the day of the walkout involved here, several of the eight machinists who made up the day shift at the shop had complained from time to time to the company's foreman \"over the cold working conditions.\"\n4\n\u00a0\n\nJanuary 5, 1959, was an extraordinarily cold day for Baltimore, with unusually high winds and a low temperature of 11 degrees followed by a high of 22. When the employees on the day shift came to work that morning, they found the shop bitterly cold, due not only to the unusually harsh weather, but also to the fact that the large oil furnace had broken down the night before and had not as yet been put back into operation. As the workers gathered in the shop just before the starting hour of 7:30, one of them, a Mr. Caron, went into the office of Mr. Jarvis, the foreman, hoping to warm himself but, instead, found the foreman's quarters as uncomfortable as the rest of the shop. As Caron and Jarvis sat in Jarvis' office discussing how bitingly cold the building was, some of the other machinists walked by the office window \"huddled\" together in a fashion that caused Jarvis to exclaim that \"[i]f those fellows had any guts at all, they would go home.\" When the starting buzzer sounded a few moments later, Caron walked back to his working place in the shop and found all the other machinists \"huddled there, shaking a little, cold.\" Caron then said to these workers, \". . . Dave [Jarvis] told me if we had any guts, we would go home. . . . I am going home, it is too damned cold to work.\" Caron asked the other \n\n[370 \nU.S. 9, 12]\n\u00a0\n workers what they were going to do and, after some discussion among themselves, they decided to leave with him. One of these workers, testifying before the Board, summarized their entire discussion this way: \"And we had all got together and thought it would be a good idea to go home; maybe we could get some heat brought into the plant that way.\"\n5\n As they started to leave, Jarvis approached and persuaded one of the workers to remain at the job. But Caron and the other six workers on the day shift left practically in a body in a matter of minutes after the 7:30 buzzer.\n\nWhen the company's general foreman arrived between 7:45 and 8 that morning, Jarvis promptly informed him that all but one of the employees had left because the shop was too cold. The company's president came in at approximately 8:20 a. m. and, upon learning of the walkout, immediately said to the foreman, \". . . if they have all gone, we are going to terminate them.\" After discussion \"at great length\" between the general foreman and the company president as to what might be the effect of the walkout on employee discipline and plant production, the president formalized his discharge of the workers who had walked out by giving orders at 9 a. m. that the affected workers should be notified about their discharge immediately, either by telephone, telegram or personally. This was done.\n\nOn these facts the Board found that the conduct of the workers was a concerted activity to protest the company's failure to supply adequate heat in its machine shop, that such conduct is protected under the provision of 7 of the National Labor Relations Act which guarantees that \"Employees shall have the right . . . to engage in . . . concerted activities for the purpose of collective \n\n[370 \nU.S. 9, 13]\n\u00a0\n bargaining or other mutual aid or protection,\"\n6\n and that the discharge of these workers by the company amounted to an unfair labor practice under 8 (a) (1) of the Act, which forbids employers \"to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 7.\"\n7\n Acting under the authority of 10 (c) of the Act, which provides that when an employer has been guilty of an unfair labor practice the Board can \"take such affirmative action including reinstatement of employees with or without back pay, as will effectuate the policies of this Act,\"\n8\n the Board then ordered the company to reinstate the discharged workers to their previous positions and to make them whole for losses resulting from what the Board found to have been the unlawful termination of their employment.\n\nIn denying enforcement of this order, the majority of the Court of Appeals took the position that because the workers simply \"summarily left their place of employment\" without affording the company an \"opportunity to avoid the work stoppage by granting a concession to a demand,\" their walkout did not amount to a concerted activity protected by 7 of the Act.\n9\n On this basis, they \n\n[370 \nU.S. 9, 14]\n\u00a0\n held that there was no justification for the conduct of the workers in violating the established rules of the plant by leaving their jobs without permission and that the Board had therefore exceeded its power in issuing the order involved here because 10 (c) declares that the Board shall not require reinstatement or back pay for an employee whom an employer has suspended or discharged \"for cause.\"\n10\n\u00a0\n\nWe cannot agree that employees necessarily lose their right to engage in concerted activities under 7 merely because they do not present a specific demand upon their employer to remedy a condition they find objectionable. The language of 7 is broad enough to protect concerted activities whether they take place before, after, or at the same time such a demand is made. To compel the Board to interpret and apply that language in the restricted fashion suggested by the respondent here would only tend to frustrate the policy of the Act to protect the right of workers to act together to better their working conditions. Indeed, as indicated by this very case, such an interpretation of 7 might place burdens upon employees so great that it would effectively nullify the right to engage in concerted activities which that section protects. The seven employees here were part of a small group of employees who were wholly unorganized. They had no bargaining representative and, in fact, no representative of any kind to present their grievances to their employer. Under these circumstances, they had to speak for themselves as best they could. As pointed out above, prior to the day they left the shop, several of them had repeatedly complained to company officials about the cold working \n\n[370 \nU.S. 9, 15]\n\u00a0\n conditions in the shop. These had been more or less spontaneous individual pleas, unsupported by any threat of concerted protest, to which the company apparently gave little consideration and which it now says the Board should have treated as nothing more than \"the same sort of gripes as the gripes made about the beat in the summertime.\" The bitter cold of January 5, however, finally brought these workers' individual complaints into concert so that some more effective action could be considered. Having no bargaining representative and no established procedure by which they could take full advantage of their unanimity of opinion in negotiations with the company, the men took the most direct course to let the company know that they wanted a warmer place in which to work. So, after talking among themselves, they walked out together in the hope that this action might spotlight their complaint and bring about some improvement in what they considered to be the \"miserable\" conditions of their employment. This we think was enough to justify the Board's holding that they were not required to make any more specific demand than they did to be entitled to the protection of 7.\n\nAlthough the company contends to the contrary, we think that the walkout involved here did grow out of a \"labor dispute\" within the plain meaning of the definition of that term in 2 (9) of the Act, which declares that it includes \"any controversy concerning terms, tenure or conditions of employment . . . .\"\n11\n The findings of the Board, which are supported by substantial evidence and which were not disturbed below, show a running dispute between the machine shop employees and the company over the heating of the shop on cold days - a dispute which culminated in the decision of the \n\n[370 \nU.S. 9, 16]\n\u00a0\n employees to act concertedly in an effort to force the company to improve that condition of their employment. The fact that the company was already making every effort to repair the furnace and bring heat into the shop that morning does not change the nature of the controversy that caused the walkout. At the very most, that fact might tend to indicate that the conduct of the men in leaving was unnecessary and unwise, and it has long been settled that the reasonableness of workers' decisions to engage in concerted activity is irrelevant to the determination of whether a labor dispute exists or not.\n12\n Moreover, the evidence here shows that the conduct of these workers was far from unjustified under the circumstances. The company's own foreman expressed the opinion that the shop was so cold that the men should go home. This statement by the foreman but emphasizes the obvious - that is, that the conditions of coldness about which complaint had been made before had been so aggravated on the day of the walkout that the concerted action of the men in leaving their jobs seemed like a perfectly natural and reasonable thing to do.\n\nNor can we accept the company's contention that because it admittedly had an established plant rule which forbade employees to leave their work without permission of the foreman, there was justifiable \"cause\" for discharging these employees, wholly separate and apart from any concerted activities in which they engaged in protest against the poorly heated plant. Section 10 (c) of the Act does authorize an employer to discharge employees for \"cause\" and our cases have long recognized this right \n\n[370 \nU.S. 9, 17]\n\u00a0\n on the part of an employer.\n13\n But this, of course, cannot mean that an employer is at liberty to punish a man by discharging him for engaging in concerted activities which 7 of the Act protects. And the plant rule in question here purports to permit the company to do just that for it would prohibit even the most plainly protected kinds of concerted work stoppages until and unless the permission of the company's foreman was obtained.\n\nIt is of course true that 7 does not protect all concerted activities, but that aspect of the section is not involved in this case. The activities engaged in here do not fall within the normal categories of unprotected concerted activities such as those that are unlawful,\n14\n violent\n15\n or in breach of contract.\n16\n Nor can they be brought under this Court's more recent pronouncement which denied the protection of 7 to activities characterized as \"indefensible\" because they were there found to show a disloyalty to the workers' employer which this Court deemed unnecessary to carry on the workers' legitimate concerted activities.\n17\n The activities of these seven employees cannot be classified as \"indefensible\" by any recognized standard of conduct. Indeed, concerted activities by employees for the purpose of trying to protect themselves from working conditions as uncomfortable as the testimony and Board findings showed them to be in this case are unquestionably activities to correct conditions which modern labor-management legislation treats as too bad to have to be tolerated in a humane and civilized society like ours. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 9, 18]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe hold therefore that the Board correctly interpreted and applied the Act to the circumstances of this case and it was error for the Court of Appeals to refuse to enforce its order. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded to that court with directions to enforce the order in its entirety.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER and MR.

Since the Union's status as majority bargaining representative turns on the ballots cast in the Board election by four of the seven discharged employees, the enforceability of that order depends upon the validity of the discharges being challenged in the principle part of the case.

L. R. B. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 736, 738]\n\u00a0\n 288. A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied enforcement of the Board's cease-and-desist order, finding in our decision in Labor Board v. Insurance Agents' Union, \n361 \nU.S. 477\n, a broad rule that the statutory duty to bargain cannot be held to be violated, when bargaining is in fact being carried on, without a finding of the respondent's subjective bad faith in negotiating. 289 F.2d 700.\n4\n The Court of Appeals said:\n\n \"We are of the opinion that the unilateral acts here complained of, occurring as they did during the negotiating of a collective bargaining agreement, do not per se constitute a refusal to bargain collectively and per se are not violative of 8 (a) (5). While the subject is not generally free from doubt, it is our conclusion that in the posture of this case a necessary requisite of a Section 8 (a) (5) violation is a finding that the employer failed to bargain in good faith.\" 289 F.2d, at 702-703.\n\n\n We granted certiorari, \n368 \nU.S. 811\n, in order to consider whether the Board's decision and order were contrary to Insurance Agents. We find nothing in the Board's decision inconsistent with Insurance Agents and hold that \n\n[369 \nU.S. 736, 739]\n\u00a0\n the Court of Appeals erred in refusing to enforce the Board's order.\n\nThe respondents are partners engaged in steel fabricating under the firm name of Williamsburg Steel Products Company. Following a consent election in a unit consisting of all technical employees at the company's plant, the Board, on July 5, 1956, certified as their collective bargaining representative Local 66 of the Architectural and Engineering Guild, American Federation of Technical Engineers, AFL-CIO. The Board simultaneously certified the union as representative of similar units at five other companies which, with the respondent company, were members of the Hollow Metal Door & Buck Association. The certifications related to separate units at the several plants and did not purport to establish a multi-employer bargaining unit.\n\nOn July 11, 1956, the union sent identical letters to each of the six companies, requesting collective bargaining. Negotiations were invited on either an individual or \"association wide\"\n5\n basis, with the reservation that wage rates and increases would have to be discussed with each employer separately. A follow-up letter of July 19, 1956, repeated the request for contract negotiations and enumerated proposed subjects for discussion. Included were merit increases, general wage levels and increases, and a sick-leave proposal.\n\nThe first meeting between the company and the union took place on August 30, 1956. On this occasion, as at the ten other conferences held between October 2, 1956, and May 13, 1957, all six companies were in attendance \n\n[369 \nU.S. 736, 740]\n\u00a0\n and represented by the same counsel.\n6\n It is undisputed that the subject of merit increases was raised at the August 30, 1956, meeting although there is an unresolved conflict as to whether an agreement was reached on joint participation by the company and the union in merit reviews, or whether the subject was simply mentioned and put off for discussion at a later date. It is also clear that proposals concerning sick leave were made. Several meetings were held during October and one in November, at which merit raises and sick leave were each discussed on at least two occasions. It appears, however, that little progress was made.\n\nOn December 5, a meeting was held at the New York State Mediation Board attended by a mediator of that agency, who was at that time mediating a contract negotiation between the union and Aetna Steel Products Corporation, a member of the Association bargaining separately from the others; and a decision was reached to recess the negotiations involved here pending the results of the Aetna negotiation. When the mediator called the next meeting on March 29, 1957, the completed Aetna contract was introduced into the discussion. At a resumption of bargaining on April 4, the company, along with the other employers, offered a three-year agreement with certain initial and prospective automatic wage increases. The offer was rejected. Further meetings with the mediator on April 11, May 1, and May 13, 1957, produced no agreement, and no further meetings were held.\n\nMeanwhile, on April 16, 1957, the union had filed the charge upon which the General Counsel's complaint later issued. As amended and amplified at the hearing and construed by the Board, the complaint's charge of unfair \n\n[369 \nU.S. 736, 741]\n\u00a0\n labor practices particularly referred to three acts by the company: unilaterally granting numerous merit increases in October 1956 and January 1957; unilaterally announcing a change in sick-leave policy in March 1957; and unilaterally instituting a new system of automatic wage increases during April 1957. As the ensuing litigation has developed, the company has defended against the charges along two fronts: First, it asserts that the unilateral changes occurred after a bargaining impasse had developed through the union's fault in adopting obstructive tactics.\n7\n According to the Board, however, \"the evidence is clear that the Respondent undertook its unilateral \n\n[369 \nU.S. 736, 742]\n\u00a0\n actions before negotiations were discontinued in May 1957, or before, as we find on the record, the existence of any possible impasse.\" 126 N. L. R. B., at 289-290. There is ample support in the record considered as a whole for this finding of fact, which is consistent with the Examiner's Intermediate Report, 126 N. L. R. B., at 295-296, and which the Court of Appeals did not question.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nThe second line of defense was that the Board could not hinge a conclusion that 8 (a) (5) had been violated on unilateral actions alone, without making a finding of the employer's subjective bad faith at the bargaining table; and that the unilateral actions were merely evidence relevant to the issue of subjective good faith. This argument prevailed in the Court of Appeals which remanded the cases to the Board saying:\n\n\"Although we might . . . be justified in denying enforcement without remand, . . . since the Board's finding of an unfair labor practice impliedly proceeds from an erroneous view that specific unilateral acts, regardless of bad faith, may constitute violations of  8 (a) (5), the case should be remanded to the Board in order that it may have an opportunity to take additional evidence, and make such findings as may be warranted by the record.\" 289 F.2d, at 709.\n9\n\u00a0\n\n\n The duty \"to bargain collectively\" enjoined by 8 (a) (5) is defined by 8 (d) as the duty to \"meet . . . and confer in good faith with respect to wages, hours, and other terms \n\n[369 \nU.S. 736, 743]\n\u00a0\n and conditions of employment.\" Clearly, the duty thus defined may be violated without a general failure of subjective good faith; for there is no occasion to consider the issue of good faith if a party has refused even to negotiate in fact - \"to meet . . . and confer\" - about any of the mandatory subjects.\n10\n A refusal to negotiate in fact as to any subject which is within 8 (d), and about which the union seeks to negotiate, violates 8 (a) (5) though the employer has every desire to reach agreement with the union upon an over-all collective agreement and earnestly and in all good faith bargains to that end. We hold that an employer's unilateral change in conditions of employment under negotiation is similarly a violation of 8 (a) (5), for it is a circumvention of the duty to negotiate which frustrates the objectives of 8 (a) (5) much as does a flat refusal.\n11\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 736, 744]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe unilateral actions of the respondent illustrate the policy and practical considerations which support our conclusion.\n\nWe consider first the matter of sick leave. A sick-leave plan had been in effect since May 1956, under which employees were allowed ten paid sick-leave days annually and could accumulate half the unused days, or up to five days each year. Changes in the plan were sought and proposals and counterproposals had come up at three bargaining conferences. In March 1957, the company, without first notifying or consulting the union, announced changes in the plan, which reduced from ten to five the number of paid sick-leave days per year, but allowed accumulation of twice the unused days, thus increasing to ten the number of days which might be carried over. This action plainly frustrated the statutory objective of establishing working conditions through bargaining. Some employees might view the change to be a diminution of benefits. Others, more interested in accumulating sick-leave days, might regard the change as an improvement. If one view or the other clearly prevailed among the employees, the unilateral action might well mean that the employer had either uselessly dissipated trading material or aggravated the sick-leave issue. On the other hand, if the employees were more evenly divided on the merits of the company's changes, the union negotiators, beset by conflicting factions, might be led to adopt a protective vagueness on the issue of sick leave, which also would inhibit the useful discussion contemplated by Congress in imposing the specific obligation to bargain collectively.\n\nOther considerations appear from consideration of the respondents' unilateral action in increasing wages. At the April 4, 1957, meeting the employers offered, and the union rejected, a three-year contract with an immediate \n\n[369 \nU.S. 736, 745]\n\u00a0\n across-the-board increase of $7.50 per week, to be followed at the end of the first year and again at the end of the second by further increases of $5 for employees earning less than $90 at those times. Shortly thereafter, without having advised or consulted with the union, the company announced a new system of automatic wage increases whereby there would be an increase of $5 every three months up to $74.99 per week; an increase of $5 every six months between $75 and $90 per week; and a merit review every six months for employees earning over $90 per week. It is clear at a glance that the automatic wage increase system which was instituted unilaterally was considerably more generous than that which had shortly theretofore been offered to and rejected by the union. Such action conclusively manifested bad faith in the negotiations, Labor Board v. Crompton-Highland Mills, \n337 \nU.S. 217\n, and so would have violated 8 (a) (5) even on the Court of Appeals' interpretation, though no additional evidence of bad faith appeared. An employer is not required to lead with his best offer; he is free to bargain. But even after an impasse is reached he has no license to grant wage increases greater than any he has ever offered the union at the bargaining table, for such action is necessarily inconsistent with a sincere desire to conclude an agreement with the union.\n12\n\u00a0\n\nThe respondents' third unilateral action related to merit increases, which are also a subject of mandatory bargaining. Labor Board v. Allison & Co., 165 F.2d 766. The matter of merit increases had been raised at three of the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 736, 746]\n\u00a0\n conferences during 1956 but no final understanding had been reached. In January 1957, the company, without notice to the union, granted merit increases to 20 employees out of the approximately 50 in the unit, the increases ranging between $2 and $10.\n13\n This action too must be viewed as tantamount to an outright refusal to negotiate on that subject, and therefore as a violation of 8 (a) (5), unless the fact that the January raises were in line with the company's long-standing practice of granting quarterly or semiannual merit reviews - in effect, were a mere continuation of the status quo - differentiates them from the wage increases and the changes in the sick-leave plan. We do not think it does. Whatever might be the case as to so-called \"merit raises\" which are in fact simply automatic increases to which the employer has already committed himself, the raises here in question were in no sense automatic, but were informed by a large measure of discretion. There simply is no way in such case for a union to know whether or not there has been a substantial departure from past practice, and therefore the union may properly insist that the company \n\n[369 \nU.S. 736, 747]\n\u00a0\n negotiate as to the procedures and criteria for determining such increases.\n14\n\u00a0\n\nIt is apparent from what we have said why we see nothing in Insurance Agents contrary to the Board's decision. The union in that case had not in any way whatever foreclosed discussion of any issue, by unilateral actions or otherwise.\n15\n The conduct complained of consisted of partial-strike tactics designed to put pressure on the employer to come to terms with the union negotiators. We held that Congress had not, in 8 (b) (3), the counterpart of 8 (a) (5), empowered the Board to pass judgment on the legitimacy of any particular economic weapon used in support of genuine negotiations. But the Board is authorized to order the cessation of behavior which is in effect a refusal to negotiate, or which directly obstructs or inhibits the actual process of discussion, or which reflects a cast of mind against reaching agreement. Unilateral action by an employer without prior discussion with the union does amount to a refusal to negotiate about the affected conditions of employment under negotiation, and must of necessity obstruct bargaining, contrary to the congressional policy. It will often disclose an unwillingness to agree with the union. It will rarely be justified by any reason of substance. It follows that the Board may hold such unilateral action to be an unfair labor practice in violation of 8 (a) (5), without also finding the employer guilty of over-all subjective bad faith. While \n\n[369 \nU.S. 736, 748]\n\u00a0\n we do not foreclose the possibility that there might be circumstances which the Board could or should accept as excusing or justifying unilateral action, no such case is presented here.\n16\n\u00a0\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to the court to enforce the Board's order.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the decision of this case.\n\nMR.

Cascade Employers Assn., Inc., 296 F.2d 42 (C. A. 9th Cir.).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] By their references to \"association wide bargaining\" the parties appear to mean negotiations at which the six members of the Association for whose employees the union had received certifications on July 5, 1956, would be concurrently represented.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] On one occasion in November 1956, a representative of the company conferred individually with the union about job classifications.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Particularizations of this charge are that the union adamantly insisted that the employers agree to a contract identical with that entered into by Aetna because the Aetna agreement contained a \"most favored nation\" clause; that the union evasively vacillated between insistence on individual and group negotiations; and that the conduct of negotiations by the union created unrest impairing the efficiency of the company's operations and causing valued employees to quit.\n\nThe Board found as a fact that the introduction of the Aetna agreement did not create any impasse at least until after the unilateral actions here in issue. The Board adopted the Examiner's finding that the company and not the union was responsible for any confusion over individual as opposed to association-wide bargaining. The unrest seems to have been a concomitant of the assertion by the employees of their rights to organize and negotiate a collective agreement, and could not justify a refusal of the company to bargain, at least in the absence of conduct of the union which amounted to an unfair labor practice.\n\nThe Examiner rejected the company's offer to prove union-instigated slowdowns. But such proof would not have justified the company's refusal to bargain. Since, as we held in Labor Board v. Insurance Agents' Union, \n361 \nU.S. 477\n, the Board may not brand partial strike activity as illegitimate and forbid its use in support of bargaining, an employer cannot be free to refuse to negotiate when the union resorts to such tactics. Engaging in partial strikes is not inherently inconsistent with a continued willingness to negotiate; and as long as there is such willingness and no impasse has developed, the employer's obligation continues.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] See Universal Camera Corp. v. Labor Board, \n340 \nU.S. 474\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] The Board had also found the company's actions violative of 8 (a) (1), 49 Stat. 452, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 158 (a) (1), but the Court of Appeals held that those findings were merely derivative of the Board's conclusions regarding 8 (a) (5) and so rejected them. We need not consider this question because the Board's order presents no separate issue as to 8 (a) (1). It requires the company to cease and desist from refusing to bargain collectively, and to bargain collectively on request. It imposes no broader obligation either in the language of, or by reference to, 8 (a) (1).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] See, e. g., Labor Board v. Allison & Co., 165 F.2d 766.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] Compare Medo Corp. v. Labor Board, \n321 \nU.S. 678\n; May Department Stores v. Labor Board, \n326 \nU.S. 376\n; Labor Board v. Crompton-Highland Mills, \n337 \nU.S. 217\n.\n\nIn Medo, the Court held that the employer interfered with his employees' right to bargain collectively through a chosen representative, in violation of 8 (1), 49 Stat. 452 (now 8 (a) (1)), when it treated directly with employees and granted them a wage increase in return for their promise to repudiate the union they had designated as their representative. It further held that the employer violated the statutory duty to bargain when he refused to negotiate with the union after the employees had carried out their promise.\n\nMay held that the employer violated 8 (1) when, after having unequivocally refused to bargain with a certified union on the ground that the unit was inappropriate, it announced that it had applied to the War Labor Board for permission to grant a wage increase to all its employees except those whose wages had been fixed by \"closed shop agreements.\"\n\nCrompton-Highland Mills sustained the Board's conclusion that the employer's unilateral grant of a wage increase substantially greater than any it had offered to the union during negotiations which had ended in impasse clearly manifested bad faith and violated the employer's duty to bargain.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] Of course, there is no resemblance between this situation and one wherein an employer, after notice and consultation, \"unilaterally\" institutes a wage increase identical with one which the union has rejected as too low. See Labor Board v. Bradley Washfountain Co., 192 F.2d 144, 150-152; Labor Board v. Landis Tool Co., 193 F.2d 279.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] The Board also concluded that the company had violated 8 (a) (5) by granting 34 merit increases in October 1956. However, it appears from a stipulation in the record and from the Board's reply brief that the latter increases occurred on October 1, 1956, while the charge on which the instant complaint issued was not filed until April 16, 1957, more than six months thereafter. Section 10 (b) of the Act, as amended, 61 Stat. 146, 29 U.S.C. 160 (b), provides that \"no complaint shall issue based upon any unfair labor practice occurring more than six months prior to the filing of the charge with the Board . . . .\" Therefore, we disregard the October 1956 increases as independently constituting an unfair labor practice. Nor do we find it necessary to decide whether they may be considered as evidence in connection with the Board's suggestion that the merit increases of October 1956 and January 1957 should be viewed as together amounting to a general wage increase.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] See Armstrong Cork Co. v.

Thompson argued the cause for respondents in No. 77. With him on the briefs was Alexander E. Wilson, Jr.\n\nO. R. T. Bowden argued the cause and filed briefs for respondent in No. 94.\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\nThese cases are here on petitions for certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which refused enforcement of orders of the Board. We granted certiorari (\n368 \nU.S. 810, 812\n) because there was a seeming noncompliance by that court with our admonitions in Universal Camera Corp. v. Labor Board, \n340 \nU.S. 474\n. We there said that while the \"reviewing court is not barred from setting aside a Board decision when it cannot conscientiously find that the evidence supporting that decision is substantial, when viewed in the light that the record in its entirety furnishes, including the body of evidence opposed to the Board's view,\" it may not \"displace the Board's choice between two fairly conflicting views, even though the court would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it de novo.\" Id., at 488.\n\nEach of these cases involves alleged discriminatory discharges of employees in violation of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. 158 (a) (3); and in each the Board ordered, inter alia, reinstatement of the workers in question with back pay. See 124 N. L. R. B. 1331, 124 N. L. R. B. 1182. In that type of case the Fifth Circuit has fashioned a special rule that was announced in Labor \n\n[369 \nU.S. 404, 406]\n\u00a0\n Board v. Tex-O-Kan Flour Mills Co., 122 F.2d 433, a decision rendered in 1941. In case of a cease-and-desist order, the court said that it generally \"costs no money and only warns to observe a right which already existed; evidence short of demonstration may easily justify such an order.\" Id., at 438. But the court established a more onerous rule for reinstatement cases:\n\n \"Orders for reinstatement of employees with back pay are somewhat different. They may impoverish or break an employer, and while they are not in law penal orders, they are in the nature of penalties for the infraction of law. The evidence to justify them ought therefore to be substantial, and surmise or suspicion, even though reasonable, is not enough. The duty to weigh and test the evidence is of course on the Board. This court may not overrule a fact conclusion supported by substantial evidence, even though we deem it incorrect under all the evidence. . . . In the matters now concerning us, the controlling and ultimate fact question is the true reason which governed the very person who discharged or refused to reemploy in each instance. There is no doubt that each employee here making complaint was discharged, or if laid off was not reemployed, and that he was at the time a member of the union. In each case such membership may have been the cause, for the union was not welcomed by the persons having authority to discharge and employ. If no other reason is apparent, union membership may logically be inferred. Even though the discharger disavows it under oath, if he can assign no other credible motive or cause, he need not be believed. But it remains true that the discharger knows the real cause of discharge, it is a fact to which he may swear. If he says it was not union membership or activity, but \n\n[369 \nU.S. 404, 407]\n\u00a0\n something else which in fact existed as a ground, his oath cannot be disregarded because of suspicion that he may be lying. There must be impeachment of him, or substantial contradiction, or if circumstances raise doubts, they must be inconsistent with the positive sworn evidence on the exact point.\" Id., at 438-439.\n\n\n This special rule concerning the weight of the evidence necessary to sustain the Board's orders for reinstatement with back pay has been repeatedly followed by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in decisions refusing enforcement of that particular type of order. See Labor Board v. Williamson-Dickie Mfg. Co., 130 F.2d 260; Labor Board v. Alco Feed Mills, 133 F.2d 419; Labor Board v. Ingram, 273 F.2d 670; Labor Board v. Allure Shoe Corp., 277 F.2d 231; Frosty Morn Meats, Inc., v. Labor Board, 296 F.2d 617.\n\nThe Court of Appeals in No. 77, Labor Board v. Walton Mfg. Co., 286 F.2d 16, 25, in resolving the issue of credibility between witnesses for the employer and witnesses for the union, as to the reasons for the discharge of the employees in question, relied on the test stated in Labor Board v. Tex-O-Kan Flour Mills Co., supra. In No. 94, Labor Board v. Florida Citrus Canners Cooperative, 288 F.2d 630, decided less than three months later, the Tex-O-Kan opinion was not mentioned. But its test of credibility of witnesses seemingly was applied. 288 F.2d, at 636-638.\n\nThere is no place in the statutory scheme for one test of the substantiality of evidence in reinstatement cases and another test in other cases. Labor Board v. Pittsburgh S. S. Co., \n340 \nU.S. 498\n, and the Universal Camera Corp. case, both decided the same day, were cases involving reinstatement. They state a rule for review by Courts of Appeals in all Labor Board cases. The test in the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 404, 408]\n\u00a0\n Tex-O-Kan opinion for reinstatement cases is that the employer's statement under oath must be believed unless there is \"impeachment of him\" or \"substantial contradiction,\" or if there are \"circumstances\" that \"raise doubts\" they must be \"inconsistent with the positive sworn evidence on the exact point.\" But the Examiner - the one whose appraisal of the testimony was discredited by the Court of Appeals in the Florida Citrus Canners Cooperative case - sees the witnesses and hears them testify, while the Board and the reviewing court look only at cold records. As we said in the Universal Camera case:\n\n \". . . The findings of the examiner are to be considered along with the consistency and inherent probability of testimony. The significance of his report, of course, depends largely on the importance of credibility in the particular case.\" \n340 \nU.S., at 496\n.\n\n\n For the demeanor of a witness\n\n\". . . may satisfy the tribunal, not only that the witness' testimony is not true, but that the truth is the opposite of his story; for the denial of one, who has a motive to deny, may be uttered with such hesitation, discomfort, arrogance or defiance, as to give assurance that he is fabricating, and that, if he is, there is no alternative but to assume the truth of what he denies.\" Dyer v. MacDougall, 201 F.2d 265, 269.\n\n\n We are in doubt as to how the Court of Appeals would have decided these two cases were it rid of the yardstick for reinstatement proceedings fashioned in its Tex-O-Kan decision. The reviewing function has been deposited, not here, but in the Court of Appeals, as the Universal Camera case makes clear. We \"will intervene only . . . when the standard appears to have been misapprehended or grossly misapplied.\" \n340 \nU.S., at 491\n. Since the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 404, 409]\n\u00a0\n special rule for reinstatement cases announced in the Tex-O-Kan opinion apparently colored the review given by the Court of Appeals of these two orders, we remand the cases to it for reconsideration.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER, whom MR. JUSTICE HARLAN joins, dissenting.\n\nThese cases were brought here on the claim that the Court of Appeals had exceeded its reviewing power over orders of the National Labor Relations Board under the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. 160 (e), requiring that \"the record considered as a whole\" be canvassed. The Court does not find that the court did not assess the evidence, including inferences fairly to be drawn, in accordance with the scope of judicial review outlined in Universal Camera Corp. v. Labor Board, \n340 \nU.S. 474\n, and its companion case, Labor Board v. Pittsburgh S. S. Co., \n340 \nU.S. 498\n. But it remands the cases to the Court of Appeals because of doubt whether that court was improperly influenced in its determinations by what is deemed an erroneous legal rule as applied in Labor Board v. Tex-O-Kan Flour Mills Co., 122 F.2d 433.\n\nI am constrained to disagree with the Court's disposition of these cases on three grounds. First, the Court assumes legal identity between two cases that raise entirely different issues. Second, in neither case did the Court of Appeals apply a special and more stringent rule of review in cases of reinstatement for wrongful discharge. Finally, I think the Tex-O-Kan rule, insofar as it was applied below in Walton and is disapproved here, is in accord with prior decisions of this Court and does not conflict with the substantial evidence rule.\n\nThe Court of Appeals in Walton accepted findings by the Trial Examiner and the Board, 124 N. L. R. B. 1331, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 404, 410]\n\u00a0\n that respondents had violated 8 (a) (1) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. 158 (a) (1), by surveillance of union activities, interrogations of employees regarding the union, and threats of reprisals for union adherence. But the court refused to enforce an order to reinstate a number of employees with back pay, holding on its reading of the same dead record that the Board had before it, that there was not substantial evidence to support the Board's findings that the employees had been discharged or laid off because of their union membership and activities. 286 F.2d 16.\n\nIn Florida Citrus the Examiner and the Board found that the respondent had refused to bargain as required by 8 (a) (5), and therefore that employees who had participated in a resulting strike had been discharged and replaced in violation of 8 (a) (1) and (3). 124 N. L. R. B. 1182. The Court of Appeals denied enforcement of the order to cease and desist, to bargain on request, and to reinstate the discharged employees with pay; it did so because it concluded, on consideration of the record as a whole, that the critical finding of refusal to bargain was not supported by substantial evidence. 288 F.2d 630.\n\nThe Court today reverses both decisions for misapplication of the standard of review set forth in 10 (e) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. 160 (e), and 10 (e) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 1009 (e), and elaborated in Universal Camera Corp. v. Labor Board, \n340 \nU.S. 474\n, that \"The findings of the Board with respect to questions of fact if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole shall be conclusive.\" The Court finds that the Court of Appeals may have erroneously adopted a special rule for cases of reinstatement for wrongful discharge, forbidding the Board to discredit an employer's testimony as to the reason for discharge unless he is \n\n[369 \nU.S. 404, 411]\n\u00a0\n impeached or contradicted. These decisions are reversed because in Walton the Court of Appeals \"relied on the test stated in Labor Board v. Tex-O-Kan Flour Mills Co.,\" 122 F.2d 433, and in Florida Citrus, although Tex-O-Kan was not cited, \"its test of credibility of witnesses seemingly was applied.\"\n\n  1. Tex-O-Kan.\n\n\n That case came before the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in 1941. Judge Sibley, writing for the court, found ample evidence to sustain a cease-and-desist order against interference with union activity: \"a cease and desist order on this point costs no money and only warns to observe a right which already existed; evidence short of demonstration may easily justify such an order.\" 122 F.2d, at 438. But, he continued,\n\n\"Orders for reinstatement of employees with back pay are somewhat different. They may impoverish or break an employer, and while they are not in law penal orders, they are in the nature of penalties for the infraction of law. The evidence to justify them ought therefore to be substantial, and surmise or suspicion, even though reasonable, is not enough.\"\n\n\n Accepting that the union membership of each discharged employee \"may have been the cause, for the union was not welcomed by the persons having authority to discharge and employ,\" the court enforced the backpay order in several instances where no other reason for discharge was apparent, or where the reason given was refuted by the facts. But where management gave reasons for the discharge that were not contradicted by the facts - that a job had been abolished, that work had been inadequately done, that an employee had engaged in irregular conduct with company property or failed to report \n\n[369 \nU.S. 404, 412]\n\u00a0\n the taking of sick leave - the court held the findings of anti-union animus to be without substantial support:\n\n\"[I]t remains true that the discharger knows the real cause of discharge, it is a fact to which he may swear. If he says it was not union membership or activity, but something else which in fact existed as a ground, his oath cannot be disregarded because of suspicion that he may be lying. There must be impeachment of him, or substantial contradiction, or if circumstances raise doubts, they must be inconsistent with the positive sworn evidence on the exact point. This was squarely ruled as to a jury in Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. Chamberlain, . . . and the ruling is applicable to the Board as fact-finder.\" 122 F.2d, at 439.\n\n\n2. History of Tex-O-Kan in the Fifth Circuit.\n\n\n In numerous cases Tex-O-Kan has been cited and quoted by the Court of Appeals for its view that testimony justifying discharge should not lightly be disregarded. Labor Board v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 129 F.2d 661, 665; Labor Board v. Alco Feed Mills, 133 F.2d 419, 421; Labor Board v. Oklahoma Transp. Co., 140 F.2d 509, 510; Labor Board v. Edinburg Citrus Assn., 147 F.2d 353, 355; Labor Board v. McGahey, 233 F.2d 406, 411-412; Labor Board v. Drennon Food Products Co., 272 F.2d 23, 27; Labor Board v. Walton Mfg. Co., 286 F.2d 16, 25; Labor Board v. Atlanta Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 293 F.2d 300, 306. See also Frosty Morn Meats, Inc., v. Labor Board, 296 F.2d 617, 620-621, where Tex-O-Kan was not cited. On occasion Tex-O-Kan has also been quoted to distinguish between cease-and-desist orders and those requiring payment of back pay. Labor Board v. Williamson-Dickie Mfg. Co., 130 F.2d 260, 263; Labor Board v. Ingram, 273 F.2d 670, 673. The Tex-O-Kan \n\n[369 \nU.S. 404, 413]\n\u00a0\n credibility view has also been applied by the court in determining whether to enforce an order requiring payment of a bonus found to have been withheld in order to discourage union activity. Labor Board v. Crosby Chemicals, Inc., 274 F.2d 72, 78. It has not been cited on the issue of credibility in cases involving only cease-and-desist orders.\n\n 3. A Special Rule for Reinstatement?\n\n\n I agree with the Court that, despite the consequences of backpay orders, \"There is no place in the statutory scheme for one test of the substantiality of evidence in reinstatement cases and another test in other cases.\" However, although the Court of Appeals has several times in the past seemingly applied two different rules, and although it has not relied on Tex-O-Kan in cases dealing solely with cease-and-desist orders, I do not think either of the present cases presents an appropriate occasion for admonishing that court against applying a double standard. Both cases concerned both cease-and-desist orders and reinstatement with back pay. In neither did the Court of Appeals suggest that it was applying a special rule for reinstatement orders alone. The part of the Tex-O-Kan opinion differentiating backpay from cease-and-desist orders, quoted by this Court, was not quoted by the Court of Appeals in either case. In Walton the court said only that \"The requirements of substantiality of evidence and reasonableness of the inferences to be drawn from the evidence are not less in a case of reinstatement and reimbursement than where a cease and desist order is directed against interference\" - not that the requirements are more strict. In Florida Citrus the single factual issue whether respondent had refused to bargain underlay both backpay and cease-and-desist orders. The court \n\n[369 \nU.S. 404, 414]\n\u00a0\n properly dealt with this as a single issue and did not purport to apply different standards of review for purposes of various parts of the order. Tex-O-Kan was nowhere cited.\n\n 4. Tex-O-Kan's Credibility Rule and the Present     Cases.\n\n\n (1) In Florida Citrus collective bargaining had broken off shortly after a disastrous freeze that threatened future business. The Trial Examiner found that the company was responsible for the failure of bargaining. He recited a delay in meeting which he attributed to the company. He referred to the company's refusal to discuss the union's proposal at a meeting held just after the freeze, and to the company's failure in the face of union demands to request a postponement of negotiations to permit assessment of the effect of the freeze, as it had announced it intended to do. Finally, by resolving conflicting testimony in favor of the General Counsel's witnesses, he found that after the failure of negotiations the company had made anti-union statements and offered inducements to the employees should they forsake the union. This finding buttressed his interpretation of the company's earlier conduct when bargaining was called off. In rejecting the testimony of production manager Stephenson and accepting that of Holly, an employee to whom the alleged anti-union statements and promises had been made, the Examiner relied in part on a comparison of the demeanor of these two witnesses, saying also that Stephenson admitted such subjects as a company union had come up in the conversation; that many of the statements he was said to have made later came true; and that Holly was a logical choice to speak such sentiments to because he might reasonably have been induced to lead a movement of defection from the union. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 404, 415]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Court of Appeals held the finding of refusal to bargain to be without substantial support. It ruled that the Board could not reasonably infer a refusal to bargain from the company's refusal to make a formal request for postponing negotiations, since the union had issued an ultimatum that in effect rejected the request. Moreover, it rejected the Board's determinations of credibility. The court made it clear that it believed the Examiner's findings to have been based on \"the belief that reliance may not be placed upon the testimony of a witness who is a part of the management of an employer in a controversy with a labor union.\" Beyond this, the court declared it was unable to accept the Examiner's crediting of Holly and discrediting of Stephenson because there was no prior indication of company opposition to the union and because it was unlikely that a manager would divulge the details of company labor policy to a watchman. As to a conflict in testimony between Stephenson and Wingate, the union's chief representative, the court ruled that Wingate's testimony should have been \"more carefully scrutinized\" because the Examiner himself had found Wingate sometimes inaccurate or careless.\n\nThe Board attacks this decision as in conflict with the substantial evidence test of the Labor Management Relations Act and of the Universal Camera doctrine. The crux of its objection is that the court has substituted its judgment as to credibility for that of the Examiner and the Board; in particular, it complains that the record gives no support to the court's conclusion that the Examiner was inclined to discredit on principle all company witnesses. Neither in its petition for certiorari nor its brief on the merits did the Board cite Tex-O-Kan as the ground of its objection to the decision in Florida Citrus. Yet this Court reverses the Court of Appeals' decision without reference to the facts or the holding of that case, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 404, 416]\n\u00a0\n saying simply that the Tex-O-Kan \"test of credibility of witnesses seemingly was applied.\" But Tex-O-Kan was no more relied on by the Court of Appeals than it was attacked in this case by the Board. Tex-O-Kan forbids the Examiner and the Board to dismiss summarily management's reasons for a discharge if not contradicted, impeached, or inherently improbable. Florida Citrus was not a case of uncontradicted testimony. It was not a case in which motivation for a discharge was in doubt. The issue was what Stephenson said to the Board's witnesses; the problem was a conflict of testimony. To be sure, the Board argues that both Florida Citrus and Tex-O-Kan are manifestations of the same attitude of hostility to findings of the Labor Board. But if the Court of Appeals strayed outside the Universal Camera bounds, it did not do so by discrediting uncontradicted testimony pursuant to Tex-O-Kan. If this Court is of the opinion that the Court of Appeals unjustifiably substituted its own judgment for that of the Board, it ought to say so. The Court of Appeals ought not to be reversed for following a decision it did not follow.\n\n(2) Walton, by contrast, squarely presents a Tex-O-Kan problem. Four employees had been discharged and nine more laid off. The Trial Examiner, in each case rejecting company testimony that the employee was a substandard performer, attributed all thirteen to the employees' union activities. The Board agreed. In holding all these findings to be without substantial support, the Court of Appeals pointed out in the case of the four discharges that in addition to the company's witnesses there was evidence, sometimes given by the employee herself, either of unsatisfactory work or of meager union activity, or both. But in reversing the Board with respect to the nine layoffs the court quoted and relied on Tex-O-Kan, pointing out that management \n\n[369 \nU.S. 404, 417]\n\u00a0\n testimony, unimpeached, assigned plausible grounds for selecting each employee for layoff, and that the factual bases for these statements were largely uncontradicted.\n\n5. Tex-O-Kan and the Substantial Evidence Test.\n\nThis Court today lays down a dogmatic rule against a Fifth Circuit evidentiary practice authorizing acceptance of plausible, uncontradicted, unimpeached testimony of motivation and apparently holds the Board's power in reviewing the dead record to determine witness credibility to be absolute and unreviewable:\n\n\"the demeanor of a witness `. . . may satisfy the tribunal, not only that the witness' testimony is not true, but that the truth is the opposite of his story . . . .'\"\n\n\n This statement, torn from context in Judge Learned Hand's opinion in Dyer v. MacDougall, 201 F.2d 265, 269, is elevated into a rule of law that ignores earlier decisions of this Court and effectively insulates many administrative findings from judicial review, contrary to the command of the Labor Management Relations Act and the Administrative Procedure Act that such findings should be set aside if not supported by substantial evidence on the whole record.\n\nThe cases abound with statements that the determination of credibility is for the trier of fact and is not to be upset on appeal. E. g., Tractor Training Service v. Federal Trade Commission, 227 F.2d 420, 424 (C. A. 9th Cir.); Kitty Clover, Inc., v. Labor Board, 208 F.2d 212, 214 (C. A. 8th Cir.). Professor Jaffe has said \"It is generally held that whether made by jury, judge, or agency a determination of credibility is nonreviewable unless there is uncontrovertible documentary evidence or physical fact which contradicts it.\" Judicial Review: Question of Fact, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 404, 418]\n\u00a0\n 69 Harv. L. Rev. 1020, 1031. It is this view that has led some courts to hold that a verdict cannot be directed in favor of a party having the burden of proof if his case rests on the credibility of witnesses, e. g., Giles v. Giles, 204 Mass. 383, 90 N. E. 595. Likewise, Professor Davis speaks of it as settled \"that a trial tribunal may disbelieve the only evidence presented and dispose of the case by holding against the party having the burden of proof,\" Administrative Law Treatise, 29.06, p. 148. Even in reviewing the findings of a trial judge sitting without a jury, where the standard of review permits closer scrutiny by the Court of Appeals, Rule 52 (a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires that \"due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses.\" And in Labor Board v. Pittsburgh S. S. Co., \n337 \nU.S. 656, 660\n, this Court held that the Board's crediting of all General Counsel's witnesses and discrediting of all respondent's does not indicate bias, so long as none of the credited testimony \"carries its own death wound\" and none of that which was rejected \"carries its own irrefutable truth.\"\n\nThe opportunity of the trier of fact to observe the demeanor of witnesses should not be overlooked. But neither should it be overlooked that the Board itself has no opportunity to observe the demeanor of witnesses. Yet the Board is not required to accept a trial examiner's credibility findings, see Universal Camera Corp. v. Labor Board, \n340 \nU.S. 474, 492\n-497, and, therefore, neither is the Court of Appeals. Even where the fact-finding function is not divided, \"due regard\" for the advantage of the trier of fact does not require appellate impotence. Judge Hand's statement in Dyer v. MacDougall was one of logic, not of law; the court went on to affirm a summary judgment against the plaintiff, who presented no evidence and relied on the chance that defendant's witnesses would be disbelieved in their denials - because, despite the logical \n\n[369 \nU.S. 404, 419]\n\u00a0\n possibility that demeanor alone might convince of the affirmative, to deny summary judgment would have destroyed the effectiveness of judicial review. Indeed, this Court has never before required complete deference to credibility findings. Labor Board v. Pittsburgh S. S. Co., \n337 \nU.S. 656\n, does not so hold; a great many findings not so unfounded as to indicate bias are nonetheless reversible error. In Universal Camera Corp. v. Labor Board, \n340 \nU.S. 474, 490\n, this Court declared that Labor Board findings must be set aside when the record \"clearly precludes the Board's decision from being justified by a fair estimate of the worth of the testimony of witnesses or its informed judgment on matters within its special competence or both.\" A \"fair estimate of the worth of the testimony\" hardly suggests that the Board is free to make an unfair estimate, especially in the light of the decision in Universal Camera that \"courts must now assume more responsibility for the reasonableness and fairness of Labor Board decisions than some courts have shown in the past. . . . Congress has imposed on them responsibility for assuring that the Board keeps within reasonable grounds.\" Professor Davis states frankly that \"Administrative determinations of credibility are often set aside because the reviewing court firmly believes that the evidence supporting the determination is clearly less credible than the opposing evidence,\" Administrative Law Treaties, 29.06, p. 145. Professor Jaffe concedes that his general rule of deference to credibility findings is not unyielding and agrees that this may be proper: \"even on a credibility issue we should probably not tolerate the intuitive `hunch' where the record evidence overwhelmingly points to the contrary.\" 69 Harv. L. Rev., at 1032.\n\nIn fact, Tex-O-Kan is clearly supported by at least two decisions of this Court requiring a trier of fact to accept unimpeached testimony not contradicted by substantial evidence in the record. In Dickinson v. United States, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 404, 420]\n\u00a0\n \n346 \nU.S. 389\n, a draft board had classified petitioner I-A for Selective Service purposes despite his uncontradicted testimony, letters, and an affidavit that he was an ordained minister exempted from service. Notwithstanding its holding that such an order was subject to more limited scrutiny than most agency orders, the Court reversed his conviction for refusing to report for induction:\n\n\"The court below in affirming the conviction apparently thought the local board was free to disbelieve Dickinson's testimonial and documentary evidence even in the absence of any impeaching or contradictory evidence. . . . But when the uncontroverted evidence supporting a registrant's claim places him prima facie within the statutory exemption, dismissal of the claim solely on the basis of suspicion and speculation is both contrary to the spirit of the Act and foreign to our concepts of justice.\" \n346 \nU.S., at 396\n-397.\n\n\n In Chesapeake & Ohio R. Co. v. Martin, \n283 \nU.S. 209\n, the Court reversed a trial judge's refusal to sustain a demurrer to the evidence on the ground that a complete defense was established by uncontradicted, unimpeached testimony. Quoting at length from cases in other courts upholding appellate review of credibility determinations, the Court concluded:\n\n \"We recognize the general rule, of course, as stated by both courts below, that the question of the credibility of witnesses is one for the jury alone; but this does not mean that the jury is at liberty, under the guise of passing upon the credibility of a witness, to disregard his testimony, when from no reasonable point of view is it open to doubt.\" \n283 \nU.S., at 216\n.\n\n\n In short, the Court of Appeals was entitled to come to the conclusion to which it came, for neither the Board nor the reviewing court was bound by the Examiner's findings \n\n[369 \nU.S. 404, 421]\n\u00a0\n on credibility. I do not think the Court of Appeals applied an erroneous standard of review or grossly misapplied the correct standard, and, therefore, since it is not for this Court to \"pass on the Board's conclusions in the first instance or to make an independent review of the review by the Court of Appeals,\" Labor Board v. Pittsburgh S. S. Co., \n340 \nU.S. 498, 502\n, I would either affirm the cases or, preferably, dismiss the writs as improvidently granted. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 404, 422]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","117":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLANZA v. NEW YORK(1962)\nNo. 236\nArgued: April 2, 1962Decided: June 4, 1962\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner was convicted in a state court of violating a state statute by willfully refusing to answer pertinent questions of a duly constituted legislative committee conducting an authorized legislative investigation, after he had been given immunity from prosecution. In this Court, he contended that his conviction violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because a conversation which he had with his brother in a public jail, where the latter was confined, was intercepted without their knowledge by state officials through an electronic listening device and a transcript of the conversation was used by the legislative committee in interrogating petitioner. The State's highest court certified that it had passed upon this claim and held that petitioner's constitutional rights were not violated. However, the record showed that at least two of the questions which petitioner was convicted of refusing to answer were not related in any way to the intercepted conversation, and refusal to answer either of these questions was sufficient to support the judgment. Held: The constitutional claim asserted by petitioner is not tendered by the record in this case, and the judgment is affirmed. Pp. 139-147.\n\n 9 N. Y. 2d 895, 175 N. E. 2d 833, affirmed.\n\nLeo Pfeffer and Jacob D. Fuchsberg argued the cause and filed briefs for petitioner.\n\nH. Richard Uviller argued the cause for respondent. With him on the briefs was Frank S. Hogan.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nOn February 13, 1957, the petitioner paid a visit to his brother, who was then confined in a New York jail. The two conversed in a room at the jail set aside for such visits. Six days later the petitioner's brother was released from custody by order of one member of the State Parole \n\n[370 \nU.S. 139, 140]\n\u00a0\n Commission, under rather unusual circumstances.\n1\n This prompted a committee of the New York Legislature to hold an investigation of possible corruption in the state parole system.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nDuring the course of the committee's investigation, the petitioner was called to testify. He appeared, accompanied by counsel. After granting the petitioner immunity from prosecution, as permitted by state law,\n3\n the committee directed him to answer several questions. For refusing to answer these questions the petitioner was indicted, tried and convicted under a provision of the criminal law of New York.\n4\n His conviction was affirmed on review by the New York courts.\n5\n We granted certiorari, \n\n[370 \nU.S. 139, 141]\n\u00a0\n \n368 \nU.S. 918\n, to consider the petitioner's claim that he could not constitutionally be punished for refusing to answer the questions put to him by the state legislative committee, because the conversation he had had with his brother in jail had been electronically intercepted and recorded by officials of the State, and a transcript of that conversation had furnished the basis of the committee's questions. For the reasons which follow, we hold that this constitutional claim is not valid, and we accordingly affirm the judgment before us.\n\nThe record does not make clear the precise circumstances under which the conversation in the jail between the petitioner and his brother was overheard and transcribed. The State concedes, however, that an electronic device was installed in the room at the Westchester County Jail where the two conversed on February 13, 1957, that without their knowledge their conversation was thereby overheard and transcribed by jail officials, and that a transcript of the conversation was in the hands of the legislative committee when the petitioner was summoned to testify.\n\nThe petitioner has not questioned the power of the state legislative committee to conduct an investigation into whether the state parole system was being administered honestly and evenhandedly, nor has he questioned the good faith or propriety of the particular investigation which gave rise to the present case. His argument is simply that the interception of the jail conversation was a violation of those principles of the Fourth Amendment which have found recognition in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth, that it was accordingly impermissible for the state legislative committee to make use of the transcript of that conversation in interrogating him, and \n\n[370 \nU.S. 139, 142]\n\u00a0\n that New York therefore denied him due process of law by convicting him for refusing to answer the committee's questions.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nThe Fourth Amendment specifically insures the \"right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures,\" by federal officers. We may take it as settled that the Fourteenth Amendment gives to the people like protection against the conduct of the officials of any State. Mapp v. Ohio, \n367 \nU.S. 643\n; Elkins v. United States, \n364 \nU.S. 206\n; Wolf v. Colorado, \n338 \nU.S. 25\n.\n\nThe petitioner's argument thus necessarily begins with two assumptions: that the visitors' room of a public jail is a constitutionally protected area, and that surreptitious electronic eavesdropping under certain circumstances may amount to an unreasonable search or seizure. As to the second there can be no doubt. This Court through the years has not taken a literal or mechanical approach to the question of what may constitute a search or seizure.\n7\n And as recently as last Term we specifically held that electronic eavesdropping by federal officers, accomplished by physical intrusion into the wall of a house, violated the \n\n[370 \nU.S. 139, 143]\n\u00a0\n Fourth Amendment rights of the occupants. Silverman v. United States, \n365 \nU.S. 505\n.\n\nBut to say that a public jail is the equivalent of a man's \"house\" or that it is a place where he can claim constitutional immunity from search or seizure of his person, his papers, or his effects, is at best a novel argument. To be sure, the Court has been far from niggardly in construing the physical scope of Fourth Amendment protection. A business office is a protected area,\n8\n and so may be a store.\n9\n A hotel room, in the eyes of the Fourth Amendment, may become a person's \"house,\"\n10\n and so, of course, may an apartment.\n11\n An automobile may not be unreasonably searched.\n12\n Neither may an occupied taxicab.\n13\n Yet, without attempting either to define or to predict the ultimate scope of Fourth Amendment protection, it is obvious that a jail shares none of the attributes of privacy of a home, an automobile, an office, or a hotel room. In prison, official surveillance has traditionally been the order of the day.\n14\n Though it may be assumed that even \n\n[370 \nU.S. 139, 144]\n\u00a0\n in a jail, or perhaps especially there, the relationships which the law has endowed with particularized confidentiality must continue to receive unceasing protection,\n15\n there is no claimed violation of any such special relationship here.\n\nBut even if we accept the premise that the room at the jail where the petitioner and his brother conversed was an area immunized by the Constitution from unreasonable search and seizure, and even though we put to one side questions as to the petitioner's standing to complain,\n16\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 139, 145]\n\u00a0\n the petitioner's argument would still carry far beyond any decision which this Court has yet rendered. The case before us bears no resemblance to such cases as Leyra v. Denno, \n347 \nU.S. 556\n, where a State attempted to use as evidence in a criminal trial a confession which had been elicited by trickery from the defendant while he was in jail. See also Spano v. New York, \n360 \nU.S. 315\n. We do not have here the introduction into a state criminal trial of evidence which is claimed to have been unconstitutionally seized, as in Mapp v. Ohio, \n367 \nU.S. 643\n. See Rochin v. California, \n342 \nU.S. 165\n. Nor is this a case where it is claimed that the evidence actually offered at a trial was procured through knowledge gained from what had been unlawfully obtained - the \"fruit of the poisonous tree.\" Cf. Nardone v. United States, \n308 \nU.S. 338\n.\n\nHere no such evidence was ever introduced in a prosecution against the petitioner. Rather, the petitioner was convicted for willfully refusing to answer the pertinent questions of a duly constituted legislative committee in the conduct of an authorized legislative investigation, after having been given immunity from prosecution. To hold that the petitioner could not constitutionally be convicted for refusing to answer such questions simply because they related to a conversation which had been unlawfully overheard by other state officials would thus be a completely unprecedented step.\n\nThe ultimate disposition of this case, however, does not demand consideration of whether such a step might ever be constitutionally required. For even if all the other doubtful issues should be resolved in the petitioner's favor, the record conclusively shows that at least two of the questions which the committee asked him were not related in any way to the intercepted conversation. The petitioner was asked to whom he had talked in February, \n\n[370 \nU.S. 139, 146]\n\u00a0\n 1957, about releasing his brother on parole.\n17\n He was asked to describe the efforts he had made to assist in obtaining his brother's release.\n18\n Not only is it apparent on their face that these questions were not dependent upon the conversation overheard at the jail, but committee counsel unequivocally so testified at the petitioner's trial.\n19\n Costello v. United States, \n365 \nU.S. 265, 279\n-280. Refusal to answer either of these questions fully supports the judgment as modified by the New York courts.\n20\n Whitfield v. Ohio, \n297 \nU.S. 431, 438\n.\n\nMoreover, the record contains no basis for supposing that the committee would not have called the petitioner to testify, had it not been in possession of a transcript of the recorded jail conversation - assuming, arguendo, that such an attenuated connection would help the petitioner's case. See Costello v. United States, supra. Indeed, it is reasonable to infer that the petitioner would have been interrogated even if the transcript of the conversation had not existed. The committee knew of the suspicious circumstances surrounding the release of the petitioner's brother.\n21\n The committee knew that the petitioner had been one of the three visitors the brother had had during \n\n[370 \nU.S. 139, 147]\n\u00a0\n his stay in jail.\n22\n And the record shows that the committee had other independent information which could have occasioned the petitioner's interrogation. In short, we conclude that the ultimate constitutional claim asserted in this case, whatever its merits, is simply not tendered by this record.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the decision of this case.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Four parole officers had concurred in a report finding that the petitioner's brother was \"not a fit subject for restoration to parole.\" This report had been endorsed by three superiors in the Division of Parole. Shortly after receiving these recommendations a member of the Commission ordered the petitioner's brother released.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The committee was the Joint Legislative Committee on Government Operations, created by the New York Legislature in 1955. This committee was endowed with \"full power and authority to investigate, inquire into and examine the management and affairs of any department, board, bureau, commission . . . of the state, and all questions in relation thereto . . . .\" The committee was specifically authorized to investigate \"the administration of state and local laws and the detection and prevention of unsound, improper or corrupt practices in connection therewith.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] New York Penal Law 381, 584, 2447.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] New York Penal Law 1330: \"A person who being present before either house of the legislature or any committee thereof authorized to summon witnesses, wilfully refuses to be sworn or affirmed, or to answer any material and proper question, or to produce upon reasonable notice any material and proper books, papers, or documents in his possession or under his control, is guilty of a misdemeanor.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The Appellate Division modified the judgment by directing that the terms imposed on the several counts of the indictment be served concurrently. 10 App. Div. 2d 315, 199 N.

On that premise, I join the Court's opinion.\n\nMemorandum opinion of MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN.\n\nI agree with MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN that the decision of the New York courts comes to us resting firmly upon an independent state ground and I therefore join his memorandum opinion. However, because the opinion of the Court departs from our practice of refusing to reach constitutional questions not necessary for decision, I deem it appropriate to add a few words.\n\nUnquestionably, all that the Court's opinion decides is that since two of the questions asked petitioner by \n\n[370 \nU.S. 139, 148]\n\u00a0\n the Committee were not in any way related to the intercepted conversation, the refusal to answer those questions alone \"fully supports the judgment as modified by the New York courts.\" Ante, p. 146. Despite the fact that this holding deprives the Court of jurisdiction to intimate views on the other, more serious problems of constitutional dimension presented by the record. Herb v. Pitcairn, \n324 \nU.S. 117\n; Enterprise Irrigation District v. Farmers Mutual Canal Co., \n243 \nU.S. 157\n; Murdock v. Memphis, 20 Wall. 590, and would warrant dismissing the writ as improvidently granted, Benz v. New York State Thruway Authority, \n369 \nU.S. 147\n; Atchley v. California, \n366 \nU.S. 207\n, the opinion undertakes, as MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN characterizes it, a \"gratuitous exposition\" upon those more difficult constitutional problems originally thought presented for decision. These expressions of dicta are in a form which can only lead to misunderstanding and confusion in future cases. Such dicta, when written into our decisions, have an unfortunate way of turning up in digests and decisions of lower courts; they are often quoted as evidencing the considered opinion of this Court, and this is so even though such intention is denied by the writer.\n\nI am expressing my views separately because I believe that for several reasons it is particularly regrettable for the Court to depart from its normal practice in this case. The New York Court of Appeals, the highest court of the State, split 4-3 on the result reached below. And, because that court did not write a full opinion in announcing its decision, we cannot tell whether it intended to decide the constitutional issues or whether it even considered them. Its remittitur is unconvincing in determining whether its judgment was intended to rest on an independent state ground. See Benz v. New York State Thruway Authority, supra. What makes this Court's action singularly unfortunate is that the state courts, state officials \n\n[370 \nU.S. 139, 149]\n\u00a0\n and the people of New York State, have uniformly condemned the eavesdropping in this case as deplorable. The New York Appellate Division termed the action at the jail \"reprehensible and offensive,\" People v. Lanza, 10 App. Div. 2d 315, 318, 199 N. Y. S. 2d 598, 601; earlier the court had called it \"atrocious and inexcusable,\" Lanza v. New York State Joint Legislative Committee, 3 App. Div. 2d 531, 533, 162 N. Y. S. 2d 467, 470; also \"flagrant and unprecedented,\" Matter of Reuter, 4 App. Div. 2d 252, 255, 164 N. Y. S. 2d 534, 538. In the Court of Appeals it was characterized as a \"gross wrong,\" Lanza v. New York State Joint Legislative Committee, 3 N. Y. 2d 92, 101, 164 N. Y. S. 2d 9, 16, 143 N. E. 2d 772, 777 (dissenting opinion), and counsel for the Joint Committee made no effort to justify or excuse the action, but on the contrary himself called it \"repulsive and repugnant,\" ibid. The Governor of New York termed unchecked eavesdropping \"unwholesome and dangerous,\" McKinney's 1958 Session Laws of New York, 1837; and the Chairman of the New York Joint Legislative Committee on Privacy of Communications called the incident \"deplorable\" and reported that it had \"brought forth a storm of protest from lawyers, some of whom had not previously been audibly concerned [with] . . . efforts to protect the people's right of privacy.\" Report of the New York Joint Legislative Committee on Privacy of Communications, Legislative Document (1958) No. 9, 25. It has been reported that a New York trial court judge found it necessary to release a prisoner without bail so that he would be able to consult his attorney, the judge not being able to feel confident after this incident that there was any jail in the State where the prisoner and his lawyers could be secure against electronic eavesdropping. Comment, 27 Fordham L. Rev. 390, 394, n. 35. The most striking indication of the degree to which the people of the State of New York were shocked by the \n\n[370 \nU.S. 139, 150]\n\u00a0\n incident was the enactment of Article 73 of the Penal Law of New York, making it a felony to do what the officials in this case did. And finally the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, affirmed by the New York Court of Appeals, reduced the bizarre and unprecedented sentence of ten years for contempt of court to one year.\n\nIt seems to me that when this Court puts its imprimatur upon conduct so universally reproached by every branch of the government of the State in which the case arose, we invite official lawlessness which, in the long run, can be far more harmful to our society than individual contumacy.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN concur in this opinion.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS join.\n\nI must protest the Court's gratuitous exposition of several grave constitutional issues confessedly not before us for decision in this case. The tenor of the Court's wholly unnecessary comments is sufficiently ominous to justify the strongest emphasis that of the abbreviated Court of seven who participate in the decision, fewer than five will even intimate views that the constitutional protections against invasion of privacy do not operate for the benefit of persons - whether inmates or visitors - inside a jail, or that the petitioner lacks standing to challenge secret electronic interception of his conversations because he has not a sufficient possessory interest in the premises, or that the Fourth Amendment cannot be applied to protect against testimonial compulsion imposed solely as a result of an unconstitutional search or seizure.\n\nThe petitioner was convicted on several counts for failure to answer each of a number of questions put to him by \n\n[370 \nU.S. 139, 151]\n\u00a0\n a state legislative committee. On appeal, the judgment, which had imposed 10 identical sentences to run consecutively, was modified by the Appellate Division to provide that the sentences on each count should run concurrently. The record shows, affirmatively and without rebuttal, that at least two of the questions were conceived and propounded independently of the search and seizure which the petitioner claims infringed his constitutional rights; and there is nothing which supports his contention that he would not have been questioned at all but for that claimed infringement.\n\nUnder these circumstances, it is apparent that the judgment of the Court of Appeals of New York can be adequately supported by an independent ground of state law. It is the settled law of that court that there is no occasion to review a conviction on one count of an indictment or information if the judgment and sentence are sufficiently sustained by another count.\n1\n Since this Court is thus able to see that the judgment of the court below - which is unelucidated by any opinion - is maintainable on an \n\n[370 \nU.S. 139, 152]\n\u00a0\n adequate, independent state ground, it should forbear from any further review of the case; for, in light of the clearly established New York law, a decision by this Court on the federal questions sought to be tendered here would be but an exercise in futility.\n2\n In any event, historic principles demand that any consideration of constitutional issues at least abide a clarification from the court below as to the basis for its judgment, in order \"that this Court not indulge in needless dissertations on constitutional law.\" Minnesota v. National Tea Co., \n309 \nU.S. 551, 557\n.\n\nI do not mean, however, that I would seek clarification in this case. It taxes credulity to suppose that the court below would disagree with the majority here that two of the counts are free of any taint, or depart from its own settled doctrine that even one such count requires affirmance. And even if this Court were somehow free to disregard the law of New York, the Court has in the past limited its review of a state conviction in accordance with \"the rule, frequently stated by this court, that a judgment upon an indictment containing several counts, with a verdict of guilty upon each, will be sustained if any count is good, and sufficient in itself to support the judgment.\" Whitfield v. Ohio, \n297 \nU.S. 431, 438\n.\n\nWhile the Court does ultimately rest its disposition of the case on this ground, it does so by way of affirmance. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 139, 153]\n\u00a0\n It is at least arguable that the proper disposition is to dismiss the case because certiorari was improvidently granted. Benz v. New York State Thruway Authority, \n369 \nU.S. 147\n;\n3\n Fox Film Corp. v. Muller, \n296 \nU.S. 207\n. But in no event is it arguable that any of the constitutional questions the Court reaches are before it.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See People v. Faden, 271 N. Y. 435, 3 N. E. 2d 584; People v. Cummins, 209 N. Y. 283, 103 N. E. 169; Hope v. People, 83 N. Y. 418; People v. Davis, 56 N. Y. 95. That is also the federal rule, see Hirabayashi v. United States, \n320 \nU.S. 81, 85\n.\n\nIn affirming the conviction, the Appellate Division found it unnecessary to pass on the petitioner's contention that he could be convicted of only a single crime because, the judgment having been modified to cause the sentences to run concurrently, \"the conviction on any one count is sufficient to sustain the sentence . . . . (People v. Faden, 271 N. Y. 435, 444-445.)\" 10 App. Div. 2d 315, 319, 199 N. Y. S. 2d 598, 603. The Court of Appeals, which in affirming without opinion modified the judgment to make clear that only a single crime had been committed, found no occasion to re-examine the sentence because \"It is clear . . . that the number of crimes of which the defendant was found guilty did not enter into the duration of the sentence imposed.\" 9 N. Y. 2d 895, 897, 175 N. E. 2d 833.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Compare Bachtel v. Wilson, \n204 \nU.S. 36\n, in which the Court dismissed a writ of error to the Supreme Court of Ohio, which had written no opinion. The Court said, at p. 40: \"Before we can pronounce [the judgment of the court below] in conflict with the Federal Constitution it must be made to appear that its decision was one necessarily in conflict therewith and not that possibly, or even probably, it was. . . . We do not decide [that the state statute is to be given a construction which would render it constitutional], but we do hold that in view of the silence of the Supreme Court we are not justified in assuming that it [did not so construe the statute].\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] In Benz, as here, the Court of Appeals had granted the petitioner an amended remittitur reciting that it had necessarily passed upon a federal constitutional question, to wit: \"Whether plaintiff was deprived of just compensation in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" Notwithstanding that representation, we concluded that the Court of Appeals had \"decided no more than\" a question relating to state court jurisdiction. That action was entirely consistent with Honeyman v. Hanan, \n300 \nU.S. 14, 18\n-19: \"A certificate or statement by the state court that a federal question has been presented to it and necessarily passed upon is not controlling. While such a certificate or statement may aid this Court in the examination of the record, it cannot avail to foreclose the inquiry which it is our duty to make or to import into the record a federal question which otherwise the record wholly fails to present.\" Indeed, as Honeyman v. Hanan, supra, and Honeyman v. Hanan, \n302 \nU.S. 375\n, illustrate, proper pursuit of the matter when suspicions are aroused may disclose that a state court's certificate simply did not mean what it appeared, at first glance, to say.\n\nThe remittitur in this case recited: \"Defendant argued that the imposition of penal sanctions for his refusal to answer certain questions deprived him of liberty without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court of Appeals held that defendant's constitutional rights were not violated.\" The Court of Appeals wrote no opinion, and it is understood in New York that \"affirmance without opinion is merely an adoption of the result reached by the Appellate Division, the reasoning of which is not necessarily adopted.\" Carmody's New York Practice (7th ed. 1956) 678. See Commissioner v. Jackson, 265 N. Y. 440, 441, 193 N. E. 262; Soderman v. Stone Bar Associates, Inc., 208 Misc. 864, 867, 146 N. Y. S. 2d 233, 236. For all we can tell, the Court of Appeals concluded that the petitioner's \"constitutional rights were not violated\" by reasoning that the two untainted questions supported the conviction. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 139, 154]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","118":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLANZA v.

To protect the prices received by milk producers in that region, he included in the orders a provision in effect requiring those who buy milk elsewhere and bring it into the region for sale as fluid milk to pay to the producers who regularly supply the region a \"compensatory payment\" equal to the difference between the minimum price set by the Market Administrator for fluid milk and the minimum price for surplus milk in the region. Held: This requirement is invalid, because it conflicts with 8c (5) (G) of the Act, which, as shown by its legislative history, was intended by Congress to prevent the Secretary from setting up trade barriers to the importation of milk from other production areas in the United States.

Mondale, Attorney General, and Sydney Berde, Deputy Attorney General, for the State of Minnesota, as amicus curiae.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioners, operating milk processing plants in Pennsylvania, challenge the validity of certain \"compensatory payment\" provisions included in milk marketing orders affecting the New York-New Jersey area, which were promulgated by the Secretary of Agriculture under the authority granted him by 8c of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, 7 U.S.C. 608c. That section permits the Secretary to issue regional regulations governing, in various enumerated respects, the marketing of certain agricultural commodities, among which is milk. This provision in question requires those who buy milk elsewhere and bring it into the region for sale as fluid milk to pay to the farmers who supply the region a fixed amount as a \"compensatory payment.\" This amount is measured by the difference between the minimum price set by the Market Administrator for fluid milk and the minimum price for surplus milk. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, 287 F.2d 726, upholding the validity of the \"compensatory payment\" provision here under attack,\n1\n conflicted with an earlier \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 78]\n\u00a0\n decision rendered by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Kass v. Brannan, 196 F.2d 791. To resolve this conflict we granted certiorari. \n366 \nU.S. 957\n.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\n THE GENERAL SCHEME OF MILK REGULATION.\n\n\n The order around which the present controversy centers, now titled Milk Marketing Order No. 2, 7 CFR 1002.1 et seq.,\n2\n though somewhat more complex than others, is in its general outline representative of the pattern of regulation established by the Secretary for the promotion of orderly marketing conditions in the milk industry and the preservation of minimum prices for farmers. Pursuant to the authority granted by 8c (5) (A),\n3\n the Order classifies milk that is sold within \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 79]\n\u00a0\n the New York-New Jersey marketing area \"in accordance with the form in which or the purpose for which it is used.\" Milk that contains 3% to 5% butterfat - the usual proportion in ordinary liquid milk - and is sold for fluid consumption is assigned to Class I. Milk that is used for cream (sweet and sour), half and half, or milk drinks containing less than 3% or more than 5% butterfat is classified in Class II. The remainder - milk that is to be stored for a substantial period and used for dairy products such as butter and cheese - is grouped in Class III. 7 CFR 1002.37.\n\nThis classification reflects the relative prices usually commanded by the different forms of milk. Thus, highest prices are paid for milk used for fluid consumption, and the lowest for milk which is to be processed into butter and cheese. Since the supply of milk is always greater than the demands of the fluid-milk market, the excess must be channeled to the less desirable, lower-priced outlets. It is in order to avoid destructive competition among milk producers for the premium outlets that the statute authorizes the Secretary to devise a method whereby uniform prices are paid by milk handlers to producers for all milk received, regardless of the form in which \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 80]\n\u00a0\n it leaves the plant and its ultimate use. Adjustments are then made among the handlers so that each eventually pays out-of-pocket an amount equal to the actual utilization value of the milk he has bought.\n\nUnder the Marketing Order here in question it is primarily the handlers whose plants are located within the marketing area and who regularly supply that are with fluid milk who are regulated. All handlers who receive or distribute milk within the area are required to submit monthly reports to the Market Administrator, listing the quantity of milk they have handled and the use for which it was sold. But only the handlers operating \"pool plants\" - i. e., plants which meet certain standards set out in 7 CFR 1002.25-1002.29\n4\n - must pay the producers from whom they buy the uniform price set by the Administrator. This price is calculated each month on the basis of the reports that are submitted. After determining the minimum prices for each use classification pursuant to formulas set out in 7 CFR 1002.40, the Administrator computes an average price for the \"pool\" milk handled during that month. This figure is reached by first multiplying the \"pool\" milk disposed of in each class by the established minimum price for that class, and then adding the products to the \"compensatory payments\" made for nonpool milk. After certain minor adjustments are made, this sum is divided by the total quantity of \"pool\" milk sold in the market during the month. The quotient is a \"blend price.\" With some adjustments to reflect transportation expenses, this uniform price must be paid to producers by all handlers maintaining \"pool\" plants. 7 CFR 1002.66. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 81]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdjustments among handlers are made by way of a \"Producer Settlement Fund,\" into which each handler contributes the excess of his \"use value\"\n5\n over the uniform price paid by him to his producer. Handlers whose \"use value\" of the milk they purchase is less than the \"blend price\" they are required to pay may withdraw the difference from the fund. The net effect is that each handler pays for his milk at the price he would have paid had it been earmarked at the outset for the use to which it was ultimately put. But the farmer who produces the milk is protected from the effects of competition for premium outlets since he is automatically allotted a proportional share of each of the different \"use\" markets.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\n  THE COMPENSATORY PAYMENT PROVISION.\n\n\n It will thus be seen that this system of regulation contemplates economic controls only over \"pool-handler\" plants since only such handlers are required to pay the \"blend price\" to their producers and to account to the Producer Settlement Fund. If limited to the provisions recounted above, the regulatory scheme would not affect milk brought into the New York-New Jersey marketing area by handlers who are primarily engaged in supplying some other market and whose producers are not located within the New York-New Jersey area. Some of the regional orders now in effect do not undertake any economic regulation of \"outside\" or \"other source\" milk.\n6\n But it is quite obvious that under certain circumstances some regulation of such milk may be necessary. Accordingly, \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 82]\n\u00a0\n 8c (7) (D) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 608c (7) (D), authorizes the Secretary to include in his regulating orders conditions that are incidental to terms expressly authorized by the statute, and that are \"necessary to effectuate the other provisions of such order.\"\n\nA handler who brings outside milk into a marketing area may disrupt the regulatory scheme in at least two respects:\n\n (1) Pool handlers in the marketing area who are required to pay the minimum class prices for their milk may find their selling prices undercut by those of nonpool handlers dealing in outside milk purchased at an unregulated price.\n\n\n (2) Producers in the marketing area, whose \"blend price\" depends on how much of the relatively constant fluid-milk demand they supply in a given month, may find the outside milk occupying a portion of the premium market, thus displacing the \"pool\" milk and forcing it into the less rewarding surplus uses, with the ultimate effect of diminishing the \"blend price\" payable to producers.\n\n\n In an effort to cope with these disruptive economic forces, the Secretary devised his \"compensatory payment\" plan. In essence the plan imposes special monetary exactions on handlers introducing \"outside\" milk for fluid consumption into a marketing area in months when there is a substantial surplus of milk on the market.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nOf the 68 regional milk orders which establish marketwide pools,\n8\n 64 contain \"compensatory payment\" provisions \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 83]\n\u00a0\n of one kind or another. The Order now before us is typical of 23 of these orders.\n9\n The Order provides that a handler who brings \"outside\" milk into the New York-New Jersey area and sells it for fluid use must pay to the pool's producers, through the Producer Settlement Fund, an amount equal to the difference between the minimum prices for the highest and for the lowest use classifications prevailing in that area. In other words, for each hundredweight of nonpool milk sold for Class I use in the New York-New Jersey area, a payment equal to the difference between Class I and Class III prices must be made by the seller to the Producer Settlement Fund.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\n  THE PURPOSE AND EFFECT OF THE COMPENSATORY\n\nPAYMENT.\n\n\n\n\n After the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit had held the compensatory payment requirement in the New York-New Jersey Milk Marketing Order (then Order No. 27) to be a \"penalty,\" Kass v. Brannan, 196 F.2d 791, \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 84]\n\u00a0\n 795, the Secretary of Agriculture conducted extensive hearings to determine whether it should be retained. His findings, which appear at 18 Fed. Reg. 8444-8454, explain this requirement as the most satisfactory means of imposing \"a suitable charge on such unpriced milk in an amount sufficient to neutralize, compensate for and eliminate the artificial economic advantage for non-pool milk which necessarily is created by the classified pricing and pooling of pool milk under the order.\" Id., at 8448. There seems little doubt that an assessment equal to the Class I-Class III differential would, in all but rare instances, nullify any competitive advantage that non-pool milk could have: only if the sum of the purchase price of the outside milk and the cost of its transportation to market were less than the Class III price would a handler find it profitable to bring such milk into the marketing area. But it must be obvious that this payment is wholly or partially \"compensatory\" - i. e., puts pool and nonpool milk \"on substantially similar competitive positions at source\" (ibid.) - only if the milk has been purchased at not more than the Class III price. If the purchase price of the nonpool milk exceeds the Class III price within the area, the effect of the fixed compensatory payment is to make it economically unfeasible for a handler to bring such milk into the marketing area.\n\nThe Secretary of Agriculture's determination that the Class I-Class III differential was the most suitable compensatory figure rested upon what was, in effect, an irrebuttable presumption that the nonpool milk was purchased at a rate commensurate with the value of \"surplus\" (Class III) milk. See 18 Fed. Reg., at 8448.\n10\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 85]\n\u00a0\n That presumption was based in turn on the supposition that the nonpool milk could not have been worth more than the Class III price where purchased since it could not be shipped elsewhere for Class I use. But it must \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 86]\n\u00a0\n be apparent that it is only if the milk is denied access to other marketing areas or if a prohibitive payment is assessed on its use elsewhere that it will depreciate in value to Class III levels. For if the milk can be freely shipped elsewhere for fluid use or if it is purchased in an area where prices paid to producers are regulated, it will command a higher price.\n\nIndeed, the facts of the case now before us demonstrate the shortcomings of the Secretary's reasoning. One of the petitioners, Suncrest Farms, Inc., purchases its milk in Pennsylvania under regulations established by the Pennsylvania Milk Control Commission. In September 1957, which was one of the months during which it sought to sell its milk in the New York-New Jersey Marketing Area, Suncrest was required to pay $6.40 per cwt. for the milk it purchased from dairy farmers in Pennsylvania. The Class I-Class III differential in the New York-New Jersey Marketing Area during that month was $2.78 per cwt. Thus, if the \"compensatory payment\" were assessed, Suncrest would actually be forced to pay $9.18 per cwt. for fluid milk sold in the area, while the handlers maintaining pool plants in the area would pay only the Class I price, which was $6.23 in August 1957.\n11\n\u00a0\n\nIf competitive parity among handlers of pool and nonpool milk were the only objective of the Secretary's \"compensatory\" regulation, other marketing orders of the Secretary show that this result has been achieved without imposing unnecessary hardships, virtually \"trade \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 87]\n\u00a0\n barriers\" as in the instance just given,\n12\n on the nonpool milk.\n13\n\u00a0\n\nIt is considering the effect of the present compensatory payment provision on the pool producers, however, \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 88]\n\u00a0\n that the principal concern of the Secretary becomes quite apparent. As has been noted (p. 82, supra), the sale for fluid use of nonpool milk in the marketing area displaces pool milk that might otherwise be used for this premium outlet. Since the market area's \"blend price\" is computed only with reference to the pool milk, the effect of the entry of nonpool milk is to drive down the price that \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 89]\n\u00a0\n is paid to producers in the area. A close examination of the workings of the present compensatory payment provision reveals that its effect is to preserve for the benefit of the area's producers the blend price that they would receive if all outside milk were physically excluded and they alone would supply the fluid-milk needs of the area For every cwt. of pool milk that is forced into \"surplus\" use by the entry of nonpool milk, the handler introducing the outside milk is required to pay for the benefit of the area's producers the difference between the value the pool milk would have had if the nonpool milk had never entered and the value it has once the nonpool milk is sold for fluid use.\n14\n In effect, therefore, the nonpool milk is \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 90]\n\u00a0\n forced to subsidize the pool milk and insulate the pool milk from the competitive impact caused by the entry of outside milk. This was recognized by the Court of Appeals which held that such a compensatory payment \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 91]\n\u00a0\n was \"designed to compensate the pool for the loss of the Class I fluid milk utilization and . . . protect the uniform blend price in the marketing area.\" 287 F.2d, at 730. It is only if the Secretary has been authorized by the statute to impose such economic trade barriers on the entry of milk into an area so as to protect the prices received by the pool producers that the present compensatory payment plan can be sustained as \"necessary to effectuate\" the expressly authorized provisions of this Order.\n\n\nIV.\n\n\n\n   SECTION 8c (5) (G).\n\n\n Section 8c (5) (G) of the Act, however, taken in light of its legislative history, indicates that the regulation here imposed by the Secretary was of the sort that Congress intended to forbid. Section 8c (5) (G) provides:\n\n \"No marketing agreement or order applicable to milk and its products in any marketing area shall prohibit or in any manner limit, in the case of the products of milk, the marketing in that area of any milk or product thereof produced in any production area in the United States.\"\n\n\n This provision was first enacted into law as part of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 750, amending the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 31. It was re-enacted as part of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, 50 Stat. 246, which reaffirmed the marketing order provisions of the 1935 Act after the processing tax had been struck down as unconstitutional in United States v. Butler, \n297 \nU.S. 1\n.\n\nAlong with enumerating the powers granted to the Secretary of Agriculture so as to avoid the \"delegation\" problems brought to light by the then recent decision in Schechter v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 495\n, the Congress \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 92]\n\u00a0\n sought in 1935 to limit the Secretary's powers so as to prevent him from establishing \"trade barriers.\" Midwestern legislators were particularly concerned over this possibility. When the reported bill which contained no provision like the present 8c (5) (G) came to the floor of the House of Representatives. Representative Andresen of Minnesota suggested that the Secretary might use his powers to \"stop the free flow in commerce . . . of dairy products.\" He received an assurance from Representative Jones, the Chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture, that the Secretary was not authorized to require anything more of milk coming into a marketing area than that it \"comply with the same conditions which the farmers and distributors comply with in that region.\" 79 Cong. Rec. 9462.\n15\n An amendment to the bill clarifying this position was then offered by Representative \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 93]\n\u00a0\n Sauthoff of Wisconsin, 79 Cong. Rec. 9493,\n16\n but no action was taken on that proposal.\n\nOn the next day, Representative Andresen proposed from the floor of the House the forerunner to the present 8c (5) (G). 79 Cong. Rec. 9572. His amendment took the following form:\n\n \"(g) No marketing agreement or order applicable to milk and its products in any marketing area shall prohibit the marketing in that area of any milk or product thereof produced in any production area in the United States.\"\n\n\n There was no objection to the addition of this language, Representative Jones remarking that \"[i]t is simply clarifying.\" Ibid. But when Representative Sauthoff sought to change the amendment by substituting the words \"limit or tend to limit\" for \"prohibit,\" Representative Jones objected on the ground that necessary milk classification and minimum pricing for the protection of outside milk producers regularly supplying their own marketing area would \"tend to limit\" the introduction of their milk into other areas.\n17\n Ibid. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 94]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe House bill, with the language added by Representative Andresen's amendment, went to the Senate. Accompanying the bill to the floor was S. Rep. No. 1011, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., which stated, at p. 11:\n\n \"To prevent assaults upon the price structure by the sporadic importation of milk from new producing areas, while permitting the orderly and natural expansion of the area supplying any market by the introduction of new producers or new producing areas, orders may provide that for the first 3 months \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 95]\n\u00a0\n of regular delivery, payments shall be made to producers not therefore selling milk in the area covered by the order at the price fixed for the lowest use classification. This is the only limitation upon the entry of new producers - wherever located - into a market, and it can remain effective only for the specified 3-month period.\" (Emphasis added.)\n18\n\u00a0\n\n\n In the Senate 8c (5) (G) was amended, without objection, 79 Cong. Rec. 11655, to read:\n\n \"(G) No marketing agreement or order applicable to milk and its products in any marketing area shall prohibit or in any manner limit, except as provided for milk only in subsection (d), the marketing in that area of any milk or product thereof produced in any production area in the United States.\"\n19\n\u00a0\n\n\n Section 8c (5) (G) emerged from conference in its present form. The conference report explained how the differences between the House and Senate versions were resolved (H. R. Rep. No. 1757, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. 21):\n\n \". . . The conference agreement retains the House provision with respect to prohibitions on marketing of both milk and products of milk. The conference agreement also denies the authority to limit in any manner the marketing in any area of milk products (butter, cheese, cream, etc.) produced anywhere in the United States. The language adopted by the conference agreement does not refer to milk, and so does not negative the applicability to milk, for use in fluid form or for manufacturing purposes, of the provisions \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 96]\n\u00a0\n  of the bill relating to milk, such as the provisions  on price fixing, price adjustment, payments for  milk, etc.\"\n\n\n When the conference agreement came to the floor of the House, Representative Jones again explained what 8c (5) (G), when taken together with 8c (5) (D), meant (79 Cong. Rec. 13022):\n\n \"Mr. SNELL. . . . I do not understand exactly what this means, `No marketing agreement or order applicable to milk and its products,' and so forth.\n\n\n \"Mr. JONES. That simply applies to fluid milk. You cannot make any limitation at all on the amount of butter or cheese or milk products that are shipped from any one area to another, and the limitation that may be applied on milk is only such limitation as puts each area on an equality with the other areas after a certain period of about 2-1\/2 months.\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"Mr. SNELL. How does that change the situation from the present law?\n\n\n \"Mr. JONES. The provisions of this particular bill would enable that area to be protected from being swamped with fluid milk from the outside, bought at any old price. For instance, if you do not have the protection of this bill they would run into the same trouble they ran into in the New York milk cases, where they went into New Hampshire and bought milk at a lower price and came in and broke down your milk agreements. Under the provisions of this bill if a price were fixed in this particular area in New York, then if anyone bought milk from an outside area and brought it in he would be compelled to pay the producer the same price that was being paid the producers within the area and comply with \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 97]\n\u00a0\n  all regulations and requirements of that area. For  the first 2 months he would be required to take  the manufacturer's price.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n This history discloses that rather than being confined, as Judge Learned Hand suggested in Kass v. Brannan, 196 F.2d, at 800, to practices aimed at the exclusion of cheese and other milk products from eastern markets, 8c (5) (G) was compendiously intended to prevent the Secretary from setting up, under the guise of price-fixing regulation, any kind of economic trade barriers, whether relating to milk or its products. Whenever there was an attempt to broaden the language of subsection (G) to encompass \"limitations\" as well as \"prohibitions,\" those opposing it pointed only to the fact that \"limit\" might be read as including the type of price fixing covered by subsection (D) - i. e., allowing new pool producers only manufacturing-use prices for a limited period - or other attempts to put outside milk on an equal footing with pool milk. Although the words of 8c (5) (G), \"in any manner limit,\" must be taken, in the context of their legislative history, as referring only to milk products, that history likewise makes it clear that as regards milk the word \"prohibit\" refers not merely to absolute or quota physical restrictions, but also encompasses economic trade barriers of the kind effected by the subsidies called for by this \"compensatory payment\" provision.\n\n\nV.\n\n\n\n  THE INVALIDITY OF THE PRESENT COMPENSATORY    PAYMENT PROVISION.\n\n\n In light of the legislative history of 8c (5) (G) we conclude that the compensatory payment provision of the New York-New Jersey Milk Marketing Order must fall as inconsistent with the policy expressed by Congress in \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 98]\n\u00a0\n that section.\n20\n Because it conflicts with 8c (5) (G), the payment provision cannot be justified under the general terms of 8c (7) (D), which prevents the inclusion of conditions that are inconsistent with express statutory provisions. Nor is the compensatory payment clause saved by the circumstance that in some instances it may also fortuitously operate to put the handlers of pool and non-pool milk on a competitive par. As has been pointed out (note 13, supra), there are other means available to the Secretary for achieving this result, while affording protection to pool producers, without imposing almost insuperable trade restrictions on the entry of nonpool milk into a marketing area.\n\nThe Government contends that the effect of 8c (5) (G) may not be considered by this Court since that provision was not cited by the petitioners in the administrative proceeding in the Department of Agriculture. But even on the Government's premise that an unauthorized regulation should be upheld by this Court merely because the provision prohibiting it was not cited in the administrative proceeding in which it was attacked, this case presents no such instance. The administrative petition filed with the Department of Agriculture alleged that the effect of the compensatory payment clause amounted \"to establishing tariffs or barriers interfering with the free flow of milk across state lines,\" an obvious reference to the prohibition of 8c (5) (G).\n\nIn addition, the Government contends that the petitioners had the choice of joining the market-wide pool, in which case they would not have been subject to the compensatory payment provisions. Their election to stay \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 99]\n\u00a0\n out of the pool, it is argued, bars any attack on the consequences of their choice. However, such an \"election\" is surely illusory. The consequences of joining the pool would have been that petitioners would have been forced to pay the \"blend price\" to all their producers wherever located and account to the Producer Settlement Fund for all milk wherever sold. In these circumstances the election was not voluntary as in Booth Fisheries v. Industrial Comm'n, \n271 \nU.S. 208, 211\n. It was coercive and, indeed, no election at all.\n\nWhether full regulation of the petitioners would be permissible under the Act is a question which we need not reach in this case. If the Secretary chooses to impose such regulation as a consequence of a handler's introducing any milk into a marketing area, the validity of such a provision would involve considerations different from those now before us. With respect to these petitioners, however, and with regard to the regulation here in issue, we conclude that the action of the Secretary of Agriculture exceeded the powers entrusted to him by Congress.\n\nThe Secretary of course remains free to protect, in any manner consistent with the provisions of the statute, the \"blend price\" in this or any other marketing area against economic consequences resulting from the introduction of outside milk. We do not now decide whether or not any new regulation directed to that end could be made to apply retrospectively, or whether, if it could be validly so applied, the presently impounded funds could be resorted to pro tanto in its effectuation. Cf. United States v. Morgan, \n307 \nU.S. 183\n. \"What further proceedings the Secretary may see fit to take in the light of our decision, or what determinations may be made by the District Court in relation to any such proceedings, are not matters which we should attempt to forecast or hypothetically to decide.\" Morgan v. United States, \n304 \nU.S. 1, 23\n, 26. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 100]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n    It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the decision of this case.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The petitioners instituted this action challenging the validity of the compensatory payment provision by filing administrative petitions with the Secretary of Agriculture pursuant to 8c (15) (A) of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, 7 U.S.C. 608c (15) (A). The Hearing Examiner sustained the petitioners' \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 78]\n\u00a0\n contentions on the authority of Kass v. Brannan, 196 F.2d 791, but the Judicial Officer, acting on behalf of the Secretary of Agriculture, dismissed the petitions.\n\nPetitioners then sought review of the Secretary's ruling in the District Court under 8c (15) (B) of the Act. The review proceedings were consolidated with enforcement actions brought by the Government pursuant to 8a (6) of the Act. The District Court, relying on Kass v. Brannan, supra, held that the payment provision was invalid. 183 F. Supp. 80. It was this decision that was reversed by the Court of Appeals. 287 F.2d 726.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] A general reorganization of Chapter IX of Title 7 of the Code of Federal Regulations during the past year has resulted in redesignation of most of the milk marketing orders. The New York-New Jersey Order had previously been designated as Milk Marketing Order No. 27 and had been found at 7 CFR 927. The section references and the contents of the regulations as quoted throughout this opinion are as they were in effect on January 1, 1962.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Section 8c (5) (A) provides:\n\n\"(5) Milk and its products; terms and conditions of orders.\n\n\n\"In the case of milk and its products, orders issued pursuant to this section shall contain one or more of the following terms and conditions, \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 79]\n\u00a0\n and (except as provided in subsection (7) of this section) no others:\n\n\n\"(A) Classifying milk in accordance with the form in which or the purpose for which it is used, and fixing, or providing a method for fixing, minimum prices for each such use classification which all handlers shall pay, and the time when payments shall be made, for milk purchased from producers or associations of producers. Such prices shall be uniform as to all handlers, subject only to adjustments for (1) volume, market, and production differentials customarily applied by the handlers subject to such order, (2) the grade or quality of the milk purchased, and (3) the locations at which delivery of such milk, or any use classification thereof, is made to such handlers.\" 7 U.S.C. 608c (5) (A).\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] These provisions establish certain performance requirements aimed at insuring that the plant continues to provide fluid milk to the marketing area even in periods of short supply. Thus, it is primarily the handlers whose main concern is the marketing area who qualify for the \"pool.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] \"Use value\" is the price the handler would have had to pay, at prevailing minimum rates, had he purchased his milk at a price reflecting its ultimate disposition.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] See 7 CFR 1034 (Dayton-Springfield), 1037 (North Central Ohio), 1038 (Rockford-Freeport), 1074 (Southwest Kansas).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The payment provision of 7 CFR 1002.83 applies only in those months when the volume of milk sold for Class III use exceeds 15% of the total pool milk reported in the marketing area.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] The Act authorizes the establishment of either marketwide pools or individual handler pools. Since the latter require only that each handler pay uniform prices to all the producers from which he buys, but does not impose a uniformity requirement among the various \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 83]\n\u00a0\n handlers, there is no need for adjustments among handlers. Consequently, no compensatory payment provision is included in orders establishing individual handler pools. See 7 CFR 1004 (Philadelphia), 1005 (Tri-State), 1010 (Wilmington), 1039 (Milwaukee), 1041 (Toledo), 1044 (Michigan Upper Peninsula), 1078 (North Central Iowa), 1096 (Northern Louisiana), 1097 (Memphis), 1102 (Fort Smith), 1129 (Austin-Waco), 1130 (Corpus Christi), 1134 (Western Colorado).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Compare 7 CFR 1001.65 (Greater Boston), 1003.62 (Washington, D.C.), 1006.65 (Springfield, Mass.), 1007.65 (Worcester), 1008.54 (Wheeling), 1009.54 (Clarksburg, W. Va.), 1011.62 (Appalachian), 1014.46 (Southeastern New England), 1015.46 (Connecticut), 1016.62 (Upper Chesapeake Bay), 1030.61 (Chicago), 1031.70 (b) (South Bend-La Porte-Elkhart), 1036.84 (b) (Northeastern Ohio), 1048.54 (Greater Youngstown-Warren), 1061.54 (St. Joseph), 1068.70 (b) (Minneapolis-St. Paul), 1071.62 (b) (Neosho Valley), 1072.55 (Sioux Falls-Mitchell), 1106.55 (Oklahoma), 1125.70 (Puget Sound), 1126.70 (d) (North Texas), 1133.70 (b) (Inland Empire).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] \"As stated earlier herein, all milk which is established to be primarily associated with the New York milk marketing area under the standards prescribed by the order is included in the New York pool. Conversely, the non-pool milk which enters the marketing area for fluid use originates from plants which are not sufficiently associated \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 85]\n\u00a0\n with the New York market to have their milk in the pool. Such plants have their primary interests in other fluid markets or specialized manufacturing uses and frequently have more milk than is required for these primary purposes. It is this surplus milk at nonpool plants which can be `dumped' into the New York market for fluid use, provided only that the plant and the milk [have] marketing area health approval. The operator of such a non-pool plant has a choice of using the excess milk for surplus uses (ordinarily in the manufacture of various milk products) or of sending it to the New York marketing area for fluid uses. In making this decision he will compare the respective net returns to him for this surplus milk and will naturally select the fluid alternative, for it will yield the greater return. In the absence of classified pricing, his cost, at source, for the excess milk remains exactly the same whether he uses it for surplus disposition or for fluid use. The pool plant operator on the other hand has no such advantage for he pays a higher classified price, at source, if he sells the milk in the market area for fluid use (Class I-A or II) than if he disposes of it for surplus manufacturing uses (Class III).\n\n\"If this artificial advantage in favor of surplus non-pool milk at the plant of origin is to be effectively removed, as it must be, the milk must be treated and evaluated for what it actually is, namely surplus milk in the milkshed. If New York marketing area disposition were not available for this surplus, the non-pool handler could derive from it only its surplus value. This surplus value is its true value or `opportunity cost' and such surplus value should be used as the subtrahend in the formula for compensation payments on non-pool milk from plants not subject to a Federal order.\n\n\n\"The Class III price under the New York order is the class price which is payable, at source, for pool milk under the New York order when used for most surplus uses. It is expressly designed to fix a proper classified value, at source, for surplus milk. The Class III price closely approximates the amount paid in the Northeast to farmers not under the New York order for so much of their milk as is used for general manufacture.\n\n\n\"It is therefore a dependable indicator of the value of surplus milk at source. If a non-pool handler, for his own reasons, chooses to pay \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 86]\n\u00a0\n more than its true market value, at source, for surplus milk which he sends to the New York area, the pool should not underwrite this unnecessary cost, particularly since the premium can be used to outbid pool handlers for milk, as previously shown.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] The fact that petitioners were paying more for their milk than the Class I price in the New York-New Jersey Marketing Area leaves no room for any suggestion that they will be receiving a \"windfall\" if it is ultimately adjudged that they are entitled to have returned the full amount of their compensatory payments.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] The total amount of the compensatory payments involved in this litigation, embracing a period of approximately four years, was some $617,000 as to Lehigh Valley and $108,000 as to Suncrest.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] Several of the marketing orders make the compensatory payment equal the difference between the Class I price in the marketing area and the actual cost of the nonpool milk. See 7 CFR 1042.60 (Muskegon), 1128.62 (b) (Central West Texas). In some marketing areas the handler who deals in nonpool milk is permitted to elect each month between paying the fluid milk-surplus use differential and paying the difference between his actual cost and the minimum regional price for Class I milk. See 7 CFR 1013.62 (Southeastern Florida), 1033.61 (Greater Cincinnati), 1035.63 (Columbus, Ohio), 1040.66 (Southern Michigan), 1043.84 (Upstate Michigan), 1045.83 (Northeastern Wisconsin), 1047.62 (Fort Wayne), 1064.61 (Greater Kansas City), 1065.62 (Nebraska-Western Iowa), 1067.61 (Ozarks), 1069.62 (Duluth-Superior), 1073.62 (Wichita), 1094.62 (New Orleans), 1098.92 (Nashville), 1103.62 (Central Mississippi), 1105.62 (Mississippi Delta), 1107.61 (Mississippi Gulf Coast), 1131.62 (Central Arizona), 1135.62 (Colorado Springs-Pueblo), 1136.62 (Great Basin), 1137.62 (Eastern Colorado).\n\nOther marketing orders, applicable in some areas, assess a compensatory payment equal to the difference between the \"blend price\" paid in the area for pool milk and the Class I price, thus treating the handler of nonpool milk as if he were a member of the pool with respect to such milk as he introduced into the marketing area.\n\nWhere this differential is accepted as the measure of the compensatory payment it is done only in those months when the surplus is lowest. In the spring and summer months the fluid milk-surplus use differential is exacted. See 7 CFR 1032.55 (b) (Suburban St. Louis, August-February), 1046.55 (b) (Ohio Valley, August-March), 1049.55 (b) (Indianapolis, August-March), 1062.55 (b) (St. Louis, August-February), 1063.63 (b) (Quad Cities-Dubuque, July-November), 1066.57 (a) (Sioux City, August-February), 1070.63 (b) (Cedar Rapids-Iowa City, July-November), 1075.63 (b) (Black Hills, July-March), 1076.63 (b) (Eastern South Dakota, July-February), 1079.63 (b) (Des Moines, July-March), 1090.54 (b) (Chattanooga, August-February), 1095.70 (e) (2) (Louisville-Lexington, October-December), \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 88]\n\u00a0\n 1099.62 (a) (Paducah, August-March), 1101.93 (b) (Knoxville, August-February), 1104.53 (b) (Red River Valley, August-January), 1108.54 (b) (Central Arkansas, August-February), 1127.65 (b) (San Antonio, January and August), 1132.63 (b) (Texas Panhandle, July-February).\n\nThe latter method treats the handler of nonpool milk who buys at a price in excess of the blend price as if he were a member of the pool since a handler in the pool may, if he chooses, pay his producer more than the \"blend price\" set by the Market Administrator, see Stark v. Wickard, \n321 \nU.S. 288, 291\n, but must still account to the Producer Settlement Fund as if he had paid only the \"blend price.\" By treating nonpool milk in the same manner, the Secretary might be able to justify a compensatory payment equal to the difference between the nonpool milk's \"use value\" and the \"blend price,\" though we do not decide the question. See generally Hutt, Restrictions on the Free Movement of Fluid Milk Under Federal Milk Marketing Orders, 37 U. Det. L. J. 525, 564-577 (1960).\n\nThe suggestion that a nonpool handler would be given a competitive advantage under either of these methods because, in the words of the Judicial Officer, he does not have \"to equalize his utilization\" as do pool handlers is demonstrably unsound. Insofar as the handlers' sale of milk is concerned, neither pool nor nonpool handlers are required to share or \"equalize\" their proceeds with others. To the extent that this contention relates to the handlers' purchase of milk and is meant to suggest that nonpool handlers will find it easier to buy milk because they will be able to pay higher prices to their producers, the exaction of a Class I-blend price payment would effectively discourage purchases in excess of the blend price (which is what the pool's producers are paid). And the assertion that the pool \"carries the surplus burden for outside handlers\" is based on the same mistaken reasoning as underlies the Secretary's determination to retain the Class I-Class III payment after Kass v. Brannan, supra. See pp. 84-86, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] A highly simplified illustration serves to clarify this effect: If the Class I price on a given date is $6 per cwt. and the Class III price is $3 per cwt., and if 2,000 cwt. are consumed as fluid milk and another 2,000 cwt. are produced by the dairy farmers in the area and utilized for surplus uses, the computation of the blend price would be as follows:\n\n    Table A.\n\n\n Class I ............................ 2,000 x 6.00 equals 12,000  Class III .......................... 2,000 x 3.00 equals 6,000         _______\n\n\n  Totals ....................... 4,000 at  18,000\n\n\n  Blend Price ............................ $4.50\n\n\n If 500 cwt. are then brought in from the outside as nonpool milk and sold for Class I use, 500 cwt. of the pool milk will drop into Class III (since the fluid milk demand remains relatively constant):\n\n    Table B.\n\n\n Class I ............................ 1,500 x 6.00 equals 9,000  Class III .......................... 2,500 x 3.00 equals 7,500         ______\n\n\n  Totals ....................... 4,000 at   16,500\n\n\n  Blend Price ............................ $4.125\n\n\n The producers in the pool would thereby be receiving $.375 less per cwt. than had the nonpool milk stayed out altogether. By distributing to them (through the exaction made of nonpool handlers) the difference between Class I and Class III prices multiplied by the \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 90]\n\u00a0\n amount of nonpool milk sold in the area as Class I, that deficit is restored. Thus,\n\n    Table C.\n\n\n  (Nonpool milk sold as Class I) x (Class I minus Class III)\n\n   equals\n\n\n  (Loss to pool by displacement of Class I outlet)\n\n\n    or\n\n\n 500 x 3.00 equals 1,500\n\n\n 1,500 divided by 4,000 cwt. equals .375 per cwt.\n\n\n The Secretary's formula, therefore, precisely accomplishes the restoring to the pool's producers whatever they have lost by reason of the occupation of their Class I outlet by the nonpool milk.\n\nIt should be noted that the actual computation of the blend price, as set out in 7 CFR 1002.66, achieves this same result in an indirect fashion. Instead of computing the blend price without reference to any nonpool milk, the Secretary's formula includes the compensatory payments within the list of minimum-price obligations that are added in determining the total proceeds for milk sold within the area. 7 CFR 1002.66 (c). But the blend price is then computed by dividing this sum by the amount of \"milk delivered by producers,\" i. e., pool milk. Consequently, the actual computation of the uniform price under the above illustration would be as follows:\n\n    Table D.\n\n\n Class I .......................... 1,500 x 6.00 equals 9,000  Class III ........................ 2,500 x 3.00 equals 7,500\n\n\n Compensatory payments (non-pool  milk) ..........................  500 x 3.00 equals 1,500        _______\n\n\n Totals (pool milk) ............ 4,000 at  18,000\n\n\n  Blend Price ............................ $4.50\n\n\n The funds paid into the Producer Settlement Fund by the handlers dealing in nonpool milk are then available to the pool handlers, whose credits from the Fund will be larger to the extent that they have been forced to pay a higher blend price.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] \"Mr. ANDRESEN. Is there anything in the milk section of the bill which gives the Secretary authority to set up trade barriers and stop the free flow in commerce throughout the United States of dairy products?\n\n\"Mr. JONES. No. There is nothing in the bill that would authorize that. The Secretary may require that in crossing from one region to another that they comply with the same conditions which the farmers and distributors comply with in that region.\n\n\n\"Mr. ANDRESEN. That is, sanitary regulations?\n\n\n\"Mr. JONES. Sanitary and other uniform regulations; but he cannot set up any trade barriers which would keep them out.\n\n\n\"Mr. ANDRESEN. A great many Members have inquired about that feature, and I just wanted the gentleman to bring that out.\n\n\n\"Mr. JONES. The amendments require a uniform price and uniform set of conditions and fair distribution. In the first place, I do not believe we could give authority to set up these barriers. In the second place, the bill does not do that. It simply enables them to have a program in one of these regions, and in developing these orders which the Secretary issues, he uses the word `region' wherever possible. Those on the outside must come into that.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] The proposed amendment read:\n\n\"Sec. - (b) No marketing agreement, order, or regulation shall contain any term or provision which will tend to result in preventing or hindering any agricultural commodity or product thereof produced in any region or area of the United States from being brought into or sold in any other such region or area, or shall have the effect of subsidizing the production or sale of any agricultural commodity or product thereof in any such region or area, in such a manner that such commodity or product thereof will tend to be sold in such other region or area at prices which will tend to depress prices therein of such commodity or product thereof.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] \"Mr. JONES. Mr. Chairman, the adoption of the amendment of the gentleman from Wisconsin would absolutely wreck the whole milk program. In order to get away from the terrific conditions that have prevailed in the milk industry there is provided in the bill \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 84]\n\u00a0\n authority to fix a minimum price to producers. That, at least in a measure, would limit or tend to limit shipment, and yet the gentleman, I am sure, does not want to interfere with the price to producers.

Brannan, supra, that the provisions of 8c (5) (A) precluded, in themselves, the promulgation of the present compensatory payment provision.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, dissenting.\n\nI find it impossible to agree with the Court's holding or opinion. In 1936, in United States v. Butler,\n1\n this Court temporarily paralyzed the national farm recovery program by holding important parts of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 unconstitutional and by casting grave doubts upon the remainder of that Act which had been passed at the bottom of the Great Depression for the express purpose of alleviating the desperate economic plight of the American farmer. Following that decision Congress, in 1937, with unusual promptness adopted another national farm program reaffirming the broad and comprehensive powers it had previously given the Secretary of Agriculture to develop agricultural marketing plans for the purpose of raising the income of farmers.\n2\n The philosophy of this later Act was not competition as in the Sherman Act but governmental price fixing as in the original 1933 Agricultural Adjustment Act, the National Industrial Recovery Act, and a host of other contemporaneous Acts, all of which were designed to raise the income and purchasing power of workers and farmers. Today some 26 years after the Butler decision this Court \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 101]\n\u00a0\n again projects itself across the path of the national farm program by reading Congress' 1937 re-enactment as designed to encourage competition rather than to help farmers by governmental price fixing, and on this basis strikes down a vital element of many of the milk marketing orders set up under the 1937 Act while raising clouds of confusion and uncertainty as to the validity of many others. Although the blow to the present farm program is not so devastating as the one inflicted on the original Act by the Butler decision, I think that in ultimate effect the harmful consequences of the two decisions will differ only in degree. It is my belief that the order of the Secretary which the Court strikes down was set up in faithful adherence to the Act's purpose to raise the prices that farmers receive for their products and that the Court's action will tend to have precisely the opposite effect of depressing those prices. I have no doubt but that the Court's decision will enable some handlers to reap greater profits but I regret to say that this is bound to be at the expense of the farmers themselves - for whose benefit the national program was primarily passed. Certainly this is true of the more than $700,000 which the Court's decision today will allow the two handlers here to be paid which of necessity must come out of the pockets of the dairy farmers where this milk was sold.\n\nThe basic features of the Act under which the Secretary promulgated the regulation which the Court today strikes down were first enacted in 1935\n3\n when the dairy industry was near the bottom of its depression and dairy farmers in many parts of the country were not even receiving the actual cost of producing the milk they sold. These 1935 provisions were themselves amendments to the original 1933 Agricultural Adjustment Act, and were designed to spell out more clearly and to some extent add \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 102]\n\u00a0\n to the broad powers which the original 1933 Act had given the Secretary to correct the \"severe and increasing disparity between the prices of agricultural and other commodities\" by raising \"the purchasing power of farmers\" and stabilizing the value of the \"agricultural assets supporting the national credit structure.\"\n4\n\u00a0\n\nThe causes of the low prices to dairy farmers which led Congress to grant these broad powers were, like the details of the operation of the milk business itself, incredibly complex. In the main, however, these low prices were widely attributed to a vicious and destructive competition among dairy farmers for fluid milk sales which brought farmers higher prices than did sales as surplus milk for manufacturing butter, cheese and other milk products.\n5\n In order to bring an end to this competition which was pushing farmers to the wall, the 1935 Act gave the Secretary specific power to set up regional marketing areas within which he could, for the Government, fix minimum prices handlers would have to pay to farmers for the various uses of milk, require that those minimum prices be paid to a pool for the area and distribute the proceeds of the pool so that each farmer selling milk through the pool would ultimately be paid at the same uniform rate or \"blend price\" regardless of the use to which his particular milk was put.\n6\n In the original 1935 Act the Secretary was directed to fix prices at \"parity\" - a level designed by Congress to insure that farmers generally would receive a higher price for their products than they could get in an open, competitive market.\n7\n The 1937 reenactment went beyond even this, however, and gave the Secretary power to fix prices above this parity level in order to \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 103]\n\u00a0\n insure that dairy farmers in particular would receive a high enough price for their products.\n8\n In order to make sure that the Secretary had enough power to raise prices above the competitive level the Secretary was also authorized to issue orders \"Incidental . . . and necessary to effectuate\" the specific price-fixing and other powers given to him.\n9\n Thus it can be seen that the general scheme of the Act was to raise prices to farmers by governmental fixing of minimum prices for dairy products within specific regional areas thereby abandoning to that extent the system of price fixing by competition.\n\nIn accordance with this general plan and under the authority of the Act, the Secretary has proceeded after full hearings within the various regions to set up a number of regional milk marketing pools, one of which is the New York-Northern New Jersey pool whose operation is jeopardized by the Court's decision today.\n10\n The Secretary has also chosen to leave a number of areas unregulated. Obviously in a system including both large unregulated areas and regulated regional pools in which prices may be fixed at different levels, there will be significant and complicated problems involved in milk sales and purchases that do not take place wholly within a single pool. Among the most serious of these problems \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 104]\n\u00a0\n is that handlers from outside a pool can, if left unregulated, get the advantages of selling milk in that pool area without bearing any of the burdens that members of that pool have to bear. And as shown by the record in this case such sales can reduce the net price received by the farmers within the pool area. In an obvious effect to prevent any such harmful effects on the prices received by farmers in the New York-Northern New Jersey pool, the Secretary, properly I think, acting under his authority to issue orders \"Incidental and necessary to effectuate\" his specific price-fixing powers, provided that nonpool handlers who sold fluid milk in that pool area at times when there was surplus fluid milk in the pool should make a payment to compensate pool farmers for the displacement of fluid sales they otherwise would have made, compensate for the reduction of the regional pool fund which this would cause and to compensate for the consequent diminution of the blend price that would be paid to pool farmers. It is this key regulatory feature which the Court strikes down as a \"trade barrier\" prohibited by 8c (5) (G) of the Act because it limits the ability of outside handlers to sell milk within the pool area at a profit.\n\nIt is no doubt true that the Secretary's requirement that nonpool handlers make compensatory payments in order to sell fluid milk within the New York-Northern New Jersey pool area does limit to some extent the ability of handlers whose major business is outside the pool to dump their surplus milk into the pool at highly profitable fluid milk prices, and if this is a trade barrier the Secretary's regulation can properly be called a \"trade barrier.\" But 8c (5) (G) says nothing at all about prohibiting \"trade barriers\" or guaranteeing high profits to handlers, and if it had it would have been at cross purposes with the basic aim of the Act to have government rather than competition \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 105]\n\u00a0\n fix the minimum prices that farmers in designated regional areas must be paid for their milk. It says only:\n\n \"No marketing agreement or order applicable to milk and its products in any marketing area shall prohibit or in any manner limit, in the case of the products of milk, the marketing in that area of any milk or product thereof produced in any production area in the United States.\"\n11\n\u00a0\n\n\n This language contains no words or arrangement of words of any kind that would prohibit the Secretary from limiting the marketing of milk in any regional area where necessary to protect the prices fixed for that regional area. The Court, however, goes to great lengths to try to show on the basis of legislative history that Congress really meant the no-limitation clause to apply to milk as well as to milk products. In other words the Court wants to read the statute as if Congress had said \"No order shall prohibit or limit the marketing in that area of any milk or product thereof.\" But Congress simply did not say that. And the whole legislative history persuades me that Congress knew exactly what it was saying and that, while it intended to forbid the Secretary from making blanket prohibitions against outside milk, it also meant to leave the Secretary free to establish whatever regulations were necessary to guarantee that farmers in a price-fixing region received the regional prices he was authorized to fix even though those regulations might limit sales by outside handlers by making them unprofitable.\n12\n\u00a0\n\nOutside the language of 8c (5) (G) itself the clearest indication that this is the proper interpretation of the legislative \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 106]\n\u00a0\n history of the Act is that an amendment which would have made the no-limitation clause applicable to milk as well as milk products was defeated on the floor of the House and that an amendment to the same effect which passed the Senate was deleted in Conference.\n13\n The arguments of the Chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture, one of the principal architects of the program, \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 107]\n\u00a0\n against the amendment in the House show, almost conclusively, a general understanding that regional price fixing necessarily required sales from out of the region to be limited if the price fixing were to be successful:\n\n \"Mr. JONES. Mr. Chairman, the adoption of the amendment of the gentleman from Wisconsin would absolutely wreck the whole milk program. In order to get away from the terrific conditions that have prevailed in the milk industry there is provided in the bill authority to fix a minimum price to producers. That, at least in a measure, would limit or tend to limit shipment, and yet the gentleman, I am sure, does not want to interfere with the price to producers. Then it is a universal custom in the marketing of milk to classify milk. This, in a way, is a limitation.\n\n\n \"I am perfectly willing to adopt the first amendment suggested [the present 8c (5) (G)], because that simply treats all areas alike, for you could not prohibit someone from an outside area coming in so long as he complied with the conditions prescribed for that area; but if you said that no restrictions or limitations could be required, it would wreck the program, it would destroy every vestige of a program we have for milk.\"\n14\n\u00a0\n\n\n After the Senate amendment had been rejected by the Conference and while the Conference Report was being considered in the House of Representatives, a discussion took place on the floor between Representative Hope, a member of the House Committee on Agriculture and one of the conferees, and the Chairman of the Committee who was also a conferee. This discussion shows the same understanding that the Secretary was to be left free to \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 108]\n\u00a0\n impose whatever limitations were necessary to protect the regional prices he was authorized to fix:\n\n \"Mr. JONES. But the original amendments did not permit any orders governing the price to the producers?\n\n\n \"Mr. HOPE. No; but otherwise the Secretary could make orders which would regulate the bringing in of milk from the outside into any particular milkshed, but under the amendments we are now considering the Secretary's power is limited. He cannot prohibit milk from coming in?\n\n\n \"Mr. JONES. That is correct.\n\n\n \"Mr. HOPE. But he can prescribe some limitations?\n\n\n \"Mr. JONES. Yes; and he cannot prohibit the products of milk being brought into any area.\n\n\n \"Mr. HOPE. No; but he can prescribe limitations on the importation of fluid milk.\n\n\n \"Mr. SNELL. Then, as far as fluid milk is concerned, it is protected in certain markets, but, as far as the other products are concerned, they are not protected.\n\n\n \"Mr. JONES. That is correct.\"\n15\n\u00a0\n\n\n These were the last comments made on the floor of the House concerning milk before the Conference Report was finally adopted.\n\nIn the light of this legislative history and the Act's language itself, I cannot possibly read 8c (5) (G) or any other part of the Act to insure profitable operations to outside handlers who desire to dump surplus milk into a regional price-fixing area or to say that the Secretary lacks the power to protect by appropriate regulations the integrity of the regional prices which Congress authorized him to fix. I simply cannot believe that Congress intended to \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 109]\n\u00a0\n take away with one hand the high fixed price for milk which it gave with the other.\n\nThe net result of the Court's action is to leave the farmers in the New York-Northern New Jersey pool, and those in 22 other pools containing the provisions which the Court strikes down today,\n16\n completely defenseless against an onslaught of outside milk that is highly discriminatory because the outside milk bears none of the burdens of pool milk. I say completely defenseless despite the fact that the Court intimates that the Secretary might possibly devise some alternative compensatory payment plan that would satisfy the exacting standards which it lays down today. My first reason for saying this is that I do not see how any formula that the Secretary could devise under the Court's expanded interpretation of the word \"prohibit\" in 8c (5) (G) would protect pool members from unfair competition by outside handlers who are by the Court's decision given the advantages but not required to bear the burdens of the pool.\n17\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 110]\n\u00a0\n Secondly, even if such a formula were possible I doubt that a single member of this Court has the technical knowledge about the complicated workings of the milk industry to formulate a sound substitute for the compensatory payment plan which the Court strikes down - a regulatory plan which represents more than a quarter century of daily practical experience in administering the congressional farm plan. Thirdly, in any event the Court's vague intimations that some compensatory payment plan might be valid are hardly sufficient to furnish the Secretary with any guidance at all as to what formula if any the Court would permit him to use to protect the farmers in this pool from the effects of being compelled to compete with outside \"free riders.\"\n\nI think that if the Court really does believe that the Secretary has any power at all to prevent pool farmers from being subjected to discriminatory competition from outside \"free riders\" it should state in clear and precise \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 111]\n\u00a0\n terms what those powers are and inform the Secretary how he can meet this Court's requirements. The Court should then remand this case to allow the Secretary to take the action which it will approve, permit him to determine the amount that he could properly under its standards have required these handlers to pay and direct that the District Court pay over that amount to the Secretary out of the funds now in its possession. This plan would at least offer the farmers in this pool some protection against having to pay out all of the more than $700,000 in compensatory payments which has already been collected from these handlers. Such a plan was followed in United States v. Morgan,\n18\n and there is every reason in equity and good conscience why it should be followed here. In that case the District Court enjoined an order of the Secretary but required the party challenging the order to pay into court sufficient funds to effect compliance with the order if it should ultimately be found valid. This Court found the order defective but nevertheless ordered the District Court not to return the fund, which then contained over a half million dollars. On the contrary, over strong dissents urging that the Secretary only had power to issue a new order for the future, this Court commanded that the fund be retained until the Secretary could make new findings and enter a new order so that the fund could be disposed of under a proper determination of the Secretary, stating that:\n\n\"Due regard for the discharge of the court's own responsibility to the litigants and to the public and the appropriate exercise of its discretion in such manner as to effectuate the policy of the Act and facilitate administration of the system which it has set up, require retention of the fund by the district court \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 112]\n\u00a0\n until such time as the Secretary, proceeding with due expedition, shall have entered a final order in the proceedings pending before him.\"\n19\n\u00a0\n\n\n Following this decision the Secretary held new hearings, made new findings and entered a new order, according to which this Court in a later United States v. Morgan\n20\n ordered the more than one-half-million-dollar fund distributed.\n\nDespite the fact that the Court purports not to pass either on the validity of requiring all handlers to bear the full burdens of pool membership or upon the ability of the Secretary to apply against these handlers any future scheme of regulation which meets the Court's standards for the period here in question,\n21\n it seems clear that in failing to follow the Morgan procedure the Court in effect rules against the Secretary on both these questions. This is because the Court's refusal to pass specifically on these questions leaves standing the District Court's holding that the Secretary cannot require these handlers to bear the full burdens of pool membership for the period during which the compensatory payments struck down here were made. The regulation under which the Secretary claims that these handlers are subject to the full burdens of pool membership is a part of the same section\n22\n as the one under which the handlers made the compensatory payments of which they complain. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 113]\n\u00a0\n That section provides that all handlers like petitioners are pool handlers and required to bear all the burdens of pool membership unless they elect to be nonpool handlers and make compensatory payments. The Secretary's contention is that once the part of the regulation which provides for the compensatory payment is struck down, as the Court does here, the remainder of the regulation which requires all handlers to be pool handlers applies. By remanding this case to the District Court which has already ruled adversely on this claim the Court without so much as saying a single word on this point effectively prevents the Secretary from trying to protect pool farmers from free-riding outside milk by treating these handlers as pool members for the period here in dispute.\n\nThe full effect of the Court's failure to follow the Morgan procedure and decide whether the Secretary's provisions for full regulation of these handlers are valid, or just what the Secretary could do to protect the prices he has fixed, is in my opinion likely to be a wholly unjust and inequitable windfall of over $700,000 to the handlers, since it will ultimately have to come out of the pockets of the farmers who bear the burdens of this pool. How many more such windfalls to other handlers involving how many countless thousands of dollars in this and the other 22 similarly situated pools the Court's action will bring one can only guess.\n23\n One familiar with the Act and its history need not guess, however, about the fact that such a result would have been abhorrent to the Congress which passed this Act for the benefit of farmers. I would affirm the decision of the court below which upheld the Secretary.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \n297 \nU.S. 1\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 50 Stat. 246, 7 U.S.C. 601 et seq.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 49 Stat. 750.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] 48 Stat. 31.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] See Nebbia v.

See also 8c (11) (A). 49 Stat. 759, 7 U.S.C. 608c (11) (A).\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] 49 Stat. 755, 7 U.S.C. 608c (5) (G). (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] See Bailey Farm Dairy Co. v. Anderson, 157 F.2d 87, 96; Kass v. Brannan, 196 F.2d 791, 800 (L. Hand, J., dissenting).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] The amendment adopted by the Senate but rejected by the Conference is indicated in italics: \"No marketing agreement or order applicable to milk and its products in any marketing area shall prohibit or in any manner limit, except as provided for milk only in subsection (d), the marketing in that area of any milk or product thereof produced in any production area in the United States.\" 79 Cong. Rec. 11655. The wording of this amendment shows that the Court's attempted explanation of why \"in any manner limit\" was omitted from the final language of 8c (5) (G) does not bear analysis. The Court's explanation is that someone might construe \"limit\" as prohibiting \"the type of price fixing [limitation] covered by subsection (D).\" But it seems very clear that the wording of the Senate amendment was expressly designed to prevent such a construction while at the same time making \"in any manner limit\" applicable to milk. Consequently it seems apparent that in rejecting the Senate amendment the Conference was not refusing to apply \"in any manner limit\" to milk because to do so would interfere with the operation of subsection (D), but was in fact omitting that language because, to be effective, price fixing itself necessarily required limitations on the selling of outside milk within the area. This is clearly shown by the Conference Report, H. R. Rep. No. 1757, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. 21:\n\n\"The Senate amendment extended this provision [ 8c (5) (G)] so that no marketing agreement or order so applicable could limit in any manner the marketing in the marketing area of milk or its products produced anywhere except that certain limitations on the marketing of milk were specifically permitted. . . . The conference agreement also denies the authority to limit in any manner the marketing in any area of milk products . . . [but] does not refer to milk, and so does not negative the applicability to milk, for use in fluid form or for manufacturing purposes, of the provisions of the bill relating to milk such as the provisions on price fixing, price adjustment, payments for milk, etc.\" (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] 79 Cong. Rec. 9572. (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] 79 Cong. Rec. 13022. (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] See note 9 of the Court's opinion. At least 18 other pools apply a compensatory payment provision like the one in this case for at least part of the year. See note 13 of the Court's opinion.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] Certainly neither of the formulas which the Court in its note 13 intimates might be proper would protect the farmers in the pool, for neither of these formulas even goes so far as to wipe out the discriminatory advantage that unregulated outside milk has over pool milk. In sustaining the Secretary's regulation in this case the Judicial Officer relied in part on the following reasons:\n\n\"[T]he marketwide pool existing under Order No. 27, as amended, carries the long-time and seasonal reserves of milk for numerous secondary markets in Pennsylvania and the Northeastern States. The New York-New Jersey market carries the surplus burden for outside handlers who distribute some milk in the marketing area. These handlers usually have a relatively high percentage of their milk in fluid milk utilization and this utilization is considerably higher than the average for the market regulated by Order No. 27. This higher utilization, of course, results in a competitive advantage in milk procurement to the outside handler as against the regulated handler and \n\n[370 \nU.S. 76, 110]\n\u00a0\n outside and regulated handlers draw on the same production area for supplies. Furthermore, the regulated handler has to equalize his utilization with other handlers and his producers are paid on the basis of a uniform price reflecting the utilization in the market as a whole rather than his individual utilization.\"\n\n\n Thus, a compensatory payment, such as the Court suggests, based on the difference between the fluid price and the blend price obviously would do nothing at all to wipe out the advantage that the outside handler has because of his higher fluid-surplus ratio which is due, as shown above, to (1) the fact that the pool carries part of his area's surplus and (2) the fact that he does not have to equalize his own utilization as do pool handlers. Only a compensatory payment which gives the outside handler less for his surplus milk than the pool farmer gets will narrow the competitive advantage which outside milk has. A compensatory payment based on the difference between the fluid price and actual cost, the other alternative suggested by the Court, would obviously be even more subject to this same defect than the fluid-blend price compensatory payment.

JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner challenges, from the standpoint of both power and discretion, the District Court's sua sponte dismissal of this diversity negligence action under circumstances that follow.\n\nThe action, growing out of a collision between petitioner's automobile and one of respondent's trains, was commenced on August 24, 1954. Some six years later, and more than three years after petitioner had finally prevailed on respondent's motion for judgment on the pleadings (during which time two fixed trial dates had been postponed),\n1\n the District Court, on September 29, 1960, duly notified counsel for each side of the scheduling of a pretrial conference to be held at the courthouse in Hammond, Indiana, on October 12, 1960, at 1 p. m. During the preceding morning, October 11, petitioner's counsel telephoned respondent's lawyer from Indianapolis, stating that \"he was doing some work on some papers,\" that he expected to be at the pretrial conference, but that he might not attend the taking of a deposition of the plaintiff scheduled for the same day. At about 10:45 on the morning of October 12 petitioner's counsel telephoned the \n\n[370 \nU.S. 626, 628]\n\u00a0\n Hammond courthouse from Indianapolis (about 160 miles away), and after asking for the judge, who then was on the bench, requested the judge's secretary to convey to him this message: \"that he [counsel] was busy preparing papers to file with the [Indiana] Supreme Court,\" that \"he wasn't actually engaged in argument and that he couldn't be here by 1:00 o'clock, but he would be here either Thursday afternoon [October 13] or any time Friday [October 14] if it [the pretrial conference] could be reset.\"\n\nWhen petitioner's counsel did not appear at the pretrial conference the District Court, after reviewing the history of the case\n2\n and finding that counsel had failed \n\n[370 \nU.S. 626, 629]\n\u00a0\n \"to indicate . . . a reasonable reason\" for his nonappearance, dismissed the action \"for failure of the plaintiff's counsel to appear at the pretrial, for failure to prosecute this action.\" The court, acting two hours after the appointed hour for the conference, stated that the dismissal was in the \"exercise [of] its inherent power.\" The Court of Appeals affirmed by a divided vote. 291 F.2d 542. We granted certiorari. \n368 \nU.S. 918\n.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nThe authority of a federal trial court to dismiss a plaintiff's action with prejudice because of his failure to prosecute cannot seriously be doubted.\n3\n The power to invoke this sanction is necessary in order to prevent undue delays in the disposition of pending cases and to avoid congestion \n\n[370 \nU.S. 626, 630]\n\u00a0\n in the calendars of the District Courts. The power is of ancient origin, having its roots in judgments of non-suit and non prosequitur entered at common law, e. g., 3 Blackstone, Commentaries (1768), 295-296, and dismissals for want of prosecution of bills in equity, e. g., id., at 451. It has been expressly recognized in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41 (b), which provides, in pertinent part:\n\n \"(b) Involuntary Dismissal: Effect Thereof. For failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with these rules or any order of court, a defendant may move for dismissal of an action or of any claim against him. . . . Unless the court in its order for dismissal otherwise specifies, a dismissal under this subdivision and any dismissal not provided for in this rule, other than a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction or for improper venue, operates as an adjudication upon the merits.\"\n\n\n Petitioner contends that the language of this Rule, by negative implication, prohibits involuntary dismissals for failure of the plaintiff to prosecute except upon motion by the defendant. In the present case there was no such motion.\n\nWe do not read Rule 41 (b) as implying any such restriction. Neither the permissive language of the Rule - which merely authorizes a motion by the defendant - nor its policy requires us to conclude that it was the purpose of the Rule to abrogate the power of courts, acting on their own initiative, to clear their calendars of cases that have remained dormant because of the inaction or dilatoriness of the parties seeking relief. The authority of a court to dismiss sua sponte for lack of prosecution has generally been considered an \"inherent power,\" governed not by rule or statute but by the control necessarily vested in courts to manage their own affairs so as to \n\n[370 \nU.S. 626, 631]\n\u00a0\n achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases.\n4\n That it has long gone unquestioned is apparent not only from the many state court decisions sustaining such dismissals,\n5\n but even from language in this Court's opinion in Redfield v. Ystalyfera Iron Co., \n110 \nU.S. 174, 176\n.\n6\n It also has the sanction of wide usage among the District Courts.\n7\n It would require a much clearer expression of \n\n[370 \nU.S. 626, 632]\n\u00a0\n purpose than Rule 41 (b) provides for us to assume that it was intended to abrogate so well-acknowledged a proposition.\n\nNor does the absence of notice as to the possibility of dismissal or the failure to hold an adversary hearing necessarily render such a dismissal void. It is true, of course, that \"the fundamental requirement of due process is an opportunity to be heard upon such notice and proceedings as are adequate to safeguard the right for which the constitutional protection is invoked.\" Anderson National Bank v. Luckett, \n321 \nU.S. 233, 246\n. But this does not mean that every order entered without notice and a preliminary adversary hearing offends due process. The adequacy of notice and hearing respecting proceedings that may affect a party's rights turns, to a considerable extent, on the knowledge which the circumstances show such party may be taken to have of the consequences of his own conduct. The circumstances here were such as to dispense with the necessity for advance notice and hearing.\n\nIn addition, the availability of a corrective remedy such as is provided by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60 (b) - which authorizes the reopening of cases in which final orders have been inadvisedly entered - renders the lack of prior notice of less consequence. Petitioner never sought to avail himself of the escape hatch provided by Rule 60 (b). \n\n[370 \nU.S. 626, 633]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAccordingly, when circumstances make such action appropriate, a District Court may dismiss a complaint for failure to prosecute even without affording notice of its intention to do so or providing an adversary hearing before acting. Whether such an order can stand on appeal depends not on power but on whether it was within the permissible range of the court's discretion.\n8\n\u00a0\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nOn this record we are unable to say that the District Court's dismissal of this action for failure to prosecute, as evidenced only partly by the failure of petitioner's counsel to appear at a duly scheduled pretrial conference, amounted to an abuse of discretion. It was certainly within the bounds of permissible discretion for the court to conclude that the telephone excuse offered by petitioner's counsel was inadequate to explain his failure to attend. And it could reasonably be inferred from his absence, as well as from the drawn-out history of the litigation (see note 2, supra),\n9\n that petitioner had been deliberately proceeding in dilatory fashion.\n\nThere is certainly no merit to the contention that dismissal of petitioner's claim because of his counsel's unexcused conduct imposes an unjust penalty on the client. Petitioner voluntarily chose this attorney as his representative in the action, and he cannot now avoid the consequences of the acts or omissions of this freely selected \n\n[370 \nU.S. 626, 634]\n\u00a0\n agent. Any other notion would be wholly inconsistent with our system of representative litigation, in which each party is deemed bound by the acts of his lawyer-agent and is considered to have \"notice of all facts, notice of which can be charged upon the attorney.\" Smith v. Ayer, \n101 \nU.S. 320, 326\n.\n10\n\u00a0\n\nWe need not decide whether unexplained absence from a pretrial conference would alone justify a dismissal with prejudice if the record showed no other evidence of dilatoriness on the part of the plaintiff. For the District Court in this case relied on all the circumstances that were brought to its attention, including the earlier delays.\n11\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 626, 635]\n\u00a0\n And while the Court of Appeals did not expressly rest its judgment on petitioner's failure to prosecute, it nonetheless set out the entire history of the case (including the statement made by the district judge's secretary that it was \"the oldest civil case on the court docket\"), noted that the District Court had considered the absence at the pretrial conference in light of \"the history of this litigation\" and \"of all the circumstances surrounding counsel's action in the case,\" 291 F.2d, at 545, and held that there was no abuse of discretion in dismissing the action \"under the circumstances of this case.\" Id., at 546. This obviously amounts to no broader a holding than that the failure to appear at a pretrial conference may, in the context of other evidence of delay, be considered by a District Court as justifying a dismissal with prejudice.\n12\n\u00a0\n\nNor need we consider whether the District Court would have been abusing its discretion had it rejected a motion under Rule 60 (b) which was accompanied by a more adequate explanation for the absence of petitioner's counsel from the pretrial conference. No such motion was ever \n\n[370 \nU.S. 626, 636]\n\u00a0\n made, so that there is nothing in the record before us to indicate that counsel's failure to attend the pretrial conference was other than deliberate or the product of neglect.\n\nFinally, this is not a case in which failure to comply with a court order \"was due to inability fostered neither by . . . [petitioner's] own conduct nor by circumstances within its control.\" Societe Internationale v. Rogers, \n357 \nU.S. 197, 211\n. Petitioner's counsel received due notice of the scheduling of the pretrial conference, and cannot now be heard to say that he could not have foreseen the consequences of his own default in attendance.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the decision of this case.\n\nMR.

On October 18, 1955, hearing was had on this motion. On November 30, 1955, the district court granted defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings and ordered the cause dismissed. From this order of dismissal plaintiff appealed. On October 10, 1956, our court reversed and remanded the case for trial. . . . 237 F.2d 1, certiorari denied \n352 \nU.S. 1003\n . . . (February 25, 1957). On March 13, 1957, the mandate from this court was filed in the district court.\n\n\n\"Subsequently, the trial court set the case for trial for July 17, 1957. On June 27, 1957, on motion of plaintiff and defendant not objecting, the trial date of July 17, 1957 was vacated; and the cause was continued.\n\n\n\"On August 17, 1957, defendant filed interrogatories for plaintiff to answer. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 626, 629]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"On February 24, 1959, the trial court on its own initiative gave notice to the parties, pursuant to Local Rule 11 [footnote omitted], that the cause would be dismissed on March 25, 1959, unless the court ordered otherwise.\n\n\n\"On March 24, 1959, plaintiff filed answers to defendant's interrogatories.\n\n\n\"On March 25, 1959, hearing was had on the show cause order, and on June 4, 1959 the trial court entered an order retaining the case on the docket and setting it for trial for July 22, 1959.\n\n\n\"On July 2, 1959, on defendant's motion, to which plaintiff agreed, the trial date of July 22, 1959 was vacated; and the case was continued.\n\n\n\"On March 11, 1960, defendant filed additional interrogatories for plaintiff to answer.

In holding that interest for a 29-year period during which the suit remained dormant should not have been allowed, Mr. Justice Matthews, speaking for a unanimous Court, said: \"This delay in prosecution would certainly have justified the court in dismissing the action on its own motion.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] In the more populous districts, where calendar congestion has become a severe problem, the District Courts, acting on their own initiative, have from time to time established special call calendars of \"stale\" cases for the purpose of dismissing those as to which neither adequate excuse for past delays nor reason for a further continuance appears. See, for example, the local rules of the following District Courts: Alaska Rule 16; Ariz. Rule 14; N. D. Cal. Rule 14; S. D. Cal. Rule 10 (d); Colo. Rule 24; Conn. Rule 15; Del. Rule 12; D.C.

Rule 8; E. D. Wis. Rule 11; W. D. Wis. Rule 15; Wyo. Rule 14.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Petitioner's contention that the District Court could not act in the conceded absence of any local rule covering the situation here is obviously unsound. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 83 expressly provides that \"in all cases not provided for by rule, the district courts may regulate their practice in any manner not inconsistent with these rules.\" In light of what has already been said we find no such inconsistency here.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] The record shows that this was the \"oldest\" case on the District Court's civil docket.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Clients have been held to be bound by their counsels' inaction in cases in which the inferences of conscious acquiescence have been less supportable than they are here, and when the consequences have been more serious. See, e. g., United States ex rel. Reid v. Richmond, 295 F.2d 83, 89-90; Egan v. Teets, 251 F.2d 571, 577 n. 9; United States v. Sorrentino, 175 F.2d 721. Surely if a criminal defendant may be convicted because he did not have the presence of mind to repudiate his attorney's conduct in the course of a trial, a civil plaintiff may be deprived of his claim if he failed to see to it that his lawyer acted with dispatch in the prosecution of his lawsuit. And if an attorney's conduct falls substantially below what is reasonable under the circumstances, the client's remedy is against the attorney in a suit for malpractice. But keeping this suit alive merely because plaintiff should not be penalized for the omissions of his own attorney would be visiting the sins of plaintiff's lawyer upon the defendant. Moreover, this Court's own practice is in keeping with this general principle. For example, if counsel files a petition for certiorari out of time, we attribute the delay to the petitioner and do not request an explanation from the petitioner before acting on the petition.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] The history of the case belies any suggestion that the delay was the fault of the defendant or solely of the district judge who first ruled erroneously on the motion for judgment on the pleadings. After the mandate of the Court of Appeals was filed with the District Court, the trial date that was set was vacated on the plaintiff's motion. Thereafter, the plaintiff failed to answer the defendant's interrogatories from August 17, 1957, until the day before the hearing on the order to show cause why the case should not be dismissed for want of \n\n[370 \nU.S. 626, 635]\n\u00a0\n prosecution - which was more than 19 months later. Although the next delay was occasioned by the defendant's motion, it was consented to by the plaintiff and there is no showing whatever that plaintiff ever made any effort to bring the case to trial. In fact, when the defendant submitted further interrogatories, plaintiff again moved to have the time to answer extended. Against this background, it is hardly surprising that the District Court concluded that the failure to appear for a pretrial conference was merely another delaying tactic.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] Even if the judgment of the Court of Appeals rested on the ground that counsel's \"failure\" to attend the pretrial conference sufficed by itself to justify the dismissal, it is our duty, without reaching the broader question, to sustain the District Court on its narrower holding if, as we decide, that holding was correct. E. g., Walling v. General Industries Co., \n330 \nU.S. 545, 547\n; Langnes v. Green, \n282 \nU.S. 531, 536\n-537; United States v. American Railway Express Co., \n265 \nU.S. 425, 435\n-436; see Securities & Exchange Comm'n v. Chenery Corp., \n318 \nU.S. 80, 88\n.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE concurs, dissenting.\n\nI think that the order of the District Court dismissing this case has no sound basis in law, in fact or in justice. The petitioner William Link brought an action to recover damages for alleged serious and permanent injuries suffered in a collision between his truck and a train operated by the respondent Wabash Railroad Company. The District Court dismissed that action without notice of any kind to the plaintiff Link or to his lawyer shortly after the lawyer failed to appear at a scheduled pretrial conference without what the trial judge regarded as an adequate excuse. The order of dismissal apparently purports to end petitioner's lawsuit and bar forever his right \n\n[370 \nU.S. 626, 637]\n\u00a0\n to recover compensation for his injuries.\n1\n Under these circumstances, I think Judge Schnackenberg was entirely correct in his dissent to the opinion of the majority on the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upholding the dismissal when he said:\n\n \"The order now affirmed has inflicted a serious injury upon an injured man and his family, who are innocent of any wrongdoing. Plaintiff's cause of action . . . was his property. It has been destroyed. The district court, to punish a lawyer, has confiscated another's property without process of law, which offends the constitution. A district court does not lack disciplinary authority over an attorney and there is no justification, moral or legal, for its punishment of an innocent litigant for the personal conduct of his counsel. Because it was neither necessary nor proper to visit the sin of the lawyer upon his client, I would reverse.\"\n2\n\u00a0\n\n\n As I understand the opinion of the Court here, it upholds the District Court's dismissal order upon the ground of \"want of prosecution\" and \"dilatoriness on the part of the plaintiff,\" making it unnecessary, as the Court views the case, to \"decide whether unexplained absence from a pretrial conference would alone justify a dismissal with prejudice . . . .\" I do not think that there is any basis in the record to support a dismissal of this case for \"want of prosecution,\" for \"dilatoriness on the part of the plaintiff\" or for any other reason. In the first place, it seems to me \n\n[370 \nU.S. 626, 638]\n\u00a0\n that the Court is in error when it suggests that both the District Court and the Court of Appeals relied on all the circumstances of this case, including its \"earlier delays,\" to justify its dismissal with prejudice. It is true that the trial judge, though expressly basing his order entirely upon the failure of petitioner's lawyer to appear at the pretrial conference,\n3\n did mention the earlier history of the case as a ground for his action in a conversation with the respondent's lawyer just before the dismissal. But as I read the Court of Appeals' opinion, it neither relied upon nor even considered such a ground to support its judgment. The opening statement of the Court of Appeals' opinion certainly treated the case as resting not upon any general want of prosecution but instead wholly upon the failure of the lawyer to appear: \"This is an appeal by plaintiff from an order of the district court entered October 12, 1960 dismissing this cause of action for failure of plaintiff's counsel to appear in court for a pre-trial conference scheduled for hearing on that date.\"\n4\n From this opening statement to the end of the majority opinion, I think that every argument and sentence in that opinion is directed to supporting the Court of Appeals' conclusion that the District Court had power to dismiss the case not for any \"want of prosecution\" but solely \"as a sanction for disobedience of a court order.\"\n5\n Indeed, the only \n\n[370 \nU.S. 626, 639]\n\u00a0\n reference to \"want of prosecution\" in the Court of Appeals' entire opinion is a parenthetical one to describe that court's holding in another case \"where we upheld the dismissal of a cause under another local rule . . . .\"\n6\n The plain import of the Court of Appeals' opinion is, to my mind, starkly revealed when its refusal to rely upon any theory of \"want of prosecution\" is considered in connection with the emphatic statements of Judge Schnackenberg in dissent: \"Defendant's counsel makes no effort to rely upon want of prosecution as a ground for the involuntary dismissal. Obviously defendant is in no position to make such a contention, inasmuch as it caused the district court to vacate the order setting the case for trial on July 22, 1959, and continue the case.\"\n7\n It is impossible for me to believe that the majority of the Court of Appeals would have left this statement unchallenged if they had wanted to place any reliance at all upon \"want of prosecution,\" \"dilatoriness on the part of the plaintiff,\" or any ground other than their desire to approve a sanction upon Link's lawyer for his failure to appear at the pretrial conference.\n\nSecondly, I think that this Court's decision to ignore the single ground upon which I believe that the Court of Appeals rested and to resurrect the \"want of prosecution\" theory from the trial court colloquy is wrong because this case has been a very live one from the date it was filed right up to this very moment. It is true that the case when dismissed had been pending for a long time, that is, from August 24, 1954, to the date of dismissal, October 12, 1960. But during this entire period of time, motions and activities of various kinds both by the lawyers and by the trial judge were taking place in the court. Certainly it would be impossible for anyone to suggest that the plaintiff Link \n\n[370 \nU.S. 626, 640]\n\u00a0\n or his lawyer was responsible for the first three years of delay in the trial of the case. If responsibility is to be placed upon anyone for that delay, it must be placed upon the lawyers for the defendant and upon the trial judge. One month after the lawsuit was filed the defendant appeared and answered the complaint. Some months later the defendant filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the complaint failed to state a cause of action. On November 30, 1955, more than a year after the case was filed, the district judge granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings and entered his first dismissal of the case. On October 10, 1956, however, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in an opinion by Judge Schnackenberg, reversed this dismissal and remanded the case for trial.\n8\n The railroad then asked this Court to grant certiorari and review the Court of Appeals' holding but, on February 25, 1957, we denied certiorari.\n9\n At this stage, the case had been delayed for almost three years by an erroneous ruling of the trial judge made at the instance of the defendant's lawyers.\n\nUpon remand, the District Court set the case for hearing on July 17, 1957, but this order was vacated and the cause continued \"on motion of the plaintiff, and defendant not objecting . . . .\" This continuance of the case by agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant of course provides not even a scintilla of evidence to support a dismissal for want of prosecution. Two months later, in an effort to buttress its defense for the approaching trial on the merits, the railroad filed interrogatories which the plaintiff answered. It is true that these interrogatories were not answered until some 19 months after they were filed. But there is no indication in the record that the defendant tried to get the interrogatories answered earlier. And every trial lawyer knows that the failure of a lawyer \n\n[370 \nU.S. 626, 641]\n\u00a0\n to answer interrogatories designed to solicit answers to be used against his client before those answers are demanded by the party filing the interrogatories is nothing more than a normal trial tactic of a lawyer who is trying to win the case for his client. On February 24, 1959, the trial judge on his own motion issued notice to the parties that he would dismiss the case for the second time on March 25, 1959, unless he ordered otherwise. After holding hearings on that date, however, and considering the arguments of counsel, the trial judge entered on June 4, 1959, an order retaining the case on his docket and setting it for trial on July 22, 1959. This action of the court in retaining the case on its docket shows that the trial judge certainly did not think at that time that the case was not being prosecuted. But before the case could be tried on July 22, the judge granted another continuance, this time at the request of the defendant with the plaintiff not objecting. Although this continuance at the request of the defendant, like the previous three-year delay directly attributable to the defendant and the court, doubtless contributed to the age of this case on the court's docket, I do not suppose (although I am not certain) that it is one of the \"circumstances\" which the Court refers to as justifying the dismissal of the case. On March 11, 1960, six years after this lawsuit was filed, the defendant's lawyers filed still more interrogatories for plaintiff to answer. One month and four days later after an extension of time granted by the trial court, these interrogatories were answered. This certainly does not seem like an extraordinary delay in answering interrogatories which apparently had taken the defendant six years to conceive and prepare.\n\nFive months after the plaintiff answered defendant's March 11 interrogatories, the trial judge, again on his own motion, issued notice scheduling a pretrial conference on October 12, 1960. This was the pretrial \n\n[370 \nU.S. 626, 642]\n\u00a0\n conference at which petitioner's lawyer failed to appear. But even that failure showed no inclination on the part of the plaintiff or his lawyer to abandon the lawsuit, for the lawyer called the clerk of the District Court over long-distance telephone and also talked to the trial judge's secretary on the morning of the day of the conference to explain why he could not be present on October 12 and to urge that the pretrial conference be passed over to the next day, October 13, to give him a chance to be present. It is true that the trial judge later refused to accept the lawyer's explanation and this ruling, if correct, indicates that the lawyer may have been guilty of some kind of breach of his responsibility to his client and to the court. It does not indicate, however, and it cannot by any stretch of the imagination be made to indicate that the lawyer, much less the plaintiff himself, was acting in the way people do who let their lawsuits die for \"want of prosecution.\" The record shows that neither the lawyer nor the plaintiff himself was given any sort of notice by the judge or by his secretary that the request for a one-day postponement would be denied, even though the defendant's request for indefinite postponement had been granted only three months earlier. Nor did the lawyer or the plaintiff receive any notice that a failure to appear at the pretrial conference would result in the drastic sanction of dismissal of the case.\n10\n And I think that nothing short of clairvoyance would have enabled either of them to anticipate that this Court, or any court, would approve dismissal of the case for \"want of prosecution.\"\n\nUnder the foregoing facts, it seems to me that it inflicts the grossest kind of injustice upon this petitioner to \n\n[370 \nU.S. 626, 643]\n\u00a0\n uphold dismissal of his case on the ground that it was not being prosecuted. Of course it was. Counsel for both parties apparently were doing the best they could to bring the case to a successful conclusion for their respective clients. The \"earlier delays\" preceding the plaintiff's lawyer's failure to appear at the pretrial hearing, far from showing a \"want of prosecution,\" actually strengthen the conclusion that the case was being prosecuted because by far the greater part of these delays was due to steps that were being taken in furtherance of the litigation. Only the two continuances in the case, one at the request of counsel for the plaintiff and the second at the request of counsel for the defendant, created delays not obviously related to that end. And if these delays are to be punished, I see no reason why the punishment should be limited to the plaintiff and his lawyer. I must say that it appears to me to be a sort of unequal justice that would punish the plaintiff or even his lawyer for \"earlier delays\" which undoubtedly were due in major part to an erroneous ruling of the trial judge with regard to the sufficiency of the pleadings, a continuance of the trial brought about at the request of the defendant, and the several motions that the defendant's counsel made along through the years in connection with interrogatories and additional interrogatories which were to be used for no purpose other than to defeat the plaintiff's actively prosecuted lawsuit.\n\nEven assuming in the face of these plain facts, however, that all the blame for the six years' delay in this case could be laid at the feet of plaintiff's lawyer, it seems to me to be contrary to the most fundamental ideas of fairness and justice to impose the punishment for the lawyer's failure to prosecute upon the plaintiff who, so far as this record shows, was simply trusting his lawyer to take care of his case as clients generally do. The Court dismisses this whole question of punishing the plaintiff \n\n[370 \nU.S. 626, 644]\n\u00a0\n Link for the alleged fault of his lawyer with the simple generalized statement: \"Petitioner voluntarily chose this attorney as his representative in the action, and he cannot now avoid the consequences of the acts or omissions of this freely selected agent.\"\n11\n One may readily accept \n\n[370 \nU.S. 626, 645]\n\u00a0\n the statement that there are circumstances under which a client is responsible for the acts or omissions of his attorney. But it stretches this generalized statement too far to say that he must always do that. This case is a good illustration of the deplorable kind of injustice that can come from the acceptance of any such mechanical rule.\n\nLink filed an action in court, as was his right, alleging the infliction of serious injuries upon him by the railroad for which he sought damages. His case was delayed for three years because of the trial judge's erroneous ruling on a question of the technical sufficiency of the complaint, a ruling which, if it had not been reversed, would have frustrated the plaintiff's right to a trial on the merits. This ruling of course should never have been made, for it was plainly inconsistent with the whole philosophy underlying the modern liberal rules of procedure which govern civil trials in the federal courts. When the Court of Appeals upheld the complaint, reversed the trial court and remanded the case for trial, the parties engaged in a number of activities obviously designed to bring the case to trial. On at least two separate occasions, the plaintiff himself was called upon to respond to interrogatories submitted by the railroad. Under these circumstances, the plaintiff simply had no way of knowing that there was even the slightest danger that his potentially valuable lawsuit was going to be thrown out of court because of some default on the part of his lawyer. Quite the contrary, the plaintiff had every reason to believe that his lawyer, who had obtained reversal of the trial judge's \n\n[370 \nU.S. 626, 646]\n\u00a0\n first erroneous order of dismissal in the Court of Appeals, was eminently well qualified to represent his interests and would do his best to win the lawsuit.\n\nThere surely can be no doubt that if the plaintiff's lawyer had gone into court without authority and asked the court to dismiss the case so as to bar any future suit from being filed, this Court would repudiate such conduct and give the plaintiff a remedy for the wrong so perpetrated against him. Or had the trial judge here, instead of putting an end to plaintiff's substantial cause of action, simply imposed a fine of several thousand dollars upon the plaintiff because of his lawyer's neglect, I cannot doubt that this Court would unanimously reverse such an unjust penalty. The result actually reached here, however, is that this Court condones a situation no different in fact from either of those described above. The plaintiff's cause of action is valuable property within the generally accepted sense of that word, and, as such, it is entitled to the protections of the Constitution. Due process requires that property shall not be taken away without notice and hearing. I do not see how the result here can be squared with that fundamental constitutional requirement.\n\nMoreover, to say that the sins or faults or delinquencies of a lawyer must always be visited upon his client so as to impose tremendous financial penalties upon him, as here, is to ignore the practicalities and realities of the lawyer-client relationship.\n12\n Lawyers everywhere in this country are granted licenses presumably because of their skill, their integrity, their learning in the law and their \n\n[370 \nU.S. 626, 647]\n\u00a0\n dependability. While there may be some clients sophisticated enough in the affairs of the world to be able to select the good from the bad among this mass of lawyers throughout the country, this unfortunately cannot always be the case. The average individual called upon, perhaps for the first time in his life, to select a lawyer to try a lawsuit may happen to choose the best lawyer or he may happen to choose one of the worst. He has a right to rely at least to some extent upon the fact that a lawyer has a license. From this he is also entitled to believe that the lawyer has the ability to look out for his case and that he should leave the lawyer free from constraint in doing so. Surely it cannot be said that there was a duty resting upon Link, a layman plaintiff, to try to supervise the daily professional services of the lawyer he had chosen to represent him. How could he know, even assuming that it is true, that his lawyer was a careless man or that he would have an adverse effect upon the trial judge by failing to appear when ordered? How could he know or why should he be presumed to know that it was his duty to see that the many steps a lawyer needs to take to bring his case to trial had been taken by his lawyer? Why should a client be awakened to his lawyer's incapacity for the first time by a sudden brutal pronouncement of the court: \"Your lawyer has failed to perform his duty in prosecuting your case and we are therefore throwing you out of court on your heels\"? So far as this record shows, the plaintiff never received one iota of information of any kind, character or type that should have put him on notice as an ordinary layman that his lawyer was not doing his duty.\n13\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 626, 648]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAny general rule that clients must always suffer for the mistakes of their lawyers simply ignores all these problems. If a general rule is to be adopted, I think it would be far better in the interest of the administration of justice, and far more realistic in the light of what the relationship between a lawyer and his client actually is, to adopt the rule that no client is ever to be penalized, as this plaintiff has been, because of the conduct of his lawyer unless notice is given to the client himself that such a threat hangs over his head. Such a rule would do nothing more than incorporate basic constitutional requirements of fairness into the administration of justice in this country.\n\nThe Court seems to find some reason for holding that this plaintiff can be penalized without notice because of a program certain courts have adopted to end congestion on their dockets by setting down long-pending cases for trial. It is of course desirable that the congestion on court dockets be reduced in every way possible consistent with the fair administration of justice. But that laudable objective should not be sought in a way which undercuts the very purposes for which courts were created - that is, to try cases on their merits and render judgments in accordance with the substantial rights of the parties. Where a case has so little merit that it is not being prosecuted, a trial court can of course properly dispose of it under fair constitutional procedures. There is not one fact in this record, however, from which an inference can be drawn that the case of Link against the Wabash Railroad Company is such a case. When we allow the desire to reduce court congestion to justify the sacrifice of substantial rights of the litigants in cases like this, we attempt to promote speed in administration, which is \n\n[370 \nU.S. 626, 649]\n\u00a0\n desirable, at the expense of justice, which is indispensable to any court system worthy of its name.\n\nMoreover, it seems plain to me that any attempt to cut down on court congestion by dismissing meritorious lawsuits is doomed to fail even in its misguided purpose of promoting speed in judicial administration. Litigants with meritorious lawsuits are not likely to accept unfair rulings of that kind without exhausting all available appellate remedies. Consequently, any reduction of trial court dockets accomplished by such dismissals will be more than offset by the increased burden on appellate courts. This case seems to me an excellent example of the sort of wholly unnecessary waste of judicial resources which can result from such overzealous protection of trial court dockets. The case has twice been before the Court of Appeals and has twice been brought to this Court as a result of \"time-saving\" rulings handed down by the trial judge.\n\nIt is true that by its ruling today the Court finally puts an end to this case and thus clears it from all federal dockets. But in view of the fact that the merits of the case have never been reached, I cannot believe that there should be too much rejoicing at this fact. The end result of the procedures adopted here has been that much time has been wasted and yet no justice has been done. I find it highly regrettable that the Court feels compelled to place its stamp of approval upon such procedures.\n\nIt may not be of much importance to anyone other than the plaintiff here and his family whether this case is tried on its merits or not. To my mind, however, it is of very great importance to everyone in this country that we do not establish the practice of throwing litigants out of court without notice to them solely because they are credulous enough to entrust their cases to lawyers whose names are accredited as worthy and capable by their government. I fear that this case is not likely to stand out in the future as the best example of American justice.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Since the order of dismissal here did not specify that it was without prejudice to the plaintiff's right to reinstitute the action, the dismissal operates as a judgment on the merits if Rule 41 (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure applies. Of course, if Rule 41 (b) is not the source of the power exercised here, as this Court seems to say, the order of dismissal would still end plaintiff's chance of recovery because his cause of action is now barred by the statute of limitations.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 291 F.2d 542, 548.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The order of dismissal stated as follows: \"Pursuant to the inherent powers of the Court, and upon failure of plaintiff's counsel to appear at a pre-trial, which was scheduled for today, October 12, 1960, at 1:00 o'clock, pursuant to notice, under Rule 12, counsel having failed to give any good and sufficient reason for not appearing at said pre-trial, the cause is now dismissed.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] 291 F.2d, at 543.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Id., at 546. It is true that the Court of Appeals set out the history of the case but it made no attempt to rely upon that history to justify its judgment of affirmance. Its references to the \"circumstances\" of the case quoted in the Court's opinion simply cannot be magnified to indicate any such reliance.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Id., at 545. (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Id., at 547.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] 237 F.2d 1.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] \n352 \nU.S. 1003\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Thus, even under the Court's theory that a client must always be charged with \"`notice of all facts, notice of which can be charged upon the attorney,'\" the plaintiff here cannot be charged with notice that his lawsuit would be dismissed upon the failure of his lawyer to appear at the pretrial conference.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] The Court does cite three cases in an effort to support this general proposition but none of those cases even suggests so harsh and expansive a rule. Moreover, they deal with situations so far removed from that presented here that their inapplicability as precedent for the conclusion reached in this case is apparent. United States ex rel. Reid v. Richmond, 295 F.2d 83, and United States v. Sorrentino, 175 F.2d 721, were criminal cases in each of which the defendant sought to upset his conviction on the ground that his lawyers had exercised poor judgment in handling one of the multitude of decisions that have to be made in the trial of every lawsuit. Reid's lawyers had failed to make an objection to one piece of evidence. The Court of Appeals, finding that this action \"had much to commend it\" as trial strategy, held that any objection to the evidence must be considered waived and that \"Reid must be bound by what his lawyers did and his acquiescence in that course by his own testimony.\" 295 F.2d, at 89-90. Even this holding provoked sharp dissent: \"A holding that counsel assigned an accused may waive him into the electric chair seems in any event dubious.\" Id., at 90-91. Sorrentino's lawyers waived his right to object to an order of the trial judge reducing the number of spectators at his trial. The Court of Appeals held that Sorrentino was bound by this waiver, saying: \"Sorrentino did not at any time indicate to the court that he was not fully satisfied with the action which the trial judge had thus taken with his counsel's consent. It must, therefore, be concluded that he acquiesced in his counsel's judgment that his interests would not be prejudiced and indeed might be served by the reduction which the court ordered in the number of spectators at the trial.\" 175 F.2d, at 723-724. Certainly no one could say of Link, as it was said of Sorrentino, that \"his interests would not be prejudiced and indeed might be served\" by the dismissal of his case. Egan v. Teets, 251 F.2d 571, involved an allegation that the defendant's original appeal papers had been suppressed and the court held merely that the failure of the defendant's counsel to raise this point in the state courts after the defendant himself knew of the alleged suppression plus the failure of the defendant to offer any explanation for not raising the point in the state courts must be taken as waiving the point. 251 F.2d, at 576-577. Here, it cannot \n\n[370 \nU.S. 626, 645]\n\u00a0\n be suggested that plaintiff's counsel has waived the plaintiff's right to have his lawsuit tried, since he has been holding on tenaciously to that right for eight years, four of which have been spent in trying to get the Court of Appeals and this Court to force the trial judge to give him a trial on the merits. Certainly, nothing in the opinion in Egan suggests that if the defendant had been able to allege and prove that his appeal papers had been suppressed by wrongful conduct on the part of his lawyer, he would nonetheless be bound by that conduct.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] I am not quite able to understand the Court's suggestion that \"keeping this suit alive . . . would be visiting the sins of plaintiff's lawyer upon the defendant.\" I do not see how it can be regarded as a punishment to compel a person to try his lawsuit on its merits before an impartial judicial tribunal established under and operating in accordance with the Constitution of the United States.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] The Court's suggestion that petitioner might have been able to file a motion under Rule 60 (b) \"accompanied by a more adequate explanation for the absence of petitioner's counsel from the pretrial conference\" is no answer at all to the problem presented by the \n\n[370 \nU.S. 626, 648]\n\u00a0\n plaintiff's lack of notice. Whether the lawyer had \"a more adequate explanation\" or not, I think the plaintiff himself is entitled to due process before his property is taken from him. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 626, 650]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","124":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLOUISIANA v.

Although petitioner maintained that he was mentally responsible when the offenses were committed and presented no evidence to support an acquittal by reason of insanity, the trial judge concluded that he was not guilty on the ground that he was insane at the time of the commission of the offense, and ordered him committed to a mental hospital under D.C. Code 24-301 (d), which provides that, \"If any person . . . is acquitted solely on the ground that he was insane at the time of [the] commission [of the offense], the court shall order such person to be confined in a hospital for the mentally ill.\" In this habeas corpus proceeding, held: The trial court erred in ordering petitioner committed, because 24-301 (d) applies only to a defendant who by his own act has relied on a defense that he was insane when the offense was committed and who is acquitted on that ground.

Shea and Lawrence Speiser for the American Civil Liberties Union, as amicus curiae.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis is a habeas corpus proceeding instituted in the District Court by the petitioner, presently confined in Saint Elizabeths Hospital for the insane pursuant to a commitment under D.C. Code 24-301 (d), to test the legality of his detention. The District Court, holding that petitioner had been unlawfully committed, directed his release from custody unless civil commitment proceedings (D.C. Code 21-310) were begun within 10 days of the court's order. The Court of Appeals, sitting en banc, reversed by a divided vote. 109 U.S. App. D.C. 404, 288 F.2d 388. Since the petition for certiorari raised important questions regarding the procedure for confining the criminally insane in the District of Columbia and suggested possible constitutional infirmities in 24-301 (d) as applied in the circumstances of this case, we granted the writ. \n366 \nU.S. 958\n.\n\nTwo informations filed in the Municipal Court for the District of Columbia on November 6. 1959, charged petitioner with having violated D.C. Code 22-1410 by drawing and negotiating checks in the amount of $50 each with knowledge that he did not have sufficient funds or credit with the drawee bank for payment. On the same day, petitioner appeared in Municipal Court to answer these charges and a plea of not guilty was recorded. He was thereupon committed under D.C. Code 24-301 (a) to the District of Columbia General Hospital for a mental examination to determine his competence to stand trial.\n1\n On December 4, 1959, the Assistant Chief Psychiatrist of \n\n[369 \nU.S. 705, 707]\n\u00a0\n the Hospital reported that petitioner's mental condition was such that he was then \"of unsound mind, unable to adequately understand the charges and incapable of assisting counsel in his own defense.\" The case was continued while petitioner was given treatment at the General Hospital.\n\nOn December 28, 1959, the Assistant Chief Psychiatrist sent a letter to the court advising that petitioner had \"shown some improvement and at this time appears able to understand the charges against him, and to assist counsel in his own defense.\" This communication also noted that it was the psychiatrist's opinion that petitioner \"was suffering from a mental disease, i. e., a manic depressive psychosis, at the time of the crime charged,\" such that the crime \"would be a product of this mental disease.\" As for petitioner's current condition, the psychiatrist added that petitioner \"appears to be in an early stage of recovery from manic depressive psychosis,\" but that it was \"possible that he may have further lapses of judgment in the near future.\" He stated that it \"would be advisable for him to have a period of further treatment in a psychiatric hospital.\"\n\nPetitioner was brought to trial the following day in the Municipal Court before a judge without a jury. The record before us contains no transcript of the proceedings,\n2\n but it is undisputed that petitioner, represented by counsel, sought at that time to withdraw the earlier plea of not guilty and to plead guilty to both informations. The trial judge refused to allow the change of plea, apparently on the basis of the Hospital's report that petitioner's commission of the alleged offenses was the product of mental illness. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 705, 708]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAt the trial one of the prosecution's witnesses, a physician representing the General Hospital's Psychiatric Division, testified, over petitioner's objection, that petitioner's crimes had been committed as a result of mental illness. Although petitioner never claimed that he had not been mentally responsible when the offenses were committed and presented no evidence to support an acquittal by reason of insanity, the trial judge concluded that petitioner was \"not guilty on the ground that he was insane at the time of the commission of the offense.\"\n3\n The court then ordered that petitioner be committed to Saint Elizabeths Hospital as prescribed by D.C. Code 24-301 (d), which reads:\n\n \"(d) If any person tried upon an indictment or information for an offense, or tried in the juvenile court of the District of Columbia for an offense, is acquitted solely on the ground that he was insane at the time of its commission, the court shall order such person to be confined in a hospital for the mentally ill.\"\n\n\n There can be no doubt as to the effect of this provision with respect to a defendant who has asserted a defense of insanity at some point during the trial. By its plain terms it directs confinement in a mental hospital of any criminal defendant in the District of Columbia who is \"acquitted solely on the ground\" that his offense was committed while he was mentally irresponsible, and forecloses the trial judge from exercising any discretion in this regard. Nor does the statute require a finding by the trial judge or jury, or by a medical board, with respect to the accused's mental health on the date of the judgment of acquittal. The sole necessary and sufficient condition for bringing the compulsory commitment provision into \n\n[369 \nU.S. 705, 709]\n\u00a0\n play is that the defendant be found not guilty of the crime with which he is charged because of insanity \"at the time of its commission.\"\n4\n Petitioner does not contend that the statute was misinterpreted in these respects.\n\nPetitioner maintains, however, that his confinement is illegal for a variety of other reasons, among which is the assertion that the \"mandatory commitment\" provision, as applied to an accused who protests that he is presently sane and that the crime he committed was not the product of mental illness, deprives one so situated of liberty without due process of law.\n5\n We find it unnecessary to consider \n\n[369 \nU.S. 705, 710]\n\u00a0\n this and other constitutional claims concerning the fairness of the Municipal Court proceeding, since we read 24-301 (d) as applicable only to a defendant acquitted on the ground of insanity who has affirmatively relied upon a defense of insanity, and not to one, like the petitioner, who has maintained that he was mentally responsible when the alleged offense was committed.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nThe decisions of this Court have repeatedly warned against the dangers of an approach to statutory construction which confines itself to the bare words of a statute, e. g., Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States, \n143 \nU.S. 457, 459\n-462; Markham v. Cabell, \n326 \nU.S. 404, 409\n, for \"literalness may strangle meaning,\" Utah Junk Co. v. Porter, \n328 \nU.S. 39, 44\n. Heeding that principle we conclude that to construe 24-301 (d) as applying only to criminal defendants who have interposed a defense of insanity is more consistent with the general pattern of laws governing the confinement of the mentally ill in the District of Columbia, and with the congressional policy that impelled the enactment of this mandatory commitment provision, than would be a literal reading of the section. That construction finds further support in the rule \n\n[369 \nU.S. 705, 711]\n\u00a0\n that a statute should be interpreted, if fairly possible, in such a way as to free it from not insubstantial constitutional doubts. E. g., United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, \n241 \nU.S. 394, 401\n; International Assn. of Machinists v. Street, \n367 \nU.S. 740, 749\n. Such doubts might arise in this case were the Government's construction of 24-301 (d) to be accepted.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nTo construe 24-301 (d) as requiring a court, without further proceedings, automatically to commit a defendant who, as in the present case, has competently and advisedly not tendered a defense of insanity to the crime charged and has not been found incompetent at the time of commitment is out of harmony with the awareness that Congress has otherwise shown for safeguarding those suspected of mental incapacity against improvident confinement.\n\nThus, a civil commitment must commence with the filing of a verified petition and supporting affidavits. D.C. Code 21-310. This is followed by a preliminary examination by the staff of Saint Elizabeths Hospital, a hearing before the Commission on Mental Health, and then another hearing in the District Court, which must be before a jury if the person being committed demands one. D.C. Code 21-311. At both of these hearings representation by counsel or by a guardian ad litem is necessary. Dooling v. Overholser, 100 U.S. App. D.C. 247, 243 F.2d 825, construing D.C. Code 21-308, 21-311. The burden of proof is on the party seeking commitment, and it is only if the trier of fact is \"satisfied that the alleged insane person is insane,\" that he may be committed \"for the best interest of the public and of the insane person.\" D.C. Code 21-315.\n7\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 705, 712]\n\u00a0\n\n\nLikewise, Congress has afforded protection from improvident commitment to an accused in a criminal case who appears to the trial court \"from the court's own observations, or from prima facie evidence submitted to the court . . . [to be] of unsound mind or . . . mentally incompetent so as to be unable to understand the proceedings against him or properly to assist in his own defense.\" D.C. Code 24-301 (a). In such circumstances preliminary commitment for a \"reasonable period\" is authorized in order to permit observation and examination. If the medical report shows that the accused is of unsound mind, the court may \"commit by order the accused to a hospital for the mentally ill unless the accused or the Government objects.\" (Emphasis added.) In case of objection, there must be a judicial determination with respect to the accused's mental health, and it is only \"if the court shall find the accused to be then of unsound mind or mentally incompetent to stand trial\" that an order for continued commitment is permissible. Hence if the accused denies that he is mentally ill, he is entitled to a judicial determination of his present mental state despite the hospital board's certification that he is of unsound mind. And it should be noted that the burden rests with the party seeking commitment to prove that the accused is \"then of unsound mind.\" D.C. Code 24-301 (a).\n\nConsidering the present case against this background, we should be slow in our reading of 24-301 (d) to attribute to Congress a purpose to compel commitment of \n\n[369 \nU.S. 705, 713]\n\u00a0\n an accused who never throughout the criminal proceedings suggests that he is, or ever was, mentally irresponsible.\n8\n This is the more so when there is kept in mind the contrast between the nature of an acquittal by reason of insanity and the finding of insanity required in other kinds of commitment proceedings. In the District of Columbia, as in all federal courts, an accused \"is entitled to an acquittal of the specific crime charged if upon all the evidence there is reasonable doubt whether he was capable in law of committing crime.\" Davis v. United States, \n160 \nU.S. 469, 484\n. See, e. g., Isaac v. United States, 109 U.S. App. D.C. 34, 284 F.2d 168. Compare Leland v. Oregon, \n343 \nU.S. 790\n. Consequently, the trial judge or jury must reach a judgment or verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity even if the evidence as to mental responsibility at the time the offense was committed raises no more than a reasonable doubt of sanity. If 24-301 (d) were taken to apply to petitioner's situation, there would be an anomalous disparity between what \n\n[369 \nU.S. 705, 714]\n\u00a0\n 24-301 (d) commands and what 24-301 (a) forbids. On the one hand, 24-301 (d) would compel posttrial commitment upon the suggestion of the Government and over the objection of the accused merely on evidence introduced by the Government that raises a reasonable doubt of the accused's sanity as of the time at which the offense was committed. On the other hand, 24-301 (a) would prohibit pretrial commitment upon the suggestion of the Government and over the objection of the accused, although the record contained an affirmative medical finding of present insanity, unless the Government is able to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the accused is presently of unsound mind.\n\nOf course the posttrial commitment of 24-301 (d) presupposes a determination that the accused has committed the criminal act with which he is charged, whereas pretrial commitment antedates any such finding of guilt. But the fact that the accused has pleaded guilty or that, overcoming some defense other than insanity, the Government has established that he committed a criminal act constitutes only strong evidence that his continued liberty could imperil \"the preservation of public peace.\" It no more rationally justifies his indeterminate commitment to a mental institution on a bare reasonable doubt as to past sanity than would any other cogent proof of possible jeopardy to \"the rights of persons and of property\" in any civil commitment. Compare note 7, supra.\n\nMoreover, the literal construction urged here by the Government is quite out of keeping with the congressional policy that underlies the elaborate procedural precautions included in the civil commitment provisions. It seems to have been Congress' intention to insure that only those who need treatment and may be dangerous are confined; committing a criminal defendant who denies the existence of any mental abnormality merely on the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 705, 715]\n\u00a0\n basis of a reasonable doubt as to his condition at some earlier time is surely at odds with this policy.\n\nThe criminal defendant who chooses to claim that he was mentally irresponsible when his offense was committed is in quite a different position. It is true that he may avoid the ordinary criminal penalty merely by submitting enough evidence of an abnormal mental condition to raise a reasonable doubt of his responsibility at the time of committing the offense. Congress might have thought, however, that having successfully claimed insanity to avoid punishment, the accused should then bear the burden of proving that he is no longer subject to the same mental abnormality which produced his criminal acts. Alternatively, Congress might have considered it appropriate to provide compulsory commitment for those who successfully invoke an insanity defense in order to discourage false pleas of insanity. We need go no further here than to say that such differentiating considerations are pertinent to ascertaining the intended reach of this statutory provision.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nThe enactment of 24-301 (d) in 1955 was the direct result of the change in the standard of criminal responsibility in the District of Columbia wrought by Durham v. United States, 94 U.S. App. D.C. 228, 214 F.2d 862. That decision provoked a congressional re-examination of the laws governing commitment of the criminally insane. \"Apprehension that Durham would result in a flood of acquittals by reason of insanity and fear that these defendants would be immediately set loose led to agitation for remedial legislation.\" Krash, The Durham Rule and Judicial Administration of the Insanity Defense in the District of Columbia, 70 Yale L. J. 905, 941 (1961). A Committee on Mental Disorder as a Criminal Defense was established \n\n[369 \nU.S. 705, 716]\n\u00a0\n by the Council on Law Enforcement in the District of Columbia to inquire into \"the substantive and procedural law of the District of Columbia bearing on mental disorder as a defense in a criminal prosecution.\" S. Rep. No. 1170, 84th Cong., 1st Sess. 1 (1955); H. R. Rep. No. 892, 84th Cong., 1st Sess. 1 (1955). Among its recommendations was a mandatory commitment provision, subsequently enacted as 24-301 (d). The Committee noted that while under the then existing discretionary commitment statute\n9\n it had been customary for the court and the appropriate executive official to order the confinement of all those who had been found not guilty solely by reason of insanity, more assurance should be given the public that those so acquitted would not be allowed to be at large until their recovery from past mental illness had been definitely established:\n\n \"No recent cases have come to the attention of this Committee where a person acquitted in the District of Columbia of a crime on the sole ground of insanity has not been committed to a mental hospital for treatment. Nevertheless, the Committee is of the opinion that the public is entitled to know that, in every case where a person has committed a crime as a result of a mental disease or defect, such person shall be given a period of hospitalization and treatment to guard against imminent recurrence of some criminal act by that person.\" (Emphasis in the original.) \n\n[369 \nU.S. 705, 717]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \"The Committee believes that a mandatory commitment statute would add much to the public's peace of mind, and to the public safety, without impairing the rights of the accused. Where accused has pleaded insanity as a defense to a crime, and the jury has found that the defendant was, in fact, insane at the time the crime was committed, it is just and reasonable in the Committee's opinion that the insanity, once established, should be presumed to continue and that the accused should automatically be confined for treatment until it can be shown that he has recovered.\" S. Rep. No. 1170, 84th Cong., 1st Sess. 13 (1955); H. R. Rep. No. 892, 84th Cong., 1st Sess. 13 (1955). (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n It is significant to note that in finding that mandatory commitment would not result in \"impairing the rights of the accused\" and that it was \"just and reasonable . . . that the insanity, once established, should be presumed to continue . . . until it can be shown that . . . [the accused] has recovered,\" the Committee Report, which was embraced in the reports of the Senate and House committees on the bill, spoke entirely in terms of one who \"has pleaded insanity as a defense to a crime.\" Certainly such confidence could hardly have been vouchsafed with respect to a defendant who, as in this case, had stoutly denied his mental incompetence at any time. And it is surely straining things to assume that any of the committees had in mind such cases as this, which are presumably rare.\n10\n\u00a0\n\nNor is it necessary to read 24-301 (d) as an assurance that an accused who requires medical treatment will be \n\n[369 \nU.S. 705, 718]\n\u00a0\n hospitalized rather than be confined to jail. Simultaneously with the mandatory commitment provision, Congress enacted the present 24-302, which permits transfers of mentally ill convicts from penal institutions to hospitals. Consequently, if an accused who pleads guilty is found to be in need of psychiatric assistance, he may be transferred to a hospital following sentence.\n\nFinally, it is not necessary to accept the Government's literal reading of 24-301 (d) in order to effectuate Congress' basic concern, in passing this legislation, of reassuring the public. Section 24-301 (a) provides a procedure for confining an accused who, though found competent to stand trial, is nonetheless committable as a person of unsound mind. That section permits the trial judge to act \"prior to the imposition of sentence or prior to the expiration of any period of probation,\" if he has reason to believe that the accused \"is of unsound mind or is mentally incompetent so as to be unable to understand the proceedings against him.\" (Emphasis added.) The statute provides for a preliminary examination by a hospital staff, and then \"if the court shall find the accused to be then of unsound mind or mentally incompetent to stand trial, the court shall order the accused confined to a hospital for the mentally ill.\"\n11\n (Emphasis added.) \n\n[369 \nU.S. 705, 719]\n\u00a0\n This inquiry, therefore, is not limited to the accused's competence to stand trial; the judge may consider, as well, whether the accused is presently committable as a person of unsound mind.\n12\n Since this inquiry may be undertaken at any time \"prior to the imposition of sentence,\" it appears to be as available after the jury returns a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity as before trial.\n\nIn light of the foregoing considerations we conclude that it was not Congress' purpose to make commitment compulsory when, as here, an accused disclaims reliance on a defense of mental irresponsibility. This does not mean, of course, that a criminal defendant has an absolute right to have his guilty plea accepted by the court. As provided in Rule 11, Fed. Rules Crim. Proc., and Rule 9, D.C. Munic. Ct. Crim. Rules, the trial judge may refuse to accept such a plea and enter a plea of not guilty on behalf of the accused. We decide in this case only that if this is done and the defendant, despite his own assertions of sanity, is found not guilty by reason of insanity, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 705, 720]\n\u00a0\n 24-301 (d) does not apply. If commitment is then considered warranted, it must be accomplished either by resorting to 24-301 (a) or by recourse to the civil commitment provisions in Title 21 of the D.C. Code.\n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the decision of this case.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The record does not reveal the basis for the trial court's action.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Despite the absence of a trial record, the District Court made findings of fact respecting the proceedings at petitioner's trial, some of which are contested by the parties. We rely only upon those facts that were here admitted.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Petitioner did not appeal from this judgment.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Similar statutes are found in 12 States, the Virgin Islands, and in England. Compare Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. (Supp. 1957) 39-8-4; Ga. Code Ann., 1953, 27-1503; Kan. Gen. Stat. Ann., 1949, 62-1532; Maine Pub. L., 1961, c. 310; Mass. Ann. Laws, 1957, c. 123, 101 (murder or manslaughter); Mich. Stat. Ann., 1954, 28.933 (3) (murder); Minn. Stat. Ann. (Supp. 1957) 631.19; Neb. Rev. Stat. Ann., 1943, 29-2203; Nev. Rev. Stat., 1955, 175.445; N. Y. Sess. Laws 1960, c. 550, 1-3; Ohio Rev. Code (Baldwin 1953) 2945.39; Wis. Stat., 1958, 957.11; V. I. Code Ann., 1957, Tit. 5, 3637. The English procedure is found in Trial of Lunatics Act, 46 & 47 Vict., c. 38, s. 2 (1883).\n\nStatutes under which commitment is mandatory if the trial judge or jury finds that the accused is presently insane are, of course, clearly distinguishable. The focus of the inquiry on which commitment turns is the accused's mental health as of the time of commitment, and the verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity is merely evidence bearing on that issue. Consequently, the effect of the compulsory aspect of such a commitment provision is by no means comparable to that involved in the present case. Similarly, any discretionary commitment statute presumably leaves the trial judge or jury free to find the accused presently sane and thus entitled to full liberty.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] In essence the claim is that 24-301 (d) compels the indeterminate commitment of such a person without any inquiry as to his present sanity, and solely on evidence sufficient to warrant a reasonable doubt as to his mental responsibility as of the time he committed the offense charged. The claim is said to be buttressed when 24-301 (d) is taken in conjunction with the rigorous release-from-confinement \n\n[369 \nU.S. 705, 710]\n\u00a0\n provisions of 24-301 (e) and 24-301 (g) as construed by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in Overholser v. Leach, 103 U.S. App. D.C. 289, 257 F.2d 667; Ragsdale v. Overholser, 108 U.S. App. D.C. 308, 281 F.2d 943.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The defense of insanity need not, of course, be asserted by means of a formal plea. Fed. Rules Crim. Proc. 11, which governs proceedings in the District Courts, permits the entry of certain enumerated pleas, not including \"not guilty by reason of insanity,\" a plea which is authorized in some jurisdictions. D.C. Munic. Ct. Crim. Rule 9 is identical to Fed. Rules Crim. Proc. 11. Consequently, a defense of insanity in a criminal proceeding in the District of Columbia may be established under a general plea of not guilty. We read 24-301 (d) as making commitment mandatory whenever the defendant successfully relies, in any affirmative way, on a claim that he was insane at the time of commission of the crime of which he is accused.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] A police officer may arrest and detain any person who appears to be of unsound mind on the belief that if such person is \"permitted to remain at large or to go unrestrained in the District of Columbia \n\n[369 \nU.S. 705, 712]\n\u00a0\n the rights of persons and of property will be jeopardized or the preservation of public peace imperiled and the commission of crime rendered probable.\" D.C. Code 21-326. However, within 48 hours of such apprehension, the petition that is otherwise required for an involuntary commitment must be filed, and the procedural machinery which follows the filing of such a petition must be set in motion. D.C. Code 21-311, par. 3.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] In eight of the 13 other American jurisdictions where statutes providing for mandatory commitment, following an acquittal by reason of insanity, are in effect, see note 4, supra, the provisions of the statutes indicate that they are to apply only if an insanity defense is interposed by the accused: Colorado (\"in a trial involving the plea of not guilty by reason of insanity\"); Georgia (\"in all criminal trials . . . wherein an accused shall contend that he was insane\"); Nebraska (accused \"may plead that he is not guilty by reason of insanity or mental derangement\"); Nevada (\"where on a trial a defense of insanity is interposed by the defendant\"); New York (\"when the defense is insanity of the defendant\"); Ohio (\"when a defendant pleads `not guilty by reason of insanity'\"); Wisconsin (\"no plea that the defendant . . . was insane . . . shall be received unless it is interposed at the time of arraignment\"); Virgin Islands (\"if the defense is the mental illness of the defendant\"). We have not been referred to any case in the remaining American jurisdictions or in England where a mandatory commitment of this nature, following a proceeding in which the defendant did not interpose a defense of insanity, was sustained.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] The statute then in effect provided:\n\n\"If the jury shall find the accused to be then insane, or if an accused person shall be acquitted by the jury solely on the ground of insanity, the court may certify the fact to the Federal Security Administrator, who may order such person to be confined in the hospital for the insane, and said person and his estate shall be charged with the expense of his support in the said hospital.\" 59 Stat. 311. (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] We have been told of four such cases in the District of Columbia, two arising in the Municipal Court and two in the District Court: District of Columbia v. Trembley, D.C. 28343-60; United States v. Taylor, U.S. 4774-59; United States v. Kloman, Crim. No. 383-58; United States v. Strickland, Crim. No. 374-59.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] D.C. Code 24-301 (a) provides:\n\n\"(a) Whenever a person is arrested, indicted, charged by information, or is charged in the juvenile court of the District of Columbia, for or with an offense and, prior to the imposition of sentence or prior to the expiration of any period of probation, it shall appear to the court from the court's own observations, or from prima facie evidence submitted to the court, that the accused is of unsound mind or is mentally incompetent so as to be unable to understand the proceedings against him or properly to assist in his own defense, the court may order the accused committed to the District of Columbia General Hospital or other mental hospital designated by the court, for such reasonable period as the court may determine for examination and observation and for care and treatment if such is \n\n[369 \nU.S. 705, 719]\n\u00a0\n necessary by the psychiatric staff of said hospital. If, after such examination and observation, the superintendent of the hospital, in the case of a mental hospital, or the chief psychiatrist of the District of Columbia General Hospital, in the case of District of Columbia General Hospital, shall report that in his opinion the accused is of unsound mind or mentally incompetent, such report shall be sufficient to authorize the court to commit by order the accused to a hospital for the mentally ill unless the accused or the Government objects, in which event, the court, after hearing without a jury, shall make a judicial determination of the competency of the accused to stand trial. If the court shall find the accused to be then of unsound mind or mentally incompetent to stand trial, the court shall order the accused confined to a hospital for the mentally ill.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] Compare 18 U.S.C. 4244, considered in Greenwood v. United States, \n350 \nU.S. 366\n, which relates only to \"mental incompetency after arrest and before trial.\" By the terms of 18 U.S.C. 4246, commitment is to last only \"until the accused shall be mentally competent to stand trial or until the pending charges against him are disposed of according to law.\"\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK, dissenting.\n\nEighty-seven years ago, Chief Justice Waite in speaking of the function of this Court said: \"Our province is to decide what the law is, not to declare what it should be . . . . If the law is wrong, it ought to be changed; but the power for that is not with us.\" Minor v. Happersett, 21 Wall. 162, 178 (1875). This holding followed as long as line of cases as it preceded. Today the Court seems to me to do what this long-established rule of statutory interpretation forbids. With sophisticated frankness it admits that the District's statute\n1\n \"[b]y its plain terms . . . directs confinement in a mental hospital of any criminal defendant . . . who is `acquitted solely on the ground' that his offense was committed while he was mentally irresponsible, and forecloses the trial judge from exercising any discretion in this regard.\" Despite these \"plain terms\" the Court writes into the statute an exception, i. e., it applies \"only to criminal defendants who have interposed a defense of insanity . . . .\" It does \n\n[369 \nU.S. 705, 721]\n\u00a0\n this despite the fact that the petitioner here apparently made no such contention in the trial court. Indeed, though he had counsel at the time of his trial in Municipal Court on two charges of passing bad checks, he made no attempt to appeal from the refusal of the court to accept his guilty plea and its finding that he was \"not guilty on the ground that he was insane at the time of the commission of the offense.\" After being committed to St. Elizabeths Hospital for treatment for some six months, he filed this habeas corpus application. Today's action may have the effect of setting him free though he makes no claim that he was sane at the time of trial or is so at this time. In fact, the last doctor's report in the record shows him to be suffering from a manic depressive psychosis from which though he \"appears to be in an early stage of recovery\" it is \"possible that he may have further lapses . . . .\" It further states that it \"would be advisable for him to have a period of further treatment in a psychiatric hospital.\" The order today risks bringing that to an end.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nThe case therefore presents the complex and challenging problem of criminal incompetency with which the people of the District of Columbia have for years been plagued. The Congress in 1955 adopted the present statute to meet what it called the \"serious and dangerous imbalance . . . in favor of the accused and against the public\" which was created in part by the rule in Durham v. United States, 94 U.S. App. D.C. 228, 214 F.2d 862 (1954). S. Rep. No. 1170, 84th Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1955). The statute, in my view, is not only designed to protect the public from the criminally incompetent but at the same time has the humanitarian purpose of affording hospitalization for those in need of treatment. It is, therefore, of the utmost importance to this community. Moreover, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 705, 722]\n\u00a0\n it has its counterpart in varying degrees in 36 of our States and in the federal system as well, many of which will be affected by this decision. In my view the Court undermines the purposes of these statutes; places a premium on pleas of guilty by defendants who were insane when they acted, made either pro se or through their attorneys; and thereby forces the conviction of innocent persons. And all of this is done in the face of the admitted \"plain terms\" of the mandate of Congress under the guise that the Court's holding \"is more consistent with the general pattern of laws governing the confinement of the mentally ill in the District of Columbia.\" I believe, however, that the Congress in adopting 24-301 (d) said what it meant and that it meant what it said. I regret that the Court has seen fit to repeal the \"plain terms\" of this statute and write its own policy into the District's law. Especially do I deplore its suggestion of doubt as to its constitutionality. In the light of the cases this is chimerical. Finding myself with reference to the opinion like Mrs. Gummidge, \"a lone, lorn creetur' and every think [about it] goes contrairy with me,\" I respectfully dissent.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nIt is well to point out first what is not involved here. First, this is not a civil commitment case, although this Court attempts to force one upon the parties. In providing the safeguards of D.C. Code 21-310 as to the ordinary civil commitment of persons claimed to be insane the Congress clearly acted in protection of those who were not charged with criminal offenses or who had never exhibited any criminal proclivities. In protecting the public from the criminally incompetent it could with reason act with less caution. See Overholser v. Leach, 103 U.S. App. D.C. 289, 291, 257 F.2d 667, 669, and Kenstrip v. Cranor, 39 Wash. 2d 403, 405, 235 P.2d 467, 468. In criminal cases the person could be held in custody in any \n\n[369 \nU.S. 705, 723]\n\u00a0\n event and humanitarian principles require his hospitalization where needed. Nor are the procedures for release involved here. Petitioner has not sought his release under the statute. The procedure, however, is simple and effective, i. e., a doctor's certificate recommending release filed with the court is sufficient. If the doctor refuses such certificate, the inmate may seek to prove his sanity on habeas corpus. Here, however, no claim of sanity has been made.\n\nNor does this case involve commitment under D.C. Code 24-301 (a). The first provision of that section largely has to do with cases before trial. The accused is entitled to a speedy trial. He may be acquitted. Hence his commitment to a hospital would delay the effectuation of these rights. The Congress, therefore, provided safeguards, i. e., he might object to such a commitment and the consequent delay of his trial. But here - under 24-301 (d) - the accused has already had his trial.\n\nFinally, the fallacy in the Court's position is clearly apparent when in an attempt to justify its holding on practical grounds it says that an accused who pleads guilty and is sentenced may thereafter be transferred from the prison to a hospital and the assurances of hospitalization provided by 24-301 (d) thus afforded. The short of this is that if the accused pleads guilty and is sentenced he then may suffer in addition to his conviction the same fate as petitioner suffers here. With due deference, this is a most cruel position. The accused, though innocent of the crime because of insanity, pleads guilty in hopes of a short jail sentence. He then has the stigma of criminal conviction permanently on his record. During or after sentence he is transferred to the hospital where he may be released at the end of his sentence but if found not cured at that time may still be subject to further custody and treatment. D.C. Code, 24-302; 18 U.S.C. 4247. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 705, 724]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nIt has long been generally acknowledged that justice does not permit punishing persons with certain mental disorders for committing acts offending against the public peace and order. But insane offenders are no less a menace to society for being held irresponsible, and reluctance to impose blame on such individuals does not require their release. The community has an interest in protecting the public from antisocial acts whether committed by sane or by insane persons. We have long recognized that persons who because of mental illness are dangerous to themselves or to others may be restrained against their will in the interest of public safety and to seek their rehabilitation, even if they have done nothing proscribed by the criminal law. The insane who have committed acts otherwise criminal are a still greater object of concern, as they have demonstrated their risk to society. In an attempt to deal with these problems, Congress has enacted 24-301 (d), which requires the court to order a person who has been acquitted of a criminal offense solely on the ground that he was insane at the time of its commission, to be confined in a hospital for the mentally ill.\n\nCommitment to an institution of persons acquitted of crime because of insanity is no novelty. At common law, before 1800, the trial judge had power to order detention in prison of an acquitted defendant he considered dangerous because of insanity.\n2\n Hadfield, acquitted of \n\n[369 \nU.S. 705, 725]\n\u00a0\n attempted regicide in 1800 as insane, was remanded to an English prison because his future confinement was \"absolutely necessary for the safety of society,\" 27 How. St. Tr. 1281, 1354. Parliament responded by providing for automatic commitment to a mental institution rather than prison in felony cases in which the accused was acquitted on grounds of insanity, 39 & 40 Geo. III, c. 94, and mandatory commitment has been the rule in misdemeanor cases as well in England since 1883. 46 & 47 Vict., c. 38. An accused acquitted on insanity grounds in Massachusetts was remanded to the sheriff for continued custody as early as 1810, Commonwealth v. Meriam, 7 Mass. 168, and in the District of Columbia, the judge being convinced that \"it would be extremely dangerous to permit him to be at large,\" in 1835, United States v. Lawrence, 26 Fed. Cas. No. 15,577. The District of Columbia Code of 1901, 31 Stat. 1189, 1340, authorized the trial judge, in his discretion and without further hearing, to forward the defendant's name to an administrator, who, in his discretion, again without hearing, might order commitment. Most defendants acquitted on insanity grounds were committed under this rule.\n3\n At the present time statutes provide for mandatory commitment of persons acquitted by reason of insanity in 12 States and the Virgin Islands as well as in England and the District of Columbia.\n4\n Six States permit \n\n[369 \nU.S. 705, 726]\n\u00a0\n commitment in the discretion of the trial judge.\n5\n Eighteen more provide for mandatory or discretionary commitment if the trial judge finds that the defendant's insanity continues\n6\n or that his discharge would be dangerous to the public peace.\n7\n In 10 States and in Puerto \n\n[369 \nU.S. 705, 727]\n\u00a0\n Rico, mandatory commitment follows a like finding by the trial jury\n8\n or by a second jury.\n9\n In three States standards for civil commitment must be met.\n10\n Only Tennessee makes no provision for such cases.\n11\n Many of these laws providing for commitment of acquitted defendants are by no means new, see the tabulation in Glueck, Mental Disorder and the Criminal Law, 394-399 (1925), and with very few exceptions such laws have been upheld by state courts against constitutional attacks.\n12\n The \n\n[369 \nU.S. 705, 728]\n\u00a0\n Model Penal Code of the American Law Institute contains a provision for mandatory commitment. ALI Model Penal Code, Proposed Final Draft No. 1, 4.08. See also comments on this section in id., Tentative Draft No. 4, p. 199. In practice, it has been said despite the varying provisions in the several jurisdictions that acquitted defendants are \"nearly always\" committed. Note, 68 Yale L. J. 293.\n\n\nIV.\n\n\n\nThe Court does not deny that petitioner was tried for an offense and acquitted solely on the ground of insanity at the time of its commission. It argues, however, that the procedure of 24-301 (d), as applied to a criminal defendant who has not pleaded insanity, is inconsistent with the whole scheme of procedural safeguards provided for commitment of other individuals to mental hospitals in the District of Columbia and therefore could not have been intended by Congress. But the procedure of 24-301 (d) applies only to defendants found not guilty solely on the ground of insanity. That is, unlike defendants committed before or during the trial, see State ex rel. Smilack v. Bushong, 159 Ohio St. 259, 111 N. E. 2d 918, all persons committed under 24-301 (d) either have been found after trial to have committed the act itself, or, as here, have conceded that they committed it. It is this \n\n[369 \nU.S. 705, 729]\n\u00a0\n adjudication, or this admission, that serves to explain and, in Congress' opinion, to justify different treatment for such individuals. Overholser v. Leach, 103 U.S. App. D.C. 289, 257 F.2d 667. Whether we would have drawn this distinction is not the question; it suffices that the distinction was drawn and is not so untenable that we can say Congress could not reasonably have drawn it. And, insofar as 24-301 (a) applies also to those who have been tried and found guilty, it is no more inconsistent with mandatory commitment where the defendant has not pleaded insanity than where he has done so. In either case Congress wanted commitment if the judge found the accused insane or if the jury entertained a reasonable doubt.\n\n\nV.\n\n\n\nI agree with the Court that the present 24-301 (d) was the response of Congress to the decision in Durham v. United States, supra. That decision substituted for the McNaghten rule the simple question whether the \"unlawful act was the product of mental disease or mental defect.\" 94 U.S. App. D.C., at 240-241, 214 F.2d, at 874-875. In amending the then 24-301 (d), Congress sought \"to protect the public against the immediate unconditional release of accused persons who have been found not responsible for a crime solely by reason of insanity. . . .\" H. R. Rep. No. 892, 84th Cong., 1st Sess. 3, 13 (1955); S. Rep. No. 1170, 84th Cong., 1st Sess. 3; 101 Cong. Rec. 9258, 12229. This danger of improvident release, so crucial in the eyes of the Congress, has in fact inhibited the adoption of the Durham rule by other courts in jurisdictions where no mandatory commitment statute is available. Sauer v. United States, 241 F.2d 640 (C. A. 9th Cir.); United States v. Smith, 5 U.S.C. M. A. 314, 329, 17 C. M. R. 314, 329; United States v. Currens, 290 F.2d 751, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 705, 730]\n\u00a0\n 776-777, dissenting opinion; Sobeloff, Insanity and the Criminal Law: From McNaghten to Durham, and Beyond, 41 A. B. A. J. 793, 879 (1955).\n\nThis is not to say, however, that the sole purpose of 24-301 (d) is commitment as a protection to the public. The policy of the law also includes assurance of rehabilitation for those so committed. Ragsdale v. Overholser, 108 U.S. App. D.C. 308, 312, 281 F.2d 943, 947. The common law permitted an acquitted incompetent to be confined in the District of Columbia even before 1901. United States v. Lawrence, supra. The desire of the Congress to satisfy its interest in the rehabilitation of an incompetent defendant brought on the original statute authorizing commitment to a mental institution. The 1955 amendment, here under attack, was designed only to strengthen the safeguards to the public safety in the light of the intervening Durham rule. There can be no question that the interest of a free society is better served by commitment to hospitals than by imprisonment of the criminally incompetent. While, as the Court points out, transfer after confinement permits treatment during sentence, it is not mandatory, and it may be interrupted before completion and the patient set free. Almost every newspaper reports depredations of the criminally insane who unfortunately for themselves and the safety of others have been released on the public. It was the purpose of the statute to prevent this occurrence whether or not the accused pleads not guilty because of insanity. A defendant's plea neither proves nor affects his guilt or his sanity. To make the commitment procedure effective only on the defendant's option limits the statute's protection of the public, forces an unfortunate choice on attorneys appointed to represent defendants, convicts those who are innocent by reason of insanity and deprives them of the treatment afforded by a humanitarian public policy. See Ragsdale v. Overholser, 108 U.S. App. D.C. 308, 281 F.2d 943. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 705, 731]\n\u00a0\n The Court says that this can all be done through another trial under civil commitment procedures, but this is but to disagree with the policy of Congress rather than the Court of Appeals which has upheld the statute. As mentioned, supra, the civil procedures are entirely insufficient where criminal acts are involved. The criterion of 24-301 (d) - merely whether there is a reasonable doubt that the accused was capable in law of committing the offense - is a far cry from the test of civil commitment, where it must be proven to the satisfaction of the court that the accused is actually insane. The requirement that the petitioner here go free unless civil commitment proceedings be filed and he be adjudged insane creates a serious risk that petitioner will again be turned loose on an unsuspecting public to carry on his check-writing proclivities and perhaps much worse. His is but one example that will inevitably follow in the wake of this decision today.\n\n\nVI.\n\n\n\nThe Court disclaims the intention of granting petitioner an absolute right to plead guilty. Such a right would be contra to our concept of the fair administration of justice as exemplified in Rule 9 of the Criminal Rules of the Municipal Court of the District of Columbia, which was lifted verbatim from Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n13\n It provides explicitly \n\n[369 \nU.S. 705, 732]\n\u00a0\n that \"[t]he Court may refuse to accept a plea of guilty.\" And it further prohibits the acceptance of a guilty plea without the court's \"first determining that the plea is made voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the charge.\" The opinion today acknowledges that the trial judge need not accept the plea of guilty when, as here, he has in his hands a certificate from competent doctors that the petitioner was and remains insane and in need of treatment. The Court emphasizes again and again that the petitioner never at any time during his trial on the check charges suggested that \"he is, or ever was, mentally irresponsible.\" Of course he did not; he preferred to go to jail for a short period. But the right of a court to refuse a plea of guilty is based on the principle that in a free society it is as important that the court make certain that the innocent go free as it is that the guilty be punished. This the court did here and decided that a just disposition of the case would not permit the entry of the plea of guilty. That the evidence of insanity was sufficient is not questioned. As this Court has often held, the judge \"is not a mere moderator, but is the governor of the trial for the purpose of assuring its proper conduct . . . .\" Quercia v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 466, 469\n (1933); Glasser v. United States, \n315 \nU.S. 60, 82\n (1942). In the words of the late and revered Learned Hand, \"he is charged to see that the law is properly administered, and it is a duty which he cannot discharge by remaining inert.\" United States v. Marzano, 149 F.2d 923, 925. And here in the District of Columbia its court of last resort, the Court of Appeals, has held that the trial judge is required to set aside jury findings of sanity where the record shows a reasonable doubt. Isaac v. United States, 109 U.S. App. D.C. 34, 284 F.2d 168. This is only further indication of his duty to seek a just disposition of every case, which justified, if it did not require, the rejection of the guilty plea here. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 705, 733]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt was also unquestionably proper for the prosecutor to introduce testimony of insanity. His function, this Court said in Berger v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 78, 88\n, is to act as \"the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty . . . whose interest . . . in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done. As such, he is in a peculiar and very definite sense the servant of the law, the twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer.\"\n\nThe Court denies none of this. Yet, although it stresses that the purpose of 24-301 (d) was to protect the public from the release of dangerous persons acquitted as insane, and although it concedes that a defendant may be acquitted as insane without pleading insanity, the Court requires a finding of present insanity in order to commit in such a case. To me neither the words nor the policy of the law supports this; I cannot believe Congress thought only people who claim to be crazy are dangerous enough to be confined without further findings.\n\n\nVII.\n\n\n\nThe Court did not reach the constitutional issue. Its failure so to do is, I believe, a \"disingenuous evasion,\" to borrow a phrase from Mr. Justice Cardozo in Moore Ice Cream Co. v. Rose, \n289 \nU.S. 373, 379\n (1933). The Court should not, as I have said, rewrite a statute merely to escape upholding it against easily parried constitutional objections. I would uphold the statute. I shall not go into details, however, since the Court does not deal with the issue. In short, petitioner has no constitutional right to choose jail confinement instead of hospitalization. It is said that automatic hospitalization without a finding of present insanity renders the statute invalid but, as I see it, Congress may reasonably prefer the safety of compulsory hospitalization subject to the release procedures \n\n[369 \nU.S. 705, 734]\n\u00a0\n offered by the statute and through habeas corpus. It is said that these release procedures are too strict, placing the burden on the petitioner. But it appears reasonable once a jury or a judge has found a reasonable doubt as to the sanity of a man who has admittedly passed bad checks to require a doctor's certificate to authorize release, and failing such to require proof of the doctor's error in refusing to issue it. There is no reason to believe that the doctors or, for that matter, the judge would be improperly motivated. Release is by no means illusory. In the past six years over 25% of those committed have been released. It must be remembered that here the constitutionality of 24-301 (d) is at issue, not the wisdom of its enactment. That is for Congress. So long as its choice meets due process standards it cannot be overturned. The problem which faced Congress was the reconciliation of the opportunity for release of the accused through a judicial hearing with the vital public interest, deference to the views of institutional authorities and a decent regard for the hospitalization and cure of the accused. The balance struck by Congress, in my view, meets the essential requirements of due process.\n\nIn any event, petitioner does not claim that he is now sane. He has made no effort to secure his release on the ground of being cured. Surely he should be required to make such an effort before asking the Court to strike down the statute on that ground. Moreover, if the burden is too heavy, rather than opening the hospital doors to all persons committed under the statute, it would be more fitting to rewrite the release procedures by shifting the burden to the hospital authorities to prove the necessity for further hospitalization. The Court has not hesitated to use a similar device in another area. Coppedge v. United States, \n369 \nU.S. 438\n. I would also think the Court would prefer to do this rather than create a loophole for those who seek to plead guilty. In so doing, the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 705, 735]\n\u00a0\n Court would not force the badge of criminal conviction on innocent persons but would afford them the benefit of treatment, safeguarded by entirely fair and reasonable release procedures, and at the same time afford the public protection from those unfortunates among us that know not what they do. The Court has chosen not to reverse the burden of proof; perhaps the Congress will consider doing so.\n\nI dissent.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 24-301 (d), District of Columbia Code.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Williams, Criminal Law: The General Part (2d ed. 1961), 456; Note, Releasing Criminal Defendants Acquitted and Committed Because of Insanity: The Need for Balanced Administration, 68 Yale L.

UNITED STATES(1962)\nNo. 69\nArgued: December 5, 1961Decided: February 19, 1962\n\n\n\n\n In a Federal District Court, petitioner pleaded guilty to two charges of bank robbery. Before sentencing, the Judge inquired whether counsel desired to make any statement; but he did not direct any similar inquiry to petitioner personally. He sentenced petitioner to imprisonment for 25 years on one charge and 15 years on the other, the sentences to run consecutively. Several years later, petitioner filed in the same Court a motion under 28 U.S.C. 2255 to vacate and set aside the sentence on the grounds that the Judge had not asked petitioner whether he wished to speak in his own behalf before sentence was imposed, as required by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32 (a), that he had accepted the guilty pleas without first determining that they had been made voluntarily, as required by Rule 11, and that the pleas of guilty had not been voluntary but had been induced by promises and threats made by the prosecuting attorney. In support of the last ground, petitioner filed an affidavit setting out detailed and specific allegations. The prosecuting attorney filed an affidavit denying any promises or coercion. Without a hearing, the District Judge determined that petitioner's allegations concerning an agreement were false and denied the motion. Held:\n\n 1. Failure of the Judge specifically to inquire at the time of sentencing whether petitioner personally wished to make a statement in his own behalf is not of itself an error that can be raised by motion under 28 U.S.C. 2255 or Rule 35. P. 489.\n\n\n 2. The District Court did not proceed in conformity with 28 U.S.C. 2255 when it made findings on controverted issues of fact without notice to petitioner and without a hearing, since this was not a case where \"the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief.\" Pp. 489-496.\n\n\n 280 F.2d 379, judgment vacated and cause remanded.\n\nBy appointment of the Court, \n365 \nU.S. 842\n, Curtis R. Reitz argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner. \n\n[368 \nU.S. 487, 488]\n\u00a0\n\n\nJulia P. Cooper argued the cause for the United States. With her on the briefs were Solicitor General Cox, Assistant Attorney General Miller, Richard J. Medalie and Beatrice Rosenberg.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nIn 1956 two informations were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio charging the petitioner with having robbed banks in Waterville, Ohio, and Forest, Ohio. Represented by counsel of his own choice, the petitioner waived indictment and pleaded guilty to both charges. Sentence was deferred pending a presentence investigation, and in the interim petitioner appeared as a defense witness at the jury trial of Marvin Breaton, charged with participation in the Waterville bank robbery. At that trial the petitioner testified that he had robbed the Waterville bank, but denied that Breaton had been with him. Breaton was convicted by the jury. Three weeks later the petitioner appeared with counsel before the District Judge for sentencing. During the course of the proceedings the judge inquired if counsel had any statement to make, but did not direct any similar inquiry to the petitioner personally. The court imposed sentence of twenty-five years imprisonment on the first information and fifteen years on the second, the sentences to run consecutively.\n\nIn 1959 the petitioner instituted the present litigation by filing in the sentencing court a motion under 28 U.S.C. 2255, to vacate and set aside the sentence he was serving. The motion alleged three grounds upon which it was claimed relief should be granted: that the petitioner's pleas of guilty had not been voluntary, but had been induced by promises made by the Assistant United States Attorney in charge of the prosecution; that in violation of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure the \n\n[368 \nU.S. 487, 489]\n\u00a0\n court had accepted the guilty pleas without first determining that they had been made voluntarily; and that in violation of Rule 32 (a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure the court had not inquired if the defendant wished to speak in his own behalf before sentence was imposed. The motion was denied by the District Court without a hearing, 184 F. Supp. 881. The Court of Appeals affirmed, per curiam, 280 F.2d 379. We granted certiorari to consider seemingly significant questions as to the scope of relief under 28 U.S.C. 2255. \n365 \nU.S. 842\n.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nFor the reasons stated in Hill v. United States, ante, p. 424, we hold that the failure of the District Court specifically to inquire at the time of sentencing whether the petitioner personally wished to make a statement in his own behalf is not of itself an error that can be raised by motion under 28 U.S.C. 2255 or Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nIn support of his claim that his pleas of guilty had been involuntarily made, the petitioner's motion and supporting affidavit set out detailed factual allegations. Specifically, the motion and affidavit alleged that on three separate occasions, identified as to time and place, an Assistant United States Attorney had promised the petitioner that he would receive a total prison sentence of not more than twenty years if he pleaded guilty to both informations. These promises were said to have been made upon the authority of the United States Attorney and to be agreeable to the District Judge. It was alleged that the petitioner had been cautioned not to tell his own lawyer about the conversations. It was further alleged that when the petitioner threatened to advise his lawyer and the court of what had transpired, the Assistant \n\n[368 \nU.S. 487, 490]\n\u00a0\n United States Attorney had told him that if he \"insisted in making a scene,\" certain unsettled matters concerning two other robberies would be added to the petitioner's difficulties. Finally, the motion and affidavit alleged that the petitioner had written two letters to the sentencing court and two letters to the Attorney General of the United States \"relative to the misrepresentations\" by the Assistant United States Attorney, to which he had received no reply.\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[368 \nU.S. 487, 491]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Government filed a memorandum in opposition to the petitioner's motion, attaching an affidavit of the Assistant United States Attorney. The affidavit emphatically denied any promises or coercion with respect to the petitioner's pleas of guilty, but did admit that the Assistant United States Attorney had had a conversation with the petitioner in the county jail the day before Breaton's trial, at which time the petitioner was told \n\n[368 \nU.S. 487, 492]\n\u00a0\n he was about to be given his last opportunity to tell the truth and that the court, in sentencing, might well take into consideration the petitioner's refusal to talk.\n\nWithout a hearing the District Judge determined that the petitioner's allegations as to an agreement with the Assistant United States Attorney were false. The court noted that it had never received either of the two letters \n\n[368 \nU.S. 487, 493]\n\u00a0\n referred to by the petitioner, but had received a letter purportedly from him six months after sentencing, which did not mention any agreement, but simply requested that the sentences be made concurrent, rather than consecutive. The court further noted that the petitioner had not complained when no request for a reduction of sentence was made by the United States Attorney within sixty days after sentencing, and that instead, the petitioner had waited almost two and a half years to file the present motion.\n\nThere can be no doubt that, if the allegations contained in the petitioner's motion and affidavit are true, he is entitled to have his sentence vacated. A guilty plea, if induced by promises or threats which deprive it of the character of a voluntary act, is void. A conviction based upon such a plea is open to collateral attack. See Walker v. Johnston, \n312 \nU.S. 275\n; Waley v. Johnston, \n316 \nU.S. 101\n; Shelton v. United States, \n356 \nU.S. 26\n, reversing, 246 F.2d 571.\n2\n \"A plea of guilty differs in purpose and effect from a mere admission or an extra-judicial confession; it is itself a conviction. Like a verdict of a jury it is conclusive. More is not required; the court has nothing to do but give judgment and sentence. Out of just consideration for persons accused of crime, courts are careful that a plea of guilty shall not be accepted unless made voluntarily after proper advice and with full understanding of the consequences.\" Kercheval v. United States, \n274 \nU.S. 220, 223\n.\n\nThe District Court recognized that the \"charges of an agreement between a former Assistant United States Attorney and the defendant are serious,\" and stated that \n\n[368 \nU.S. 487, 494]\n\u00a0\n if \"this Court had any doubt as to their falsity it would require a hearing.\" The court determined, however, that the combination of factual inferences already mentioned \"conclusively indicates the falsity of the defendant's allegations.\" 184 F. Supp., at 883.\n\nWe think the District Court did not proceed in conformity with the provisions of 28 U.S.C. 2255, when it made findings on controverted issues of fact without notice to the petitioner and without a hearing. United States v. Hayman, \n342 \nU.S. 205, 220\n. The statute requires a District Court to \"grant a prompt hearing\" when such a motion is filed, and to \"determine the issues and make findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect thereto\" unless \"the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief.\"\n3\n This was not a case where the issues raised by the motion were conclusively determined either by the motion itself or by the \"files and records\" in the trial court. The factual allegations contained in the petitioner's motion and affidavit, and put in issue by the affidavit filed with the Government's response, related primarily to purported occurrences outside the courtroom and upon which the record could, therefore, cast no real \n\n[368 \nU.S. 487, 495]\n\u00a0\n light. Nor were the circumstances alleged of a kind that the District Judge could completely resolve by drawing upon his own personal knowledge or recollection.\n\nWe cannot agree with the Government that a hearing in this case would be futile because of the apparent lack of any eyewitnesses to the occurrences alleged, other than the petitioner himself and the Assistant United States Attorney. The petitioner's motion and affidavit contain charges which are detailed and specific. It is not unreasonable to suppose that many of the material allegations can either be corroborated or disproved by the visitors' records of the county jail where the petitioner was confined, the mail records of the penitentiary to which he was sent, and other such sources. \"Not by the pleadings and the affidavits, but by the whole of the testimony, must it be determined whether the petitioner has carried his burden of proof and shown his right to a discharge. The Government's contention that his allegations are improbable and unbelievable cannot serve to deny him an opportunity to support them by evidence. On this record it is his right to be heard.\" Walker v. Johnston, \n312 \nU.S. 275\n, at 287.\n\nWhat has been said is not to imply that a movant must always be allowed to appear in a district court for a full hearing if the record does not conclusively and expressly belie his claim, no matter how vague, conclusory, or palpably incredible his allegations may be. The language of the statute does not strip the district courts of all discretion to exercise their common sense. Indeed, the statute itself recognizes that there are times when allegations of facts outside the record can be fully investigated without requiring the personal presence of the prisoner.\n4\n Whether the petition in the present case can \n\n[368 \nU.S. 487, 496]\n\u00a0\n appropriately be disposed of without the presence of the petitioner at the hearing is a question to be resolved in the further proceedings in the District Court.\n\nThere will always be marginal cases, and this case is not far from the line. But the specific and detailed factual assertions of the petitioner, while improbable, cannot at this juncture be said to be incredible. If the allegations are true, the petitioner is clearly entitled to relief. Accordingly, we think the function of 28 U.S.C. 2255 can be served in this case only by affording the hearing which its provisions require.\n\n   Vacated and remanded.\n\n\n THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE BLACK, MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN concur in the Court's judgment and opinion except as to Part I, from which they dissent for the reasons set out in their dissent in Hill v. United States, ante, p. 430.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The affidavit filed with the petitioner's motion was as follows:\n\n\"John Machibroda, having been duly sworn according to law deposes and says that he is the petitioner in an action filed in this Court entitled `Motion To Vacate sentence' and this affidavit is made in support thereof:\n\n\n\"1. That affiant was interviewed in the County Jail on or about February 21, 1956, by one Clarence M. Condon who represented himself to be as Assistant United States Attorney in charge of the prosecution of alleged bank robberies committed at the Waterville and Forest Banks. (Later designated as Cases 10345 and 10348). The County Jail where the interview took place is situated in Toledo, Ohio.\n\n\n\"2. That the said Clarence M.

That the said Clarence M. Condon represented to the Affiant that if the Affiant would waive indictment in case no. 10348 and plead guilty in cases Nos. 10345 and 10348 the Court would not impose a sentence in the excess of twenty (20) years in Case No. 10345 and that any sentence imposed in Case No. 10348 would not be in the excess of ten (10) years and would be ordered served concurrently with the term imposed in case No. 10345.\n\n\n\"4. That on the assurance of the said Clarence M. Condon that the sentences would be imposed as heretofore set out in paragraph 3, above, the Affiant agreed to waive indictment in case no. 10348 and plead guilty to both cases.\n*\n (This interview was held on or about February 21, 1956.)\n\n\n\"[*] At that time the Affiant had already waived indictment in case No. 10345. \n\n[368 \nU.S. 487, 491]\n\u00a0\n \"5. That the said Clarence M. Condon instructed the Affiant to advise his Attorney, John Schuchmann, that he would waive indictment in case no. 10348 and plead guilty to both cases.\n\n\n\"6. That the said Clarence M. Condon cautioned the Affiant to refrain from advising the said John Schuchmann of his interviews with Mr. Condon and that an agreement had been reached between the government as represented by Mr. Condon, and the Affiant in the matter of waiver, pleas and sentences.\n\n\n\"7. That on February 24, 1956, Affiant acting on the promises and representations of the said Clarence M. Condon waived indictment in case no. 10348.\n\n\n\"8. That on February 24, 1956, the Affiant acting on the promises and representations of the said Clarence M. Condon pleaded guilty in Cases Nos. 10345 and 10348.\n\n\n\"9. That on or about May 22, 1956, the said Clarence M. Condon again interviewed the Affiant at the County Jail and informed Affiant that because of Affiant's unfavorable testimony at the trial of a co-defendant the Court was vexed and there might be some difficulty in regards to the promised twenty (20) year sentence.\n\n\n\"10. That the said Clarence M. Condon admonished the Affiant that he had tried to warn him during the trial of the co-defendant that Affiant would shortly appear before this Court for sentence.[*]\n\n\n\"[*] The exact words Mr. Condon used to warn the Affiant are to be found in the transcript of the trial of Marvin Ferris Breaton.\n\n\n\"11. That at no time did the Affiant ever represent to Mr. Condon or anyone else that he would testify one way or the other at the trial of the co-defendant. The promise of the maximum sentence of twenty (20) years was predicated solely on the Affiant's agreement to waive indictment and plead guilty to both informations.\n\n\n\"12. That the Affiant immediately became agitated and hotly informed Mr. Condon that he was going to tell his Attorney the \n\n[368 \nU.S. 487, 492]\n\u00a0\n whole story and demand that the Court be informed of the agreement.\n\n\n\"13. That the said Clarence M. Condon assured the Affiant that in the event a sentence in the excess of twenty (20) years was imposed the United States Attorney, himself, would move within sixty (60) days for a reduction of the portion of the sentence in excess of twenty (20) years; that the Affiant had nothing to worry about if he kept his mouth shut; that on the other hand, if Affiant insisted in making a scene in a matter of his own making, there were the unsettled matters of the robberies of the Trotwood and Canal Fulton Banks which would be added to the Affiant's present difficulties.\n\n\n\"14. That on May 23, 1956, the Affiant was sentenced by the Honorable Frank L. Kloeb to twenty-five (25) years in Case No. 10345 and fifteen (15) years in case no. 10348.\n\n\n\"15. That immediately after sentence in an interview with the said Clarence M. Condon, the Affiant was informed he had no reason to worry for as soon as the Judge `cooled off' the United States Attorney would have the sentence reduced to twenty (20) years as had been promised.\n\n\n\"16. That within a few hours after sentence, the Affiant was on his way to the Federal Penitentiary, Leavenworth, Kansas.\n\n\n\"17. That the sentence was not reduced in sixty (60) days and has not been reduced to date.\n\n\n\"18. That the petitioner wrote two (2) letters to the Honorable Frank L. Kloeb and two (2) letters to the Attorney General of the United States relative to the misrepresentations by the said Clarence M. Condon. These letters were posted in the official prisoner's mail box and the Affiant has failed to receive a reply to any of them.\n\n\n\"19. That the Affiant's previous experience with Court officials has been with the authorities representing the Canadian Government and he found them to honor their commitments. He had no reason to believe that the officials of the United States Courts would do otherwise. His naivete has cost him an extra twenty (20) years in prison.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See also Daniel v. United States, 107 U.S. App. D.C. 110, 274 F.2d 768; Teller v.

If the court finds that the judgment was rendered without jurisdiction, or that the sentence imposed was not authorized by law or otherwise open to collateral attack, or that there has been such a denial or infringement of the constitutional rights of the prisoner as to render the judgment vulnerable to collateral attack, the court shall vacate and set the judgment aside and shall discharge the prisoner or resentence him or grant a new trial or correct the sentence as may appear appropriate.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Section 2255 of Title 28, United States Code, also provides, in part: \"A court may entertain and determine such motion without requiring the production of the prisoner at the hearing.\"\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK, with whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER and MR. JUSTICE HARLAN join, dissenting.\n\nThe Court awards petitioner, a bank robber serving sentences in Alcatraz, a hearing on a 2255 petition which it admits is \"not far from the line\" marking those applications the trial judge may ordinarily deny. If this be true, the doubt should be resolved in support of the decision below, not in the destruction of it. The experienced trial judge, who had been with this case from the very beginning, found the files and records conclusively show to be false petitioner's contention that his pleas of guilty were induced by promises of leniency. Accordingly, petitioner's application under 2255 was dismissed without a hearing in exact compliance with that section. The Court of Appeals affirmed this dismissal. This Court now rejects the inferences drawn from the files and records by the courts below and substitutes its own finding \n\n[368 \nU.S. 487, 497]\n\u00a0\n that these materials do not conclusively belie petitioner's story and that it is necessary to go outside the files and records to discover the truth of the matter. With this conclusion I cannot agree.\n1\n It represents not only a failure to give due deference to the inferences drawn by the two lower courts but an unwarranted restriction of the summary disposition provision of 2255. The opinion is an invitation to prisoners, always seeking a sojourn from their keepers, to swear to \"Munchausen\" tales when self-interest readily leads to self-deception in 2255 applications. Once the opinion goes the rounds of our prisons, we will likely be plagued with a rash of such spurious applications.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nThe record shows that petitioner, who had previously been convicted of armed robbery, participated in four bank robberies in Ohio, which at the point of a sawed-off shotgun netted over $169,000. After the last of these robberies, the Waterville State Savings Bank, he escaped to Canada. He was arrested there and upon waiver of extradition was returned to Ohio. An information was filed charging petitioner and one Breaton with the robbery of the Waterville Bank. Both signed in open court waivers of indictment on the charges. A week later another information was filed against the petitioner alone charging him with the robbery of the First National Bank of Forest. Petitioner, who was accompanied by counsel throughout, again filed a waiver of indictment, and at this time he pleaded guilty to both informations. The trial judge called for a presentence report, and petitioner was returned to jail. \n\n[368 \nU.S. 487, 498]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the interim between pleading and sentencing, petitioner pursuant to a subpoena testified on behalf of the defense at the trial of his codefendant Breaton. He admitted that he had committed the Waterville robbery but denied that Breaton was in anywise connected with it. He claimed that another person, presently unknown to him, whom he had picked up in a bar in Canada was his accomplice. He testified that they had driven together from Canada to Waterville, but he insisted that he not only did not know his accomplice's name but could not describe him. State witnesses testified that petitioner had stated in their presence that Breaton was the accomplice. The jury disbelieved petitioner and found Breaton guilty. Shortly thereafter petitioner appeared for sentencing before the same judge who had presided over Breaton's trial and was given a total of 40 years, 25 in the Waterville and 15 in the Forest robbery.\n\nThree years later petitioner filed this application before the same trial judge claiming that an Assistant United States Attorney, with full authority of his superior and with the implied consent of the judge, promised him a total sentence of 20 years, rather than the 40 which he had received, in return for a waiver of indictment in the second case and a plea of guilty in each case. He alleged that the Assistant had contacted him in the local jail twice before sentencing and once immediately afterwards. The latter occasion was to reassure him that the sentence would be reduced to 20 years within 60 days. The Government contested these allegations and filed a detailed affidavit by the Assistant specifically denying each of the charges.\n\nAn examination of the files and records in this case reveals that petitioner clearly outspoke himself. If a deal had been made, it borders on the incredible that petitioner would sit quietly in prison for over two and one-half \n\n[368 \nU.S. 487, 499]\n\u00a0\n years after the prosecutor had reneged on his promise.\n3\n To my mind it is preposterous to think that the prosecutor would make the trade alleged when before any promises were allegedly made not only had petitioner waived indictment on the Waterville robbery, which was the more serious of the two charges, but his attorney in his presence had mentioned to the judge in open court the \"possibility of another information being filed\" and had indicated a clear intention to waive indictment on \"both informations\" and to plead guilty to at least one. Moreover, experienced criminals such as petitioner know that judges, not prosecutors, control sentences. Petitioner says the Assistant had the \"implied\" consent of the judge. Certainly this would have not been sufficient for one so experienced as petitioner. The pledge he alleges the Assistant exacted as to silence with reference to his attorney did not include the judge. Despite this and even though he appeared before the judge on three occasions subsequent to the alleged \"deal,\" he never mentioned the same nor asked for any conference with the judge in camera. Finally, it is inconceivable that credence could be given to a story of an agreement of leniency told by a hardened criminal who before the alleged agreement was performed had testified against the Government and favorable to a codefendant. Prosecutors make deals, if at all, for testimony to support their prosecutions, not to destroy them.\n\nIn addition to being unbelievable in light of the files and records, petitioner's claim is inconsistent therewith. To explain his tardiness in seeking formal relief, petitioner alleges several previous informal attempts by letter to prod the Government into fulfilling its obligations. Yet \n\n[368 \nU.S. 487, 500]\n\u00a0\n the protest letters supposedly sent to the trial judge were not received by him and were not in the files where under departmental routine they would have been deposited had they been received. But petitioner's file is not barren of letters for it contains one written by petitioner to the trial judge several months after the Assistant United States Attorney had failed to perform the purported bargain. This letter, however, did not even remotely suggest an agreement but merely sought a reduction of sentence based upon repentance. Then, of course, there is petitioner's own admission at the time his guilty pleas were entered that such action was voluntarily taken.\n\nFor the Court to say that an application so inconsistent and incredible cannot be dispatched without a hearing leaves the summary dismissal exception of 2255 meaningless.\n4\n As pointed out by the Government, to require a hearing in this case means \"that the number of hearings held on motions under Section 2255 would be limited only by the imagination and ingenuity of the prisoners involved.\" An ingenious prisoner can deliberately bait his application with claims beyond independent proof or disproof and then demand that he be brought to court to tell the story known only to him, no matter how inconsistent and incredible it may be in light of the files and records. The Court \"supposes\" that in the present case \"many of the material allegations can either be corroborated or disproved by the visitors' records of the county jail where the petitioner was confined, the mail records of the penitentiary to which he was sent, and such other sources.\" If such independent proof is available, which \n\n[368 \nU.S. 487, 501]\n\u00a0\n I doubt,\n5\n then these avenues should be explored before permitting the petitioner to make a trip into town.\n6\n Why not ask for a response in this regard, as we often do, before ordering a hearing with the attendant expense and hazards. The Court implies that a full hearing may not be required in a given case if the allegations are sufficiently \"vague, conclusory, or palpably incredible.\" Although I would not require any hearing under the circumstances of this case, I submit that if upon remand it develops that no letters were mailed and that the Assistant United States Attorney did not visit the jail as claimed, then even the rationale of the Court's opinion would not require that petitioner be summoned to tell his story in court.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nAlcatraz is a maximum security institution housing dangerous incorrigibles, and petitioner wants a change of scenery. The Court has left the door ajar for a trip from California to Ohio along with the accompanying hazards. I would deny it.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] I concur in Part I of the Court's opinion.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 2255 cases have been steadily on the increase. The fiscal year 1961 saw a new high of 560 applications filed under this section, an increase of 15% over the previous year. The frivolous nature of these applications is indicated by the fact that less than 3% were granted by the District Courts.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] For a case in which this factor alone was considered sufficient to summarily deny an application, see United States v. Lowe, 173 F.2d 346 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1949).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] In evaluating the inferences to be drawn from the files and records some weight must be accorded the personal recollection of the trial judge. E. g., Dario Sanchez v. United States, 256 F.2d 73 (C. A. 1st Cir. 1958). Judge Kloeb observed petitioner at the time he entered his pleas of guilt and again when he was sentenced. He had also listened to petitioner's blatant lies at the trial of his codefendant.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Although prisons keep records of letters which actually go out, no record is made of every letter dropped in the mailbox. Jails likewise keep some records of visitors but do not necessarily record which prisoners are interviewed by police investigators and prosecutors, who are there regularly.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] It could be argued that the visitor and mailing records are part of the \"files and records of the case\" within the meaning of 2255 and that therefore such records could be examined by the trial judge in determining whether a hearing is necessary.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] 28 U.S.C. 2255 provides in part that: \"A court may entertain and determine such motion without requiring the production of the prisoner at the hearing.\" \n\n[368 \nU.S. 487, 502]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","127":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMALONE v. BOWDOIN(1962)\nNo. 113\nArgued: March 20, 1962Decided: May 14, 1962\n\n\n\n\n By this common law action of ejectment, brought in a state court and removed to a Federal District Court, respondents sought to eject petitioner, a Forest Service Officer of the United States Department of Agriculture, from land occupied by him solely in his official capacity under a claim of title in the United States. There was no allegation that petitioner was acting beyond his authority or that his occupation of the land amounted to an unconstitutional taking. Held: The action was one against the United States and, in the absence of consent by the United States, the District Court was without jurisdiction. Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Commerce Corp., \n337 \nU.S. 682\n. Pp. 643-648.\n\n 284 F.2d 95, reversed.\n\nDaniel M. Friedman argued the cause for petitioner. On the briefs were Solicitor General Cox and Roger P. Marquis.\n\nWilliam Buford Mitchell argued the cause for respondents. With him on the briefs was John Burke Harris, Jr.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis litigation began in a Georgia court when the respondents filed a common law action of ejectment against the petitioner, a Forest Service Officer of the United States Department of Agriculture.\n1\n The basis \n\n[369 \nU.S. 643, 644]\n\u00a0\n for the suit was the respondents' claim that they were the rightful owners of certain land occupied by the petitioner.\n2\n The action was removed to a Federal District Court under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. 1442 (a).\n3\n The removal petition stated that the action \"involves lands that were acquired by the United States of America by deed on June 6, 1936,\" that the petitioner's \"official duties as a Forest Service Officer required him to be, and he was, in charge and in possession of the land described in said ejectment suit,\" and that \"all his acts in connection with \n\n[369 \nU.S. 643, 645]\n\u00a0\n the matters charged in said complaint were committed by him under color of his said office.\"\n\nThe petitioner filed a motion to dismiss upon the ground that the suit was in substance and effect one against the United States, which had not consented to be sued or waived its immunity from suit. Noting that the respondents had conceded in a pretrial conference that the petitioner in occupying the land was acting solely as an official or employee of the United States, the District Court granted the motion to dismiss, relying upon Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Corp., \n337 \nU.S. 682\n.\n4\n On appeal, the judgment was reversed, one judge dissenting, 284 F.2d 95.\n5\n We granted certiorari to consider the scope of sovereign immunity in suits of this kind. \n368 \nU.S. 811\n. We agree with the District Court that the doctrine of the Larson case required dismissal of this action, and we therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n\nFor its view that the sovereign immunity of the United States did not bar the maintenance of this suit, the Court of Appeals found principal support in United States v. Lee, \n106 \nU.S. 196\n. In that case the Virginia estate of General Robert E. Lee had been acquired by the United States for nonpayment of taxes, although the taxes had in fact been tendered by a third party. An ejectment action was brought against the governmental custodians of the land, upon which a federal military installation and a cemetery had been established. The trial court found that the tax sale had been invalid, and that title to the land was in the plaintiff. This Court upheld a judgment in favor of the plaintiff upon the trial court's finding that the defendants' possession of the land was illegal, holding \n\n[369 \nU.S. 643, 646]\n\u00a0\n that a suit against them under such circumstances was not a suit against the sovereign.\n\nIn a number of later cases, arising over the years in a variety of factual situations, the principles of the Lee case were approved.\n6\n But in several other cases which came to the Court during the same period, it was held that suits against government agents, specifically affecting property in which the United States claimed an interest, were barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity.\n7\n While it is possible to differentiate many of these cases upon their individualized facts, it is fair to say that to reconcile completely all the decisions of the Court in this field prior to 1949 would be a Procrustean task.\n\nThe Court's 1949 Larson decision makes it unnecessary, however, to undertake that task here. For in Larson the Court, aware that it was called upon to \"resolve the conflict in doctrine\" (\n337 \nU.S., at 701\n), thoroughly reviewed the many prior decisions, and made an informed and carefully considered choice between the seemingly conflicting precedents.\n\nIn that case a suit had been brought against the War Assets Administrator to enjoin him from selling surplus coal which, it was alleged, the Administrator had already sold to the plaintiff. The theory of the action was that where \"an officer of the Government wrongly takes or \n\n[369 \nU.S. 643, 647]\n\u00a0\n holds specific property to which the plaintiff has title, then his taking or holding is a tort, and `illegal' as a matter of general law, whether or not it be within his delegated powers,\" and that the officer \"may therefore be sued individually to prevent the `illegal' taking or to recover the property `illegally' held.\" \n337 \nU.S., at 692\n. The Court held that this theory was not adequate to support a conclusion that the relief asked was not relief against the sovereign.\n\nCutting through the tangle of previous decisions, the Court expressly postulated the rule that the action of a federal officer affecting property claimed by a plaintiff can be made the basis of a suit for specific relief against the officer as an individual only if the officer's action is \"not within the officer's statutory powers or, if within those powers, only if the powers, or their exercise in the particular case, are constitutionally void.\" \n337 \nU.S., at 702\n. Since the plaintiff had not made an affirmative allegation of any relevant statutory limitation upon the Administrator's powers, and had made no claim that the Administrator's action amounted to an unconstitutional taking, the Court ruled that the suit must fail as an effort to enjoin the United States.\n\nWhile not expressly overruling United States v. Lee, supra, the Court in Larson limited that decision in such a way as to make it inapplicable to the case before us. Pointing out that at the time of the Lee decision there was no remedy by which the plaintiff could have recovered compensation for the taking of his land,\n8\n the Court interpreted Lee as simply \"a specific application of the constitutional exception to the doctrine of sovereign \n\n[369 \nU.S. 643, 648]\n\u00a0\n immunity.\" \n337 \nU.S., at 696\n. So construed, the Lee case has continuing validity only \"where there is a claim that the holding constitutes an unconstitutional taking of property without just compensation.\" Id., at 697.\n\nNo such claim has been advanced in the present case. Nor has it been asserted that the petitioner was exceeding his delegated powers as an officer of the United States in occupying the land in question,\n9\n or that he was in possession of the land in anything other than his official capacity. This suit, therefore, is not within the class of cases in which, under Larson, specific relief can be obtained against a government officer. Accordingly, it was rightly dismissed by the District Court as an action which in substance and effect was one against the United States without its consent.\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the decision of this case.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The original pleading was in the fictitious common law form in use in Georgia, Ga.

The petitioner and the United States were served with process, which was accompanied by a \n\n[369 \nU.S. 643, 644]\n\u00a0\n \"Notice to the Real Defendants,\" stating that Richard Roe had \"acted as casual ejector only.\" The subsequent dismissal of the United States as a petitioner is not challenged here.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] This assertion did not appear on the face of the original pleadings because of their fictitious form. In a subsequent brief, however, the respondents explained the basis of their claim. They alleged that an 1857 will had devised a life estate in the land to Martha A. Sanders, with remainder over to her children, and that in 1873 Mrs. Sanders, had devised the land in fee to mesne grantors of the United States, which had acquired title in 1936. Mrs. Sanders died in 1928, and the respondents claimed to be the remaindermen under the 1857 will.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 28 U.S.C. 1442 (a) provides:\n\n\"A civil action or criminal prosecution commenced in a State court against any of the following persons may be removed by them to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place wherein it is pending:\n\n\n\"(1) Any officer of the United States or any agency thereof, or person acting under him, for any act under color of such office or on account of any right, title or authority claimed under any Act of Congress for the apprehension or punishment of criminals or the collection of the revenue.\n\n\n\"(2) A property holder whose title is derived from any such officer, where such action or prosecution affects the validity of any law of the United States.\n\n\n\"(3) Any officer of the courts of the United States, for any act under color of office or in the performance of his duties;\n\n\n\"(4) Any officer of either House of Congress, for any act in the discharge of his official duty under an order of such House.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The District Court's opinion is reported sub nom.

Unlike the situation in the Lee case, there has been at all relevant times a tribunal where the respondents could seek just compensation for the taking of their land by the United States. That tribunal is the Court of Claims. United States v. Causby, \n328 \nU.S. 256, 267\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] If such a claim is to be made, \"it is necessary that the plaintiff set out in his complaint the statutory limitation on which he relies.\" Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Corp., \n337 \nU.S. 682, 690\n. While this requirement could probably not have been precisely complied with here because of the fictitious form of pleading involved, no such claim was ever suggested at any stage of the proceedings.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting.\n\nUnited States v. Lee, \n106 \nU.S. 196\n, serves a useful function and should be followed here. There, as here, the contest was over real estate which an officer of the Federal Government held against the claim of the plaintiff. Here, as there, if the federal agent's possession of the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 643, 649]\n\u00a0\n land is illegal, the suit is not against the sovereign. Mr. Justice Miller, speaking for the Court, said:\n\n\"The instances in which the life and liberty of the citizen have been protected by the judicial writ of habeas corpus are too familiar to need citation, and many of these cases, indeed almost all of them, are those in which life or liberty was invaded by persons assuming to act under the authority of the government. . . .\n\n\n \"If this constitutional provision is a sufficient authority for the court to interfere to rescue a prisoner from the hands of those holding him under the asserted authority of the government, what reason is there that the same courts shall not give remedy to the citizen whose property has been seized without due process of law, and devoted to public use without just compensation?\" Id., at 218.\n\n\n United States v. Lee was a five-to-four decision. But as late as 1947 seven members of the Court agreed to the statement in Land v. Dollar, \n330 \nU.S. 731, 737\n, that \"[w]here the right to possession or enjoyment of property under general law is in issue, and the defendants claim as officers or agents of the sovereign, the rule of United States v. Lee, supra, has been repeatedly approved.\" Two years later in Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Corp., \n337 \nU.S. 682\n, the case of United States v. Lee was attempted to be distinguished in the manner indicated by the Court. But the Larson decision was six to three, Mr. Justice Rutledge concurring in the result and my vote being the fifth. But I explained my concurrence on the following grounds:\n\n \"I think that the principles announced by the Court are the ones which should govern the selling of government property. Less strict applications of those principles would cause intolerable interference with public administration. To make the right to \n\n[369 \nU.S. 643, 650]\n\u00a0\n sue the officer turn on whether by the law of sales title had passed to the buyer would clog this governmental function with intolerable burdens. . . .\" Id., at 705.\n\n\n The holding in United States v. Lee has thus not been repudiated or necessarily restricted by anything decided prior to today.\n\nThe Court is quite correct in saying that all of our decisions in this field cannot easily be reconciled; and the same will doubtless be true if said by those who sit here several decades hence. The reason the decisions are not consistent is that policy considerations, not always apparent on the surface, are powerful agents of decision. Thus the Larson case was a suit for specific performance of a contract to sell coal, a matter that courts had long left to damage suits. As I said in my separate concurrence in that case, any other rule would \"clog\" government procurement \"with intolerable burdens.\" \n337 \nU.S., at 705\n.\n\nEjectment, on the other hand, is the classic form of action to try title. It takes place in the locality where the land is located. No judges are better qualified to try it than the local judges. It is a convenient and ready form of remedy for possession of land. Moreover, the United States, not being a party, is not bound by the state court decree. If it is aggrieved by the state or federal court ruling on title, it can bring its arsenal of power into play. Eminent domain - with the power immediately to take possession - is available.\n\nIf, however, the citizen must bow to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, he is precluded from any relief except a suit for damages under 28 U.S.C. 1346 (b) or 28 U.S.C. 1346 (a) (2), or 28 U.S.C. 1491. This places the advantage with an all-powerful Government, not with the citizen. He may, as the Court says, go into court and get the value of his property. But he does not \n\n[369 \nU.S. 643, 651]\n\u00a0\n get his property, even though we assume, as we must, that the Government is not the rightful claimant.\n\nThe result is at war with our prior decisions. Those remedies with which the Court leaves the property owner are not \"special remedies\" provided to \"displace those that otherwise would be at the plaintiff's command.\" See Sloan Shipyards v. United States Fleet Corp., \n258 \nU.S. 549, 567\n. As stated by MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER:\n\n\"When there is such a special remedy the suit against the officer is barred, not because he enjoys the immunity of the sovereign but because the sovereign can constitutionally change the traditional rules of liability for the tort of the agent by providing a fair substitute. Crozier v. Fried, \n224 \nU.S. 290\n; Richmond Screw Anchor Co. v. United States, \n275 \nU.S. 331\n. But the general statute permitting suit in the Court of Claims in certain instances against the Government is not a statute that provides that remedies otherwise at the plaintiff's command are to be displaced. A holding that the availability of an action for monetary damages in the Court of Claims against the United States prevents a suit at law, or, if the necessary requisites for equity jurisdiction are present, in equity, against the governmental agent, would be as novel as it is indefensible in the light of the settled course of decisions. Indeed, this argument is not novel; it has been explicitly negatived in at least two cases. See Sloan Shipyards Corp. v. United States Fleet Corp., \n258 \nU.S. 549, 567\n, 568; Land v. Dollar, \n330 \nU.S. 731, 738\n.\" Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Corp., supra, at 722-723 (dissenting opinion).\n\n\n What Mr. Justice Miller said in United States v. Lee, supra, 220, 221, needs repeating:\n\n \"No man in this country is so high that he is above the law. No officer of the law may set that law at \n\n[369 \nU.S. 643, 652]\n\u00a0\n defiance with impunity. All the officers of the government, from the highest to the lowest, are creatures of the law, and are bound to obey it.\n\n\n .   .   .   .   .\n\n\n \"It cannot be, then, that when, in a suit between two citizens for the ownership of real estate, one of them has established his right to the possession of the property according to all the forms of judicial procedure, and by the verdict of a jury and the judgment of the court, the wrongful possessor can say successfully to the court, Stop here, I hold by order of the President, and the progress of justice must be stayed. That, though the nature of the controversy is one peculiarly appropriate to the judicial function, though the United States is no party to the suit, though one of the three great branches of the government to which by the Constitution this duty has been assigned has declared its judgment after a fair trial, the unsuccessful party can interpose an absolute veto upon that judgment by the production of an order of the Secretary of War, which that officer had no more authority to make than the humblest private citizen.\"\n\n\n Sovereign immunity has become more and more out of date, as the powers of the Government and its vast bureaucracy have increased. Keifer & Keifer v. Reconstruction Finance Corp., \n306 \nU.S. 381, 390\n et seq. To give the agent immunity from suit is, to use the words of Mr. Justice Holmes:\n\n\"a very dangerous departure from one of the first principles of our system of law. The sovereign properly so called is superior to suit for reasons that often have been explained. But the general rule is that any person within the jurisdiction always is amenable to the law. If he is sued for conduct harmful to the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 643, 653]\n\u00a0\n plaintiff his only shield is a constitutional rule of law that exonerates him. Supposing the powers of the Fleet Corporation to have been given to a single man we doubt if anyone would contend that the acts of Congress and the delegations of authority from the President left him any less liable than other grantees of the power of eminent domain to be called upon to defend himself in court. An instrumentality of government he might be and for the greatest ends, but the agent, because he is agent, does not cease to be answerable for his acts.\" Sloan Shipyards v. United States Fleet Corp., supra, pp. 566-567.\n\n\n The balance between the convenience of the citizen and the management of public affairs is a recurring consideration in suits determining when and where a citizen can sue a government official. See Williams v. Fanning, \n332 \nU.S. 490\n. The balance is, in my view, on the side of the citizen where he claims realty in the Government's possession and where there are ready means of adjudicating the title. If legal title is actually in the claimant, if the action of the official in taking possession under authority of the United States is ultra vires, what objectionable interference with governmental functions can be said to exist?\n\nI am authorized to say that MR. JUSTICE HARLAN agrees with this opinion. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 643, 654]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","128":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMANAGED FUNDS, INC. v.

DAY(1962)\nNo. 123\nArgued: Decided: June 25, 1962\n\n\n\n\n After an administrative hearing, the Judicial Officer of the Post Office Department issued a ruling barring a shipment of petitioners' magazines from the mails under 18 U.S.C. 1461, on the grounds that (1) they were themselves \"obscene,\" and (2) they gave information as to where \"obscene\" matter could be obtained. The magazines consisted largely of photographs of nude, or nearly nude, male models and gave the name of each model and each photographer and the latter's address. They also contained a number of advertisements by independent photographers offering for sale photographs of nude men. The Judicial Officer found that the magazines (1) were composed primarily, if not exclusively, for homosexuals and had no literary, scientific or other merit; (2) would appeal to the \"prurient interest\" of such sexual deviates, but would not have any interest for sexually normal individuals; (3) are read almost entirely by homosexuals, and possibly a few adolescent males; and (4) would not ordinarily be bought by normal male adults. In a suit by petitioners, the District Court sustained the administrative ruling and denied injunctive relief. The Court of Appeals affirmed. Held: The judgment is reversed.

Pp. 481-491.\n\n\n 2. The obscene-advertising proscription of 1461 is not applicable unless the publisher knew that at least some of his advertisers \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 479]\n\u00a0\n were offering to sell obscene material, and the evidence in this record is not sufficient to support a finding that petitioners had such knowledge. Pp. 491-495.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BRENNAN, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, concluded that 18 U.S.C. 1461 does not authorize the Postmaster General to employ any administrative process of his own to close the mails to matter which, in his view, falls within the ban of that section. Pp. 495-519.\n\nStanley M. Dietz argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the brief was Edward J. Lynch.\n\nJ. William Doolittle argued the cause for respondent. With him on the briefs were Solicitor General Cox, Assistant Attorney General Orrick, John G. Laughlin, Jr. and David L. Rose.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN announced the judgment of the Court and an opinion in which MR. JUSTICE STEWART joins.\n\nThis case draws in question a ruling of the Post Office Department, sustained both by the District Court and the Court of Appeals, 110 U.S. App. D.C. 78, 289 F.2d 455, barring from the mails a shipment of petitioners' magazines. That ruling was based on alternative determinations that the magazines (1) were themselves \"obscene,\" and (2) gave information as to where obscene matter could be obtained, thus rendering them nonmailable under two separate provisions of 18 U.S.C. 1461, known as the Comstock Act.\n1\n Certiorari was granted \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 480]\n\u00a0\n (\n368 \nU.S. 809\n) to consider the claim that this ruling was inconsistent with the proper interpretation and application of 1461, and with principles established in two of this Court's prior decisions. Roth v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 476\n; Smith v. California, \n361 \nU.S. 147\n.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nPetitioners are three corporations respectively engaged in publishing magazines titled MANual, Trim, and Grecian Guild Pictorial. They have offices at the same address in Washington, D.C., and a common president, one Herman L. Womack. The magazines consist largely of photographs of nude, or near-nude, male models and give the names of each model and the photographer, \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 481]\n\u00a0\n together with the address of the latter. They also contain a number of advertisements by independent photographers offering nudist photographs for sale.\n\nOn March 25, 1960, six parcels containing an aggregate of 405 copies of the three magazines, destined from Alexandria, Virginia, to Chicago, Illinois, were detained by the Alexandria postmaster, pending a ruling by his superiors at Washington as to whether the magazines were \"non-mailable.\" After an evidentiary hearing before the Judicial Officer of the Post Office Department there ensued the administrative and court decisions now under review.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nOn the issue of obscenity, as distinguished from unlawful advertising, the case comes to us with the following administrative findings, which are supported by substantial evidence and which we, and indeed the parties, for the most part, themselves, accept: (1) the magazines are not, as asserted by petitioners, physical culture or \"body-building\" publications, but are composed primarily, if not exclusively, for homosexuals, and have no literary, scientific or other merit;\n3\n (2) they would appeal to the \"prurient interest\" of such sexual deviates, but would not have any interest for sexually normal individuals; and (3) the magazines are read almost entirely by homosexuals, and possibly a few adolescent males; the ordinary male adult would not normally buy them.\n\nOn these premises, the question whether these magazines are \"obscene,\" as it was decided below and argued before us, was thought to depend solely on a determination \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 482]\n\u00a0\n as to the relevant \"audience\" in terms of which their \"prurient interest\" appeal should be judged. This view of the obscenity issue evidently stemmed from the belief that in Roth v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 476, 489\n, this Court established the following single test for determining whether challenged material is obscene: \"whether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest.\" (Footnote omitted.) On this basis the Court of Appeals, rejecting the petitioners' contention that the \"prurient interest\" appeal of the magazines should be judged in terms of their likely impact on the \"average person,\" even though not a likely recipient of the magazines, held that the administrative finding respecting their impact on the \"average homosexual\" sufficed to establish the Government's case as to their obscenity.\n\nWe do not reach the question thus thought below to be dispositive on this aspect of the case. For we find lacking in these magazines an element which, no less than \"prurient interest,\" is essential to a valid determination of obscenity under 1461, and to which neither the Post Office Department nor the Court of Appeals addressed itself at all: These magazines cannot be deemed so offensive on their face as to affront current community standards of decency - a quality that we shall hereafter refer to as \"patent offensiveness\" or \"indecency.\" Lacking that quality, the magazines cannot be deemed legally \"obscene,\" and we need not consider the question of the proper \"audience\" by which their \"prurient interest\" appeal should be judged.\n\nThe words of 1461, \"obscene, lewd, lascivious, indecent, filthy or vile,\" connote something that is portrayed in a manner so offensive as to make it unacceptable under current community mores. While in common usage the \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 483]\n\u00a0\n words have different shades of meaning,\n4\n the statute since its inception has always been taken as aimed at obnoxiously debasing portrayals of sex.\n5\n Although the statute condemns such material irrespective of the effect it may \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 484]\n\u00a0\n have upon those into whose hands it falls, the early case of United States v. Bennett, 24 Fed. Cas. 1093 (No. 14571), put a limiting gloss upon the statutory language: the statute reaches only indecent material which, as now expressed in Roth v. United States, supra, at 489, \"taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest.\" This \"effect\" element, originally cast in somewhat different language from that of Roth (see \n354 \nU.S., at 487\n, 489), was taken into federal obscenity law from the leading English case of Regina v. Hicklin, 1868. L. R. 3 Q. B. 360, of which a distinguished Australian judge has given the following illuminating analysis:\n\n \"As soon as one reflects that the word `obscene,' as an ordinary English word, has nothing to do with corrupting or depraving susceptible people, and that it is used to describe things which are offensive to current standards of decency and not things which may induce to sinful thoughts, it becomes plain, I think, that Cockburn, C. J., in . . . R. v. Hicklin . . . \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 485]\n\u00a0\n was not propounding a logical definition of the word `obscene,' but was merely explaining that particular characteristic which was necessary to bring an obscene publication within the law relating to obscene libel.\n6\n The tendency to deprave is not the characteristic which makes a publication obscene but is the characteristic which makes an obscene publication criminal. It is at once an essential element in the crime and the justification for the intervention of the common law. But it is not the whole and sole test of what constitutes an obscene libel. There is no obscene libel unless what is published is both offensive according to current standards of decency and calculated or likely to have the effect described in R. v. Hicklin . . . .\"\n7\n Regina v. Close, 1948. Vict. L. R. 445, 463, Judgment of Fullagar, J. (Emphasis in original.)\n\n\n The thoughtful studies of the American Law Institute reflect the same twofold concept of obscenity. Its earlier draft of a Model Penal Code contains the following definition of \"obscene\": \"A thing is obscene if, considered as a whole, its predominant appeal is to \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 486]\n\u00a0\n prurient interest . . . and if it goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters.\" A. L. I., Model Penal Code, Tent. Draft No. 6 (1957), 207.10 (2). (Emphasis added.) The same organization's currently proposed definition reads: \"Material is obscene if, considered as a whole, its predominant appeal is to prurient interest . . . and if in addition it goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in describing or representing such matters.\" A. L. I., Model Penal Code, Proposed Official Draft (May 4, 1962), 251.4 (1). (Emphasis added.)\n8\n\u00a0\n\nObscenity under the federal statute thus requires proof of two distinct elements: (1) patent offensiveness; and (2) \"prurient interest\" appeal. Both must conjoin before challenged material can be found \"obscene\" under 1461. In most obscenity cases, to be sure, the two elements tend to coalesce, for that which is patently offensive will also usually carry the requisite \"prurient interest\" appeal. It is only in the unusual instance where, as here, the \"prurient interest\" appeal of the material is found limited to a particular class of persons that occasion arises for a truly independent inquiry into the question whether or not the material is patently offensive.\n\nThe Court of Appeals was mistaken in considering that Roth made \"prurient interest\" appeal the sole test of obscenity.\n9\n Reading that case as dispensing with the \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 487]\n\u00a0\n requisite of patently offensive portrayal would be not only inconsistent with 1461 and its common-law background, but out of keeping with Roth's evident purpose to tighten obscenity standards. The Court there both rejected the \"isolated excerpt\" and \"particularly susceptible persons\" tests of the Hicklin case, \n354 \nU.S., at 488\n-489, and was at pains to point out that not all portrayals of sex could be reached by obscenity laws but only those treating that subject \"in a manner appealing to prurient interest.\" \n354 \nU.S., at 487\n. That, of course, was but a compendious way of embracing in the obscenity standard both the concept of patent offensiveness, manifested by the terms of 1461 itself, and the element of the likely corruptive effect of the challenged material, brought into federal law via Regina v. Hicklin.\n\nTo consider that the \"obscenity\" exception in \"the area of constitutionally protected speech or press,\" Roth, at 485, does not require any determination as to the patent offensiveness vel non of the material itself might well put the American public in jeopardy of being denied access to many worthwhile works in literature, science, or art. For one would not have to travel far even among the acknowledged masterpieces in any of these fields to find works whose \"dominant theme\" might, not beyond reason, be claimed to appeal to the \"prurient interest\" of the reader or observer. We decline to attribute to Congress any such quixotic and deadening purpose as would bar from the mails all material, not patently offensive, which stimulates impure desires relating to sex. Indeed such a construction of 1461 would doubtless encounter constitutional barriers. Roth, at 487-489. Consequently we consider the power exercised by Congress in enacting 1461 as no more embracing than the interdiction of \"obscenity\" as it had theretofore been understood. It is only material whose indecency is self-demonstrating and which, from the standpoint of its effect, may be said \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 488]\n\u00a0\n predominantly to appeal to the prurient interest that Congress has chosen to bar from the mails by the force of 1461.\n\nWe come then to what we consider the dispositive question on this phase of the case. Are these magazines offensive on their face? Whether this question be deemed one of fact or of mixed fact and law, see Lockhart and McClure, Censorship of Obscenity: The Developing Constitutional Standards, 45 Minn. L. Rev. 5, 114-115 (1960), we see no need of remanding the case for initial consideration by the Post Office Department or the Court of Appeals of this missing factor in their determinations. That issue, involving factual matters entangled in a constitutional claim, see Grove Press, Inc., v. Christenberry, 276 F.2d 433, 436, is ultimately one for this Court. The relevant materials being before us, we determine the issue for ourselves.\n\nThere must first be decided the relevant \"community\" in terms of whose standards of decency the issue must be judged. We think that the proper test under this federal statute, reaching as it does to all parts of the United States whose population reflects many different ethnic and cultural backgrounds, is a national standard of decency. We need not decide whether Congress could constitutionally prescribe a lesser geographical framework for judging this issue\n10\n which would not have the intolerable consequence of denying some sections of the country access to material, there deemed acceptable, which in others might be considered offensive to prevailing community standards of decency. Cf. Butler v. Michigan, \n352 \nU.S. 380\n.\n\nAs regards the standard for judging the element of \"indecency,\" the Roth case gives little guidance beyond \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 489]\n\u00a0\n indicating that the standard is a constitutional one which as with \"prurient interest,\" requires taking the challenged material \"as a whole.\" Roth, at 489. Being ultimately concerned only with the question whether the First and Fourteenth Amendments protect material that is admittedly obscene,\n11\n the Court there had no occasion to explore the application of a particular obscenity standard. At least one important state court and some authoritative commentators have considered Roth and subsequent cases\n12\n to indicate that only \"hard-core\" pornography can constitutionally be reached under this or similar state obscenity statutes. See People v. Richmond County News, Inc., 9 N. Y. 2d 578, 175 N. E. 2d 681; Lockhart and McClure, supra, at 58-60. Whether \"hard-core\" pornography, or something less, be the proper test, we need go no further in the present case than to hold that the magazines in question, taken as a whole, cannot, under any permissible constitutional standard, be deemed to be beyond the pale of contemporary notions of rudimentary decency.\n\nWe cannot accept in full the Government's description of these magazines which, contrary to Roth (\n354 \nU.S., at 488\n-489), tends to emphasize and in some respects overdraw certain features in several of the photographs, at the expense of what the magazines fairly taken as a whole depict.\n13\n Our own independent examination of \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 490]\n\u00a0\n the magazines leads us to conclude that the most that can be said of them is that they are dismally unpleasant, uncouth, and tawdry. But this is not enough to make them \"obscene.\" Divorced from their \"prurient interest\" appeal to the unfortunate persons whose patronage they were aimed at capturing (a separate issue), these portrayals of the male nude cannot fairly be regarded as more objectionable than many portrayals of the female nude that society tolerates. Of course not every portrayal of male or female nudity is obscene. See Parmelee v. United States, 72 App. D.C. 203, 206-208, 113 F.2d 729, 732-734; Sunshine Book Co. v. Summerfield, \n355 \nU.S. 372\n; Mounce v. United States, \n355 \nU.S. 180\n. Were we to hold that these magazines, although they do not transcend the prevailing bounds of decency, may be denied access to the mails by such undifferentiated legislation as that before us, we would be ignoring the admonition that \"the door . . . into this area [the First Amendment] cannot be left ajar; it must be kept tightly closed and opened \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 491]\n\u00a0\n only the slightest crack necessary to prevent encroachment upon more important interests\" (footnote omitted). Roth, at 488.\n14\n\u00a0\n\nWe conclude that the administrative ruling respecting nonmailability is improvident insofar as it depends on a determination that these magazines are obscene.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nThere remains the question of the advertising. It is not contended that the petitioners held themselves out as purveyors of obscene material, or that the advertisements, as distinguished from the other contents of the magazines, were obscene on their own account. The advertisements were all by independent third-party photographers. And, neither with respect to the advertisements nor the magazines themselves, do we understand the Government to suggest that the \"advertising\" provisions of 1461 are violated if the mailed material merely \"gives the leer that promises the customer some obscene pictures.\" United States v. Hornick, 229 F.2d 120, 121. Such an approach to the statute could not withstand the underlying precepts of Roth. See Poss v. Christenberry, 179 F. Supp. 411, 415; cf. United States v. Schillaci, 166 F. Supp. 303, 306. The claim on this branch of the case rests, then, on the fact that some of the third-party advertisers were found in possession of what undoubtedly may be regarded as \"hard-core\" photographs,\n15\n and that postal \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 492]\n\u00a0\n officials, although not obtaining the names of the advertisers from the lists in petitioners' magazines, received somewhat less offensive material through the mails from certain studios which were advertising in petitioners' magazines.\n\nA question of law must first be dealt with. Should the \"obscene-advertising\" proscription of 1461 be construed as not requiring proof that the publisher knew that at least some of his advertisers were offering to sell obscene material? In other words, although the criminal provisions of 1461 do require scienter (note 1, supra), can the Post Office Department in civil proceedings under that section escape with a lesser burden of proof? We are constrained to a negative answer. First, Congress has required scienter in respect of one indicted for mailing material proscribed by the statute. In the constitutional climate in which this statute finds itself, we should hesitate to attribute to Congress a purpose to render a publisher civilly responsible for the innocuous advertisements of the materials of others, in the absence of any showing that he knew that the character of such materials was offensive. And with no express grant of authority to the Post Office Department to keep obscene matter from the mails (see note 2, supra), we should be slow to accept the suggestion that an element of proof expressly required in a criminal proceeding may be omitted in an altogether parallel civil proceeding. Second, this Court's ground of decision in Smith v. California, \n361 \nU.S. 147\n, indicates that a substantial constitutional question would arise were we to construe 1461 as not requiring proof of scienter in civil proceedings. For the power of the Post Office to bar a magazine from the mails, if exercised without proof of the publisher's knowledge of the character of the advertisements included in the magazine, would as effectively \"impose a severe limitation on the public's \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 493]\n\u00a0\n access to constitutionally protected matter,\" \n361 \nU.S., at 153\n, as would a state obscenity statute which makes criminal the possession of obscene material without proof of scienter. Since publishers cannot practicably be expected to investigate each of their advertisers, and since the economic consequences of an order barring even a single issue of a periodical from the mails might entail heavy financial sacrifice, a magazine publisher might refrain from accepting advertisements from those whose own materials could conceivably be deemed objectionable by the Post Office Department. This would deprive such materials, which might otherwise be entitled to constitutional protection, of a legitimate and recognized avenue of access to the public. To be sure, the Court found it unnecessary in Smith to delineate the scope of scienter which would satisfy the Fourteenth Amendment. Yet it may safely be said that a federal statute which, as we construe it, requires the presence of that element is not satisfied, as the Government suggests it might be, merely by showing that a defendant did not make a \"good faith effort\" to ascertain the character of his advertiser's materials.\n\nOn these premises we turn to the record in this case. Although postal officials had informed petitioners' president, Womack, that their Department was prosecuting several of his advertisers for sending obscene matter through the mails, there is no evidence that any of this material was shown to him. He thus was afforded no opportunity to judge for himself as to its alleged obscenity. Contrariwise, one of the government witnesses at the administrative hearing admitted that the petitioners had deleted the advertisements of several photographic studios after being informed by the Post Office that the proprietors had been convicted of mailing obscene material.\n16\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 494]\n\u00a0\n The record reveals that none of the postal officials who received allegedly obscene matter from some of the advertisers obtained their names from petitioners' magazines; this material was received as a result of independent test checks. Nor on the record before us can petitioners be linked with the material seized by the police. Note 15, supra. The only such asserted connection - that \"hard core\" matter was seized at the studio of one of petitioners' advertisers - falls short of an adequate showing that petitioners knew that the advertiser was offering for sale obscene matter. Womack's own conviction for sending obscene material through the mails, Womack v. United States, 111 U.S. App. D.C. 8, 294 F.2d 204, is remote from proof of like conduct on the part of the advertisers. At that time he was acting as president of another studio; the vendee of the material, while an advertiser in petitioners' magazines, had closed his own studio before the present issues were published. Finally, the general testimony by one postal inspector to the effect that in his experience advertisers of this character, after first leading their customers on with borderline material, usually followed up with \"hard-core\" matter, can hardly be deemed of probative significance on the issue at hand.\n\nAt best the Government's proof showed no more than that petitioners were chargeable with knowledge that these advertisers were offering photographs of the same character, and with the same purposes, as those reflected \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 495]\n\u00a0\n in their own magazines. This is not enough to satisfy the Government's burden of proof on this score.\n17\n\u00a0\n\nIn conclusion, nothing in this opinion of course remotely implies approval of the type of magazines published by these petitioners, still less of the sordid motives which prompted their publication. All we decide is that on this record these particular magazines are not subject to repression under 1461.\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BLACK concurs in the result.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the decision of this case.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 1461 of 18 U.S.C. provides in part:\n\n\"Every obscene, lewd, lascivious, indecent, filthy or vile article, matter, thing, device, or substance; and -\n\n.   .   .   .   .\n\n\n\n\"Every written or printed card, letter, circular, book, pamphlet, advertisement, or notice of any kind giving information, directly or indirectly, where, or how, or from whom, or by what means any of \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 480]\n\u00a0\n such mentioned matters, articles, or things may be obtained or made . . . .\n\n.   .   .   .   .\n\n\n\n\"Is declared to be nonmailable matter and shall not be conveyed in the mails or delivered from any post office or by any letter carrier.\n\n\n\"Whoever knowingly uses the mails for the mailing, carriage in the mails, or delivery of anything declared by this section to be nonmailable, or knowingly causes to be delivered by mail according to the direction thereon, or at the place at which it is directed to be delivered by the person to whom it is addressed, or knowingly takes any such thing from the mails for the purpose of circulating or disposing thereof, or of aiding in the circulation or disposition thereof, shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years . . . .\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Because of our view of the case, we need not reach petitioners' third contention that, as applied in this instance, these Post Office procedures amounted to an unconstitutional \"prior restraint\" on the publication of these magazines. The petitioner in this case has not questioned the Post Office Department's general authority under 1461 to withhold these magazines from the mails if they are obscene. If that question, discussed in the opinion of MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, post, p. 495, may still be deemed open in this Court, see Milwaukee Publishing Co. v. Burleson, \n255 \nU.S. 407, 421\n-422 (Brandeis, J., dissenting); cf. Hannegan v. Esquire, Inc., \n327 \nU.S. 146\n, we do not think it should be decided except upon full-dress argument and briefing, which have not been afforded us here.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The Judicial Officer found that \"the publisher has admitted that the magazines are knowingly published to appeal to the male homosexual group,\" and that \"The publisher of the issues here involved has deliberately planned these publications so that they would appeal to the male homosexual audience . . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The words of the statute are defined in Webster's New International Dictionary (unabridged, 2d ed., 1956) as follows:\n\n obscene\n\n\"1. Offensive to taste; foul; loathsome; disgusting.\n\n.   .   .   .   .\n\n\n\n\"2. a Offensive to chastity of mind or to modesty; expressing or presenting to the mind or view something that delicacy, purity, and decency forbid to be exposed; lewd; indecent; as, obscene language, dances, images.\"\n\n\n lewd\n\n\"4.

In 1865 the Congress passed the first Postal Act touching on the mailing of obscene matter, making it a crime to deposit an \"obscene book . . . or other publication of a vulgar and indecent character\" in the mails. 13 Stat. 507. The reenactment of the 1865 Act in the codification of the postal laws in 1872 did not change the several adjectives describing the objectionable matter. 17 Stat. 302. The Comstock Act, 17 Stat. 598, added the descriptive terms \"lewd\" and \"lascivious\" so that the proscription then included any \"obscene, lewd, or lascivious book . . . or other publication of an indecent character,\" but this Court in Swearingen v. United States, \n161 \nU.S. 446, 450\n, held that the words \"obscene, lewd or lascivious\" described a single offense. In 1909 the phrase \"and every filthy\" as well as the word \"vile\" were included in the provisions of the Comstock Act, 35 Stat. 1129. In 1955 the words were arranged in their present order. 69 Stat. 183. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit noted that the words \"indecent, filthy or vile\" are limited in their meaning by the preceding words \"obscene, lewd, lascivious,\" and that all have reference to matters of sex. Flying Eagle Publications, Inc. v. United States, 273 F.2d 799, 803.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] \"Obscene libel\" in English usage simply means obscene material, being derived from libellus, \"little book.\" See St. John-Stevas, Obscenity and the Law, 24.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The passage referred to in Regina v. Hicklin was the following: \"I think the test of obscenity is this, whether the tendency of the matter charged as obscenity is to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences, and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall. Now, with regard to this work, it is quite certain that it would suggest to the minds of the young of either sex, or even to persons of more advanced years, thoughts of a most impure and libidinous character.\" 1868. L. R. 3 Q. B., at 371.\n\nThe quotations from Regina v. Close and the Hicklin case are not intended to signify our approval of either the \"tendency to deprave\" or \"sexual thoughts\" test, but only to emphasize the two elements in the legal definition of \"obscene.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] This definition was approved by the Institute, as part of the \"Proposed Official Draft,\" at its annual meeting in Washington, D.C., in May 1962.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] It is also evident that the Judicial Officer of the Post Office Department and its counsel entertained the same mistaken view of Roth. The Report of the Judicial Officer did not address itself directly to the inherent indecency aspect of the magazines, except to the extent that such factor was tangentially involved in the findings already summarized (supra, p. 481). The same is true of the expert testimony adduced by government counsel at the administrative hearing.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] The 1958 amendments to 18 U.S.C. 1461, 72 Stat. 962, authorizing criminal prosecution at the place of delivery evince no purpose to make the standard less than national.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] No issue was presented in Roth as to the obscenity of any of the materials involved. \n354 \nU.S., at 481\n, n. 8.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] See cases cited, infra, p. 490.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] \"The magazines contained little textual material, with pictures of male models dominating almost every page . . . . The typical page consisted of a photograph, with the name of the model and the photographer and occasional references to the model's age (usually under 26), color of eyes, physical dimensions and occupation. The magazines contained little, either in text or pictures, that could be \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 490]\n\u00a0\n considered as relating in any way to weight lifting, muscle building or physical culture . . . .\n\n\"Many of the photographs were of nude male models, usually posed with some object in front of their genitals . . .; a number were of nude or partially nude males with emphasis on their bare buttocks . . . . Although none of the pictures directly exposed the model's genitals, some showed his pubic hair and others suggested what appeared to be a semi-erect penis . . .; others showed male models reclining with their legs (and sometimes their arms as well) spread wide apart . . . . Many of the pictures showed models wearing only loin cloths, `V gowns,' or posing straps . . .; some showed the model apparently removing his clothing . . . . Two of the magazines had pictures of pairs of models posed together suggestively . . . .\n\n\n\"Each of the magazines contained photographs of models with swords or other long pointed objects . . . . The magazines also contained photographs of virtually nude models wearing only shoes, boots, helmets or leather jackets . . . . There were also pictures of models posed with chains or of one model beating another while a third held his face in his hands as if weeping . . . .\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] Since Congress has sought to bar from the mails only material that is \"obscene, lewd, lascivious, indecent, filthy or vile,\" and it is within this statutory framework that we must judge the materials before us, we need not consider whether these magazines could constitutionally be reached under \"a statute narrowly drawn to define and punish specific conduct as constituting a clear and present danger.\" Cantwell v. Connecticut, \n310 \nU.S. 296, 311\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] A number of such photographs were seized by the police, possessing search or arrest warrants, but knowledge that these advertisers were selling, or would sell, such photographs was never brought home to any of these petitioners.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] Grecian Guild Pictorial carried a notice that it \"does not knowingly use the work of any studio which takes or sells nude, undraped front or side view photographs. The photographers listed above do not offer such photographs.\" To be sure this magazine, as did the others, also carried a notation that the publisher was familiar with the work of the advertisers and urged the reader to support them; but this cannot well be taken as an admission of knowledge that the advertisers' works were obscene.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] We do not think it would be appropriate at this late stage to remand the case for further proceedings on the issue of scienter. Although suggesting that \"[it] is arguable\" that scienter is not a necessary element under this part of the statute, the Government undertakes to defend this aspect of the judgment primarily on the premise that it was. The record shows that at the administrative hearing government counsel sought to fasten the petitioners with knowledge that the third-party advertisers were selling \"obscene\" material. The Judicial Officer indeed rejected the petitioners' proposed findings that \"the publishers of each of the magazines in evidence . . . had no personal knowledge of the material sold by the advertisers . . . .\" To be sure, the record does not disclose whether this was because \"knowledge\" was deemed proved rather than that such element was not considered relevant. But on the cross motions for summary judgment, based upon the administrative record, the Government did not undertake to controvert petitioners' allegations that scienter was a necessary element under this part of the statute.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS join, concurring in the reversal.\n\nI agree that the judgment below must be reversed, though for a reason different from my Brother HARLAN'S. This is the first occasion on which the Court has given \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 496]\n\u00a0\n plenary review\n1\n to a Post Office Department order holding matter \"nonmailable\" because obscene.\n\nPetitioners, publishers of certain magazines, employ the mails in the distribution of about half of their claimed circulation of 25,000. On March 25, 1960, petitioners deposited 405 copies of their publications for transmission as second class mail from Alexandria, Virginia, to Chicago. However, the Alexandria postmaster, acting, apparently without notice to petitioners, on his belief that the magazines might be obscene and therefore \"nonmailable\" under 18 U.S.C. 1461, withheld delivery and forwarded samples to the General Counsel of the Post Office Department. On April 5 and 7 that official notified petitioners not only that the magazines were being withheld from delivery because of his opinion that they were nonmailable, but also that no formal hearing would be held since an insufficient monetary value was involved. Shortly thereafter, on April 11, 1960, petitioners requested a Post Office hearing, and also sought injunctive relief in the District Court for the District of Columbia against this stoppage of their mailing. On the same day the Post Office Judicial Officer reversed the General Counsel and ordered a hearing, and thereafter the District Court refused temporary relief. On April 21, after pleadings had been filed, the hearing was begun before the Judicial Officer. On April 25 petitioners' injunction suit was dismissed on the condition that they might seek further relief if final administrative action was not forthcoming by April 28. On April 28, one month and three days after the mailing, the Judicial Officer handed down his opinion holding the magazines obscene and nonmailable, thus opening petitioners' way into court.\n\nOn May 13, petitioners filed the complaint now before us, alleging that the magazines were not obscene, that \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 497]\n\u00a0\n respondent's action in withholding them from the mails was \"unlawful and inequitable . . . calculated . . . to censor and harass plaintiffs and . . . a prior restraint designed to deprive the plaintiffs of their rights under the First Amendment . . .,\" and requesting temporary and permanent injunctive relief. Petitioners then moved for summary judgment, arguing, inter alia, that \"the Post Office Department held a time-consuming hearing, the product of which was an Order contrary to the established law of the United States . . . . This amounts to the most obnoxious and unconstitutional censorship. The principal effect of the administrative hearing . . . is to delay action of this Court. . . . Plaintiffs assert that the Post Office has conducted an ex parte administrative prior restraint treading upon an area of constitutional sensitivity apart from the substantive problems of determining whether or not the magazines are obscene. . . . Further, plaintiffs argue that the entire civil procedure followed by the Post Office based upon a criminal statute raises doubts of constitutionality.\" Respondent, too, moved for summary judgment. His motion was granted and the complaint dismissed without opinion. The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding the magazines obscene.\n\nIn addition to the question whether the particular matter is obscene, the Post Office order raises insistent questions about the validity of the whole procedure which gave rise to it, vital to the orderly development of this body of law and its administration. We risk erosion of First Amendment liberties unless we train our vigilance upon the methods whereby obscenity is condemned no less than upon the standards whereby it is judged. Marcus v. Search Warrant, \n367 \nU.S. 717\n; Kingsley Books, Inc., v. Brown, \n354 \nU.S. 436\n; see also Smith v. California, \n361 \nU.S. 147\n. Questions of procedural safeguards loom large in the wake of an order such as the one before us. Among them are: (a) whether Congress can close the \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 498]\n\u00a0\n mails to obscenity by any means other than prosecution of its sender; (b) whether Congress, if it can authorize exclusion of mail, can provide that obscenity be determined in the first instance in any forum except a court, and (c) whether, even if Congress could so authorize administrative censorship, it has in fact conferred upon postal authorities any power to exclude matter from the mails upon their determination of its obscene character.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nLower courts and judges have been troubled by these questions,\n3\n but this Court has not had occasion to decide them. At least question (c) is before us now.\n4\n It surpasses in general significance even the important issue of the standards for judging this material's \"mailability.\" Moreover, dealing with the case on this ground involves less constitutional difficulty than inheres in others. The conclusion that the Postmaster General is acting ultra vires because Congress has not granted the power which \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 499]\n\u00a0\n he here asserts, while greatly influenced by constitutional doubts, does not require a decision as to whether any establishment of administrative censorship could be constitutional. Hannegan v. Esquire, Inc., \n327 \nU.S. 146\n; Kent v. Dulles, \n357 \nU.S. 116\n.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nMr. Justice Holmes has said: \"The United States may give up the Post Office when it sees fit, but while it carries it on the use of the mails is almost as much a part of free speech as the right to use our tongues, and it would take very strong language to convince me that Congress ever intended to give such a practically despotic power to any one man.\" Milwaukee Publishing Co. v. Burleson, \n255 \nU.S. 407, 437\n (dissenting opinion). \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 500]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhether Congress, by its enactment or amendment of 18 U.S.C. 1461 (a part of the Criminal Code), has authorized the Postmaster General to censor obscenity, is our precise question. The Government relies upon no other provision to support the constitutionally questionable power of administrative censorship of this material. That power is inferred from the declaration that every item proscribed in 1461 is \"nonmailable matter and shall not be conveyed in the mails or delivered from any post office or by any letter carrier.\" Even granting that these words on their face permit a construction allowing the Post Office the power it asserts, their use in a criminal statute, their legislative history, and the contrast with the words and history of other provisions dealing with similar problems, raise the most serious doubt that so important and sensitive a power was granted by so perfunctory a provision. The area of obscenity is honeycombed with hazards for First Amendment guaranties, and the grave constitutional questions which would be raised by the grant of such a power should not be decided when the relevant materials are so ambiguous as to whether any such grant exists.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nThe origin of 1461 is briefly told.\n6\n It was the tag end of a bill drawn in 1865 to meet Post Office requests \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 501]\n\u00a0\n for various administrative changes. Its first version read:\n\n\"That no obscene book, pamphlet, picture, print, or other publication of a vulgar and indecent character, shall be admitted into the mails of the United States; but all such obscene publications deposited in or received at any post office, or discovered in the mails, shall be seized and destroyed, or otherwise disposed of, as the Postmaster General shall direct. And any person or persons who shall deposit or cause to be deposited in any post office or branch post office of the United States, for mailing or for delivery, an obscene book, pamphlet, picture, print, or other publication, knowing the same to be of a vulgar and indecent character, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, being duly convicted thereof, shall, for every such offense, be fined not more than $500, or imprisoned not more than one year, or both, according to the circumstances and aggravations of the offense.\"\n\n\n In offering this proposal, Chairman Collamer of the Senate Post Office Committee took pains to point out that it \"may be liable to some objection. . . . I am not perhaps entirely satisfied with it,\" and Senator Reverdy \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 502]\n\u00a0\n Johnson, concerned about postmasters breaking seals, immediately took up Chairman Collamer's suggestion that only the penal provision be adopted. Chairman Collamer, agreeing that the nonpenal clause \"might be made a precedent for undertaking to give [a postmaster] a sort of censorship over the mails,\" said he would be as happy if it were dropped. Senator Johnson then moved to strike it: \"[I]t would be establishing a very bad precedent to give authority to postmasters to take anything out of the mail.\" He acknowledged that much material is sent uncovered, but thought the penal provision sufficient to meet the evil. However, Senator Sherman observed:\n\n\"I would much prefer, if the Senator would be satisfied, with simply striking out the second clause of the first [sentence]. I think the prohibition against publications of this character going into the mails ought to stand. We are well aware that many of these publications are sent all over the country from the city of New York with the names of the parties sending them on the backs, so that the postmasters without opening the mail matter may know that it is offensive matter, indecent and improper to be carried in the public mails. I think, therefore, the legislative prohibition against carrying such matter when it is known to the postmasters should be left. Probably the second clause allowing him to open mail matter should be struck out . . . .\"\n\n\n Senator Johnson acquiesced and the bill was then passed, reading:\n\n\"That no obscene book, pamphlet, picture, print, or other publication of a vulgar and indecent character, shall be admitted into the mails of the United States; any person or persons . . . .\" Cong. Globe, 38th Cong., 2d Sess. 660-661 (1865); 13 Stat. 507. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 503]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n There are two possible constructions of 1461 on the basis of this brief Senate discussion. One possibility is that short of breaking seals,\n7\n the postmasters could remove matter which they thought from its face or the name of its sender to be obscene. The second construction is that postmasters could remove matter but only to turn it over to the appropriate authorities as the proposed subject of a criminal prosecution - and also of course after that material had been determined, in a criminal trial of its sender, to be obscene. Support for this second construction is found not only in the brief 1865 Senate consideration itself but also in an 1888 statute amending 1461, and enacting a section banning material with obscene matter on its face and - unlike 1461 - explicitly providing that it \"shall be withdrawn from the mails under such regulations as the Postmaster-General shall prescribe.\"\n8\n\u00a0\n\nThe 1865 Senate discussion is not unambiguous, but I cannot suppose that Senator Johnson - who had already noted his awareness that much obscene material was discoverable without breaking seals, and even so, his determined opposition to its being stopped - would have accepted Senator Sherman's suggestion had he understood it to mean more than that the Post Office could stop obviously questionable matter for the purpose of transmitting it to prosecuting authorities, could stop matter already held obscene if it were sent again, and could investigate matter sent by persons previously convicted and, if the matter were found violative, could present it to the prosecuting authorities. I believe this is the correct \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 504]\n\u00a0\n construction of the 1865 enactment. But at least it is arguably correct, and necessary if we are to avoid the section's probable constitutional infirmity\n9\n (see Near v. Minnesota, \n283 \nU.S. 697\n; Summerfield v. Sunshine Book Co., 95 U.S. App. D.C. 169, 221 F.2d 42) if construed as a provision allowing the Postmaster General to exclude all matter sent by a person who had previously sent violative matter. Such an exclusion by attaint could not be justified by the \"hoary dogma . . . that the use of the mails is a privilege on which the Government may impose such conditions as it chooses, [for that] has long since evaporated.\" Roth v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 476, 504\n (dissenting opinion); Hannegan v. Esquire, Inc., \n327 \nU.S., at 156\n; Speiser v. Randall, \n357 \nU.S. 513, 518\n.\n\nSubsequent developments concerning the removal of matter from the mails reveal a nearly contemporaneous strong distaste for and awareness of constitutional doubts about nonjudicial censorship, such as reflects meaningfully on the ambiguity surrounding 1461's enactment. That ambiguity has persisted throughout 1461's history of amendment, reconsideration, and codification. In the concurrent history of Congress' handling of related problems, there has been in each instance either a clear grant of power to the Postmaster General or, for matters as inextricably intertwined with the First Amendment as obscenity, a provision for judicial rather than administrative process. Nothing is found to suggest that one should resolve the ambiguity in 1865 to find a grant of the power of administrative censorship. Compare Lewis Publishing Co. v. Morgan, \n229 \nU.S. 288, 311\n.\n\nIn 1868, in considering a provision making it unlawful to deposit letters or circulars concerning lotteries, House Conferees struck a Senate proposal which would have \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 505]\n\u00a0\n authorized postmasters to remove from the mail and deposit in dead letter offices any letters or circulars thought to concern lotteries. House Postal Committee Chairman Farnsworth explained \"We thought that was a dangerous power to confer upon postmasters, and therefore we have stricken it out. That section provides that it shall be unlawful to deposit in the mails . . . which we thought would be a wise provision. But we thought it would not be wise to give postmasters this extraordinary power to be exercised upon a mere suspicion.\" Cong. Globe, 40th Cong., 2d Sess. 4412 (1868). Opinions of the Attorney General advising as to the postmasters' authority under this lottery provision emphasized the necessity for explicit legislative authorization to warrant removal of material from the mails. Those opinions cited examples of provisions containing such express authorization but, significantly, did not include 1461 - an important omission in the light of the observation of the Attorney General that aside from the examples he gave \"[i]f there are other provisions permitting a detention of letters by a postmaster, they have escaped my attention. It is believed that, at least, there are no others affecting the subject of the present inquiry.\" Furthermore, in describing the authorizations he did find, the Attorney General said: \"It will be seen that none of these authorize what can properly be called a `seizure' of any suspected letters by a postmaster, because, probably, he is not deemed the proper functionary to bring to trial and punishment those violating the postal laws.\"\n10\n\u00a0\n\nIn 1872, 1461 was amended as part of a codification of postal legislation. The amendment added a proscription against the mailing of \"any letter upon the envelope of which, or postal card upon which scurrilous epithets \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 506]\n\u00a0\n may have been written or printed, or disloyal devices printed or engraved . . . .\" 17 Stat. 302.\n11\n The section was further revised when the Comstock Law was enacted in 1873. 17 Stat. 598. That statute established penalties for dealing in or in any way publishing obscenity or any article of an immoral nature in areas under federal jurisdiction, expanded the list of items not to be mailed to include matter intended to aid the procuring of abortion, and banned the importation of all such items. When the bill came to the floor, Senator Casserly objected to the provision allowing customs officers to seize prohibited items: \"I do not know whether it can be left to officers of the custom-house to determine with safety what kind of literature or what sort of matter is to be admitted.\" Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 3d Sess. 1436 (1873). The bill was accordingly changed to authorize customs officers simply to detain the items, and then proceed in a federal court to condemn them, if the federal judge were satisfied that they must be condemned. Id., at 1525. There is no suggestion that customs officers were thought to be less trustworthy than postal officers;\n12\n this insistence upon judicial proceedings shows plainly the congressional aversion to administrative censorship.\n\nThe Comstock bill received but scant and hasty consideration.\n13\n As passed, its language was susceptible of a reading which would fail to penalize the mailing of \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 507]\n\u00a0\n obscene or indecent literature, and reach only actual abortifacients. Closing this inadvertent gap was the sole purpose\n14\n of an 1876 amendment, 19 Stat. 90, which made several language changes; among them, the substitution of the words of which the Government makes so much - \"declared to be non-mailable matter, [which] shall not be conveyed in the mails, nor delivered from any post-office nor by any letter-carrier\" - for the more cursory \"[which] shall [not] be carried in the mail.\" Moreover, the 1876 discussion evinces the understanding that the only obscene materials removable by the Post Office were those which were to be submitted as, or which already had been, the subject of a criminal prosecution. The manager of the amendment assured the House: \"Nor, sir, does this bill give any right to any postmaster to open or to interfere with anybody's mail. It is like anything else, before you can convict, you must offer and make proof.\" During the debate a different speaker said: \"Whenever a jury in any locality in the country shall find that a paper contains matter which may be devoted to a purpose which they deem immoral - not only indecent, but immoral - the jury may convict the man who sends \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 508]\n\u00a0\n the paper or the man who receives it by mail, and the postmaster is authorized to exclude that newspaper from the mail.\" A third speaker, in urging that the word \"scurrilous\" be removed, warned: \"I do not object to the purification of the mails, but I would like the committee when they reconsider this bill not to go too far in giving postmasters discretion.\" Another Congressman feared that the severity of the penalties would make the law a dead letter, because judges and juries would be unwilling to convict. Thus the tenor of the entire debate reflected the premise that 1461 had only a criminal application. No one suggested that it also authorized administrative censorship. 4 Cong. Rec. 695-696.\n15\n And see 8 Cong. Rec. 697 (1879). \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 509]\n\u00a0\n\n\nEspecially significant in pointing up the purely penal application of 1461 are the legislative events of 1888. An amendment of but a few months' duration changed the law on such postal crimes as counterfeiting money orders. It included a provision penalizing the mailing of any matter upon the envelope or outside cover of which was indecent, scurrilous, threatening, etc., language.\n16\n The provision was promptly amended in the same session because \"there was a suspicion that an implied power was given to postmasters to open letters. Of course there was no such intention, and this [new] bill eliminates that objectionable feature . . . .\" 19 Cong. Rec. 8189.\n17\n\u00a0\n\nBut even more significantly, the new enactment transferred to a new section, 1463, 25 Stat. 496, the ban of 1461 which, in the 1876 version (19 Stat. 90), had reached \"every letter upon the envelope of which, or postal card upon which, indecent, lewd, obscene, or lascivious delineations, epithets, terms, or language may be written or printed\"; and 1463, instead of merely \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 510]\n\u00a0\n declaring that the listed matter was nonmailable and was not to be conveyed or delivered, provided that those items \"shall be withdrawn from the mails under such regulations as the Postmaster-General shall prescribe . . . .\" It is strange, I think, that 1461 - amended at the same time as 1463 was enacted - was not amended also to include an explicit provision for withdrawal from the mails, if authority for withdrawal had been Congress' intention. But Congress did not contemplate any general administrative censorship of obscenity. The House discussion expressed the agreement that besides the power to punish, there should be no more than the most limited Post Office power to stop mail - and 1463 states that limitation; and the Senate debate, focusing almost entirely upon how severe the penalties should be, reinforced the restrictions upon the postmasters and underlined that 1461 is exclusively penal. See 19 Cong. Rec. 7660-7662, 8189.\n\nThe last congressional dealing with 1461 which is pertinent to our inquiry occurred in 1909, when again that section was amended, this time to bar more abortifacients and \"every letter, packet, or package, or other mail matter containing any filthy, vile, or indecent thing.\"\n18\n Though committee reports are unenlightening, the House discussion makes plain that the changes were intended to reverse the limitations stated in Swearingen v. United States, \n161 \nU.S. 446\n, that the statute applied only to \"that form of immorality which has relation to sexual impurity,\" and that its words had \"the same meaning as is given them at common law in prosecutions for obscene libel.\" \n161 \nU.S., at 451\n; 42 Cong. Rec. 995-999, 43 Cong. Rec. 283-284.\n19\n The two brief House discussions suggest that there were members who did believe that \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 511]\n\u00a0\n the Post Office had some power to remove obscene mail, even apart from presenting it for criminal prosecution; it was analogized to fraudulent matter. But nothing characterizes the discussion so much as its ambiguity, and its concern lest the Post Office acquire powers whose exercise would amount to censorship. See 42 Cong. Rec. 995-998. And see 101 Cong. Rec. 3804, 7798, 8241-8242 (1955).\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nSection 1463 is not the only statute which goes further than 1461 towards authorizing Post Office censorship. Five other criminal statutes prohibiting the introduction of various matter into the mails either contain within themselves or have direct counterparts in the postal laws which contain explicit authorizations to the Postmaster General to remove or return such matter.\n20\n In sharp \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 512]\n\u00a0\n contrast, 1461 - itself silent as to sanctions except for the provision of criminal penalties - has no counterpart in the postal laws. It is mentioned once in the recodification of 1960 - in 4001 (a), a section collecting the various provisions designating matter as nonmailable and which, the Committee Report indicates and the floor discussion and reviser's note assure, was not intended to change existing law\n21\n - ambiguous throughout.\n\nThe removal of obscene material has not been the Post Office's only weapon against it. In 1950, 4006 was enacted granting special powers over the mail of any person found, to the Postmaster General's satisfaction, to be using the mails to obtain money for or to be providing information about any obscene or vile article or thing: Postmasters could mark mail sent to that person \"unlawful\" and return it to its sender; and they could forbid payment to that person of any money orders or postal notes, and return the funds to the senders.\n22\n The clarity of the grant of these powers is no less noteworthy than their subsequent history. In 1956 the Postmaster General sought\n23\n and obtained the power to enter an order, pending the administrative proceeding to determine whether 4006 should be invoked, under which all mail \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 513]\n\u00a0\n addressed to the respondent could be impounded. The order was to expire at the end of 20 days unless the Postmaster General sought, in a Federal District Court, an order continuing the impounding. The 20-day order by the Postmaster General, and its extension by a court, were to issue only if \"necessary to the effective enforcement of [ 4006].\"\n24\n In 1959, extensive hearings were held in the House on the Post Office's request that the 20-day period be extended to 45 days, and that the standard of necessity be changed to \"public interest.\"\n25\n Instead, what was enacted in 1960 stripped the Postmaster General of his power to issue an interim order for any period, and directed him to seek a temporary restraining order in a Federal District Court.\n26\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 514]\n\u00a0\n\n\nCongress gave full consideration to censorship of obscene material when it dealt with the Tariff Act of 1930. Prior to that year, the customs laws provided for the exclusion from the United States of obscene written matter, but required resort in the first instance to a Federal District Court for a determination of the matter's obscenity.\n27\n In the course of their work on the bill, the House Ways and Means Committee added language to exclude seditious as well as obscene material, and also replaced the judicial procedure with the generally applicable procedures for seizure by the customs officers, entailing judicial review only at the instance of a would-be importer. See H. R. Rep. No. 7, 71st Cong., 1st Sess., at 160, 185, 190, 244-245. It was in this form that the bill passed the House, and was reported by the Senate Committee, see S. Rep. No. 37, 71st Cong., 1st Sess. 60; 71 Cong. Rec. 4458 (remarks of Senator Smoot), but on the Senate floor it ran into strong expressions against customs censorship: fears about administrative determinations were enhanced by felt difficulties in applying the \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 515]\n\u00a0\n statute's proscriptions to particular material. Judicial review was though insufficient, for that would leave the initiative for resort to the courts with the person subjected to the censorship: expense, inconvenience, and public embarrassment would, it was believed, result in unreviewed administrative exclusion. See generally 71 Cong. Rec. 4432-4439; 4445-4471. In support of the idea that the initial decision should be made by a court rather than a customs inspector, 72 Cong. Rec. 5417-5423, Senator Walsh of Montana said:\n\n\"Everybody of right mind wants to prevent the circulation of such books as the Senator from Utah has in mind. That is not the point at all. Those immoral and obscene and indecent publications are printed in this country, as well as abroad. . . . How do we reach the situation? We make it a crime to circulate those books in this country, and we punish that offense the same as we punish every other offense, by proper prosecution. Likewise, we prohibit the circulation of material of that kind in the mails, and if anybody circulates it in the mails he becomes liable to indictment and prosecution. That is the way we endeavor to deal with that thing.\" 72 Cong. Rec. 5419. See also id., at 5425, 5430. But compare the remarks of Senators Copeland, Cutting, and Fletcher, 71 Cong. Rec., at 4435, 4450.\n\n\n He then offered an amendment to impose criminal sanctions for importing proscribed matter, and to require the matter's detention by the customs for transmittal to the appropriate authorities to commence judicial forfeiture proceedings. Id., at 5421. However, there were misgivings about the criminal sanction; it was thought by some to jeopardize borderline activity too seriously. Id., at 5423-5431. The Senate passed a provision corresponding to Senator Walsh's amendment, but without \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 516]\n\u00a0\n a criminal sanction, 72 Cong. Rec. 5501-5520, and this was enacted into law. Thus the House Committee's attempt to revert from judicial to administrative determinations in the initial phase of customs censorship was emphatically rebuffed.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nIt is clear that the Post Office has long practiced administrative censorship of allegedly obscene mailings generally. However, the formal regulations prescribing a procedure are new.\n28\n The practice was described in 1952 by the Solicitor of the Department when testifying before a congressional committee:\n\n\"[W]e have an informal procedure, which, so far, hasn't been considered or tested out in the court, so we have gotten by with it so far. That is where a postmaster finds obscene matter at the point of entry of the mail into the post office, and if he is in doubt as to whether it is good or bad he will send it to the Solicitor's office for a ruling. . . .\"\n\n\n He also said:\n\n \"If we had to hold hearings on all of those, if any court should ever decide that those hearings also come under the Administrative Procedure Act, we are just hopelessly sunk, that is all; we are just lost.\n\n\n \"They may, but they have never taken us into court on it. We just hope that we get by with it as long as we can.\"\n29\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 517]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n And:\n\n\"[S]ometimes you can get five people together, and you can give them five pieces of mail, and ask them to mark them, and you will get five different results, because in some cases it is just one of those things that depends on your own personal ideas and your own bringing up; it depends upon how strongly you feel about things, and there are some types of that material that you just can't get two people to agree on no matter how reasonably and how objectively they look upon it. It is just an honest difference of opinion. We experience it all the time, so we have our conferences, and we decide what is going to be the best thing to do. . . .\n\n\n .  .  .  . .\n\n\n \"We have no trouble with prosecutions on things that are definitely obscene, but it is this material that is this way and that way that is very, very difficult to prosecute.\" Hearings before the Select Committee on Current Pornographic Materials, House of Representatives, on Investigation of Literature Allegedly Containing Objectionable Material, 82d Cong., 2d Sess. 281, 282 (1952).\n\n\n It also is clear that this was not the first or last occasion on which Post Office practice has been brought to the attention of a congressional committee.\n30\n But the report \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 518]\n\u00a0\n of the 1952 Select Committee, which listed 1461 as a criminal statute, certainly did not dispel the continuing ambiguity surrounding that section. And the report said:\n\n\"There are other means of handling this problem than by the ban of the censor, means which can be applied without danger of infringing on the freedom of the press . . . .\"\n31\n\u00a0\n\n\n But, in any event, testimony before committees, committee reports, and administrative usurpation, do not, either singly or collectively, suffice to establish authorization.\n\n\nIV.\n\n\n\nWe have sustained the criminal sanctions of 1461 against a challenge of unconstitutionality under the First Amendment. Roth v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 476\n. We have emphasized, however, that the necessity for safeguarding First Amendment protections for nonobscene materials means that Government \"is not free to adopt whatever procedures it pleases for dealing with obscenity . . . without regard to the possible consequences for constitutionally protected speech.\" Marcus v. Search Warrant, \n367 \nU.S. 717, 731\n. I imply no doubt that \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 519]\n\u00a0\n Congress could constitutionally authorize a noncriminal process in the nature of a judicial proceeding under closely defined procedural safeguards. But the suggestion that Congress may constitutionally authorize any process other than a fully judicial one immediately raises the gravest doubts. However, it is enough to dispose of this case that Congress has not, in 1461, authorized the Postmaster General to employ any process of his own to close the mails to matter which, in his view, falls within the ban of that section. \"The provisions . . . would have to be far more explicit for us to assume that Congress made such a radical departure from our traditions and undertook to clothe the Postmaster General with the power to supervise the tastes of the reading public of the country.\" Hannegan v. Esquire, Inc., \n327 \nU.S., at 156\n. I, therefore, concur in the judgment of reversal.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] One, Inc., v. Olesen, \n355 \nU.S. 371\n, and Sunshine Book Co. v. Summerfield, \n355 \nU.S. 372\n, were decided summarily without argument.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] There would also be the question, if (a), (b) and (c) were answered affirmatively, of the validity of the particular procedures that the Post Office has employed.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See, e. g., Grove Press, Inc., v. Christenberry, 175 F. Supp. 488, 495, and 276 F.2d 433, 435; Sunshine Book Co. v. Summerfield, 101 U.S. App. D.C. 358, 364-367, 249 F.2d 114, 120-123 (dissenting opinion), reversed, see supra, n. 1. And cf. Roth v. Goldman, 172 F.2d 788, 794-795 (concurring opinion). Compare Stanard v. Olesen, 74 S. Ct. 768 (opinion of MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS), Olesen v. Stanard, 227 F.2d 785; Summerfield v. Sunshine Book Co., 95 U.S. App. D.C. 169, 221 F.2d 42.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The Government argues that petitioners \"complain generally of `an unconstitutional prior restraint,'. . . without specifying [where] the asserted vice lies . . . .\" Insofar as petitioners challenge the constitutionality of 1461 if read to impose civil restraints, their suit would be within the requirements for convening a three-judge court under 28 U.S.C. 2282, and therefore that claim is not here. But insofar as their attack is grounded upon a claim that 1461 is not to be construed as granting censorial power to the Post Office, 2282 does not apply.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] My Brother HARLAN states that no question is raised as to the Post Office Department's general authority under 18 U.S.C. 1461 to withhold obscene matter from the mails. The Government asserts only that at the administrative level the petitioners made no objection to the procedure. The Government does not suggest that the challenge to the Post Office's power to act at all had to be made before the administrative body. That challenge presents a jurisdictional question and is open to the petitioners even if not initially asserted in the agency proceeding. See United States v. L. A. Tucker Truck Lines, Inc., \n344 \nU.S. 33, 38\n. And although perhaps not artfully, the petitioners did challenge the authority of the Post Office in the District Court. In their motion for summary judgment petitioners stated: \"[P]laintiffs argue that the entire civil procedure followed by the Post Office based upon a criminal statute raises doubts of constitutionality. The fragile foundation on which the Post Office action rests must be kept in mind, both in dealing with the substantive obscenity question involved and in determining the proper scope of judicial review. . . . There is lacking here the kind of specific legislative direction to the administrative agency that in certain circumstances justifies judicial deference to administrative determinations.\" The Court of Appeals did not discuss the issue, perhaps because it had held in Sunshine Book Co. v. Summerfield, supra, n. 3, that the questioned authority exists; the Government does not suggest that petitioners failed to make their argument there. And in this Court, petitioners continue their attack and the Government, without reservation, fully defends against it.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] There is no need to consider here the history before 1865, which was highlighted by the rejection by Congress in 1836, largely on constitutional grounds, of President Jackson's request for legislation to suppress mail distribution of \"incendiary\" abolitionist literature. See Rogers, The Postal Power of Congress (1916); Deutsch, Freedom of the Press and of the Mails, 36 Mich. L. Rev. 703 (1938). The 1865 Senate debates referred to such action as the kind for which power should be withheld. Cong. Globe, 38th Cong., 2d Sess. 661 (1865). The Post Office occasionally seized allegedly treasonable \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 501]\n\u00a0\n newspapers despite its lack of authority. See H. R. Rep. No. 51, 37th Cong., 3d Sess., pp. 3, 10 (1863).\n\nThe only noncriminal procedure authorized against obscene material before 1865 was a judicial proceeding for imported material's forfeiture. 5 Stat. 566; see United States v. Three Cases of Toys, 28 Fed. Cas. 112, No. 16,499; Anonymous, 1 Fed. Cas. 1024, No. 470. For a comprehensive discussion of the history and practice of censorship in the Post Office and Bureau of Customs, see Paul and Schwartz, Federal Censorship: Obscenity in the Mail (1961), and Paul, The Post Office and Non-Mailability of Obscenity: An Historical Note, 8 U. C. L. A. L. Rev. 44 (1961).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Congress in 1865 was undoubtedly against any power in the Post Office to break seals (see Cong. Globe, 38th Cong., 2d Sess. 660-661), and 23 years later made this explicit as to first class mail. 25 Stat. 496-497. But even that was a prohibition \"out of abundant caution\" and was not intended to imply any power to open mail of other classes. See 19 Cong. Rec. 8189 (1888).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] 25 Stat. 496, now 18 U.S.C. 1463.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] See Milwaukee Publishing Co. v. Burleson, \n255 \nU.S. 407, 423\n, 429-430 (Brandeis, J., dissenting).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] 16 Op. Atty. Gen. 5, 6 (1878); 12 id., 538 (1868); and see 12 id., 399, 401 (1868).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] There was also a provision that any material \"which may be seized or detained for violation of law shall be returned to the owner or sender of the same, or otherwise disposed of as the Postmaster-General may direct,\" 17 Stat. 323, but that only states what may be done with material which may be seized or detained, and our question is whether obscene material - except in the narrow circumstances already described - may be seized or detained at all. Compare pp. 511-512, infra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] But see Casserly's second statement, id., at 1436, which was a misunderstanding of the bill.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] See Paul, supra, n. 6, at 51-57.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] The bill's manager in the House said: \"[T]he proposed bill in no wise changes the law as it now is except to provide a penalty for the circulation of obscene literature. By an oversight in drafting the original section the penalty applies only to the disposition of articles circulated or sold for the purpose of procuring abortion or preventing conception. Already this obscene class of matter spoken of in the other portion of the section is prohibited from passing through the mails, but no penalty is provided. . . . [I]t in no way changes the section as it now is. It makes nothing non-mailable that is not now non-mailable. It merely provides a penalty. . . .\" 4 Cong.

Rec. 4261-4264.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] Discussion in the Senate included the first reference to the problem of standards of obscenity - it was hardly such as to afford guidelines for administrative action:\n\n\"Mr. MORTON. Mr. President, in prohibiting the transmission of any matter through the mails there ought to be great care used and it ought to be particularly described and defined. All of that which is described in the beginning of the first section of this bill is eminently proper to prohibit from being transmitted through the mails; but there is a part of that section that I think is vague and susceptible of abuse. It prohibits the transmission through the mail of `every article or thing intended or adapted for any indecent or immoral use.' What is an `immoral use?' That question may be subject to very different opinions. The word `obscene' is well defined; we can understand what that means; but when you prohibit everything that is for an immoral use, there would be wide differences of opinion on that point.\n\n\n\"Mr. CONKLING. The same words are in the law now.\n\n\n\"Mr. MORTON. That may be. I remember a time when certain newspapers and pamphlets were prohibited from going through the mails in certain States, because they were held to be of an immoral and seditious character - of `an incendiary character,' as my friend from Ohio [Mr. SHERMAN] suggests. Public opinion has changed upon that point. But when we come to prohibit the transmission of any matter through the mails, we ought to understand pretty well what it is. There are many things that a portion of our people would consider \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 509]\n\u00a0\n immoral that other portions would consider entirely moral. Some people might consider a pack of cards highly immoral; others might think they were entirely proper. Many other things might be enumerated.\" 4 Cong.

Such power is directly contrary to the letter and spirit of normal due process, as exemplified by the Administrative Procedure Act, which requires a hearing before any penalty may be imposed. The Post Office Department has made its case for this legislation on the grounds that a temporary and summary procedure is required to deal with fly-by-night operators using the mails to defraud or to peddle pornography, who may go out of business - or change the name of their business or their business address - before normal legal procedures can be brought into operation. The Post Office Department has not recommended, nor does this committee approve, the use of the temporary impounding procedure under this bill as a substitute for the normal practice of an advance hearing or the bringing of an indictment \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 514]\n\u00a0\n for violation of the criminal code in all cases involving legitimate and well-established business operations.

JUSTICE CLARK, dissenting.\n\nWhile those in the majority like ancient Gaul are split into three parts, the ultimate holding of the Court today, despite the clear congressional mandate found in 1461, requires the United States Post Office to be the world's largest disseminator of smut and Grand Informer of the names and places where obscene material may be obtained. The Judicial Officer of the Post Office Department, the District Court, and the Court of Appeals have all found the magazines in issue to be nonmailable on the alternative grounds that they are obscene and that they contain information on where obscene material may be obtained. The Court, however, says that these magazines must go through the mails. Brother HARLAN, writing for himself and Brother STEWART, finds that the magazines themselves are unobjectionable because 1461 is not so narrowly drawn as to prohibit the mailing of material \"that incites immoral sexual conduct,\" and that the presence of information leading to obscene material does not taint \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 520]\n\u00a0\n the magazines because their publishers were unaware of the true nature of this information. Brother BRENNAN, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Brother DOUGLAS, finds that 1461 does not authorize the Postmaster General through administrative process to close the mails to matter included within its proscriptions. Since in my view the Postmaster General is required by 1461 to reject nonmailable matter, I would affirm the judgment on the sole ground that the magazines contain information as to where obscene material can be obtained and thus are nonmailable. I, therefore, do not consider the question of whether the magazines as such are obscene.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nThe procedures followed below can be described briefly. Petitioners deposited in the Post Office in Alexandria, Virginia, six parcels containing 405 copies of three magazines which they published. The parcels were directed to petitioners' agent in Chicago and marked as second class matter. Being unsealed and subject to inspection,\n1\n the Postmaster noticed that the material appeared to be obscene. Under the regulations of the Post Office Department in effect since 1902, the Alexandria Postmaster notified the General Counsel of the Post Office Department in Washington and submitted samples of the material; the General Counsel determined the magazines to be nonmailable under 1461 and notified petitioners' president. Petitioners sought injunctive relief against the Department in the District Court on the grounds that the magazines did not violate 1461 and the procedure used amounted to an unconstitutional \"ex parte administrative prior restraint,\" but the suit was dismissed for determination of the issue at an administrative hearing provided for by the Department's regulations. After a full \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 521]\n\u00a0\n hearing, at which petitioners did not dispute the congressional authorization to reject the six parcels for second class mailings, the Judicial Officer declared the material nonmailable. Petitioners contested this finding by judicial review in the District Court, where the action of the Judicial Officer was upheld.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, as I have indicated, has reached the conclusion that when the Congress originally passed the Act in question some 97 years ago it granted no power to the Post Office to refuse to receive and carry matter declared by the Act to be nonmailable. Since this point was neither presented below nor argued here, I do not believe it to be properly before us. Brother BRENNAN, however, rests his concurring opinion on it and for that reason I shall discuss the issue.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nSection 1461 explicitly provides that:\n\n\"Every obscene, lewd, lascivious, indecent, filthy or vile article, matter, thing, device, or substance; and . . . [e]very written or printed card, letter, circular, book, pamphlet, advertisement, or notice of any kind giving information, directly or indirectly, where, or how, or from whom, or by what means any of such mentioned matters, articles, or things may be obtained . . . [i]s declared to be nonmailable matter and shall not be conveyed in the mails or delivered from any post office or by any letter carrier.\" (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n Its genesis was in Section 16 of the Act of March 3, 1865, 13 Stat. 507, which when reported in the Senate had two parts:\n\n\"[N]o obscene book, pamphlet, picture, print, or other publication of a vulgar and indecent character, shall be admitted into the mails of the United States; \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 522]\n\u00a0\n but all such obscene publications deposited in or received at any post office, or discovered in the mails, shall be seized and destroyed, or otherwise disposed of, as the Postmaster General shall direct.\"\n\n\n\"[A]ny person or persons who shall deposit or cause to be deposited in any post office or branch post office of the United States, for mailing or for delivery, an obscene book, pamphlet, picture, print, or other publication, knowing the same to be of a vulgar and indecent character, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor . . . .\" Cong. Globe, 38th Cong., 2d Sess. 661.\n\n\n The sponsor of the bill advised the Senate that it had a twofold effect: \"The first part of it provides that if such [obscene] publications are in the mails the postmasters may take them out; and the latter part provides a penalty and a punishment for those who put them into the mails.\" This explanation of the sponsor seems enough to undermine Brother BRENNAN'S contention, but there is even more. Senator Johnson of Maryland apparently feared that obscene matter might be mailed in sealed envelopes and that \"the postmaster . . . will break the seal.\" He moved to strike out the first part of the bill. Senator Sherman, however, objected, saying that \"the legislative prohibition against carrying such matter when it is known to the postmasters should be left. Probably the second clause allowing him to open mail matter should be struck out.\" Ibid. (Emphasis supplied.) Senator Johnson acquiesced in this suggestion, and thus the bill as finally passed clearly permitted postmasters to refuse matters which were known by them to be obscene, so long as seals were not broken.\n3\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 523]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe 1873 postal regulations reflected this power to exclude obscene matter from the mails,\n4\n as have all succeeding ones, e. g., Postal Laws and Regulations (1893 ed.) 335. In 1876 the Act was amended to substantially its present form. 19 Stat. 90. It not only declared certain material \"to be non-mailable matter\" but added that such \"shall not be conveyed in the mails, nor delivered from any post-office nor by any letter-carrier.\" A single comment by the bill's sponsor in the House reflects the understanding that this section, both before and after amendment, authorized exclusion:\n\n\"[T]he proposed bill in no wise changes the law as it now is except to provide a penalty for the circulation of obscene literature. By an oversight in drafting the original section the penalty applies only to the disposition of articles circulated or sold for the purpose of procuring abortion or preventing conception. Already this obscene class of matter spoken of in the other portion of the section is prohibited from passing through the mails, but no penalty is provided. . . . [I]t in no way changes the section as it now is. It makes nothing non-mailable that is not now non-mailable. It merely provides a penalty. . . .\" 4 Cong. Rec. 695 (1876). (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n Regulations establishing the procedure now used by the Department to determine questions of mailability were adopted in 1902. And in 1960 in a recodification the Congress included 1461 within its collection of provisions which designate matter as nonmailable. 39 U.S.C. (Supp. II) 4001 (a). \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 524]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn light of the language of the statutes, the legislative history, the subsequent recodification and the consistent history of administrative interpretation, it stretches my imagination to understand how one could conclude that Congress did not authorize the Post Office Department to exclude nonmailable material. As Justice Brandeis said in Milwaukee Publishing Co. v. Burleson, \n255 \nU.S. 407, 418\n, 421 (1921) (dissenting opinion):\n\n\"The scope of the Postmaster General's alleged authority is confessedly the same whether the reason for the nonmailable quality of the matter inserted in a newspaper is that it violates the Espionage Act, or the copyright laws, or that it is part of a scheme to defraud, or concerns lotteries, or is indecent, or is in any other respect matter which Congress has declared shall not be admitted to the mails.\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n\"As a matter of administration the Postmaster General, through his subordinates, rejects matter offered for mailing, or removes matter already in the mail, which in his judgment is unmailable. The existence in the Postmaster General of the power to do this cannot be doubted. The only question which can arise is whether in the individual case the power has been illegally exercised.\"\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nLet us now turn to the opinion of Brother HARLAN and first take up the question whether magazines which indisputably contain information on where obscene material may be obtained can be considered nonmailable apart from the sender's scienter. Giving regard to the wording of 1461, the interests involved, and the nature of the sanction imposed, I fail to see how the sender's scienter is anywise material to a determination of nonmailability. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 525]\n\u00a0\n Section 1461 very explicitly demands that no information \"be conveyed in the mails or delivered from any post office or by any letter carrier\" if it in fact tells how obscene material can be obtained. This command running to those charged with the administration of the postal system is not conditioned by the words of the statute upon the sender's scienter or any remotely similar consideration. When it wants to inject a scienter requirement, the Congress well knows the words to use, as evidenced by the very next sentence in 1461 establishing the criminal sanctions: \"Whoever knowingly uses the mails for the mailing, carriage in the mails, or delivery of anything declared by this section to be nonmailable . . . shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both . . . .\" (Emphasis supplied.) Congress could not have made it more clear that the sender's knowledge of the material to be mailed did not determine its mailability but only his responsibility for mailing it. Nor is there any reason why Congress - in a civil action - should have wanted it any other way. The sender's knowledge of the matter sought to be mailed is immaterial to the harm caused to the public by its dissemination. Finally, interpreting 1461 to mean what it says would not give rise to the \"serious constitutional question\" envisioned. This fear is premised entirely on Smith v. California, \n361 \nU.S. 147\n (1959), which was a criminal case. Surely the prerequisites to criminal responsibility are quite different from the tests for the use of the mails. The present determination of nonmailability of bulk packages of magazines to newsstands rains no sanctions or incriminations upon the publishers of these magazines nor does it confiscate or impound the magazines. For these reasons, I believe the only possible interpretation of 1461 is that the sender's scienter is immaterial in determining the mailability of information on where obscene material can be obtained. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 526]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn passing, it might be noted that a requirement of scienter gives rise to some interesting problems. For instance: Is the sender's scienter permanently fixed at the time the material is first unsuccessfully offered for mailing, or is his scienter to be re-evaluated when the material is again offered for mailing? How are equitable principles such as \"clean hands\" and \"he who seeks equity must do equity\" squared in a proceeding to enjoin an administrative non-mailable order with an insistence on mailing material which has been shown to contain information leading to obscene material?\n\nHowever, assuming that the knowledge of the sender is material in determining the mailability of these magazines, I submit the undisputed facts and findings compel as a matter of law the conclusion that the petitioners knew that materials published in their magazines informed their readers where obscene matter might be obtained. To say the least, these facts and findings are such that this Court ought not to set itself up as a fact-finder but should remand the case for a determination by those who have been entrusted initially with this responsibility.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nThe content and direction of the magazines themselves are a tip-off as to the nature of the business of those who solicit through them. The magazines have no social, educational, or entertainment qualities but are designed solely as sex stimulants for homosexuals. They \"consist almost entirely of photographs of young men in nude or practically nude poses handled in such a manner as to focus attention on their genitals or buttocks or to emphasize \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 527]\n\u00a0\n these parts . . . .\" Because of this content the magazines do \"not appeal to the ordinary male adult, . . . [who] would have no interest in them and would not buy them under ordinary circumstances and . . . [therefore] the readers of these publications consist almost entirely of male homosexuals and possibly a few adolescent males . . . .\" The publishers freely admit that the magazines are published to appeal to the male homosexual group. The advertisements and photographer lists in such magazines were quite naturally \"designed so as to attract the male homosexual and to furnish him with names and addresses where nude male pictures in poses and conditions which would appeal to his prurient interest may be obtained.\" Moreover, the advertisements themselves could leave no more doubt in the publishers' minds than in those of the solicited purchasers. To illustrate: some captioned a picture of a nude or scantily attired young man with the legend \"perfectly proportioned, handsome, male models, age 18-26.\" Others featured a photograph of a nude male with the area around the privates obviously retouched so as to cover the genitals and part of the public hair and offered to furnish an \"original print of this photo.\" Finally, each magazine specifically endorsed its listed photographers and requested its readers to support them by purchasing their products. In addition, three of the four magazines involved expressly represented that they were familiar with the work of the photographers listed in their publications.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nTurning to Womack, the president and directing force of all three corporate publishers, it is even clearer that we are not dealing here with a \"Jack and Jill\" operation. Mr. Womack admitted that the magazines were planned for homosexuals, designed to appeal to and stimulate \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 528]\n\u00a0\n their erotic interests. To improve on this effect, he made suggestions to photographers as to the type of pictures he wanted. For example, he informed one of the studios listed in his publications that \"physique fans want their `truck driver types' already cleaned up, showered, and ready for bed . . . [and] it is absolutely essential that the models have pretty faces and a personality not totally unrelated to sex appeal.\" Womack had also suggested to the photographers that they exchange customer names with the hope of compiling a master list of homosexuals. He himself had been convicted of selling obscene photographs via the mails. Womack v. United States, 111 U.S. App. D.C. 8, 294 F.2d 204 (1961). More recently he has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to like charges. Washington Post, Feb. 1, 1962, p. D-3. Furthermore, he was warned in March, April, and July of 1959 that a number of his photographer advertisers were being prosecuted for mailing obscene matter and that he might be violating the law in transmitting through the mails their advertisements. However, he continued to disseminate such information through the mails, removing photographers from his lists only as they were convicted. Finally, through another controlled corporation not here involved, he filled orders for one of his advertisers sent in by the readers of his magazines. This material was found to be obscene and like all of the above facts and findings it is not contested here.\n\nThe corporate petitioners are chargeable with the knowledge of what they do, as well as the knowledge of their president and leader. How one can fail to see the obvious in this record is beyond my comprehension. In the words of Milton: \"O dark, dark, dark amid the blaze of noon.\" For one to conclude that the above undisputed facts and findings are insufficient to show the required scienter, however stringently it may be defined, is in effect \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 529]\n\u00a0\n to repeal the advertising provisions of 1461. To condition nonmailability on proof that the sender actually saw the material being sold by his advertisers is to portray the Congress as the \"mother\" in the jingle, \"Mother, may I go out to swim? Yes, my darling daughter. Hang your clothes on a hickory limb and don't go near the water.\"\n\nFor these reasons I would affirm the decision below.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 39 U.S.C. (Supp. II) 4058.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] I agree with the conclusion in that opinion that petitioners' constitutional claim cannot be considered here.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The magazines here involved were second class matter and thus were unsealed and subject to inspection. 39 U.S.C. (Supp. II) 4058.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] \"All books, pamphlets, circulars, prints, &c., of an obscene, vulgar, or indecent character . . . must be withdrawn from the mails by postmasters at either the office of mailing or the office of delivery.\" Postal Laws and Regulations (1873 ed.) 88. (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] If the express rejection by the Judicial Officer of petitioners' proposed finding that they had \"no personal knowledge of the material sold by the advertisers\" is taken as a finding to the contrary, then of course this is entitled to the deference accorded administrative findings, cf., e. g., Labor Board v. Walton Mfg. Co., \n369 \nU.S. 404\n (1962).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The magazines were offered in six bundles, apparently with copies of each of the four magazines intermingled among the bundles. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 478, 530]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","130":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMARAKAR v.

INTERLAKE CO.(1962)\nNo. 166\nArgued: April 16, 1962Decided: June 11, 1962\n\n\n\n\n The two petitioner labor unions represented marine engineers employed on the Great Lakes and elsewhere. Respondents owned and operated a fleet of bulk cargo vessels on the Great Lakes, and the marine engineers employed by them were not represented by any union. In a suit brought by respondents, a State Court enjoined peaceful picketing and other activities by the petitioner unions of a kind arguably prohibited by 8 (b) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, if the petitioner unions were \"labor organizations\" within the contemplation of 8 (b). Although it was shown from recent decisions of the National Labor Relations Board involving these unions that the Board was of the opinion that they were such \"labor organizations,\" the State Court held that they were not, on the ground that only \"supervisory\" personnel were involved in the dispute. Held: The dispute was arguably within the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board, and, therefore, the State Court was precluded from exercising jurisdiction. San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, \n359 \nU.S. 236\n. Pp. 174-185.\n\n (a) The principles of San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon confined the State Court to deciding only whether the evidence in this case was sufficient to show that either of the petitioner unions was arguably a \"labor organization\" within the contemplation of 8 (b). Pp. 177-182.\n\n\n (b) The evidence in this case, including recent decisions of the National Labor Relations Board, was sufficient to deprive the State Court of jurisdiction over this controversy. Pp. 182-183.\n\n\n (c) Evidence having been introduced to show that the petitioner unions were arguably \"labor organizations\" for the purposes of 8 (b), it was the duty of the State Court to defer to the Board's determination, in the absence of a showing that this position had been authoritatively rejected by the courts or abandoned by the Board. P. 184.\n\n\n 260 Minn. 1, 108 N. W. 2d 627, reversed. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 173, 174]\n\u00a0\n\n\nLee Pressman argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the briefs was Richard H. Markowitz.\n\nRaymond T. Jackson argued the cause for respondents. With him on the briefs was James P. Garner.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nIn San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, \n359 \nU.S. 236\n, this Court held that the proper administration of the federal labor law requires state courts to relinquish jurisdiction not only over those controversies actually found to be within the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board, but also over litigation arising from activities which might arguably be subject to that agency's cognizance. Only such a rule, the Court held, will preserve for the Labor Board its congressionally delegated function of deciding what is and what is not within its domain.\n1\n In the present case the Supreme Court of Minnesota held that the petitioners, Marine Engineers Beneficial Association (MEBA) and its Local 101, were not \"labor organizations\" within the meaning of 8 (b) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. 158 (b), and therefore not subject to the unfair labor practice provisions of that section of the statute. Accordingly, the court held that a state trial court had not erred in assuming jurisdiction over a labor dispute involving MEBA and Local 101, and in permanently enjoining them \n\n[370 \nU.S. 173, 175]\n\u00a0\n from picketing found to be in violation of state law. 260 Minn. 1, 108 N. W. 2d 627. We granted certiorari, \n368 \nU.S. 811\n, to consider an asserted conflict between the Minnesota court's decision and our holding in the Garmon case.\n\nThe essential facts which gave rise to this controversy are not in dispute. The respondents owned and operated a fleet of bulk cargo vessels on the Great Lakes. MEBA and Local 101 were unions which represented marine engineers employed on the Great Lakes and elsewhere.\n2\n The marine engineers employed by the respondents were not represented by MEBA or any other union.\n\nOn November 11, 1959, the respondents' vessel, Samuel Mather, arrived at the dock of the Carnegie Dock and Fuel Company in Duluth, Minnesota. The following morning several members of Local 101 began to picket at the only entrance road to the Carnegie dock. They carried signs which read: \"Pickands Mather Unfair to Organized Labor. This Dispute Only Involves P-M. M. E. B. A. Loc. 101 AFL-CIO.\" and \"M. E. B. A. Loc. 101. AFL-CIO. Request P-M Engineers to Join with Organized Labor to Better Working Conditions. This Dispute Only Involves P-M.\" When the pickets appeared, employees of the Carnegie Dock and Fuel Company refused to continue unloading the Samuel Mather. As a result, the ship was forced to remain at the dock, and another of the respondents' steamers, the Pickands, was compelled to ride at anchor outside the harbor for a number of days, because the Carnegie dock could accommodate but one vessel at a time. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 173, 176]\n\u00a0\n\n\nUpon learning of the picket line, the respondents filed a complaint in the state court charging the union with several violations of state law. The complaint alleged, among other things, that the petitioners had induced Carnegie's employees to refuse to perform services, and that the petitioners had thus caused Carnegie to breach its contract with the respondents. The petitioners filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, claiming that the dispute was arguably subject to the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board and thus, under the Garmon doctrine, beyond the state court's cognizance.\n3\n Evidence was taken concerning the nature and effect of the picketing, the employment status of respondents' marine engineers, and, to a limited extent, the characteristics of MEBA and Local 101. The trial court concluded that the dispute was within its jurisdiction, and, finding the picketing to be in violation of Minnesota law, it issued a temporary injunction prohibiting the petitioners from picketing at or near any site where the respondents' vessels were loading or unloading, from inducing other employees or other firms not to perform services for the respondents, and from interfering in other specified ways with the respondents' operations. The injunction was later made permanent on the basis of the same record, and the court's judgment was affirmed on review by the Supreme Court of Minnesota.\n\nThe Garmon case dealt with rules of conduct - whether certain activities were protected by 7 or prohibited by 8 of the Act. In the present case it has hardly been disputed, nor could it be, that the petitioners' conduct was of a kind arguably prohibited by 8 (b) (4) (A) of the Act and thus within the primary jurisdiction of the Board, if MEBA and Local 101 were \"labor organizations\" \n\n[370 \nU.S. 173, 177]\n\u00a0\n within the contemplation of 8 (b) generally.\n4\n The Minnesota courts determined, however, that those whom the petitioners represented and sought to enlist were \"supervisors,\" that consequently neither of the petitioners was a \"labor organization,\" and therefore that nothing in the Garmon doctrine precluded a state court from assuming jurisdiction.\n\nIt is the petitioners' contention that the issue to be determined in this case is not whether the state courts correctly decided their \"labor organization\" status, but whether the state courts were free to finally decide that issue at all. The petitioners contend that the principles of the Garmon decision confined the state court to deciding \n\n[370 \nU.S. 173, 178]\n\u00a0\n only whether the evidence in this case was sufficient to show that either of them was arguably a \"labor organization\" within the contemplation of 8 (b). We agree, and hold that the evidence was sufficient to deprive the Minnesota courts of jurisdiction over this controversy.\n\nWe see no reason to assume that the task of interpreting and applying the statutory definition of a \"labor organization\" does not call for the same adjudicatory expertise that the Board must bring to bear when it determines the applicability of 7 and 8 of the Act to substantive conduct. Indeed, analysis of the problem makes clear that the process of defining the term \"labor organization\" is one which may often require the full range of Board competence.\n\nThe term \"labor organization\" is defined by 2 (5) of the Act, which says:\n\n \"The term `labor organization' means any organization of any kind, or any agency or employee representation committee or plan, in which employees participate and which exists for the purpose, in whole or in part, of dealing with employers concerning grievances, labor disputes, wages, rates of pay, hours of employment, or conditions of work.\" 29 U.S.C. 152 (5).\n\n\n The part of that definition at issue in the present case is the requirement that \"employees participate\" in the organization. As defined by 2 (3) of the Act, \"[t]he term `employee' . . . shall not include . . . any individual employed as a supervisor . . . .\" 29 U.S.C. 152 (3).\n5\n \"Supervisor\" is defined in turn by 2 (11) of the Act to mean:\n\n\". . . any individual having authority, in the interest of the employer, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, \n\n[370 \nU.S. 173, 179]\n\u00a0\n recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees, or responsibly to direct them, or to adjust their grievances, or effectively to recommend such action, if in connection with the foregoing the exercise of such authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature, but requires the use of independent judgment.\" 29 U.S.C. 152 (11).\n\n\n The statutory definition of the term \"supervisor\" has been the subject of considerable litigation before the NLRB and in the federal courts.\n6\n It is immediately apparent, moreover, that the phrase \"organization . . . in which employees participate\" is far from self-explanatory. Several recurring questions stem from the fact that national \n\n[370 \nU.S. 173, 180]\n\u00a0\n or even local unions may represent both \"employees\" and \"supervisors.\"\n7\n For example, is employee participation in any part of a defendant national or local union sufficient, or must \"employees\" be involved in the immediate labor dispute?\n8\n What percentage or degree of employee participation in the relevant unit is required?\n9\n If an organization is open to \"employees\" or solicits their membership, must there be a showing that there are actually employee members? And, if a local union is not itself a \"labor organization,\" are there conditions under which it may become subject to 8 (b) as an agent of some other organization which is?\n10\n\u00a0\n\nThe considerations involved in answering these questions are largely of a kind most wisely entrusted initially to the agency charged with the day-to-day administration of the Act as a whole. The term \"labor organization\" appears in a number of sections of the Act. Section 8 (a) (2), for example, forbids employers to \"dominate or interfere with the formation or administration of any labor organization or contribute financial or other support to it . . . .\" 29 U.S.C. 158 (a) (2). Section 8 (a) (3) makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer, by certain discriminatory conduct, \"to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization . . . .\" 29 U.S.C. 158 (a) (3). Section 9 (c), dealing with the largely \n\n[370 \nU.S. 173, 181]\n\u00a0\n unreviewable area of representation elections,\n11\n refers repeatedly to both \"employees\" and \"labor organizations.\" The policy considerations underlying these and other sections of the Act, and the relationship of a particular definitional approach under 8 (b) to the meaning of the same term in the various sections, must obviously be taken into account if the statute is to operate as a coherent whole.\n12\n A centralized adjudicatory process is also essential in working out a consistent approach to the status of the many separate unions which may represent interrelated occupations in a single industry.\n13\n Moreover, as the national agency charged with the administration of federal labor law, the Board should be free in the first instance to consider the whole spectrum of possible approaches to the question, ranging from a broad definition of \"labor organization\" in terms of an entire union to a narrow case-by-case consideration of the issue. Only the Board can knowledgeably weigh the effect of either choice upon the certainty and predictability of labor management relations, or assess the importance of simple administrative convenience in this area.\n14\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 173, 182]\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor these reasons we conclude that the task of determining what is a \"labor organization\" in the context of 8 (b) must in any doubtful case begin with the National Labor Relations Board, and that the only workable way to assure this result is for the courts to concede that a union is a \"labor organization\" for 8 (b) purposes whenever a reasonably arguable case is made to that effect. Such a case was made in the Minnesota courts.\n\nThere persuasive evidence was introduced to show that all the marine engineers employed by the respondents were in fact supervisors.\n15\n It was also shown that MEBA had steadfastly maintained in proceedings before the NLRB that it was not a labor organization subject to 8 (b) of the Act.\n16\n However, the petitioners introduced into the record two recent Board decisions, one holding \n\n[370 \nU.S. 173, 183]\n\u00a0\n that MEBA was subject to 8 (b) and was guilty of an unfair labor practice for engaging in an activity similar to that involved in this case,\n17\n and the other holding that marine engineers represented by a branch of Local 101 were \"employees\" for the purpose of a 9 (c) election.\n18\n The Board's order in the first case was enforced by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on January 13, 1960, during the pendency of the present litigation in the Minnesota trial court.\n19\n The state court's attention was expressly called to the Board's theory, subsequently adopted by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, that the relevant unit of membership for determining what is a labor organization in a 8 (b) context is the entire union, and to the holding that the known membership of a few \"employees,\" provisions in the union's constitution making membership available to \"employees,\" and previous conduct indicative of \"employee\" representation were sufficient to render the national union a \"labor organization.\" See 121 N. L. R. B., at 209-210; 274 F.2d ___, at 174-175. Three additional District Court decisions expressly holding that the Board had reasonable cause to believe that MEBA or Local 101 was subject to 8 (b) had been decided before the issuance of the Minnesota trial court's judgment in the present litigation, although the record does not show that these were specifically brought to the court's attention.\n20\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 173, 184]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThis was a case, therefore, where a state court was shown not simply the arguable possibility of Labor Board jurisdiction over the controversy before it, but that the Board had actually determined the underlying issue upon which its jurisdiction depended, i. e., that MEBA was a \"labor organization\" for purposes of 8 (b) of the Act. In the absence of a showing that this position had been authoritatively rejected by the courts,\n21\n or abandoned by the Labor Board itself, we hold that it was the duty of the state court to defer to the Board's determination.\n22\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 173, 185]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe need for protecting the exclusivity of NLRB jurisdiction is obviously greatest when the precise issue brought before a court is in the process of litigation through procedures originating in the Board. While the Board's decision is not the last word, it must assuredly be the first. In addition, when the Board has actually undertaken to decide an issue, relitigation in a state court creates more than theoretical danger of actual conflict between state and federal regulation of the same controversy.\n23\n \"Our concern\" here, as it was in the Garmon case, \n359 \nU.S., at 246\n, \"is with delimiting areas . . . which must be free from state regulation if national policy is to be left unhampered.\"\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"At times it has not been clear whether the particular activity regulated by the States was governed by 7 or 8 or was, perhaps, outside both these sections. But courts are not primary tribunals to adjudicate such issues. It is essential to the administration of the Act that these determinations be left in the first instance to the National Labor Relations Board. What is outside the scope of this Court's authority cannot remain within a State's power and state jurisdiction too must yield to the exclusive primary competence of the Board.\" \n359 \nU.S., at 244\n-245.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The record shows that Local 101 was hardly a \"local\" in the conventional sense of that term. It had branch offices not only throughout the Great Lakes area, but also in Brooklyn, San Francisco, and Houston, among other places, and there were \"approximately 35 to 40 locals in 101; some are very small, some are very large.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Potential NLRB jurisdiction under 8 (b) is the only basis upon which the petitioners have claimed preemption of state court jurisdiction. See note 4, infra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] On November 12, 1959, the day the picketing began, 8 (b) (4) (A) provided as follows:\n\n\"It shall be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents -\n\n.  .   .  .  .\n\n\n\n\"(4) to engage in, or to induce or encourage the employees of any employer to engage in, a strike or a concerted refusal in the course of their employment to use, manufacture, process, transport, or otherwise handle or work on any goods, articles, materials, or commodities or to perform any services, where an object thereof is: (A) forcing or requiring any employer or self-employed person to join any labor or employer organization or any employer or other person to cease using, selling, handling, transporting, or otherwise dealing in the products of any other producer, processor, or manufacturer, or to cease doing business with any other person . . . .\" 29 U.S.C. 158 (b) (4) (A).\n\n\n Shortly thereafter the amendments made by the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act became effective, and 8 (b) (4) (A) became 8 (b) (4) (B), 29 U.S.C. (Supp. II) 158 (b) (4) (B). The here-pertinent language of the amended sections remained virtually the same.\n\nWe express no opinion on the ultimate applicability of these provisions.

The Board's assumption of jurisdiction over supervisors under the 1935 Act was approved by this Court in Packard Motor Car Co. v. Labor Board, \n330 \nU.S. 485\n.

Labor Board. 274 F.2d, at 175, where it was said:\n\n\"We earnestly suggest to the Board that the issue whether these two unions, whose activities concern almost every ocean and inland port of the United States, are `labor organizations' within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act deserves more thorough treatment than it has had here. Such an investigation would not, of course, have to be performed in every case. Once the Board determined on the basis of a full inquiry that MEBA and MMP were or were not labor organizations, the Board could rely on this unless there was evidence of a change.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] The trial court relied, in part, upon the 1949 Labor Board decision in Globe Steamship Co., supra, n. 6, which held that certain marine engineers employed on Great Lakes vessels, including those of respondents, were \"supervisors\" for the purpose of a 9 (c) election petition.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] Respondents introduced an affidavit, filed by MEBA in a prior NLRB proceeding, in which the union claimed to represent only supervisors. This is the affidavit quoted in note 1 of the dissenting opinion, post, p. 185. But, as petitioners pointed out, the Board concluded then, and has continued of the view, that petitioners are \"labor organizations\" despite such assertions.\n\nThe petitioners did not attempt to introduce specific evidence in the state court to prove that they actually represented employees who were not supervisors. Indeed, the record would seem to indicate that MEBA and Local 101 would ultimately prefer to be classified as supervisory unions outside the ambit of 8 of the Federal Act. The actual assertion of NLRB jurisdiction over these unions, however, at the very time the state court action was pending, was more than sufficient to create an arguable case for NLRB jurisdiction under 8. It would be entirely inconsistent with our holding in Garmon to require the unions affirmatively to abandon in the state court the position they wished to maintain before the NLRB. It would be equally inconsistent to give evidentiary weight to union affidavits dredged up from prior NLRB proceedings in which the Board rejected the union's self-characterizing claims.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] National Maritime Union (Standard Oil Co.), supra, n. 4.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] Graham Transp.

Va., 1957); Douds v. Seafarers' International Union, 148 F. Supp. 953.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 21\n] The trial court noted that the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit had determined that MEBA was not a \"labor organization\" within the meaning of 301 of the federal statute. A. H. Bull Steamship Co. v. National Marine Eng. B. Assn., 250 F.2d 332. This case was subsequently distinguished by the Second Circuit in a case under 8 (b), National Marine Engineers Beneficial Assn. v. Labor Board, supra, n. 8, and in United States v. National Marine Engineers' Ben. Assn., 294 F.2d 385. Subsequent to the trial court's decision in the present case the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ordered the NLRB to take additional evidence and to reconsider its determination of a similar maritime union's status as a \"labor organization.\" International Organization of Masters, Mates & Pilots v. Labor Board, supra, n. 9. At the most these court decisions would only serve to cast some doubt on the validity of the Board's determination. But even if the doubt were much more substantial, the Garmon doctrine would require a state court to decline jurisdiction of the controversy.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 22\n] To distinguish the several NLRB decisions on the ground that each involved marine engineers whose jobs were unlike those of the respondents' engineers, as the Minnesota courts sought to do, is inconsistent with all that Garmon teaches. Such a distinction can be made only on the assumption that the relevant unit in determining what is a \"labor organization\" for purposes of 8 (b) is no more than the group of employees involved in the then-pending dispute. The validity of this very assumption is currently being litigated before the Labor Board and reviewing courts. Far from having been authoritatively accepted, this limited view of the relevant unit has at least twice been expressly rejected. National Marine Engineers Beneficial Assn. v.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting.\n\nWhile I agree with the principles announced by the Court, I disagree with the result that is reached on the facts of this case. The record contains an affidavit of the President of this union, the Marine Engineers Beneficial Association (MEBA), which states that all members of the union, including the local involved in this case, perform supervisory functions.\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 173, 186]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAn officer of MEBA testified:\n\n \"Local 101 of the Marine Engineers Beneficial Association is comprised of those men who are licensed as marine engineers by the United States Coast Guard, and those men who perform the engineering duties of engineers, whether or not they are licensed by the Coast Guard.\"\n\n\n The record makes clear that a licensed engineer has supervisory duties whenever there is someone working under him. That status is grounded in the historic distinction between licensed and unlicensed personnel and is shown by this record.\n2\n A union of masters and mates \n\n[370 \nU.S. 173, 187]\n\u00a0\n would plainly be a union of supervisors and under present law not be qualified to represent ordinary seamen. If there are rare instances when an engineer on a tug, for example, is nothing more than an employee, that has not been shown in the record and is directly contrary to the affidavit of this union's president.\n\nThe trial court in this case said that the record \"does not show\" that this MEBA Local \"admits to membership any non-supervisory employee, and in any event it is clear that its membership is composed primarily and almost exclusively of supervisors.\" That finding is not challenged here. Petitioners, placing all their hopes on the words of the trial court that this local is composed \"primarily and almost exclusively of supervisors,\" say it may therefore be arguably and reasonably contended that the local is a labor organization within the meaning of the Act.\n\nSection 2 (5) defines \"labor organization\" as any organization \"in which employees participate\" for the purpose \"of dealing with employers concerning grievances,\" etc.\n\nThe word \"employee\" was redefined by Congress\n3\n following our decision in Packard Co. v. Labor Board, \n330 \nU.S. 485\n, so as to exclude \"any individual employed as a supervisor.\" 2 (3). And 14 (a) provides that \"Nothing herein shall prohibit any individual employed as a supervisor from becoming or remaining a member of a labor organization, but no employer subject to this Act shall be compelled to deem individuals defined herein as supervisors as employees for the purpose of any law, either national or local, relating to collective bargaining.\" \n\n[370 \nU.S. 173, 188]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThere is not a shred of evidence in this record showing that any employee not a supervisor is a member of this union. There is therefore not a shred of evidence to show that this local of MEBA is a \"labor organization.\" Since there is not, it has made no showing that it is entitled to any of the protections of the Federal Act. Such a showing is within its power to make. It apparently claims to be a \"labor organization\" when it is to its advantage to do so and protests against being so labeled when that position serves its end.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nIf it desires the protection of the Federal Act, it should be required to come forth with evidence showing who its members are. In absence of such a showing, we should not disturb the rulings of the Minnesota courts, which on this record were fully justified in enjoining the picketing. It was indeed conceded by counsel for MEBA at the trial that the purpose of the picketing was \"to improve the wages, hours and working conditions\" of the \"licensed engineers,\" not the wages, hours and working conditions of those few undisclosed individuals who it is now intimated may have been members of the union.\n\nSince this local is not on this record a \"labor organization,\" it does not come within the purview of 8 (b) (2) or 8 (b) (4), which makes certain practices, alleged to have taken place here, unfair labor practices. For 14, quoted above, returned supervisors to the basis which they enjoyed prior to the Federal Act. Bull S. S. Co. v. National Marine Eng. B. Assn., 250 F.2d 332. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 173, 189]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt matters not that at other times this local or MEBA may have been a \"labor organization\" for purposes of the Federal Act.\n5\n Apparently an engineer may at times be only an ordinary employee.\n6\n So for one operation this local may have members doing the work of nonsupervisory employees. Whether its status would therefore change from day-to-day or week-to-week might be presented in some case. It is not presented here, for, on a record showing only supervisors among the membership list, the union has no claim to shelter under the Federal Act.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"I can state most categorically that licensed marine engineers who comprise the entire members of MEBA, without a single exception in the nature of their work, have authority in the interests of the employer \n\n[370 \nU.S. 173, 186]\n\u00a0\n for whom they may be working to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, fine, reward or discipline the unlicensed personnel who work in the engine department, over which the licensed engineers have supervision or responsibility to direct such unlicensed personnel in the engine department or adjust the grievances of the unlicensed personnel in the engine department, or to effectively recommend any such action. In furtherance of their duties, licensed engineers do not exercise the authority just described merely as a routine or clerical nature, but they must exercise the use of independent judgment. Every single member of MEBA performs work of the nature which I have just described. The type of marine personnel over whom the MEBA assumes jurisdiction and takes in as members, is precisely that which I have just described. We do not have any members who do not fall within such description, insofar as their duties and responsibilities are concerned.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The findings state: \"All engineers and assistant engineers employed on Interlake vessels stand watches during which they are in charge of and responsible for the operation and condition of the vessel's propulsion mechanism and responsibly direct, control and supervise the work of the firemen, oilers and coal passers on duty during such watch; they hire, fire, transfer and change the status of and discipline the persons working under them and have authority to and do make effective recommendations respecting the employment and tenure of employment of the people working under them; they handle initially grievances of the employees who are subject to their supervision; the exercise \n\n[370 \nU.S. 173, 187]\n\u00a0\n of authority by the engineers and assistant engineers requires the use of independent judgment and discretion; and all such engineers are required to be licensed by the United States Coast Guard.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See H.

Labor Board, 274 F.2d 167, that MEBA was a \"labor organization\" turned on a narrow procedural point mentioned by the Court of Appeals: \"MEBA and MMP know who their members are and, if they do not know what their members do, certainly they can find out. The Board could properly have thought that the matters placed in the record by the general counsel justified an inference that non-supervisors do participate in MEBA and MMP, and that this sufficed for the Board's finding to that effect unless they were rebutted by more convincing evidence than the unions offered here. We therefore cannot say the Board's finding that MEBA and MMP were labor organizations did not meet the standards laid down in Universal Camera Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 1951, \n340 \nU.S. 474, 71\n S.

See N. L. R. B. v. Quincy Steel Casting Co., 1st Cir., 1952, 200 F.2d 293. The general counsel claimed that at least one of the engineers on the Sandra Marie could not have been a supervisor since he had no one to supervise. See General Foods Corp., 110 N. L. R.

Judgment was entered upon findings based upon a detailed stipulation of facts in which appellants admitted all the allegations of the complaint and agreed to the ultimate conclusion that they had unlawfully combined and conspired in unreasonable restraint of foreign trade and commerce in yellow grease. The District Court found that only the support of the union and the powerful weapons at its command had enabled the peddlers and the union to destroy free competition in the purchase and sale of waste grease and that termination of membership of the grease peddlers in the union appeared to be the most effective, if not the only, means of preventing a recurrence of appellants' unlawful activities. It not only enjoined the practices found to be unlawful but also ordered the union to expel from membership all self-employed grease peddlers. Held: The judgment is sustained.

JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe appellants are a Los Angeles labor union, one of its business agents, and four self-employed independent contractors, so-called \"grease peddlers,\" who were members of the union. They appeal from a judgment entered against them by a Federal District Court in a civil action brought by the United States to terminate violations of 1 of the Sherman Act.\n1\n The judgment was entered upon findings based upon a detailed stipulation of facts in which the appellants admitted all the allegations of the complaint and agreed to the ultimate conclusion that they \n\n[371 \nU.S. 94, 96]\n\u00a0\n had unlawfully combined and conspired in unreasonable restraint of foreign trade and commerce in yellow grease. In the stipulation the appellants also agreed to the issuance of a broad injunction against them. The District Court's decree enjoined in specific detail the practices found to be unlawful, and in addition ordered the union to terminate the union membership of all self-employed grease peddlers. 196 F. Supp. 12. The appellants attack the judgment here upon the single ground that the District Court was in error in ordering termination of the union membership of these independent businessmen.\n2\n Consideration of this claim requires a somewhat detailed review of the nature of the illegal conspiracy in which the appellants in this case were concededly engaged.\n\nDuring the period between 1954 and 1959 there were in Los Angeles County eight firms engaged as processors in the production of yellow grease, an inedible grease produced by removing moisture and solid impurities from so-called restaurant grease - waste grease resulting from the preparation of food in restaurants, hotels and institutions. A substantial part of the yellow grease so produced was sold to overseas purchasers and to purchasers in California for prompt shipment overseas.\n\nThe processors procured restaurant grease in two separate ways. They made direct purchases, usually from large restaurants, hotels and other institutions, and in these transactions the processors picked up the restaurant grease from the sellers through employees who were members of the union. Restaurant grease from other sources was usually purchased by the processors from grease peddlers, independent entrepreneurs whose earnings as middlemen consisted of the difference between the price at which they bought the restaurant grease from various sources and the price at which they sold it to the processors, \n\n[371 \nU.S. 94, 97]\n\u00a0\n less the cost of operating and maintaining their trucks. There were some 35 to 45 grease peddlers in the Los Angeles area.\n\nIn 1954 most of the grease peddlers became members of the appellant union, at the instigation of the appellant business agent, for the purpose of increasing the margin between the prices they paid for grease and the prices at which they sold it to the processors. To accomplish this purpose, fixed purchase and sale prices were agreed upon and enforced by union agents through the exercise or threatened exercise of union economic power in the form of strikes and boycotts against processors who indicated any inclination to deal with grease peddlers who were not union members. The union's business agent allocated accounts and territories for both purchases and sales among the various grease peddlers, who agreed to refrain from buying from or soliciting the customers of other peddlers, and violations of this agreement could result in a grease peddler's suspension from the union, in which event he was, of course, prohibited from carrying on his business.\n\nFrom 1954 to 1959 this basic plan of price fixing and allocation of business was effectively carried out by elimination of the few peddlers who had not joined the union, and by coercion upon the processors through threats of \"union trouble\" if they did not comply.\n\nWithin the union the grease peddlers were treated as a separate group, distinct from the some 2,400 employee members. The meetings of the grease peddlers were always held apart from regular union meetings, and from 1955 on, the grease peddlers were members of a special \"subdivision\" of the union - Local 626-B. The affairs of this separate subdivision were administered not by regular union officers, but by the appellant business agent who had originated the scheme, together with a committee of grease peddlers to assist in \"policing, enforcing \n\n[371 \nU.S. 94, 98]\n\u00a0\n and carrying out the program to suppress and eliminate competition.\"\n\nThere was no showing of any actual or potential wage or job competition, or of any other economic interrelationship, between the grease peddlers and the other members of the union. It was stipulated that no processors had ever substituted peddlers for employee-drivers in acquiring restaurant grease, or had ever threatened to do so. The stipulation made clear that the peddlers and the processors had essentially different sources of supply and different classes of customers. Based on these stipulated facts, the District Court affirmatively found that \"there is no competition between [the employee and peddler] groups because each is engaged in a different line of work . . . .\"\n\nPointing out that \"the stipulated facts clearly show that before the grease peddlers joined the defendant Union, there was no suppression of competition among them, and that only the support of the Union and the powerful weapons at its command enabled the peddlers and the Union together to destroy free competition in the purchase and sale of waste grease,\" the District Court concluded that \"a decree terminating the membership of the grease peddlers in defendant Union appears to be the most effective, if not the only, means of preventing a recurrence of defendants' unlawful activities.\" The court further concluded that nothing in the Clayton Act or the Norris-LaGuardia Act prevented the issuance of a decree divesting the grease peddlers of union membership in the circumstances of this case. We agree with these basic conclusions.\n\nIt is beyond question that a court of equity has power in appropriate circumstances to order the dissolution of an association of businessmen, when the association and its members have conspired among themselves or with others to violate the antitrust laws. Hartford-Empire Co. v. \n\n[371 \nU.S. 94, 99]\n\u00a0\n United States, \n323 \nU.S. 386, 428\n. And the circumstances stipulated and found in the present case provided ample support, we think, for a decree of dissolution, as a matter of the discreet exercise of equitable power.\n\nIt is also beyond question that nothing in the anti-injunction provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act,\n3\n\u00a0\n\n[371 \nU.S. 94, 100]\n\u00a0\n nor in the labor exemption provisions of the Clayton Act,\n4\n insulates a combination in illegal restraint of trade between businessmen and a labor union from the sanctions of the antitrust laws. Allen Bradley Co. v. Local \n\n[371 \nU.S. 94, 101]\n\u00a0\n Union No. 3, \n325 \nU.S. 797\n. Indeed, the appellants have conceded the propriety of the order in the present case which broadly enjoins the illegal practices in which they were engaged.\n\nThe narrow question which emerges in this case, therefore, is whether businessmen who combine in an association which would otherwise be properly subject to dissolution under the antitrust laws can immunize themselves from that sanction by the simple expedient of calling themselves \"Local 626-B\" of a labor union.\n5\n We think there is nothing in the Norris-LaGuardia Act nor in the Clayton Act, nor in the federal policy which these statutes reflect, to prevent a court from dissolving the ties which bound these businessmen together, and which bound them to the appellant union, in the circumstances of the present case. \n\n[371 \nU.S. 94, 102]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act place severe limitations upon the issuance of an injunction by a federal court in \"any case involving or growing out of any labor dispute,\" and the statute specifically forbids a District Court in such a case to prohibit anyone from \"[b]ecoming or remaining a member of any labor organization.\" But, as the District Court correctly found, the present case was not one \"involving or growing out of any labor dispute,\" but one involving an illegal combination between businessmen and a union to restrain commerce. In such a case, as Allen Bradley Co. clearly held, neither the Norris-LaGuardia Act nor the labor exemption provisions of the Clayton Act are applicable.\n\nThis Court's decision in Columbia River Co. v. Hinton, \n315 \nU.S. 143\n, is very much in point. That was a private antitrust suit brought by a processor of fish to enjoin an allegedly illegal combination of fishermen, who had joined together in the Pacific Coast Fishermen's Union to regulate the terms under which fish would be sold. The organization was \"affiliated with the C. I. O.\" \n315 \nU.S., at 144\n. The defendants claimed that an injunction against them would violate the Norris-LaGuardia Act. The Court held that the controversy was not a \"labor dispute\" within the meaning of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, pointing out that that statute was \"not intended to have application to disputes over the sale of commodities.\" \n315 \nU.S., at 145\n. Here, as in Columbia River Co., the grease peddlers were sellers of commodities, who became \"members\" of the union only for the purpose of bringing union power to bear in the successful enforcement of the illegal combination in restraint of the traffic in yellow grease.\n6\n\u00a0\n\n[371 \nU.S. 94, 103]\n\u00a0\n The District Court was not in error in ordering the complete termination of that illegal combination.\n\nWhat has been said is not remotely to suggest that a labor organization might not often have a legitimate interest in soliciting self-employed entrepreneurs as members. Cf. Milk Wagon Drivers' Union v. Lake Valley Farm Products, \n311 \nU.S. 91\n; Bakery Drivers Local v. Wohl, \n315 \nU.S. 769\n; Local 24 v. Oliver, \n358 \nU.S. 283\n. And both the Norris-LaGuardia Act and the Clayton Act ensure that the antitrust laws cannot be used as a vehicle to stifle legitimate labor union activities. But here the court found upon stipulated facts that there was no job or wage competition or economic interrelationship of any kind between the grease peddlers and other members of the appellant union. If that situation should change in the future, the District Court will have ample power to amend its decree.\n7\n\u00a0\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal . . . .\" 15 U.S.C. 1.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The appeal was brought directly to this Court under the provisions of the Expediting Act, 32 Stat. 823, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 29.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Norris-LaGuardia Act, 4, 29 U.S.C. 104: \"104.

This contention, carried to its logical conclusion, would render unconstitutional not only many of the provisions of the antitrust laws, but all general criminal conspiracy statutes as well. Such a claim was explicitly rejected in Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co., \n336 \nU.S. 490\n. The appellants further contend that the decree is void as to grease peddlers who were not joined as defendants. But the order of divestiture ran only against the union: \"The defendant Local 626 is ordered and directed: \"(a) To expel promptly from membership all grease peddlers; \"(b) To refuse membership at any time in the future to any grease peddler; \"(c) To expel from membership any member who becomes a grease peddler; \"(d) To furnish a copy of this decree to all grease peddlers who are now members of Local 626.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] In November 1954, the grease peddlers formed a trade association known as the Los Angeles Grease Buyers Association. This association was unsuccessful in its efforts to control the market in restaurant grease, and it was dissolved in early 1955 after a meeting at which \n\n[371 \nU.S. 94, 103]\n\u00a0\n the appellant union business agent told the peddlers to choose between the union and the association, stating that the union could do for the peddlers what the association could not do.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] United States v. Swift & Co., \n286 \nU.S. 106, 114\n. Cf. Donaldson v. Read Magazine, \n333 \nU.S. 178, 184\n.\n\nMR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG, with whom MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN joins, concurring.\n\nI concur in today's opinion and judgment of the Court because the absence here of any countervailing union interest in retaining the grease peddlers as members coupled with the egregious nature of the conduct involved supports the District Court's exercise of discretion in imposing the contested sanction as the \"most effective . . . means of preventing a recurrence of defendants' unlawful activities.\" Ante, p. 98. As I read the stipulated record, the peddlers did not act and were not viewed by the \n\n[371 \nU.S. 94, 104]\n\u00a0\n union as participants in normal union activities designed to better their economic condition, but instead were from the very beginning used by union officials to effect a concededly illegal scheme to control the distribution and processing of grease.\n\nThis does not mean, and I do not regard the opinion of the Court as saying, that members may be expelled from a union when the pursuit of genuine labor objectives has collaterally resulted in transgressions of the antitrust laws.\n\nThe relief given by the District Court is not inconsistent with these expressions. To support its order, however, that the union must terminate the membership of the grease peddlers, the court below reasoned that the expulsion was appropriate and justified because, in the absence of job or wage competition between the peddlers and other union members, the peddlers were not proper subjects of unionization. In reaching this conclusion, the court below too narrowly circumscribed the permissible area of legitimate labor union activity. To believe that labor union interests may not properly extend beyond mere direct job and wage competition is to ignore not only economic and social realities so obvious as not to need mention, but also the graphic lessons of American labor union history.\n\nToday's opinion of the Court thus properly notes that a labor organization may \"often have a legitimate interest in soliciting self-employed entrepreneurs as members\" and recognizes that permissible union interest and action extends beyond job and wage competition to other \"economic interrelationship[s].\" Ante, p. 103. In my view, there is therefore implicit in this Court's opinion a rejection of the District Court's overly strict view that job or wage competition is the sole measure of the propriety of union organizational efforts.\n\nNotwithstanding what I take to be its disapproval of the views of the district judge, the Court correctly sustains \n\n[371 \nU.S. 94, 105]\n\u00a0\n the judgment expelling the peddlers from membership in the union, not because there is absent the job or wage competition erroneously considered crucial by the District Court, but because there does not appear in this record any other legitimate labor union interest presently being served by organization of these peddlers.\n\nThe Court is not here required to pass upon, and does not pass upon, the existence of the antitrust violation, or whether, as an original matter, the grease peddlers might properly associate among themselves or affiliate with a sympathetic and genuinely interested union to improve their economic condition. Resolution of such issues would require careful and detailed consideration of federal labor policy, the scope of the antitrust exemption afforded labor organizations by 6 and 20 of the Clayton Act and the Norris-LaGuardia Act, as interpreted by United States v. Hutcheson, \n312 \nU.S. 219\n, and, in addition, the applicability here of the doctrines enunciated by this Court in cases such as Columbia River Packers Association, Inc., v. Hinton, \n315 \nU.S. 143\n, and Allen Bradley Co. v. Local No. 3, \n325 \nU.S. 797\n. In the present case, however, appellants stipulated in the District Court that they have violated the Sherman Act and engaged in a pattern of conduct calling for remedial injunctive relief; they offered no justification for their admittedly illegal conduct. These concessions necessarily forfeit any antitrust exemption which might otherwise have been claimed to attach. Consequently, the only question remaining is whether, having thus negatived by their stipulations the existence of any exonerating legitimate union interest, appellants may now complain that the district judge abused his discretion in fashioning a remedy which included, in addition to the enjoining of future similarly illegal conduct, expulsion of the peddlers from the union. Although, as I have indicated, I do not agree with all of \n\n[371 \nU.S. 94, 106]\n\u00a0\n his views, I believe that the district judge did not exceed permissible bounds in framing the decree.\n\nThe particular nature of the challenged conduct giving rise to the ultimate illegality (whether adjudicated after contest or stipulated) is, of course, immediately and directly relevant to the nature of the relief to be decreed. Relief should be effective to preclude future violations and, at the same time, should not unduly penalize the parties. Since the conduct here goes beyond that recorded in the opinion of the Court, a brief recital of additional facts is appropriate.\n\nThe stipulated antitrust violation does not depend upon the fact of combination between the grease peddlers and the union for the purpose of bettering the economic condition of the former through limited use of collective bargaining power - an affiliation which standing alone and as an original matter might have been proper. Though not joined as defendants below, at least some of the processors purchasing grease from the peddlers were conceded to have been co-conspirators. The union business agent openly allocated sales among the processors and certain processors were completely cut off from sources of supply. On at least one occasion, processors were required to submit information concerning the volume of their grease purchases and the data supplied was used by the union as a basis for ordering an equalizing shift of business to a processor owned by a union member. Only a month earlier, the union business agent had arranged for a competitor to \"help out\" this same favored processor by selling for it grease which it was having trouble selling. The accommodating processor undertook the sale simply because it feared \"trouble\" with the union and its agent if it refused.\n\nBy virtue of the union's activities, the peddlers' sales of grease were ultimately wholly diverted from the six processors originally dealing with the peddlers to two \n\n[371 \nU.S. 94, 107]\n\u00a0\n processors, one of which was owned by a union member and in the other of which a union member was a partner. In the course of accomplishing this shift of business, at least one noncooperative processor was forced out of business.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nSuch facts - all of which were stipulated - demonstrate a pattern of allocation of sales among processors and other improper practices designed to benefit certain favored processors in which union members had a direct financial interest.\n\nMoreover, as indicated in the opinion of the Court, appellants stipulated that the peddlers themselves are \"independent businessmen\" and not \"employees\" of the processors. We cannot overlook the force of these concessions. This case is unlike Labor Board v. Hearts Publications, \n322 \nU.S. 111\n, in which nonemployee status was not merely unconceded, but the contrary was argued and shown. Here, the single paragraph in the stipulation of facts describing the nature of the peddlers' activities does not overcome the ultimate stipulation that they were \"businessmen\" and not \"employees.\" Certainly we should not, merely by mechanically affixing naked labels imported from other contexts, decide cases on abstractions; but we cannot ignore the impact of unlimited, self-made categorizations applied by agreement in the very lawsuit before us.\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[371 \nU.S. 94, 108]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe import of the entire stipulated factual record is that the union neither had nor pursued any legitimate present interest in organizing the grease peddlers. Were it otherwise, that portion of the decree compelling expulsion of the peddlers from the union, in my view, could not stand. The sanction here invoked is an extreme one, and, unless confined to use but rarely and then only in the most compelling of circumstances, may become a device for unfairly and improperly fractionalizing or decimating unions.\n\nOn the circumstances presented to the Court, the judgment below is properly affirmed. The situation may change, however, and I understand the opinion of the Court to say that if a legitimate union interest in organizing the peddlers does hereafter arise, the District Court has the power, and indeed the duty, to modify the decree on application of the appellants. For these reasons, I join in the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The union agent told the owner of the business that \"if he [the agent] could learn the name of [the processor's] . . . landlord and the buyers to whom [the processor] . . . was selling yellow grease . . . he would bring pressure through the Union to have [the processor's] . . . lease cancelled and to have the buyers stop dealing with [it] . . . .\" The agent said that he did not \"want [the processor] . . . in the grease business.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The stipulation of nonemployee status plus the absence of pursuit of any genuine labor objective negatives the existence of any \"labor dispute\" and eliminates the need to consider further the applicability \n\n[371 \nU.S. 94, 108]\n\u00a0\n of the Norris-LaGuardia Act prohibitions on specified injunctive relief. There is involved neither an extension of Allen Bradley Co. v. Local No. 3, \n325 \nU.S. 797\n, nor a narrowing of the application of Norris-LaGuardia. Similarly obviated is the related question whether the substantive antitrust exemption read into the Norris-LaGuardia Act by United States v. Hutcheson, \n312 \nU.S. 219\n, is coextensive with the Act's injunctive inhibitions, so that appellants' waiver of the former with respect to the activities and combination here challenged, see p. 105, supra, is also effective to waive the latter.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting.\n\nIf we took here the approach we took in Labor Board v. Hearst Publications, \n322 \nU.S. 111\n, we would reverse this judgment. The question there was whether \"newsboys,\" (who were indeed mature men, id., 116) whose compensation consisted of the difference between the price at which they bought their papers from the publisher and the price at which they sold them, were \"employees\" for purposes of the National Labor Relations Act. Though \n\n[371 \nU.S. 94, 109]\n\u00a0\n by common-law standards they were \"independent contractors,\" we held that they were \"employees\" under the Federal Act. We noted that numerous types of \"independent contractors\" had formed or joined unions for collective bargaining - musicians, actors, writers, artists, architects, engineers, and insurance agents. Id., 127, n. 26. We pointed out that there were marginal groups who, though entrepreneurial in form, lacked the bargaining power necessary to obtain decent compensation, decent hours, and decent working conditions. Id., 126-128. We emphasized that \"the economic facts of the relation\" (id., 128) may make it \"more nearly one of employment than of independent business enterprise with respect to the ends sought to be accomplished by the legislation.\" Ibid.\n\nWe know from our own cases (which are much closer on their facts to the present controversy than is Columbia River Co. v. Hinton, \n315 \nU.S. 143\n) that the owner-driver-peddler system in the transportation and service trades has led to wage and job competition and to strife of one kind or another. Senn v. Tile Layers Union, \n301 \nU.S. 468\n, sustained picketing of a tile contractor who did much of the manual labor himself but also hired a few nonunion helpers. In Bakery Drivers Local v. Wohl, \n315 \nU.S. 769\n, a conflict arose between a union and small peddlers of baked goods who had increased ranks as a result of social security and unemployment compensation laws. Id., 770. We sustained under the First Amendment the union's picketing of the peddlers. See also Local 24 v. Oliver, \n358 \nU.S. 283\n.\n\nDrivers' Union v. Lake Valley Co., \n311 \nU.S. 91\n, is even more in point for it presented, as does the present case, a question under the Norris-LaGuardia Act. Small milk peddlers who bought from wholesalers and sold to retailers grew so fast that union dairy employees lost their jobs and retailers started cutting prices. The result was a \n\n[371 \nU.S. 94, 110]\n\u00a0\n weakening of the union position. Picketing started and an injunction against it issued. We held that there was a \"labor dispute\" within the meaning of the Norris-LaGuardia Act and therefore that the federal courts had no power to issue an injunction. Cf. United States v. American Federation of Musicians, \n318 \nU.S. 741\n.\n\nIt was stipulated in the present case that \"Grease peddlers are independent businessmen who are engaged in the business of buying, transporting, and selling restaurant grease for their own account. They are not employees of the grease processors.\"\n\nThis is the beginning not the end of the problem. And it is no answer to say, as did the District Court, that union members and these grease peddlers do not compete. That is, indeed, denied by the record which shows that union members drive trucks for grease producers and pick up and transport grease.\n\nThe record in American Trucking Assns. v. United States, \n344 \nU.S. 298, 304\n-306, makes clear that marginal owner-drivers can demoralize large segments of the transportation industry. Moreover, the stark fact is that here, as in the \"newsboys\" case, the union's effort was to improve the economic status of the grease peddlers. This is made clear by the stipulated facts:\n\n \"These self-employed peddlers have no established places of business; no employees, except an occasional loader; no capital investment except a small equity in a truck; no skill or special qualifications except the ability to load, unload and drive a truck. . . . Their earnings represent the difference between the buy and sell price of the waste grease . . . .\"\n\n\n When the level of prices paid to peddlers by processors dropped in 1952-1954 to less than half of the previous price, the income of peddlers was substantially reduced. \n\n[371 \nU.S. 94, 111]\n\u00a0\n This led to intensive competition between peddlers. As a result, the unionization program was designed to increase the profits of the grease peddlers by allocating routes and customers between them and by increasing the margin between the price paid by the peddlers and the price they would receive.\n\nThe Court said many years before this age of enlightenment that unions were rightfully concerned with \"the standard of wages of their trade in the neighborhood.\" American Foundries v. Tri-City Council, \n257 \nU.S. 184, 209\n. This fact underlies the present controversy. All who haul grease, whether \"employees\" or \"peddlers,\" are in the same boat. Protection of one protects all. The union plainly has a legitimate interest in the conditions in the industry which increase or reduce employment opportunities or increase or reduce labor's rewards.\n*\n The \n\n[371 \nU.S. 94, 112]\n\u00a0\n fact that illegal acts were committed does not alter the fact that at heart we have here a \"labor dispute\" within the meaning of the Norris-LaGuardia Act. That definition is broad and includes \"any controversy concerning terms or conditions of employment, or concerning the association or representation of persons in negotiating, fixing, maintaining, changing, or seeking to arrange terms or conditions of employment.\" 29 U.S.C. 113 (c). To the extent that the stipulations in this case tend to preclude the conclusion that there was a \"labor dispute\" those stipulations should not control. For other stipulations of fact compel the contrary conclusion, which is essentially a legal question. Estate of Sanford v. Commissioner, \n308 \nU.S. 39\n. \"We are not bound to accept, as controlling, stipulations as to questions of law.\" Id., 51.\n\nThe fact that acts were committed which overstepped the bounds set by the interlacing Sherman, Clayton and Norris-LaGuardia Acts means that the full array of antitrust remedies can be brought against the grease peddlers, insofar as they combined with processors, a nonlabor group. See Allen Bradley Co. v. Local Union, \n325 \nU.S. 797, 812\n. Yet that does not mean that they can be expelled from the union. Since there was a \"labor dispute\" within the meaning of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, federal courts have no power to compel the grease peddlers to resign as members of the union. For that Act expressly bars a federal court from enjoining anyone from \"Becoming or remaining a member of any labor organization.\" 29 U.S.C. 104 (b).\n\nThe fact that the grease peddlers may have committed federal offenses or otherwise shown themselves to be lawless, not law-abiding, in no way qualifies the absolute command of the Norris-LaGuardia Act. Indeed, we held in Allen Bradley Co. v. Local Union, supra, 812, that a \n\n[371 \nU.S. 94, 113]\n\u00a0\n union that combines with business interests to violate the antitrust laws could be enjoined only as respects \"those prohibited activities.\" Otherwise we said the injunction would run \"directly counter\" to the Norris-LaGuardia Act. Id., 812. When we sanction the addition of the penalty of expulsion from union membership, we qualify the Allen Bradley decision.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] \"The small owner-operator or `gypsy' needs only enough capital to make a down payment on a truck and is free to offer his services at whatever rates he may be willing to accept. In order to protect his equity in his truck he tends, under competitive pressures, to progressively lower his rates until he is taking a bare subsistence for his own wages and is providing inadequate reserves for repairs, maintenance, or replacement. He works long hours, attempts to do his own repair work, often disregards health and safety requirements and load restrictions. He is difficult to organize into trade associations for purposes of self-regulation of rates and standards; and he is likewise difficult to organize into a trade union. He often loses his truck through inability to maintain payments; or when it wears out he has no funds accumulated for another. But there are always new hopefuls to replace him, especially in a period of considerable unemployment (as in the thirties), when an attempt to create self-employment appears to be the only alternative to no employment whatever. Unless regulated in some manner, the small owner-operator constitutes a menace to employment conditions, standards, and in fact to the stability of the entire industry.\" Gillingham, The Teamsters Union on the West Coast, Institute of Industrial Relations, U. of Calif.

EGAN(1962)\nNo. 848\nArgued: Decided: March 5, 1962\n\n\n\n\n By the Act of March 3, 1891, the Annette Islands in Alaska were \"set apart as a reservation\" for the Metlakatlans and other Indians, \"to be held and used by them . . . under such rules and regulations . . . as may be prescribed from time to time by the Secretary of the Interior.\" Relying not upon that Act, but upon the White Act of June 6, 1924, and 4 of the Alaska Statehood Act, the Secretary of the Interior promulgated the present regulations whereby appellant, the incorporated Metlakatla Indian Community, was accorded the right to erect and operate salmon traps in waters surrounding the Annette Islands. Appellant sued to enjoin threatened enforcement against it of a statute of the State of Alaska forbidding the use of salmon traps. Its suit was dismissed, and the Supreme Court of Alaska affirmed. Held:\n\n 1. Neither the White Act nor 4 of the Alaska Statehood Act conferred authority on the Secretary of the Interior to permit Metlakatlans to use salmon traps. Organized Village of Kake v. Egan, post, p. 60. P. 54.\n\n\n 2. The authority to issue regulations governing the Metlakatla Indian Reservation, which was granted to the Secretary of the Interior by the 1891 Act, has not been repealed or impaired, and he has power to issue regulations concerning the fishing rights of these Indians on this reservation which would supersede state law; but the present regulations did not purport to be issued under that authority. They purported to be issued under a misconceived duty wrongly read into the Alaska Statehood Act. Pp. 54-59.\n\n\n 3.

Davis, by special leave of Court, argued the cause for the United States, as amicus curiae, urging reversal. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Cox and Roger P. Marquis.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis is an appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of the State of Alaska, ___ Alaska ___, 362 P.2d 901, affirming the denial of an injunction against interference by the State with appellant's use of fish traps in the Annette Islands of southeastern Alaska. Appellant rests its claim in part on regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior whereby the Metlakatla Indian Community was accorded the right to erect and to operate salmon traps at four locations in waters surrounding the Annette Islands, which Congress set aside for its use in 1891. Alaska challenged this authorization by a state conservation law forbidding the use of salmon traps.\n\nLong before the white man came to Alaska, the annual migrations of salmon from the sea into Alaska's rivers to spawn served as a food supply for the natives. Commercial salmon fishing has become vital for Alaska's economy, but its exploitation seriously threatened the resource even before the turn of the century. See Gruening, The State of Alaska (1954), pp. 75, 97. Congress in 1889, in 1896, in 1906, and again in 1924 enacted conservation measures, prohibiting any obstruction of waters to impede salmon migration, limiting the times and means of taking salmon, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 45, 47]\n\u00a0\n and authorizing the appropriate department to impose further restrictions.\n1\n When Alaska was established as a State, Congress withheld jurisdiction over her fisheries until she had made adequate provision for their administration.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nEqually with Congress, Alaska has been concerned with the evils of overexploitation. In particular she saw a menace in the fish trap, a labor-saving but costly device, which became in her eyes the symbol of exploitation of her resources by \"Stateside\" colonialism. See Rogers, Alaska in Transition (1960), pp. 4-15; Gruening, supra, at pp. 392-407; Gruening, Let Us End American Colonialism (1955); reprinted at 103 Cong. Rec. 470-474. The fish trap, \"a formidable structure,\" Alaska Pacific Fisheries v. United States, \n248 \nU.S. 78, 87\n, consists principally of a fence or netting stretched across or partly across a stream to obstruct the upstream progress of the salmon and turn the fish into the \"heart\" or \"pot\" of the trap, where they are imprisoned until removed. See Rogers, supra, at p. 7; Gruening, The State of Alaska, supra, at pp. 169-170. At one time there were about 700 salmon traps in operation in Alaska. The Secretary of the Interior felt that the fish trap's threat to conservation could be adequately dealt with by regulating the number of fish permitted to escape.\n3\n Alaska vigorously opposed this. The Territorial Legislature several times sent memorials to Congress urging abolition \n\n[369 \nU.S. 45, 48]\n\u00a0\n of trap fishing.\n4\n An ordinance to abolish all commercial traps was approved by Alaska voters along with the proposed State Constitution in 1956, and in early 1959 the first State Legislature turned this ordinance into the statute here under review.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nThe Metlakatla Indians, some 800, led by a British missionary, moved from British Columbia to Alaska in 1887. In 1891 the Annette Islands, south of Ketchikan at the extreme lower end of the Alaskan archipelago, were \"set apart as a reservation\" by Congress for the Metlakatlans and other Indians, \"to be held and used by them in common, under such rules and regulations, and subject to such restrictions, as may be prescribed from time to time by the Secretary of the Interior.\" 26 Stat. 1095, 1101, 48 U.S.C. 358. In 1915 the Secretary issued regulations, 25 CFR (1939 ed.), pt. 1, establishing an elective council to make local ordinances for Metlakatla, and also permitting members of the Community to obtain permits for the use of salmon traps in waters adjacent to the Annette Islands. The next year, in furtherance of the Secretary's plan to establish a salmon \n\n[369 \nU.S. 45, 49]\n\u00a0\n cannery at Metlakatla, President Wilson by proclamation declared the waters within 3,000 feet of certain of these islands to be a part of the Metlakatla Reserve, to be used by the Indians as a source of supply for the intended cannery, \"under the general fisheries laws and regulations of the United States as administered by the Secretary of Commerce.\" 39 Stat. 1777.\n6\n In 1918, without reference to the proclamation, this Court upheld the right of the Metlakatlans to exclude others from the waters surrounding their islands on the ground that these waters were included within the original reservation by Congress. Alaska Pacific Fisheries v. United States, \n248 \nU.S. 78\n.\n\nEver since 1915, Metlakatla has operated fish traps with the consent of the Secretary of the Interior. Following the enactment of the State's fish-trap law in 1959, the Secretary in the exercise of his transitional power over Alaska fisheries banned all fish traps except those operated by Metlakatla and by other Indians involved in the companion case, Organized Village of Kake v. Egan, post, p. 60. 24 Fed. Reg. 2053, 2056, 2069 (1959). The following year, having relinquished general control of the fisheries, the Secretary again authorized Metlakatla to operate fish traps at four of eight specified locations, citing as authority the White Act, 43 Stat. 464, as amended, 48 U.S.C. 221-228, and 4 of the Alaska Statehood Act, 72 Stat. 339, as amended by 73 Stat. 141. 25 CFR (1961 Supp.), pt. 88.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nWith this background we reach the present controversy. In May, 1959, just before the salmon season began, the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 45, 50]\n\u00a0\n State warned Metlakatla and other Indians that she would enforce the fish-trap law against them. The threat was intensified when the State arrested members of other Indian communities and seized one fish trap. Suits were thereupon filed by Metlakatla and by the appellants in the companion case in the interim United States District Court for the District of Alaska, seeking an injunction against interference with their asserted federal rights to fish with traps. All complaints were dismissed, 18 Alaska ___, 174 F. Supp. 500. Appeal was brought to this Court, as the Supreme Court of Alaska had not yet been fully organized. Pending decision, MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN granted a stay of enforcement by the State, 80 S. Ct. 33. The Court assumed jurisdiction and continued the stay but remanded the case to the newly constituted State Supreme Court primarily for its disposition of matters of local law, \n363 \nU.S. 555\n. That Court affirmed the District Court's dismissal, holding the fishtrap law applicable to Metlakatla and to the other appellants, and upholding its validity as so applied, ___ Alaska ___, 362 P.2d 901. From its judgment, the appeal is properly here under 28 U.S.C. 1257. We noted probable jurisdiction, \n368 \nU.S. 886\n.\n\nSeveral grounds of the decision below are now out of the case on concession of error by Alaska, but she firmly stands on the judgment in her favor. Metlakatla argues that it is immune from the fish-trap law because (1) state law cannot regulate Indian activities on Indian reservations; (2) the State cannot regulate a federal instrumentality; and (3) appellant has been authorized to operate traps by the Secretary of the Interior. The United States has supported Metlakatla as amicus curiae, see \n362 \nU.S. 967\n.\n\nThe Indians of southeastern Alaska, who have very substantially adopted and been adopted by the white man's civilization, were never in the hostile and isolated \n\n[369 \nU.S. 45, 51]\n\u00a0\n position of many tribes in other States. As early as 1886 a federal judge, holding Alaskan Indians subject to the Thirteenth Amendment, denied that the principle of Indian national sovereignty enunciated in Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, applied to them. In re Sah Quah, 31 F. 327 (D. Alaska). There were no Indian wars in Alaska, although on at least one occasion, see Gruening, The State of Alaska (1954), pp. 36-37, there were fears of an uprising. There was never an attempt in Alaska to isolate Indians on reservations. Very few were ever created, and the purpose of these, in contrast to many in other States, was not to confine the Indians for the protection of the white settlers but to safeguard the Indians against exploitation. Alaskan Indians are now voting citizens, some of whom occupy prominent public office in the state government. See United States v. Booth, 17 Alaska 561, 161 F. Supp. 269 (D. Alaska 1958); United States v. Libby, McNeil & Libby, 14 Alaska 37, 41-42, 107 F. Supp. 697, 699 (D. Alaska 1952). Metlakatlans, the State tells us, have always paid state taxes, in contrast to the practice described and prescribed for other reservations in The Kansas Indians, 5 Wall. 737, and it has always been assumed that the reservation is subject to state laws. United States v. Booth, 17 Alaska, at 563, 161 F. Supp., at 270. Congress in 1936, 49 Stat. 1250, 48 U.S.C. 358a, by authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to create Indian reservations of land reserved for Indian uses under 48 U.S.C. 358, seems to have believed that Metlakatla was no ordinary reservation, since Metlakatla alone is covered in 358. Finally, in United States v. Booth, supra, the District Court for Alaska held that a crime committed on the Metlakatla Reserve, before the extension of jurisdiction over Indian country to Alaska, see p. 56, infra, was punishable under territorial laws, since for the reasons here outlined the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 45, 52]\n\u00a0\n Reserve was not \"Indian country\" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 1151-1153.\n\nThe words \"set apart as a reservation,\" appearing in the statute creating the Annette Islands Reserve, are substantially the same as used in numerous other statutory reservations. E. g., 13 Stat. 63 (Uinta Valley, Utah); 13 Stat. 541, 559 (Colorado River); 18 Stat. 28 (Gros Ventre and others); 19 Stat. 28, 29 (Pawnee). None of these statutes made express provision for self-government or for state government. Some treaties, such as that with the Cherokees in 1828, 7 Stat. 311, expressly excluded state laws. Other treaties, however, while sometimes phrased in terms of a gift or assignment rather than a reservation of land, made no mention of state power. E. g., Treaty with the Shawnee Tribe, 1825, 7 Stat. 284; Treaty with the Potawatomies, 1837, 7 Stat. 532; Treaty with the New York Indians, 1838, 7 Stat. 550, 551; Treaty with the Sacs and Foxes, 1842, 7 Stat. 596. Later treaties \"set apart for the absolute and undisturbed use and occupation\" of the Indians certain lands. E. g., Treaty with the Arapahoes and Cheyennes, 1867, 15 Stat. 593, 594; Treaty with the Crow Indians, 1868, 15 Stat. 649, 650. The 1868 Treaty with the Navajos was similar. 15 Stat. 667, 668. And the 1855 treaty with the Quinault Indian Tribe, 12 Stat. 971, which the Supreme Court of Washington held barred state regulation of reservation fishing, promised only that lands would be \"reserved, for the use and occupation of the tribes.\" It was implemented by an executive order of November 7, 1873, by which certain lands were \"withdrawn from sale and set apart for the use\" of the tribe. See Pioneer Packing Co. v. Winslow, 159 Wash. 655, 657-658, 294 P. 557, 558.\n\nThe provision creating the Metlakatla Reserve in 1891 was added to a House bill dealing with timber lands on the floor of the Senate by Nebraska's Senator Manderson. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 45, 53]\n\u00a0\n Reciting the unfortunate experience of the Metlakatlans in British Columbia and their emigration to Alaska, Senator Manderson explained that his amendment was designed to dispel fears of expulsion from their new lands as from their old, or of intrusion by outsiders seeking to exploit the resources of the islands. The purpose, he stated, was \"simply to allow this band of Indians to remain there under such rules and regulations as the Secretary of the Interior may impose, and give them some recognized footing at that place.\" Remarks by Senators Dawes and Dolph were to the same effect. 21 Cong. Rec. 10092-10093 (1890). The amendment was agreed to and adopted by both Houses after a conference, with no further discussion.\n\nThis provision subjecting Metlakatla to rules and regulations of the Secretary of the Interior is unusual. Since 1849 the Secretary had been the officer of the United States charged with administration of the Indian laws, but none of the treaties or statutes which have come to our attention contained such a provision. The Cheyenne and Crow treaties, supra, provided that Congress might regulate matters on the reservations, but this was no delegation of Congress' powers to the Secretary. It was but a recognition by the Indians of powers the Constitution gave to the national legislature.\n\nThe regulations issued by the Secretary for the government of the Annette Islands January 28, 1915, appear to be without parallel. No such rules applying to other reservations are to be found in the Code of Federal Regulations. The Secretary vested powers of local government in an elective council, 25 CFR (1939 ed.), 1.2, which was given authority to pass ordinances required not to conflict with \"the laws of the United States, the laws of the Territory of Alaska, or the rules and regulations in this part,\" 1.10, and subject to review by the Secretary, 1.62. As a condition to the right to vote in local elections, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 45, 54]\n\u00a0\n members of the Reserve - limited to Metlakatlans and other natives, 1.51 - were required to swear obedience to local laws, laws of the United States, and laws of the Territory of Alaska, 1.52. Thus the Secretary, in the exercise of the authority delegated him by Congress, subjected self-government of Metlakatla not only to federal oversight but to territorial laws as well. However, as discussed above, an additional regulation issued by the Secretary in 1915 authorized the use of fish traps at Metlakatla, and this permission has been continued in regulations issued since statehood.\n\nAlaska urges that the regulations are invalid because neither the White Act nor the Statehood Act conferred authority on the Secretary to permit Metlakatlans to use fish traps. The State's premise is correct, Organized Village of Kake v. Egan, post, p. 60. However, Congress in 1891 gave the Secretary authority to make rules governing the Metlakatla Reservation, and his authority, like the reservation itself, Alaska Pacific Fisheries v. United States, \n248 \nU.S. 78\n, extended to the waters surrounding the islands. Does this Act validate the regulations in light of subsequent legislative and executive actions?\n\nThe Presidential Proclamation of 1916, 39 Stat. 1777, declared waters within 3,000 feet of Annette and adjacent islands to be a part of the Metlakatla Reservation and provided that the Indians should have the use of these waters \"under the general fisheries laws and regulations of the United States as administered by the Secretary of Commerce.\" Alaska argues that the purpose of this provision was to place Metlakatla fishermen in the same position as all others in Alaska by subjecting them to the same laws. In 1916 the general laws were federal; now they are those of the State. Therefore, the State contends, the policy of the Proclamation requires that the provision be construed as subjecting the Metlakatlans to the laws governing all other fishermen, which now include the state \n\n[369 \nU.S. 45, 55]\n\u00a0\n fish-trap law. The Metlakatlans have the right to exclude others from their waters, Alaska agrees, but not the right to be free from regulation.\n\nAlaska does not argue that the Proclamation deprived the Secretary of the Interior of the authority Congress gave him to prescribe rules governing fishing and other activities on the Annette Islands. Assuming the President had power to do so, he did not purport to exercise it. Quite the contrary. The Proclamation recites that the Secretary has determined to establish a cannery for the Metlakatlans, that the Secretary has been given authority to make regulations for Metlakatla by the statute of 1891, and that protection of the Indians' fishing rights is required to assure a supply of fish for the cannery. Apparently the Proclamation was prompted by the threatened encroachment of non-Indian fishermen into Metlakatla waters and the fear that the reservation of the islands might not protect the Indians against such intrusions. No statutory authority for the Proclamation was cited. It was declared to be issued under authority of \"the laws of the United States.\" It is clear that President Wilson was attempting to assist and promote the plans of the Secretary of the Interior to develop the reserve under his statutory authority, not to limit or destroy that authority. The subjection of Metlakatla to general fisheries laws and to regulations of the Secretary of Commerce thus did not make those laws and regulations superior to regulations of the Secretary of the Interior. Rather the general laws and Commerce regulations were adopted as a part of the Interior regulations, so far as not in conflict with other rules adopted by the Secretary of the Interior and subject to his further modification under the power given him in 1891.\n\nNor did the White Act impair the Secretary's power. That statute permitted the secretary for conservation purposes to limit the taking of salmon in areas of his designation, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 45, 56]\n\u00a0\n but prohibited his granting exclusive rights in so doing. This Court in Hynes v. Grimes Packing Co., \n337 \nU.S. 86\n, held that the prohibition bars the Secretary from creating exclusive White Act rights in Indians as well as in non-Indians, but it expressly disclaimed holding that no exclusive Indian rights may exist. \n337 \nU.S., at 118\n-119, 122-123. The Secretary's regulations did not create exclusivity; that was a part of the reservation as created in 1891 and clarified by the proclamation of 1916, which excluded others from fishing in Metlakatla waters.\n\nIn 1958, 72 Stat. 545, Alaska was added to the list of States and Territories permitted to exercise civil and criminal jurisdiction over Indian reservations. The State has not argued that this took away the power of the Secretary of the Interior to make regulations contrary to state law. Appellant has argued, to the contrary, that the statute expressly preserved Indian fishing rights from state laws. The statute granting States civil and criminal jurisdiction was passed in 1953, 67 Stat. 588, 18 U.S.C. 1162, 28 U.S.C. 1360. Subsection (b) of 18 U.S.C. 1162 provides that nothing therein shall authorize alienation, encumbrance, or taxation of Indian property, \"or shall authorize regulation of the use of such property in a manner inconsistent with any Federal treaty, agreement, or statute or with any regulation made pursuant thereto; or shall deprive any Indian or any Indian tribe, band, or community of any right, privilege, or immunity afforded under Federal treaty, agreement, or statute with respect to hunting, trapping, or fishing or the control, licensing, or regulation thereof.\"\n\nThis statute expressly protects against state invasion all uses of Indian property authorized by federal treaty, agreement, statute, or regulation, but only those fishing rights and privileges given by federal treaty, agreement, or statute. It might plausibly be argued, therefore, that \n\n[369 \nU.S. 45, 57]\n\u00a0\n fishing rights given by regulation are not protected and state jurisdiction is established. Legislative history is silent as to the interpretation of the provision. See H. R. Rep. No. 848, 83d Cong., 1st Sess.; S. Rep. No. 699, 83d Cong., 1st Sess.; 99 Cong. Rec. 9962, 10782, 10928 (1953). The apparent purpose of the proviso was to preserve federally granted fishing rights. It would be sheer speculation to attribute significance to the imperfect parallelism of the provisions protecting property and fishing rights in the absence of any suggested reason for excluding fishing rights based on regulations. The process of statutory drafting and evolution, here veiled from scrutiny, is too imprecise to permit such an inference. Cf. United States v. Mersky, \n361 \nU.S. 431, 437\n. In any event, the proviso also protects rights given the Indians by statute respecting the control and regulation of fishing, and the 1891 statute gave the Metlakatlans the right to fish under regulations of the Secretary of the Interior.\n\nSection 6 (e) of the Alaska Statehood Act, 72 Stat. 339, 340-341, providing for the conveyance of United States properties \"used for the sole purpose of conservation and protection of the fisheries and wildlife of Alaska,\" contemplated transfer to the State of the same measure of administration and jurisdiction over fisheries and wildlife as possessed by other States, S. Rep. No. 1929, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 13-14 (1950); H. R. Rep. No. 1731, 80th Cong., 2d Sess. 1 (1948); S. Rep. No. 1028, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. 31 (1954); S. Rep. No. 1163, 85th Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1957), see Geer v. Connecticut, \n161 \nU.S. 519\n, after the transition period during which the State was to establish machinery for this purpose. Section 4, however, as amended by 73 Stat. 141, required Alaska to disclaim all right and title to any United States property not granted her by the statute, and also \"to any lands or other property (including fishing rights), the right or title \n\n[369 \nU.S. 45, 58]\n\u00a0\n to which may be held by any Indians, Eskimos, or Aleuts (hereinafter called natives) or is held by the United States in trust for said natives.\" Such property was to \"be and remain under the absolute jurisdiction and control of the United States until disposed of under its authority, except to such extent as the Congress has prescribed or may hereafter prescribe,\" with immaterial exceptions, and provided that claims against the United States are neither enlarged, diminished, nor recognized by these provisions. This disclaimer is substantially the same as found in the Acts admitting 13 other States. See S. Rep. No. 315, 82d Cong., 1st Sess. 15 (1951).\n\nAlaska does not expressly argue that the Secretary's power was destroyed by the Statehood Act. She does, however, contend that control of all fishing was transferred to the State with no exception for Indian fishing, and that only the exclusiveness of Metlakatla's fishing rights was preserved. But legislative history makes clear that the transfer of jurisdiction over fishing was subject to rights reserved in 4. S. Rep. No. 1929, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 2 (1950).\n\nClearly this section does not protect only \"recognized\" Indian rights - those the taking of which would be compensable by the United States. Committee reports demonstrate the aim of Congress to preserve the status quo as to a broader class of \"right,\" including, in the case of land, mere possession or occupancy. Compensation was an issue Congress took pains to avoid. See H. R. Rep. No. 1731, 80th Cong., 2d Sess. 15 (1948); H. R. Rep. No. 255, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. 13 (1949); S. Rep. No. 1028, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. 4, 29-30 (1954); S. Rep. No. 1163, 85th Cong., 1st Sess. 15 (1957). We need not here explore the remoter reaches of this protection. The Metlakatla Reservation was Indian property within 4. Whether or not the \"absolute jurisdiction\" retained \n\n[369 \nU.S. 45, 59]\n\u00a0\n by the United States in 4 is exclusive of state authority, see Organized Village of Kake v. Egan, post, p. 60, the statute clearly preserves federal authority over the reservation. Federal authority was lodged in the Secretary in 1891, and it was not dislodged by the Statehood Act.\n\nHowever, in issuing the present regulations the Secretary relied not on the 1891 statute but on the White Act and the Statehood Act, neither of which authorized his action. In a letter to the Solicitor General, filed by the United States as an Appendix to its brief as amicus curiae, the Secretary left no doubt that in issuing the regulations he acted under compulsion of what he conceived to be his duty under the Statehood Act to preserve the status quo. He deemed himself, as it were, to be a mere automaton. The exercise of any authority that the Secretary has under the reservation statute to allow fish traps necessarily involves his judgment on a complex of facts, his evaluation of the relative weights of the Indians' need for traps and of the impact of traps at Metlakatla on the State's interest in conservation. We cannot make this determination for him.\n\nThe appropriate course is to vacate the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alaska and remand the case there to be held to give ample opportunity for the Secretary of the Interior with all reasonable expedition to determine, prior to the 1963 salmon fishing season, what, if any, authority he chooses to exercise in light of this opinion. Should the Secretary fail so to act, the parties may apply to the Alaska court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. See Addison v. Holly Hill Fruit Products, Inc., \n322 \nU.S. 607, 618\n-619. The stay granted by MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, and continued by the Court, will remain in force until the end of the 1962 salmon fishing season, as defined in the regulations issued by the Secretary of the Interior.\n\n    It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 25 Stat. 1009; 29 Stat. 316 (Treasury Department); 34 Stat. 478, now 48 U.S.C. 230-239, 241-242 (Commerce Department); 43 Stat. 464, now 48 U.S.C. 221-228 (Commerce Department).

He subsequently filed in that court a paper entitled \"Motion for Dismissal of Sentence and Reversal of Verdict,\" claiming, inter alia, that materially false testimony had been used against him at the trial. That court treated that motion as one to vacate sentence under 28 U.S.C. 2255 and denied it. The Court of Appeals affirmed, though petitioner had produced in that court, for the first time, an affidavit of a police captain which contradicted the testimony of a prosecution witness.

Cf. Mesarosh v. United States, \n352 \nU.S. 1\n. We, of course, intimate no view upon the merits of the motion.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK, with whom MR. JUSTICE HARLAN and MR. JUSTICE STEWART join, dissenting.\n\nThe Court sua sponte summarily vacates this judgment affirming the denial of a 2255 application and remands the matter for a hearing, treating the case as one involving a motion for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence. I characterize the application below, titled a \"Motion for Reversal of Verdict and Dismissal of Sentence,\" as one under 28 U.S.C. 2255 not only because of its wording but also because the petitioner, the Government, the trial court, and the Court of Appeals (including the dissenting judge) so styled it. Although petitioner in the alternative contends that the wording of this application could serve as \"notice of appeal,\" he never suggests it should be treated as a motion for a new trial. If petitioner had intended the application in question to serve as a motion for a new trial, he would have so labeled it as he did the motion filed four days after the verdict. The Court, despite this treatment by all the parties and judges below, tags the application as a motion for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence in order to escape the limitations of 2255. I cannot give this pleading such a twist, but even if I could I would have to find the allegations insufficient to meet the requirements of Rule 33, which governs motions for new trials.\n\nThe newly discovered evidence consists of an affidavit by Police Captain Brown which merely corroborates the testimony of petitioner and another witness. It appears that during the investigation of the robbery in question the petitioner and one Adcock were placed in a police line-up supervised by Police Captain Brown. From this \n\n[368 \nU.S. 439, 441]\n\u00a0\n line-up Ellis, one of the victims, identified Adcock as the robber. On trial Ellis testified that his identification was not positive and that he only picked Adcock as one who resembled the robber. Both Adcock and petitioner, however, testified that Ellis had positively identified Adcock in the line-up. There is no contention or showing that the Government knew that Ellis' testimony was false. Brown's affidavit was obtained while the case was pending in the Court of Appeals.\n\nThe affidavit, of course, was not newly discovered evidence. Both Adcock and the petitioner were in the line-up, and both knew that Police Captain Brown was likewise present and saw and heard Ellis' identification. In such a situation petitioner's motion for a new trial would be untimely because Rule 33, Fed. Rules Crim. Proc., permits such a motion to be made more than five days after a verdict of guilty only in the case of newly discovered evidence. However, even if the facts in the affidavit were newly discovered, it would still not be sufficient under Rule 33. As was said in Mesarosh v. United States, \n352 \nU.S. 1, 9\n, \"new evidence which is `merely cumulative or impeaching' is not, according to the often-repeated statement of the courts, an adequate basis for the grant of a new trial. [Citing cases.]\"\n\nOn the other hand, if the Court treats the application as one under 2255, it is insufficient. Under that section the application would be a collateral attack on the conviction. In such a case it is essential for the moving party to establish not only that perjury existed but also that the prosecution used the testimony knowingly and wilfully to obtain a conviction. E. g., Griffin v. United States, 103 U.S. App. D.C. 317, 258 F.2d 411 (1958); Tilghman v. Hunter, 167 F.2d 661 (C. A. 10th Cir. 1948). \n\n[368 \nU.S. 439, 442]\n\u00a0\n This long-standing limitation was not erased by Mesarosh v. United States, supra, which involved a direct attack on the conviction rather than a collateral attack.\n\nI regret that the Court, in an effort to avoid the requirements of 2255, treats an application thereunder as a motion for a new trial. In my view this is a new approach to 2255 cases. It extends that section far beyond its intended scope and can only plague us in future cases. I therefore dissent. \n\n[368 \nU.S. 439, 443]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","138":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMORALES v.

The grain in this last shot had been treated with a chemical insecticide, and the petitioners were injured by fumes from the chemical, made noxious by concentration in the closely confined area where they were working.\n\nThe petitioners brought the present suit against the City of Galveston and the owner of the vessel to recover for their injuries.\n1\n Their claim was predicated upon the negligence of the City and the shipowner, and upon the unseaworthiness of the ship.

On certiorari (\n364 \nU.S. 295\n) we vacated the judgment and remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for consideration in the light of Mitchell v. Trawler Racer, Inc., \n362 \nU.S. 539\n, which had been decided in the interim. That court, one judge dissenting, was of the view that Mitchell was inapplicable to the facts of the present case, and again affirmed the District Court's judgment, 291 F.2d 97. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 165, 167]\n\u00a0\n We granted certiorari to consider a seemingly significant question of admiralty law. \n368 \nU.S. 816\n.\n\nThe factual issues bearing upon the alleged negligence of the City and shipowner were determined in their favor by the District Court. Specifically, the court found that the City had not itself applied the fumigant to the grain in question, and that neither of the respondents knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, that the grain had been improperly fumigated at an inland point by someone else.\n2\n Even a cursory examination of \n\n[370 \nU.S. 165, 168]\n\u00a0\n the lengthy record shows that these findings were based upon substantial evidence. They were re-examined and affirmed on appeal.\n3\n We cannot say that they were clearly erroneous. McAllister v. United States, \n348 \nU.S. 19, 20\n-21.\n\nOf greater significance in this litigation is the issue which prompted our remand to the Court of Appeals for reconsideration. Briefly stated, the question is whether, upon the facts as found by the District Court, it was error to hold that the Grelmarion was seaworthy at the time the petitioners were injured.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nIn the Mitchell case, supra, we reversed a judgment for the defendant, because the District Court and the Court of Appeals had mistakenly imported concepts of common-law negligence into an action for unseaworthiness. There the jury had erroneously been instructed that liability for unseaworthiness could attach only if the alleged unseaworthy condition was \"there for a reasonably long period of time so that a shipowner ought to have seen that it was removed.\"\n5\n The Court of Appeals had affirmed on the theory that, at least as to an unseaworthy condition that arises during the progress of the voyage, the shipowner's obligation \"is merely to see that \n\n[370 \nU.S. 165, 169]\n\u00a0\n reasonable care is used under the circumstances . . . incident to the correction of the newly arisen defect.\"\n6\n It was alleged in that case that a ship's rail which was habitually used as a means of egress to the dock was rendered unseaworthy by the presence of slime and gurry. We did not decide the issue, but reversed for a new trial under proper criteria, holding that the shipowner's actual or constructive knowledge of the unseaworthy condition is not essential to his liability, and that he has an absolute duty \"to furnish a vessel and appurtenances reasonably fit for their intended use.\" \n362 \nU.S., at 550\n.\n\nIn the present case the Court of Appeals was of the view that the trial judge's determination of the Grelmarion's seaworthiness at the time the petitioners were injured was in no way inconsistent with our decision in the Mitchell case. We agree. The District Judge did not, as in Mitchell, hold that unseaworthiness liability depends upon the shipowner's actual or constructive knowledge. He did not, as in Mitchell, indicate that liability may be excused if an unseaworthy condition is merely temporary. Rather, as the Court of Appeals pointed out, the trier of the facts found, upon substantial evidence, that \"the cause of the injury was not any defect in the ship but the fact that the last shot of grain which was being loaded was contaminated . . . .\" 291 F.2d, at 98.\n\nThe trial court found, upon substantial evidence, that what happened was an unexpected, isolated occurrence. Several years before there had been three, or perhaps four, incidents involving injury to longshoremen from grain which had been fumigated by the city itself. But at the time the present case arose the city had adopted a series of safety and inspection measures which made completely innocuous the grain which it fumigated, and \n\n[370 \nU.S. 165, 170]\n\u00a0\n \"vast quantities of wheat and other grains had been loaded through the elevator, some eight to ten percent of which had been fumigated by the city, without similar incident in recent years.\"\n7\n The court found that the fumes in the present case came from \"chloropicrin, an insecticide which had never been used by the respondent city.\"\n8\n The petitioners question none of these findings here. Under these circumstances we cannot say that it was error for the court to rule that the absence of a forced ventilation system in the hold did not constitute unseaworthiness.\n9\n\u00a0\n\nA vessel's unseaworthiness might arise from any number of individualized circumstances. Her gear might be defective, her appurtenances in disrepair, her crew unfit. The method of loading her cargo, or the manner of its stowage, might be improper. Mahnich v. Southern S. S. Co., \n321 \nU.S. 96\n; Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, \n328 \nU.S. 85\n; Pope & Talbot, Inc., v. Hawn, \n346 \nU.S. 406\n; Alaska Steamship Co. v. Petterson, \n347 \nU.S. 396\n; Rogers v.

Ellerman Lines, Ltd., \n369 \nU.S. 355\n. For any or all of these reasons, or others, a vessel might not be reasonably fit \n\n[370 \nU.S. 165, 171]\n\u00a0\n for her intended service. What caused injury in the present case, however, was not the ship, its appurtenances, or its crew, but the isolated and completely unforeseeable introduction of a noxious agent from without. The trier of the facts ruled, under proper criteria, that the Grelmarion was not in any manner unfit for the service to which she was to be put, and we cannot say that his determination was wrong.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Petitioners of course received compensation and medical treatment under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. 901 et seq. 181 F.

I find that neither of the respondents knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, that this quantity of grain, which had been improperly treated with an excessive amount of fumigant, was in the elevator or loaded aboard the Grelmarion; and that (for all the evidence shows here) the respondent city, in the operation of its elevator, had never received knowledge of a prior instance where chloropicrin or other fumigants applied at inland elevators had adhered to the grain sufficiently long as to present danger after receipt by the elevator.\n\n\"15. I find that the respondent city was not negligent in failing to know or learn of the presence of this quantity of grain within its elevator, in failing to make some additional inspection therefor, or in any other particular. The record shows without dispute that careful and painstaking inspections and examinations were made under governmental authority when the grain was received, and again as it was disbursed by the elevator, which in the present instance failed to detect the presence of the remaining traces of fumigant in this quantity of grain. I find that had additional inspections been made by the respondent city, there is no reason to believe that such inspections would have been more successful.\n\n .   .  .   .  .\n\n\n\n\"17. I find that the Grelmarion's cargo spaces were of customary design and construction; that they were clean, and in all respects ready to receive the wheat; and had been surveyed and approved prior to loading.

While the Grelmarion's cargo spaces were not equipped with forced ventilation systems, I find that only very rarely is this the case on grain vessels, and that it is not necessary or customary. . . .\"\n\n\"The finding heretofore has been made that the noxious gases and fumes were introduced into the bin with the last `shot' of grain, and resulted from a fumigant that had been improperly applied, and that had adhered to the grain an unusually long period of time. Under these circumstances, I find that the admission thereof into the bin of the vessel did not cause the Grelmarion to become unseaworthy, the vessel and all its appurtenances being entirely adequate and suitable in every respect.\" 181 F. Supp., at 206-207.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE BLACK concur, dissenting.\n\nThe District Court found that the libellants were injured in 1957 as a result of a release into the hold of a \"shot\" of grain that completely closed the hatch opening, which was the only source of ventilation for the hold in which they were working. This grain had been treated by chemicals for weevil infestation; and the noxious fumes from those chemicals injured libellants.\n\nThe vessel's cargo spaces were not equipped with a forced ventilation system. Grain vessels, the District Court found, rarely are so equipped; and it concluded that forced ventilation is \"not necessary or customary.\" If this were an isolated instance of fumigated grain releasing noxious gases, no claim of unseaworthiness could be maintained. But this was not an isolated instance. Of the wheat loaded through this elevator, some 8 to 10% was fumigated by the city. Wheat is commonly fumigated either in the elevators or in railroad cars. When the fumigant is properly applied, the gases and fumes are dissipated so as not to be dangerous or harmful after 24 to 48 hours. The District Court found, however, that to the knowledge of the owners of the vessel several recent \n\n[370 \nU.S. 165, 172]\n\u00a0\n incidents like that in the present case had occurred in Galveston, causing injury to longshoremen - one in 1949, one in 1950, two in 1953.\n\nA vessel without a forced ventilation system would be seaworthy if this injury were an unexpected, isolated occurrence. But I agree with Judge Rives of the Court of Appeals that the vessel and her appurtenances were not \"reasonably fit for their intended use\" (291 F.2d 97, 99), where up to 10% of the grain loaded from this elevator was fumigated and where the owners had knowledge of like accidents. One \"intended service\" of this vessel was, therefore, the loading of fumigated grain which in the past had given off noxious fumes. Unseaworthiness by reason of the absence of a forced ventilation system is clearer here than it was in Mitchell v. Trawler Racer, Inc., \n362 \nU.S. 539\n, where temporary slime and gurry on the ship's rail rendered it unseaworthy. The unseaworthy condition in the present case had no such temporary span. What happened here shows that the vessel was unseaworthy whenever fumigated grain was being loaded. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 165, 173]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","139":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMURPHY v.

Laughlin, Jr. and Pauline B. Heller, for respondent.\n  Petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied.\n\n\n Mr. Justice BLACK dissents:\n  The Trading with the Enemy Act1 authorizes the Government to seize and confiscate under some circumstances the property of aliens. By its denial of certiorari in this case the Court leaves standing a judgment of confiscation2 under circumstances which in my judgment the Act does not authorize. I therefore fell impelled to dissent.\n  In May 1940 Hitler's forces, violating the historic neutrality of the Netherlands, suddenly invaded that country, largely destroyed one of its finest cities and within a short time occupied the whole country. Although the United States soon recognized and allied itself with a group of Royal Netherlands citizens who had escaped and set up an independent government- in-exile in London,3 that occupation continued until May 1945 when troops from this country and its allies finally managed to liberate the Netherlands from the German forces. Within several weeks this country's ally, the free Netherlands Government, assumed lawful command of its own citizens and territory. It was not, however, until some five and a \n\n[370 \nU.S. 940\n, 941]\n\u00a0\n half years later, long after the end of the Nazi occupation and the return of the lawful government of the Netherlands, that the Alien Property Custodian in 1951, purportedly acting under the Trading With the Enemy Act, seized and confiscated the four bank accounts in this country belonging to the petitioning Dutch company which form the object of this lawsuit. That confiscation of petitioner's property was sustained by the Court of Appeals on the sole ground that the Netherlands, our friend and ally, where petitioner was incorporated, had been overrun and occupied by Germany during the war. Because this result seems so contrary to the Purpose of Congress in passing the Trading With the Enemy Act and raises such grave constitutional questions under the Fifth Amendment's command that the Government not take private property without paying just compensation, I think we should grant certiorari to review the Court of Appeals' decision.\n  The Trading with the Enemy Act provides that the President may seize 'During the time of war' 'any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest.' That Act also provides, however, that 'Any person not an enemy or ally of enemy' may sue to compel the return of his property. And even though the Act defines and 'enemy' as 'Any individual, partnership, or other body of individuals, of any nationality, resident within the territory (including that occupied by the military and naval forces) for any nation with which the United States is at war ... and any corporation incorporated within such territory ...,' it does not say, as did the Court of Appeals, that every corporation which was at any time present within territory while that territory was occupied by an enemy is an 'enemy' within the meaning of the Act. I do not see how it can be thought that Congress intended by this Act to authorize \n\n[370 \nU.S. 940\n, 942]\n\u00a0\n the confiscation, between the end of actual occupation in 1945 and the official end of the war in 1951,4 of every bit of property in this country owned by the citizens and corporations of the Netherlands, France, Norway, Belgium and other countries solely because those countries, our staunch friends and allies, and during the war been overrun by an enemy that was trying to destroy them and us. \n5\n I can understand how Congress might be thought to have desired to authorize the President to seize the property of citizens and corporations of friendly countries and allies when those countries were at the time being occupied by an enemy which might be able to use their property to carry on war against us. I do not believe, however, that Congress intended to place a permanent taint on the property of our friends so that whenever that property showed up in this country it might be sized-even though long after our friends' countries had been fortunate enough to escape the occupation clutches of our common enemy. It would be bad enough after the end of occupation to confiscate the property of friendly aliens which had been in this country during the occupation but to go beyond that and confiscate as here a bank account which did not even exist in this country until 1948, three years after the return of lawful government to the Netherlands, seems wholly contrary to any purpose Congress could have had in the Act. Moreover, to construe this statute this way raises serious questions about the constitutionality of the Act as applied, for it has long been settled that the provision of the Fifth Amendment requiring the payment of just compensation \n\n[370 \nU.S. 940\n, 943]\n\u00a0\n when private property is taken for public use protects friendly aliens as well as citizens. \n6\n And it is obviously no answer to this to say, as did the Court of Appeals, that the confiscation was proper because this Government needed the property after the war to support the cost of its past war efforts. Our constitutional guarantee against uncompensated government seizure of private property surely does not melt away merely because public officials believe the Government needs to seize property without paying for it.\n  This case would be course be far different if the Court of Appeals had rested on the two other grounds urged by the Government below: (1) that petitioner was 'enemy-tainted,' (2) and also that it was engaged in doing business in Germany which was enemy territory. But the Court of Appeals did not rest on either of these grounds and we must accept the case as it comes to us or fail to accord petitioner its full day in court. This is particularly true here, since the question of enemy domination, if litigated, would have to be decided in light of Kaufman v. Societe Internationale,7 where we held that innocent stockholders even of enemy corporations must be protected from having their property confiscated.\n  It is true that the refusal of the Court to grant certiorari in this case gives no express approval to the interpretation of the Act made by the Court of Appeals and leaves that question open for final authoritative decision later. The Court's refusal to act now, however, does leave standing the Court of Appeals' decision as a precedent in the lower federal courts which will until reviewed here hang as a cloud over the property rights in this country of citizens of foreign countries.  \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 40 Stat. 411, as amended, 50 U.S.C.App.  1 et seq.  \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 299 F.2d 923.  \n[\nFootnote 3\n] See Mutual Aid Agreement between the United States and the Netherlands, July 8, 1942, 56 Stat. 1554; and Mutual Aid Agreement, April 30, 1945, 59 Stat. 1627. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Joint Resolution to terminate the state of war between the United States and the Government of Germany, October 19, 1951, 65 Stat. 451.  \n[\nFootnote 5\n] Cf.

They again appealed from the judgment of that court sustaining the constitutionality of the statute against their claim, in a declaratory-judgment proceeding, that it violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Held: The appeal is dismissed for want of a substantial federal question.\n\n Reported below: 58 Wash. 2d 111, 361 P.2d 551.\n\nFrancis Hoague for appellants.\n\nJohn J. O'Connell, Attorney General of Washington, Herbert H. Fuller, Deputy Attorney General, and Timothy R. Malone, Assistant Attorney General, for appellees.\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\nThe motion to dismiss is granted and the appeal is dismissed for want of a substantial federal question.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting.\n\nThe disposition that the Court makes of the case resolves one of the questions presented by the appeal, viz., that appellants are entitled to a hearing before they can be discharged for refusing to take the oath. This was the holding below on the remand.\n1\n 58 Wash. 2d 111, 132, 361 P.2d 551, 564. \n\n[368 \nU.S. 436, 437]\n\u00a0\n\n\nYet a remand for that purpose does not answer the other questions tendered, which concern the oath in question and First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.\n\nThe oath Washington demands of a teacher (Wash. Rev. Code, 1951, 9.81.070) requires him to swear he is not a \"subversive person,\" who is defined as\n\n\". . . any person who commits, attempts to commit, or aids in the commission, or advocates, abets, advises or teaches by any means any person to commit, attempt to commit, or aid in the commission of any act intended to overthrow, destroy or alter, or to assist in the overthrow, destruction or alteration of, the constitutional form of the government of the United States, or of the state of Washington, or any political subdivision of either of them by revolution, force, or violence; or who with knowledge that the organization is an organization as described in subsections (2) and (3) hereof, becomes or remains a member of a subversive organization or a foreign subversive organization.\" (Italics added.) Wash. Rev. Code, 1951, 9.81.010 (5), as amended in 1953.\n\n\n One aspect of the question the Court does not answer is akin to the one we had in Cramp v. Board of Public Instruction, ante, p. 278. There we held that an oath which required a teacher to say he had never knowingly lent his \"aid\" or \"support\" or \"advice\" or \"counsel\" or \"influence\" to the Communist Party was unconstitutional, because it brought or might bring into its net people who, by parallelism of conduct, might be said to have given \"aid\" to the Communist Party though the cause they espoused was wholly lawful.\n\nThis oath presents the question whether one who plans to \"alter\" the Government of the United States by \"revolution\" or who knowingly belongs to a group that sponsors \n\n[368 \nU.S. 436, 438]\n\u00a0\n that idea can be disqualified as a teacher. To \"alter\" has been the objective of many who have proposed constitutional amendments. The idea of \"revolution\" is an American concept\n2\n that at least until recently has been greatly reversed. A \"revolution\" that operates through the route of constitutional amendments would, at least arguably, be in keeping with our ideas of freedom of belief and expression. I mention this matter not to decide it but to indicate its gravity and importance.\n\nThe judgment below dismissed the complaint. That action, together with what we do today, deprives appellants of their right to declaratory relief on questions we have never decided. They are remitted to the administrative relief afforded by a hearing - a relief they can get only if they refuse to take the oath. Whether they can preserve in an administrative proceeding the full array of constitutional questions which they now tender is at least debatable, since the judgment that dismisses their complaint decides all the constitutional questions, except the right to a hearing, against them.\n\nFor the reasons I dissent from the disposal made of the case and vote to note jurisdiction.\n\nFor the reasons stated by MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS in his dissent, and others, MR. JUSTICE BLACK also dissents from the dismissal of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The purpose of our remand when the case was here earlier was to have that question of local law resolved.

Boles, Warden, also on certiorari to the same Court.\n\n West Virginia's habitual criminal statute provides for a mandatory life sentence upon the third conviction \"of a crime punishable by confinement in a penitentiary.\" The increased penalty is to be invoked by an information filed by the prosecuting attorney \"immediately upon conviction and before sentence.\" In such proceedings, in which they were represented by counsel and did not request continuances or raise any matters in defense but did concede the applicability of the statute to the circumstances of their cases, petitioners were sentenced to life imprisonment. Subsequently they petitioned the State Supreme Court for writs of habeas corpus, alleging that the Act had been applied without advance notice and to only a minority of those subject to its provisions, in violation of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Their petitions were denied. Held:\n\n 1. Due process does not require advance notice that the trial on the substantive offense will be followed by an habitual criminal accusation. It does require a reasonable opportunity to defend against such an accusation; but the records show that petitioners were not denied such an opportunity. Pp. 451-454.\n\n\n 2. The failure to proceed against other offenders because of a lack of knowledge of prior offenses or because of the exercise of reasonable selectivity in enforcement does not deny equal protection to persons who are prosecuted, and petitioners did not allege that the failure to prosecute others was due to any other reason. Pp. 454-456.\n\n\n Affirmed.\n\nDavid Ginsburg, acting under appointment by the Court, \n365 \nU.S. 826\n, argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioners. \n\n[368 \nU.S. 448, 449]\n\u00a0\n\n\nGeorge H. Mitchell, Assistant Attorney General of West Virginia, argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was C. Donald Robertson, Attorney General. Fred H. Caplan entered an appearance for respondent.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe petitioners in these consolidated cases are serving life sentences imposed under West Virginia's habitual criminal statute. This Act provides for a mandatory life sentence upon the third conviction \"of a crime punishable by confinement in a penitentiary.\"\n1\n The increased penalty is to be invoked by an information filed by the prosecuting attorney \"immediately upon conviction and before sentence.\"\n2\n Alleging that this Act had been applied without advance notice and to only a minority of those subject to its provisions, in violation respectively of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, the petitioners filed separate petitions for writs of habeas corpus in the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia. Both of their petitions were denied without opinion. Unlike Chewning v. Cunningham, ante, p. 443, here each of the petitioners was represented by counsel at the time he was sentenced. Finding the cases representative of the many recidivist cases that have been docketed in this Court the past few Terms, we granted certiorari. \n365 \nU.S. 810\n. We now affirm the judgment in each case.\n\nWilliam Oyler, the petitioner in No. 56, was convicted of murder in the second degree on February 5, 1953, which offense carried a penalty of from 5 to 18 years' imprisonment. Sentence was deferred, and on February 11 his motion for a new trial was overruled. On that same date \n\n[368 \nU.S. 448, 450]\n\u00a0\n the Prosecuting Attorney requested and was granted leave to file an information in writing alleging that Oyler was the same person who had suffered three prior convictions in Pennsylvania which were punishable by confinement in a penitentiary. After being cautioned as to the effect of such information, Oyler, accompanied by his counsel, acknowledged in open court that he was the person named in the information. The court then determined that the defendant had thrice been convicted of crimes punishable by confinement in a penitentiary and sentenced him to life imprisonment. In so doing the court indicated that the life sentence was mandatory under the statute and recommended that Oyler be paroled as soon as he was eligible. In 1960 Oyler filed a habeas corpus application in the Supreme Court of Appeals alleging a denial of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment in that he had not been given advance notice of his prosecution as a recidivist which prevented him from showing the inapplicability of the habitual criminal law. The statute was alleged to be inapplicable because he had never been sentenced to imprisonment in a penitentiary although he had been convicted of crimes subjecting him to the possibility of such sentence.\n3\n He also attacked his sentence on the equal protection ground previously set forth.\n\nIn 1957 Paul Crabtree, the petitioner in No. 57, pleaded guilty to forging a $35 check, which offense carried a penalty of from 2 to 10 years' imprisonment. Sentence was deferred, and a week later the Prosecuting Attorney informed the court that Crabtree had suffered two previous felony convictions, one in the State of Washington and one in West Virginia. The trial judge, after cautioning Crabtree of the effect of the information and \n\n[368 \nU.S. 448, 451]\n\u00a0\n his rights under it, inquired if he was in fact the accused person. Crabtree, who had been represented by counsel throughout, admitted in open court that he was such person. Upon this admission and the accused's further statement that he had nothing more to say, the court proceeded to sentence him to life imprisonment. In 1960 Crabtree sought habeas corpus relief in the Supreme Court of Appeals claiming denial of due process because of the absence of notice which prevented him from showing he had never been convicted in Walla Walla County, Washington, as had been alleged in the information.\n4\n Like Oyler, he also raised the equal protection ground.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nPetitioners recognize that the constitutionality of the practice of inflicting severer criminal penalties upon habitual offenders is no longer open to serious challenge;\n5\n however, they contend that in West Virginia such penalties are being invoked in an unconstitutional manner. It is petitioners' position that procedural due process under the Fourteenth Amendment requires notice of the habitual criminal accusation before the trial on the third \n\n[368 \nU.S. 448, 452]\n\u00a0\n offense or at least in time to afford a reasonable opportunity to meet the recidivist charge.\n\nEven though an habitual criminal charge does not state a separate offense, the determination of whether one is an habitual criminal is \"essentially independent\" of the determination of guilt on the underlying substantive offense. Chandler v. Fretag, \n348 \nU.S. 3, 8\n (1954). Thus, although the habitual criminal issue may be combined with the trial of the felony charge, \"it is a distinct issue, and it may appropriately be the subject of separate determination.\" Graham v. West Virginia, \n224 \nU.S. 616, 625\n (1912). If West Virginia chooses to handle the matter as two separate proceedings, due process does not require advance notice that the trial on the substantive offense will be followed by an habitual criminal proceeding.\n6\n See Graham v. West Virginia, supra.\n\nNevertheless, a defendant must receive reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard relative to the recidivist charge even if due process does not require that notice be given prior to the trial on the substantive offense. Such requirements are implicit within our decisions in Chewning v. Cunningham, supra; Reynolds v. Cochran, \n365 \nU.S. 525\n (1961); Chandler v. Fretag, supra. Although these cases were specifically concerned with the right to assistance of counsel, it would have been an idle accomplishment to say that due process requires counsel but not the right to reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard.\n\nAs interpreted by its highest court, West Virginia's recidivist statute does not require the State to notify the \n\n[368 \nU.S. 448, 453]\n\u00a0\n defendant prior to trial on the substantive offense that information of his prior convictions will be presented in the event he is found guilty.\n7\n Thus notice of the State's invocation of the statute is first brought home to the accused when, after conviction on the substantive offense but before sentencing, the information is read to him in open court as was done here. At this point petitioners were required to plead to the information. The statute expressly provides for a jury trial on the issue of identity if the accused either denies he is the person named in the information or just remains silent.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nBut the petitioners, who were represented by counsel, neither denied they were the persons named nor remained silent. Nor did they object or seek a continuance on the ground that they had not received adequate notice and needed more time to determine how to respond with respect to the issue of their identity. Rather, both petitioners rendered further inquiry along this line unnecessary by their acknowledgments in open court that they were the same persons who had previously been convicted. In such circumstances the petitioners are in no position now to assert that they were not given a fair opportunity to respond to the allegations as to their identity.\n\nThey assert, however, that they would have raised other defenses if they had been given adequate notice of the recidivist charges. It is, of course, true that identity is not the only issue presented in a recidivist proceeding, for, as pointed out by Mr. Justice Hughes (later Chief Justice) when this Court first reviewed West Virginia's habitual criminal law, this statute contemplates valid convictions which have not been subsequently nullified. Graham v. West Virginia, supra. A list of the more obvious issues \n\n[368 \nU.S. 448, 454]\n\u00a0\n would also include such matters as whether the previous convictions are of the character contemplated by West Virginia's statute and whether the required procedure has been followed in invoking it. Indeed, we may assume that any infirmities in the prior convictions open to collateral attack could have been reached in the recidivist proceedings, either because the state law so permits\n9\n or due process so requires. But this is a question we need not and do not decide, for neither the petitioners nor their counsel attempted during the recidivist proceedings to raise the issues which they now seek to raise or, indeed, any other issues. They were not, therefore, denied the right to do so. The petitioners' claim that they were deprived of due process because of inadequate opportunity to contest the habitual criminal accusation must be rejected in these cases. Each of the petitioners had a lawyer at his side, and neither the petitioners nor their counsel sought in any way to raise any matters in defense or intimated that a continuance was needed to investigate the existence of any possible defense. On the contrary, the record clearly shows that both petitioners personally and through their lawyers conceded the applicability of the law's sanctions to the circumstances of their cases.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nPetitioners also claim they were denied the equal protection of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. In his petition for a writ of habeas corpus to the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, Oyler stated:\n\n \"Petitioner was discriminated against as an Habitual Criminal in that from January, 1940, to \n\n[368 \nU.S. 448, 455]\n\u00a0\n June, 1955, there were six men sentenced in the Taylor County Circuit Court who were subject to prosecution as Habitual offenders, Petitioner was the only man thus sentenced during this period. It is a matter of record that the five men who were not prosecuted as Habitual Criminals during this period, all had three or more felony convictions and sentences as adults, and Petitioner's former convictions were a result of Juvenile Court actions.\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n\"#5. The Petitioner was discriminated against by selective use of a mandatory State Statute, in that 904 men who were known offenders throughout the State of West Virginia were not sentenced as required by the mandatory Statutes, Chapter 61, Article 11, Sections 18 and 19 of the Code. Equal Protection and Equal Justice was [sic] denied.\"\n\n\n Statistical data based on prison records were appended to the petition to support the latter allegation. Crabtree in his petition included similar statistical support and alleged:\n\n  \"The said Statute are [sic] administered and  applied in such a manner as to be in violation of  Equal Protection and Equal Justice therefor in  conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment to the  Constitution of the United States.\"\n\n\n Thus petitioners' contention is that the habitual criminal statute imposes a mandatory duty on the prosecuting authorities to seek the severer penalty against all persons coming within the statutory standards but that it is done only in a minority of cases.\n10\n This, petitioners \n\n[368 \nU.S. 448, 456]\n\u00a0\n argue, denies equal protection to those persons against whom the heavier penalty is enforced. We note that it is not stated whether the failure to proceed against other three-time offenders was due to lack of knowledge of the prior offenses on the part of the prosecutors or was the result of a deliberate policy of proceeding only in a certain class of cases or against specific persons. The statistics merely show that according to penitentiary records a high percentage of those subject to the law have not been proceeded against. There is no indication that these records of previous convictions, which may not have been compiled until after the three-time offenders had reached the penitentiary, were available to the prosecutors.\n11\n Hence the allegations set out no more than a failure to prosecute others because of a lack of knowledge of their prior offenses. This does not deny equal protection due petitioners under the Fourteenth Amendment. See Sanders v. Waters, 199 F.2d 317 (C. A. 10th Cir. 1952); Oregon v. Hicks, 213 Ore. 619, 325 P.2d 794 (1958).\n\nMoreover, the conscious exercise of some selectivity in enforcement is not in itself a federal constitutional violation. Even though the statistics in this case might imply a policy of selective enforcement, it was not stated that the selection was deliberately based upon an unjustifiable standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Therefore grounds supporting a finding of a denial of equal protection were not alleged. Oregon v. Hicks, supra; cf. Snowden v. Hughes, \n321 \nU.S. 1\n (1944); Yick Wo v. Hopkins, \n118 \nU.S. 356\n (1886) (by implication).\n\nThe other points raised by petitioners, such as the misstatement of the Washington county in which Crabtree \n\n[368 \nU.S. 448, 457]\n\u00a0\n was convicted and the fact that Oyler actually served in a Pennsylvania correctional home rather than a penitentiary, all involve state questions with which we are not concerned. Since the highest court of West Virginia handed down no opinion, we do not know what questions its judgment foreclosed. If any remain open, our judgment would not affect a test of them in appropriate state proceedings.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] W. Va. Code, 1961, 6130.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] W. Va. Code, 1961, 6131.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The statute has been interpreted as requiring only that the previous convictions be such that imprisonment in a penitentiary could have been imposed. State ex rel. Johnson v. Skeen, 140 W. Va. 896, 87 S. E. 2d 521 (1955).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The record indicates that instead of in Walla Walla Crabtree was convicted in Yakima County, Washington. At the time he was sentenced as a habitual criminal, he admitted that he had previously been sentenced to imprisonment in the State of Washington for a term of 20 years.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] E. g., Moore v. Missouri, \n159 \nU.S. 673\n (1895). West Virginia's statute is a carryover from the laws of Virginia, Va. Code, 1860, c. 199, 25-26, and became its law when West Virginia was organized as a separate State. Since that time it has remained basically the same, save for a 1943 procedural amendment which provided that the statute should be invoked by information filed after conviction rather than by allegation in the indictment upon which the subject was being prosecuted for a substantive offense. In 1912 this Court upheld the constitutionality of the statute. Graham v. West Virginia, \n224 \nU.S. 616\n (1912).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Any other rule would place a difficult burden on the imposition of a recidivist penalty. Although the fact of prior conviction is within the knowledge of the defendant, often this knowledge does not come home to the prosecutor until after the trial, and in many cases the prior convictions are not discovered until the defendant reaches the penitentiary.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] West Virginia v. Blankenship, 137 W. Va. 1, 69 S. E. 2d 398 (1952).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] W. Va. Code, 1961, 6131.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] The fact that the statute expressly provides for a jury trial on the issue of identity and is silent as to how other issues are to be determined does not foreclose the raising of issues other than identity. This is especially clear in the case of legal issues, such as the petitioners now raise, where a jury trial would be inappropriate.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] The denial of relief by West Virginia's highest court may have involved the determination that the statute, like its counterpart 6260, infra, note 11, is not mandatory. Such an interpretation would be binding upon this Court. However, we need not inquire into this point.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] After prisoners are confined in the penitentiary, the warden is granted discretion as to the invocation of the severer penalty. W. Va. Code, 1961, 6260. Thus the failure to invoke the penalty in the cases cited by petitioners may reflect the exercise of such discretion.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring.\n\nI join the Court's opinion in Oyler v. Boles and Crabtree v. Boles, Nos. 56 and 57, and concur in the result in Chewning v. Cunningham, No. 63, ante, p. 443.\n\nIn my view, the issues decided in Oyler and Crabtree, on the one hand, and in Chewning, on the other, represent opposite sides of the same coin. Since their interrelationship does not appear from the opinions of the Court, and since I cannot agree with the grounds of decision stated in Chewning, I file this separate opinion.\n\nThe statutes of both Virginia and West Virginia provide for enhanced punishment of multiple offenders. Apparently under the practice of neither State is the alleged recidivist given advance notice, either before the trial for his latest offense or after that trial but before sentencing, of the charges that are made in the multiple-offense accusation. It is not until he appears in open court and hears the prosecutor's information read to him that the accused learns on which convictions it is that the State relies in support of its demand for an increased sentence. And it is then and there that he must plead and state what his defense is, if he has any. This procedure was followed in each of the present cases.\n\nFor an individual unrepresented by counsel, this is surely too precipitous a procedure to satisfy the standards of fairness required of state courts by the Due Process \n\n[368 \nU.S. 448, 458]\n\u00a0\n Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In re Oliver, \n333 \nU.S. 257, 273\n; see Williams v. New York, \n337 \nU.S. 241, 245\n; Cole v. Arkansas, \n333 \nU.S. 196, 201\n. One who is untutored in the law cannot help but be bewildered by this sudden presentation of the charges against him and the demand for an immediate response. Without suggesting that advance notice of any particular duration must be afforded, still less that such notice must be given before trial or sentencing on the latest offense, had the petitioners in Oyler and Crabtree been without the aid of counsel at their multiple-offender hearings, I would entertain grave doubts as to the constitutionality of the procedure from which their increased sentences resulted.\n\nBut the records in these cases reveal that both Oyler and Crabtree had counsel at hand when the multiple-offender hearing was held and when they were asked to plead. Counsel could have requested a continuance in order to look into the validity of the previous convictions or other possible defenses to the recidivist charges, or, if there was any doubt, to establish the identities of the previous offenders. They chose not to do so, and I think this choice forecloses the petitioners' claims that they were not given adequate notice and opportunity to prepare a defense.\n\nIn Chewning, however, the petitioner had no counsel. He was taken from the state penitentiary without any warning of what was in store for him, and was accused in open court of having been convicted on three prior occasions. His allegations that he requested the assignment of counsel, and that such request was denied, are not controverted.\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[368 \nU.S. 448, 459]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Court strikes down the enhanced sentence, despite the apparent similarity between this claim and the one rejected in Gryger v. Burke, \n334 \nU.S. 728\n, because it holds that various defenses that were available to Chewning under Virginia law could not have been known to or presented by a layman. To me, the bare possibility that any of these improbable claims could have been asserted does not amount to the \"exceptional circumstances\" which, under existing law, e. g., Betts v. Brady, \n316 \nU.S. 455\n, must be present before the Fourteenth Amendment imposes on the State a duty to provide counsel for an indigent accused in a noncapital case. Nor do I think that a decision on these grounds can be reconciled with the holding in Gryger, in which the Court rejected the proposition, made by able appointed counsel, that certain contentions, much like those here suggested by the Court, could have been offered had the petitioner in that case been provided with counsel for his multiple-offender hearing.\n\nWhat does distinguish this case from Gryger, however, and persuades me that the failure to supply assistance of counsel amounted to a denial of the procedural fairness assured by the Fourteenth Amendment, is the want of adequate notice in advance of the hearing. In Gryger, a copy of the information listing the prior occasions on which the accused had been convicted was served upon him more than six and a half months before he was brought into court and asked to plead. This was more than ample time for him to engage an attorney, request assignment of counsel, or decide for himself what line of defense to take.\n2\n In the case before us now, Chewning \n\n[368 \nU.S. 448, 460]\n\u00a0\n was given no such opportunity. Hence I agree that the least that fairness required was that he be provided with counsel so as to be advised of the courses available to him. With no opportunity to get such advice, I do not think that his own failure to ask for a continuance has any legal significance.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Although petitioner did not allege in his habeas corpus petition that he was indigent at the time of the recidivist hearing, the state court apparently proceeded on the assumption that he had met the necessary poverty standard.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] It is true that a subsidiary claim in Gryger was that the petitioner had been denied access to legal materials which were necessary in the preparation of his defense. But he was at least able to reflect calmly on the factual accusation being made against him and was able to plan in advance what plea to enter and how best to present his case.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE BLACK, and MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN concur, dissenting.\n\nWhen this Court, years ago, sustained an application of West Virginia's habitual criminal law, it said:\n\n\"Full opportunity was accorded to the prisoner to meet the allegation of former conviction. Plainly, the statute contemplated a valid conviction which had not been set aside or the consequences of which had not been removed by absolute pardon. No question as to this can be raised here, for the prisoner in no way sought to contest the validity or unimpaired character of the former judgments, but pleaded that he was not the person who had thus been convicted. On this issue he had due hearing before a jury.\" Graham v. West Virginia, \n224 \nU.S. 616, 625\n.\n\n\n The issue now presented is broader. It is what procedure used in making a charge that a person is an habitual criminal is necessary to satisfy the requirements of due process.\n\nIt is said that the record fails to show that this precise point was raised at the trial. If so, West Virginia might make that an adequate state ground, though it should be noted in passing that the court in Rhea v. Edwards, 136 F. Supp. 671, aff'd, 238 F.2d 850, held that Tennessee's former procedure in habitual-offender cases violated due process where inadequate notice was given, even though \n\n[368 \nU.S. 448, 461]\n\u00a0\n the accused apparently had not made this an issue at the trial. Cf. Terminiello v. Chicago, \n337 \nU.S. 1\n. In these cases, however, West Virginia nowhere suggests that the issue of due process is not properly here. Rather the argument is that the requirements of due process are satisfied though the issue to be tried is restricted to the identity of the accused.\n\nA hearing under these habitual-offender statutes requires \"a judicial hearing\" in order to comport with due process. Chandler v. Fretag, \n348 \nU.S. 3, 8\n. The Chandler case held that denial of an opportunity for an accused to retain a lawyer to represent him deprives him of due process. And see Chewning v. Cunningham, ante, p. 443. If due process is to be satisfied, the full procedural panoply of the Bill of Rights, so far as notice and an opportunity to defend are concerned, must be afforded the accused. The charge of being an habitual offender is as effectively refuted by proof that there was no prior conviction or that the prior convictions were not penitentiary offenses as by proof that the accused is not the person charged with the new offense. The charge of being an habitual offender is also effectively refuted by proof that the prior convictions were not constitutionally valid as, for example, where one went to trial without a lawyer under circumstances where the appointment of someone to represent him was a requirement of due process. Denial or absence of counsel is an issue raisable on collateral attack of state judgments. Williams v. Kaiser, \n323 \nU.S. 471\n. That is an inquiry that should also be permitted in these habitual-offender cases, if the procedure employed is to satisfy due process.\n\nI mention the right of counsel merely to underline the gravity of these accusations. Unless any infirmities in the prior convictions that can be reached on collateral \n\n[368 \nU.S. 448, 462]\n\u00a0\n attack\n1\n can be reached in these proceedings, the wrong done is seriously compounded.\n\nAs I understand it, the opinion of the Court concedes as much. But it affirms the convictions, even though no prior notice of the habitual-offender charge was given. Without any advance warning the present informations were filed at times when petitioners were in court in connection with their most recent convictions. The omission of formal notice has been held fatal in proceedings under recidivist statutes. United States v. Claudy, 204 F.2d 624; Edwards v. Rhea, 238 F.2d 850. I think reasonable prior notice is necessary to satisfy due process - notice given far enough in advance to allow for an opportunity to defend. A 9-day notice was deemed adequate in Johnson v. Kansas, 284 F.2d 344, 345, the court saying:\n\n \"The fundamental requisites of due process, when  the statute is to be invoked, are reasonable notice  and an opportunity for a full and complete hearing,  with the right to the aid of competent counsel.\"\n\n\n Respondent concedes that the notice necessary for a criminal trial was not given. Respondent indeed maintains that no notice is necessary:\n\n \"The primary purpose for affording a defendant  notice is to inform him of the charge against him,  and to give him a reasonable time in which to prepare  his defense. Such reason for notice does not exist  in the instant cases pertaining to the application of  the West Virginia habitual criminal act.\" Brief, p. 5.\n\n\n Adequate notice of the charge under these habitual-offender statutes is as important as adequate notice \n\n[368 \nU.S. 448, 463]\n\u00a0\n of the charge in an ordinary criminal trial. The notice required must be commensurate with the range and complexity of issues that concededly may be tendered. The requirements of notice, like those for a fair hearing, are basic. As we stated in In re Oliver, \n333 \nU.S. 257, 273\n: \"A person's right to reasonable notice of a charge against him, and an opportunity to be heard in his defense - a right to his day in court - are basic in our system of jurisprudence . . . .\" That case was one in which a \"one-man grand jury\" charged a witness with giving false and evasive testimony and summarily convicted him. Its principle is equally applicable here. Until there is a charge fairly made and fairly tried, procedural due process has not been satisfied.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nUnless this principle is adhered to in proceedings under these recidivist statutes, serious penalties may be imposed without any real opportunity to defend.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Constitutional infirmities in criminal convictions in federal courts were declared to be \"a jurisdictional bar to a valid conviction\" and assertable by habeas corpus in Johnson v. Zerbst, \n304 \nU.S. 458, 468\n, decided in 1938.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Any contrary implications from Graham v. West Virginia, supra, must be read in light of the fact that the broadening reach of constitutional issues raisable by state habeas corpus followed our decision in Johnson v. Zerbst, supra, note 1.

JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis is a dispute between the trustee in bankruptcy of a government contractor and the contractor's payment bond surety over which has the superior right and title to a fund withheld by the Government out of earnings due the contractor.\n\nThe petitioner, Pearlman, is trustee of the bankrupt estate of the Dutcher Construction Corporation, which in April 1955 entered into a contract with the United States to do work on the Government's St. Lawrence Seaway project. At the same time the respondent, Reliance Insurance Company,\n1\n executed two surety bonds required of the contractor by the Miller Act, one to guarantee performance of the contract, the other to guarantee payment to all persons supplying labor and material for the project.\n2\n Under the terms of the contract, which was attached to and made a part of the payment bond, the United States \n\n[371 \nU.S. 132, 134]\n\u00a0\n was authorized to retain and hold a percentage of estimated amounts due monthly until final completion and acceptance of all work covered by the contract. Before completion Dutcher had financial trouble and the United States terminated its contract by agreement. Another contractor completed the job, which was finally accepted by the Government. At this time there was left in the Government's withheld fund $87,737.35, which would have been due to be paid to Dutcher had it carried out its obligation to pay its laborers and materialmen. Since it had not met this obligation, its surety had been compelled to pay about $350,000 to discharge debts of the contractor for labor and materials. In this situation the Government was holding over $87,000 which plainly belonged to someone else, and the fund was turned over to the bankrupt's trustee, who held it on the assumption that it had been property of the bankrupt at the time of adjudication and therefore had vested in the trustee \"by operation of law\" under 70 of the Bankruptcy Act.\n3\n The surety then filed a petition in the District Court denying that the fund had vested in the trustee, alleging that it, the surety, was \"the owner of said sum\" of $87,737.35 \"free and clear of the claims of the Trustee in Bankruptcy or any other person, firm or corporation,\" and seeking an order directing the trustee to pay over the fund to the surety forthwith.\n4\n The referee in bankruptcy, relying chiefly on this Court's opinion in United States v. Munsey Trust Co., \n332 \nU.S. 234\n (1947), held that the surety had no superior rights in the fund, refused to direct payment to the surety, and \n\n[371 \nU.S. 132, 135]\n\u00a0\n accordingly ordered the surety's claim to be allowed as that of a general creditor only to share on an equality with the general run of unsecured creditors.\n5\n The District Court vacated the referee's order and held that cases decided prior to Munsey had established the right of a surety under circumstances like this to be accorded priority over general creditors and that Munsey had not changed that rule.\n6\n The Second Circuit affirmed.\n7\n Other federal courts have reached a contrary result,\n8\n and as the question is an important and recurring one, we granted certiorari to decide it.\n9\n\u00a0\n\nOne argument against the surety's claim is that this controversy is governed entirely by the Bankruptcy Act and that 64, 11 U.S.C. 104, which prescribes priorities for different classes of creditors, gives no priority to a surety's claim for reimbursement. But the present dispute - who has the property interests in the fund, and how much - is not so simply solved. Ownership of property rights before bankruptcy is one thing; priority of distribution in bankruptcy of property that has passed unencumbered into a bankrupt's estate is quite another. Property interests in a fund not owned by a bankrupt at the time of adjudication, whether complete or partial, legal or equitable, mortgages, liens, or simple priority of rights, are of course not a part of the bankrupt's property and do not vest in the trustee. The Bankruptcy Act simply does not authorize a trustee to distribute other people's \n\n[371 \nU.S. 132, 136]\n\u00a0\n property among a bankrupt's creditors.\n10\n So here if the surety at the time of adjudication was, as it claimed, either the outright legal or equitable owner of this fund, or had an equitable lien or prior right to it, this property interest of the surety never became a part of the bankruptcy estate to be administered, liquidated, and distributed to general creditors of the bankrupt. This Court has recently reaffirmed that such property rights existing before bankruptcy in persons other than the bankrupt must be recognized and respected in bankruptcy.\n11\n Consequently our question is not who was entitled to priority in distributions under 64, but whether the surety had, as it claimed, ownership of, an equitable lien on, or a prior right to this fund before bankruptcy adjudication.\n\nSince there is no statute which expressly declares that a surety does acquire a property interest in a fund like this under the circumstances here, we must seek an answer in prior judicial decisions. Some of the relevant factors in determining the question are beyond dispute. Traditionally sureties compelled to pay debts for their principal have been deemed entitled to reimbursement, even without a contractual promise such as the surety here had.\n12\n And probably there are few doctrines better established \n\n[371 \nU.S. 132, 137]\n\u00a0\n than that a surety who pays the debt of another is entitled to all the rights of the person he paid to enforce his right to be reimbursed.\n13\n This rule, widely applied in this country\n14\n and generally known as the right of subrogation, was relied on by the Court of Appeals in this case. It seems rather plain that at least two prior decisions of this Court have held that there is a security interest in a withheld fund like this to which the surety is subrogated, unless, as is argued, the rule laid down in those cases has been changed by passage of the Miller Act or by our holding in the Munsey case. Those two cases are Prairie State Bank v. United States, \n164 \nU.S. 227\n (1896), and Henningsen v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co., \n208 \nU.S. 404\n (1908).\n\nIn the Prairie Bank case a surety who had been compelled to complete a government contract upon the contractor's default in performance claimed that he was entitled to be reimbursed for his expenditure out of a fund that arose from the Government's retention of 10% of the estimated value of the work done under the terms of the contract between the original contractor and the Government. That contract contained almost the same provisions for retention of the fund as the contract presently before us. The Prairie Bank, contesting the surety's claim, asserted that it had a superior equitable lien arising from moneys advanced by the bank to the contractor before the surety began to complete the work. The Court, in a well-reasoned opinion by Mr. Justice White, held that this fund materially tended to protect the surety, \n\n[371 \nU.S. 132, 138]\n\u00a0\n that its creation raised an equity in the surety's favor, that the United States was entitled to protect itself out of the fund, and that the surety, by asserting the right of subrogation, could protect itself by resort to the same securities and same remedies which had been available to the United States for its protection against the contractor. The Court then went on to quote with obvious approval this statement from a state case:\n\n\"The law upon this subject seems to be, the reserved per cent to be withheld until the completion of the work to be done is as much for the indemnity of him who may be a guarantor of the performance of the contract as for him for whom it is to be performed. And there is great justness in the rule adopted. Equitably, therefore, the sureties in such cases are entitled to have the sum agreed upon held as a fund out of which they may be indemnified, and if the principal releases it without their consent it discharges them from their undertaking.\" \n164 \nU.S., at 239\n, quoting from Finney v. Condon, 86 Ill. 78, 81 (1877).\n\n\n The Prairie Bank case thus followed an already established doctrine that a surety who completes a contract has an \"equitable right\" to indemnification out of a retained fund such as the one claimed by the surety in the present case. The only difference in the two cases is that here the surety incurred his losses by paying debts for the contractor rather than by finishing the contract.\n\nThe Henningsen case, decided 12 years later in 1908, carried the Prairie Bank case still closer to ours. Henningsen had contracts with the United States to construct public buildings. His surety stipulated not only that the contractor would perform and construct the buildings, but also, as stated by the Court, that he would \"pay promptly \n\n[371 \nU.S. 132, 139]\n\u00a0\n and in full all persons supplying labor and material in the prosecution of the work contracted for.\"\n15\n Henningsen completed the buildings according to contract but failed to pay his laborers and materialmen. The surety paid. This Court applied the equitable principles declared in the Prairie Bank case so as to entitle the surety to the same equitable claim to the retained fund that the surety in the Prairie Bank case was held to have. Thus the same equitable rules as to subrogation and property interests in a retained fund were held to exist whether a surety completes a contract or whether, though not called upon to complete the contract, it pays the laborers and materialmen. These two cases therefore, together with other cases that have followed them,\n16\n establish the surety's right to subrogation in such a fund whether its bond be for performance or payment. Unless this rule has been changed, the surety here has a right to this retained fund.\n\nIt is argued that the Miller Act\n17\n changed the law as declared in the Prairie Bank and Henningsen cases. We think not. Certainly no language of the Act does, and we have been pointed to no legislative history that indicates such a purpose. The suggestion is, however, that a congressional purpose to repudiate the equitable doctrine of the two cases should be implied from the fact that the Miller Act required a public contract surety to execute two bonds instead of the one formerly required. It is true that the Miller Act did require both a performance \n\n[371 \nU.S. 132, 140]\n\u00a0\n bond and an additional payment bond, that is, one to assure completion of the contract and one to assure payments by the contractor for materials and labor. But the prior Acts on this subject, while requiring only one bond, made it cover both performance and payment.\n18\n Neither this slight difference in the new and the old Acts nor any other argument presented persuades us that Congress in passing the Miller Act intended to repudiate equitable principles so deeply imbedded in our commercial practices, our economy, and our law as those spelled out in the Prairie Bank and Henningsen cases.\n19\n\u00a0\n\nThe final argument is that the Prairie Bank and Henningsen cases were in effect overruled by our holding and opinion in United States v. Munsey Trust Co., supra. The point at issue in that case was whether the United States while holding a fund like the one in this case could offset against the contractor a claim bearing no relationship to the contractor's claim there at issue. We held that the Government could exercise the well-established common-law right of debtors to offset claims of their own against their creditors. This was all we held. The opinion contained statements which some have interpreted\n20\n as meaning that we were abandoning the established legal and equitable principles of the Prairie Bank and Henningsen cases under which sureties can indemnify themselves against losses. But the equitable rights of a surety declared in the Prairie Bank case as to sureties who complete \n\n[371 \nU.S. 132, 141]\n\u00a0\n the performance of a contract were expressly recognized and approved in Munsey,\n21\n and the Henningsen rule as to sureties who had not completed the contract but had paid laborers was not mentioned. Henningsen was not even cited in the Munsey opinion. We hold that Munsey left the rule in Prairie Bank and Henningsen undisturbed. We cannot say that such a firmly established rule was so casually overruled.\n22\n\u00a0\n\nWe therefore hold in accord with the established legal principles stated above that the Government had a right to use the retained fund to pay laborers and materialmen; that the laborers and materialmen had a right to be paid out of the fund; that the contractor, had he completed his job and paid his laborers and materialmen, would have become entitled to the fund; and that the surety, having paid the laborers and materialmen, is entitled to the benefit of all these rights to the extent necessary to reimburse it.\n23\n Consequently, since the surety in this case has paid \n\n[371 \nU.S. 132, 142]\n\u00a0\n out more than the amount of the existing fund, it has a right to all of it. On this basis the judgment of the Court of Appeals is\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE WHITE dissents.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The company was then known as Fire Association of Philadelphia.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 40 U.S.C. 270a provides in part as follows: \"(a) Before any contract, exceeding $2,000 in amount, for the construction, alteration, or repair of any public building or public work of the United States is awarded to any person, such person shall furnish to the United States the following bonds, which shall become binding upon the award of the contract to such person, who is hereinafter designated as `contractor': \"(1) A performance bond with a surety or sureties satisfactory to the officer awarding such contract, and in such amount as he shall deem adequate, for the protection of the United States. \"(2) A payment bond with a surety or sureties satisfactory to such officer for the protection of all persons supplying labor and material in the prosecution of the work provided for in said contract for the use of each such person.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 30 Stat. 565 (1898), 11 U.S.C. 110.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The surety appears also to have claimed some general priority over all creditors for the entire $350,000 it had paid out for the contractor, based on \"liens, subrogation and assignment,\" but here its petition for certiorari and briefs seem to limit its claim to the net amount of the retained fund turned over to the trustee by the Government.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] 35 J.

JUSTICE CLARK, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN join, concurring in the result.\n\nThe Court holds that the surety company here is entitled to the funds the Government has paid into court on the theory that the surety is subrogated to the claims of the laborers and materialmen which it has paid. I cannot agree. None of the cases in this Court so hold. Indeed, in United States v. Munsey Trust Co., \n332 \nU.S. 234\n (1947), this Court said:\n\n\"But nothing is more clear than that laborers and materialmen do not have enforceable rights against the United States for their compensation. . . . They cannot acquire a lien on public buildings . . . and as a substitute for that more customary protection, the various statutes were passed which require that a surety guarantee their payment. Of these, the last and the one now in force is the Miller Act under which the bonds here were drawn.\" Id., at p. 241.\n\n\n \"[I]t is elementary that one cannot acquire by subrogation what another whose rights he claims did not have. . . .\" Id., at p. 242.\n\n\n Since the laborers and materialmen have no right against the funds, it follows as clear as rain that the surety could have none. It appears to me that today's holding that laborers and materialmen had \"rights\" to funds in the Government's hands might jeopardize the rights of the United States and have serious consequences for its building operations. The Congress has not so provided and I would not so hold. \n\n[371 \nU.S. 132, 143]\n\u00a0\n\n\nHowever, this Court has held in two cases not necessary to the decision in Munsey that the surety who pays laborers' and materialmen's claims stands in the shoes of the United States and is entitled to surplus funds remaining in its hands after the contract is completed. The first is Prairie State Bank v. United States, \n164 \nU.S. 227\n (1896), and the other Henningsen v. U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co., \n208 \nU.S. 404\n (1908). In neither of those cases, however, did the Court find that laborers and materialmen had any right against the United States but only that the \"Guaranty Company [was] entitled to subrogation to any right of the United States Government arising through the building contract.\" Henningsen, supra, at p. 410.\n\nSince the funds here have been paid into court by the Government, there is some question whether the doctrine of those cases would apply. In each of them the money was in the hands of the United States at the time the suit was commenced and was clearly applicable to payment of any debt under the contract. It would, therefore, be my view that the equities existing here in favor of the surety grow out of the contract between it and the contractor (in whose shoes the trustee now stands), which was made in consideration of the execution of the bond. Under that agreement in the event of any breach or default in the construction contract all sums becoming due thereunder were assigned to the surety to be credited against any loss or damage it might suffer thereby. In Martin v. National Surety Co., \n300 \nU.S. 588\n (1937), this Court in an identical situation\n*\n awarded such a fund to \n\n[371 \nU.S. 132, 144]\n\u00a0\n the surety. Mr. Justice Cardozo, for a unanimous Court, said: \"In our view of the law, the equities in favor of materialmen growing out of that agreement [between the surety and the contractor] were impressed upon the fund in the possession of the court.\" Id., at pp. 593-594. It is well to note also that the Court of Appeals in Martin had based its decision on the theory announced by the Court today, but Mr. Justice Cardozo for a unanimous Court chose the \"narrower\" ground of the assignment in affirming the judgment for the surety. I agree with Martin as to the \"narrower\" ground and believe the Court should keep the opinion today \"within the necessities of the specific controversy\" rather than enlarging upon the rules of Henningsen and Prairie State Bank. In so doing the Court would but fulfill the prophecy made in Martin that \"the grounds chosen . . . may be expected to be helpful as a guide in other cases.\" Id., at p. 593.\n\nI would affirm the judgment on this basis.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] In Martin the contractor assigned to the surety \"all the deferred payments and retained percentages, and any and all moneys and properties that may be due and payable to the undersigned at the time of any breach or default in said contract, or . . . thereafter . . . .\" Id., at pp. 590-591. Here the assignment was of, inter alia, \"Any and all \n\n[371 \nU.S. 132, 144]\n\u00a0\n percentages of the contract price retained on account of said contract, and any and all sums that may be due under said contract at the time of such . . . forfeiture or breach, or that thereafter may become due . . . .\" \n\n[371 \nU.S. 132, 145]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","152":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPOINDEXTER v.

COLUMBIA BROADCASTING(1962)\nNo. 45\nArgued: Decided: February 19, 1962\n\n\n\n\n This action under 4 of the Clayton Act to recover treble damages for losses allegedly resulting from violations of 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act was brought by petitioner, who is the assignee of a dissolved corporation which formerly owned and operated WCAN, an ultra high frequency (UHF) television broadcasting station in Milwaukee, which was affiliated with the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) network. He alleged that, pursuant to a conspiracy to restrain and monopolize trade in the television broadcasting business, CBS purchased WOKY, a competing UHF station in Milwaukee, cancelled WCAN's network affiliation, thereby forced petitioner to sell WCAN to CBS at much less than its true value, and eliminated him from the broadcasting business in Milwaukee. He also alleged that a purpose of the conspiracy was to eliminate UHF broadcasting in Milwaukee and possibly throughout the United States. On the basis of pleadings, affidavits, depositions and interrogatories filed in the case, the District Court granted respondents' motion for a summary judgment, on the ground that the injury suffered by petitioner was damnum absque injuria, since CBS had a right to purchase WOKY, subject to approval by the Federal Communications Commission, and to cancel its affiliation contract with WCAN. Held: On this record, it cannot be said that \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact,\" within the meaning of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 (c), and the motion for summary judgment should not have been granted. Pp. 465-474.\n\n (a) If the cancellation of WCAN's network affiliation and the purchase of WOKY by CBS were part and parcel of unlawful conduct or agreement with others or were conceived in a purpose to unreasonably restrain trade, control a market, or monopolize, as alleged in the complaint, then such conduct might well violate the Sherman Act, and the record indicates that on a trial petitioner might be able to substantiate his claim of conspiracy. Pp. 467-473.\n\n\n (b) Summary procedures should be used sparingly in complex antitrust litigation where motive and intent play leading roles, the proof is largely in the hands of the alleged conspirators, and hostile witnesses thicken the plot. P. 473. \n\n[368 \nU.S. 464, 465]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n (c) It cannot be said that no restraint of trade resulted from termination by CBS of its affiliation with WCAN because the public would still receive the same service from another source. Klor's v. Broadway-Hale Stores, \n359 \nU.S. 207\n. P. 473.\n\n\n 109 U.S. App. D.C. 170, 284 F.2d 599, reversed.\n\nMorris Wolf argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs was Abraham L. Freedman.\n\nSamuel I. Rosenman argued the cause for respondents. With him on the briefs was Ambrose Doskow. Leon Brooks entered an appearance.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe question involved here is whether this treble damage action based on alleged violations of the restraint of trade and monopoly sections of the Sherman Law\n1\n was rightly terminated by a summary judgment of dismissal. The petitioner, Lou Poller, is the assignee of the Midwest Broadcasting Company, a dissolved corporation. In 1954 Midwest was the owner and operator of WCAN, an ultra high frequency (UHF)\n2\n broadcasting station \n\n[368 \nU.S. 464, 466]\n\u00a0\n located in Milwaukee. The station was affiliated with the Columbia Broadcasting System network and was of the alleged value of $2,000,000. Poller charged that the respondents in 1954 entered into an unlawful conspiracy to eliminate WCAN from the broadcast field in Milwaukee.\n3\n It was a part of the conspiracy that respondent Holt was to secure in his name an option to purchase WOKY, a competing but inferior UHF broadcaster in Milwaukee. When and if the Federal Communications Commission amended its multiple ownership rules, then under consideration, so as to permit CBS to own UHF stations in addition to its VHF ones, Holt was to assign his option to CBS if it so elected. In that event, it was agreed CBS would cancel its affiliation agreement with WCAN pursuant to its option in that contract and in due course consummate its purchase of WOKY. This would place WCAN in the precarious position of competing with the two major national networks with stations in Milwaukee. Being unable to survive such competition, its only course would be to liquidate at distressed prices its valuable equipment and facilities only recently acquired. CBS might then acquire them at its own price for use in its new operation which was necessary because of the inferior quality of those of WOKY. CBS would then have Midwest's superior facilities and equipment which with the WOKY license would enable it to start broadcasting at a minimum expense and the least possible delay. Poller further claimed that the overall purpose of CBS was to destroy UHF broadcasting, which had only been permitted to enter the field in 1952, in order to protect its vast interest in VHF stations throughout the United States. Finally, he alleged the conspiracy was so successful that CBS not only acquired WCAN at a loss of \n\n[368 \nU.S. 464, 467]\n\u00a0\n $1,450,000 to Midwest but that the latter was obliged to buy the facilities and equipment of WOKY at exorbitant prices and to agree to continue broadcasting from the latter's premises - which was done \"in order to pretend that there was no restraint of trade or elimination of competition . . . .\" However, WCAN continued in business only 10 days after CBS started its broadcasts on February 17, 1955. CBS discontinued UHF broadcasting in 1959 when it became affiliated with a Milwaukee VHF station.\n\nAt the hearing on the motion for summary judgment the trial judge held that the injury suffered was damnum absque injuria, stating that CBS had a right to purchase WOKY, subject to Federal Communications Commission approval, and to cancel its affiliation contract with WCAN. 174 F. Supp. 802. The Court of Appeals affirmed with Judge Washington dissenting, 109 U.S. App. D.C. 170, 284 F.2d 599, and we granted certiorari, \n365 \nU.S. 840\n. We now conclude that there was a genuine issue as to material facts and that summary judgment was not therefore in order.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nSummary judgment should be entered only when the pleadings, depositions, affidavits, and admissions filed in the case \"show that [except as to the amount of damages] there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Rule 56 (c), Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. This rule authorizes summary judgment \"only where the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, where it is quite clear what the truth is, . . . [and where] no genuine issue remains for trial . . . [for] the purpose of the rule is not to cut litigants off from their right of trial by jury if they really have issues to try.\" Sartor v. Arkansas Natural Gas Corp., \n321 \nU.S. 620, 627\n (1944). We now examine the contentions of the parties to determine whether under the rule summary judgment was proper. \n\n[368 \nU.S. 464, 468]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nThe respondents in their motion for summary judgment depended upon the affidavits of four persons. The first is Richard Salant, Vice President of CBS; another, Jay Eliasberg, Director of its Research Division; a third, Lee Bartell, who made the sale of WOKY to CBS at a $50,000 profit; finally, Thad Holt, a codefendant who received $10,000 from the transaction. These were supplemented by material taken from petitioner's depositions of Salant and CBS President Stanton. It is readily apparent that each of these persons was an interested party.\n\nRespondents appear to place most reliance on the Salant testimony, and we shall, therefore, take it up in some detail. It projects three defenses, the first being that there was no conspiracy for the following reasons: CBS-TV was not a separate entity but only a division of CBS, and therefore there could be no conspiracy between the two; Holt, the cover man in securing the option and purchase of WOKY, \"had been given the particular job\" by CBS and therefore was not a conspirator; and Bartell never shared in any illegal purpose that would bring him into the conspiracy. Secondly, in any event, the only issue in the case is the legality of the cancellation of the affiliation agreement by CBS which was merely the legal exercise by CBS of \"the normal right of a producer to select the outlet for its product.\" And, finally, the monopoly charges are entirely \"frivolous.\" The trial judge accepted the second defense.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nIt may be that CBS by independent action could have exercised its granted right to cancel WCAN's affiliation upon six months' notice and independently purchased its own outlet in Milwaukee. However, if such a cancellation and purchase were part and parcel of unlawful \n\n[368 \nU.S. 464, 469]\n\u00a0\n conduct or agreement with others or were conceived in a purpose to unreasonably restrain trade, control a market, or monopolize, then such conduct might well run afoul of the Sherman Law. See Times-Picayune Pub. Co. v. United States, \n345 \nU.S. 594, 624\n-625 (1953); Eastman Kodak Co. v. Southern Materials Co., \n273 \nU.S. 359, 375\n (1927). Poller alleges and the affidavits, depositions, and exhibits indicate much more than the free exercise by CBS of the granted right of cancellation. A conspiracy is alleged to restrain trade in the Milwaukee television market; to eliminate WCAN from that market; to secure its facilities at depressed prices; and to occupy the UHF band in that market exclusively. The right of cancellation was merely one of the means used to effectuate this conspiracy. Moreover, \"in its wider sense\" Poller claims that a part of their conspiracy was \"to wipe out the most outstanding UHF operator in the country [WCAN] and by wiping him out they destroyed the UHF industry, which was a threat to them, despite their protestations, because of the enormous economic investment they had in VHF.\"\n\nIt is argued that CBS cannot conspire with itself. However, this begs the question for the allegation is that independent parties, i. e., Holt and Bartell, conspired with CBS and its officers.\n4\n While respondents' affidavits assert that Holt acted in good faith as a special agent or employee for CBS and that Bartell was completely free of any evil motives directed toward WCAN, the trial judge indicated a belief that Holt was \"an independent actor\" and would have submitted the question of his status to the jury had he not disposed of the case on other grounds. Furthermore, Poller submitted a deposition of Holt, an exhibit to which showed CBS had furnished Holt \n\n[368 \nU.S. 464, 470]\n\u00a0\n a complete analysis in writing of the Milwaukee market and the ownership and affiliation of the TV stations there, including WCAN. The deposition revealed that Holt had knowledge that the obvious purpose and necessary effect of the plan would be to eliminate independent UHF in Milwaukee and that he had a personal stake in its success. This included, inter alia, Holt's statements that he met with top CBS officials in New York for a briefing on his role, that he was a close friend of these officials, and that he would have retained the option for himself if unused by CBS. The latter admissions, when coupled with the uncertainty at that time of a Federal Communications Commission rule permitting CBS to purchase WCAN, suggest that the alternative plan was to let Holt exercise the option and take the affiliation if CBS could not. Likewise, Bartell's affidavit, barely a page and a half in the record, does not negative the allegations of conspiracy. Unquestionably, after knowing that Holt had in truth been acting for CBS and that the sale would prove disastrous to WCAN, he did file certain papers with the Federal Communications Commission requesting approval of the sale of WOKY. Poller had no opportunity to cross-examine him although he was a key witness to respondents' theory of the case. And it is noted that even though the transfer was uncontested before the Federal Communications Commission it received approval by a vote of only three Commissioners with the remaining two strongly dissenting.\n5\n It might be that on a trial Poller could substantiate his claims of conspiracy even against Bartell, although this would not be necessary to his case.\n\nRespondents' answer to the charge that one of the purposes of the alleged conspiracy was to exert a restraining effect upon the development of UHF is that this is a \n\n[368 \nU.S. 464, 471]\n\u00a0\n \"fantastic assumption - for which there is not a shred of evidence.\" An analysis of the record seems to indicate that in 1954 prior to the purchase of WOKY there were three UHF channels assigned to Milwaukee by the Federal Communications Commission, two of which (WCAN and WOKY) were operating; that since December 1953 CBS had been studying UHF markets preparatory to an expected change in Commission rules that would allow it to purchase two UHF stations in addition to its five VHF ones; that its staff rated Pittsburgh, St. Louis, New Haven-Hartford, and Milwaukee, in that order, as the most attractive; that CBS chose to enter the latter market and buy WOKY rather than to operate in Milwaukee on the third available channel; that WCAN's profitable operation in 1954, even with lower rates and competition from WOKY, was \"immediately converted to a losing\" one, although in 1955 WOKY was out of business; and that this reported loss of about $130,000 under CBS operation in 1955 contrasted sharply with the 66% increase in its profits nationally. Furthermore, reports in the record from CBS itself show that it always had recognized \"a VHF station . . . would be preferable to a UHF . . .\" but that the latter had \"specially good short-term prospects\" (emphasis supplied) in Milwaukee because it had \"the characteristic of being at present\" (1954) a \"single station\" market. CBS further recognized that since its programing was \"already working to build up UHF set population . . . [through WCAN] [t]here would be no short-term loss to the network in continuing to give the support of CBS programing to the buildup of a UHF population . . . at least until more VHF stations come in.\" (Emphasis supplied.)\n\nThe record indicates that Poller had built up a profitable UHF operation, which was recognized as \"the most successful\" in the United States. Even CBS officials pointed to it as an example of how \"a vigorously and \n\n[368 \nU.S. 464, 472]\n\u00a0\n aggressively managed new UHF station in that community can do well.\" In the short period of a year its public acceptance in Milwaukee was so great that 90% of the 260,000 TV sets in the area had been modified, at an expense of some $20 to each owner, so as to be able to receive UHF signals. While CBS had refused to enlarge the six-month cancellation clause, at no time prior to the alleged conspiracy did it indicate an intention to cancel the WCAN affiliation.\n6\n It was, Poller claims, only pursuant to the conspiracy that CBS came into the Milwaukee market and eliminated both WCAN and WOKY. Since that time the total number of commercial UHF stations in the United States has steadily declined from 121 at the end of 1953 to 94 by midyear 1956. At the close of 1957 the number was only 88. In 1958 CBS itself abandoned a UHF station in Hartford, and in 1959 the very station in controversy here was likewise abandoned, leaving Milwaukee with no commercial UHF service. Instead, CBS has switched to VHF, affiliating with a Storer Broadcasting Company station which was authorized there the same year. It will be remembered that Mr. Storer is the same prospect who, Poller claims, indicated he would pay $2,000,000 for WCAN when the multiple rule was adopted but who cooled after a CBS warning. All of this may not be sufficient to warrant the finding that Poller contends for on this charge, but it does indicate more than fantasy, particularly in the light of the testimony of CBS Vice President Salant in his deposition that \"it would be the kiss of death to UHF if either NBC or CBS abandoned a UHF station.\"\n\nIt may be that upon all of the evidence a jury would be with the respondents. But we cannot say on this record that \"it is quite clear what the truth is.\" Certainly \n\n[368 \nU.S. 464, 473]\n\u00a0\n there is no conclusive evidence supporting the respondents' theory. We look at the record on summary judgment in the light most favorable to Poller, the party opposing the motion, and conclude here that it should not have been granted. We believe that summary procedures should be used sparingly in complex antitrust litigation where motive and intent play leading roles, the proof is largely in the hands of the alleged conspirators, and hostile witnesses thicken the plot.\n7\n It is only when the witnesses are present and subject to cross-examination that their credibility and the weight to be given their testimony can be appraised. Trial by affidavit is no substitute for trial by jury which so long has been the hallmark of \"even handed justice.\"\n\n\nIV.\n\n\n\nOther contentions of respondents are subject to ready disposition. They say that no restraint of trade resulted from CBS' termination of its affiliation with WCAN for this enabled it to support WOKY, the other UHF station in the Milwaukee area, which based upon Poller's own allegations was doomed without an affiliation. To the extent that this argument suggests that there is no violation of the antitrust laws because the public will still receive the same service, it has been foreclosed by this Court's decision in Klor's v. Broadway-Hale Stores, \n359 \nU.S. 207\n (1959). And if it is meant to say that there was no restraint because CBS in canceling its affiliation with WCAN was merely doing what it had a right to do and the resulting demise of WCAN followed from normal market conditions, it erroneously assumes that CBS had an absolute right despite violations of the antitrust laws to exercise its contractual privilege. See Part III, supra. A further answer to the respondents' contention \n\n[368 \nU.S. 464, 474]\n\u00a0\n in this regard is that Poller has an additional claim that part of the conspiracy was the destruction of UHF broadcasting entirely. The sole answer of CBS to that is \"there is not a shred of evidence\" to support such a charge. However, there has been no trial as yet, and the issue remains a factual one disputed under the pleadings and still undetermined.\n\nCBS contends that the monopolization charges are frivolous. We find the record unclear on these claims. In view of our remand for a trial on the merits, we forego any comment thereon. The complaint does not allege the relevant market involved. In the trial court it was argued that UHF broadcasting in Milwaukee was the market, but on the record here we are unable to determine that issue. It may well be that on a trial appropriate allegations and proof can be adduced showing violations of 2. See generally International Boxing Club v. United States, \n358 \nU.S. 242, 249\n-252 (1959); United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., \n353 \nU.S. 586, 648\n-654 (1957) (dissenting opinion). We believe it to be good judicial administration to withhold decision on these issues.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides that: \"Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal . . . .\" 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 1.\n\nSection 2 of the Sherman Act provides that: \"Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor . . . .\" 26 Stat. 209, as amended. 15 U.S.C. 2.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The terms ultra high frequency (UHF) and very high frequency (VHF) refer to the wave lengths of the electrical impulses which are projected by broadcasting stations to carry programs to receiving sets.

Silas Mason Co., \n334 \nU.S. 249, 256\n-257 (1948); Arenas v. United States, \n322 \nU.S. 419, 434\n (1944).\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, with whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER and MR. JUSTICE STEWART join, dissenting.\n\nAs I see it, this is one of those cases, not unfamiliar in treble-damage litigation, where injury resulting from normal business hazards is sought to be made redressable by casting the affair in antitrust terms. I think that the antitrust laws do not fit this case, and that the courts below were quite correct in holding that the respondents were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n\nThe litigation arises out of CBS' cancellation of an affiliation arrangement with WCAN, a UHF television broadcasting station in Milwaukee, owned by Midwest \n\n[368 \nU.S. 464, 475]\n\u00a0\n Broadcasting Company of whose property Poller is assignee. CBS maintains that such cancellation was but the legitimate exercise of a contractual right. Poller says that it was part of a conspiracy to restrain and monopolize trade in the television broadcasting business, violative of 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. Suing under 4 of the Clayton Act,\n1\n Poller seeks to recover as damages the trebled fair value of the WCAN station and equipment, whose sale to CBS at a distress price he claims was forced upon him in consequence of CBS' cancellation of the WCAN affiliation contract.\n\nPoller asserts that CBS, joined by others as conspirators, wanted to put him out of business as the first step in a grand design to destroy UHF broadcasting in Milwaukee, if not indeed throughout the United States. It is said that CBS looked with disfavor upon the growth of UHF broadcasting, being itself already heavily committed to VHF. As subsidiary steps towards the effectuation of this plan, it is charged that CBS chilled prospective purchasers of WCAN; acquired the only then competing UHF station in Milwaukee, WOKY; and later closed that station down.\n2\n CBS' co-conspirators are said to have been CBS-Television, an unincorporated division of CBS; certain officers of CBS; Bartell, the then owner of WOKY; and Holt, a management consultant, who at CBS' behest obtained from Bartell an option to purchase WOKY.\n\nI assume that Poller would be entitled to proceed to trial if the record before the District Court had left open \n\n[368 \nU.S. 464, 476]\n\u00a0\n a genuine question of fact as to whether the alleged conspiracy had as its object the elimination of all UHF stations in the Milwaukee area, or even if it appeared that petitioner might prove that the respondents entered upon this course in order to reduce the number of UHF stations in Milwaukee from two to one, which was to be owned outright by CBS.\n3\n But, for reasons given below, I think that the depositions and affidavits which were before the District Court disclosed to a practical certainty that such proof could not be made.\n\nWhat did remain open to proof was an alleged arrangement among CBS, its television division, and its officers and agents whereby CBS canceled an affiliation with one UHF station and purchased the facilities of a competing station. Even if somewhere among those sought to be drawn into petitioner's net there can be found two independent actors whose meeting of minds would satisfy the usual conspiracy requirement of \"plurality of parties,\"\n4\n their agreement to carry out that design would not, in my \n\n[368 \nU.S. 464, 477]\n\u00a0\n view, of itself offend anything proscribed by 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nIn passing on the motion for summary judgment, the District Court had before it more than the four affidavits of interested parties to which the Court's opinion seems especially to refer (ante, pp. 468, 473). In the record was the testimony of four key witnesses taken by pretrial depositions. Petitioner's counsel had examined Frank Stanton, President of CBS; Richard Salant, a Vice-President of CBS; and Thad Holt, who acted for CBS in procuring the option on the Bartell station.\n5\n Petitioner's testimony was also in the record in the form of a deposition taken by respondents' counsel, and two affidavits submitted in opposition to the motion for summary judgment. In addition, the record contained the respondents' answers to written interrogatories put by the petitioner. It is in light of this far from meager pretrial discovery that the appropriateness of summary judgment must be evaluated.\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 (c) authorizes a District Court to enter summary judgment\n\n\"if the pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"\n\n\n In so providing, the draftsmen of the Rule of course did not intend to cut off a litigant's right to a trial before the appropriate fact-finder if triable issues remained unresolved after the pleadings were closed and pretrial discovery \n\n[368 \nU.S. 464, 478]\n\u00a0\n had. Sartor v. Arkansas Natural Gas Corp., \n321 \nU.S. 620, 627\n; Fountain v. Filson, \n336 \nU.S. 681\n. On the other hand, it is equally clear that their purpose was to obviate trials which would serve no useful purpose. In administering the Rule, the availability of pretrial discovery, as well as matter actually discovered, is a factor to be considered in determining whether a \"genuine issue as to any material fact\" is open. E. g., Schneider v. McKesson & Robbins, Inc., 254 F.2d 827, 831. Further, the Rule does not indicate that it is to be used any more \"sparingly\" in antitrust litigation (ante, p. 473) than in other kinds of litigation, or that its employment in antitrust cases is subject to more stringent criteria than in others. On the contrary, without reflecting in any way upon the good faith of this particular lawsuit, having regard for the special temptations that the statutory private antitrust remedy affords for the institution of vexatious litigation, and the inordinate amount of time that such cases sometimes demand of the trial courts, there is good reason for giving the summary judgment rule its full legitimate sweep in this field.\n\nIn this case petitioner, the party opposing the motion, had complete access by means of pretrial discovery to all the evidence he could marshal at a trial on the merits.\n6\n Neither his cross-examination of hostile witnesses nor his own direct testimony by way of deposition and affidavit produced any evidence which would indicate that the respondents sought to accomplish anything more than to purchase for CBS a UHF station in Milwaukee. As the Court's opinion seems to recognize, such a purchase (accompanied by a cancellation of petitioner's station affiliation) would be unlawful only if \"conceived in a purpose to unreasonably restrain trade, control a market, or \n\n[368 \nU.S. 464, 479]\n\u00a0\n monopolize.\" (Ante, p. 469.) (Emphasis added.) In other words, unless a purpose to cancel petitioner's affiliation and purchase the Bartell station would, by itself, be unlawful, petitioner could prevail in this suit only if he proved that the respondents intended to stifle competition in, or monopolize, television broadcasting, either by closing down his station or, more broadly, by destroying the UHF business in whole or in part.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nThis crucial issue, therefore, turns on proof of the respondents' motives. Had petitioner proceeded to trial and introduced no more evidence of motive than was \n\n[368 \nU.S. 464, 480]\n\u00a0\n revealed by the pretrial depositions and affidavits, the case, in my opinion, could not well have been permitted to go to the jury. There being no extrinsic evidence of an unlawful purpose, and CBS' executives having unequivocally denied any purpose to eliminate petitioner as a competitor, the jury would be left with no affirmative evidence of any intent to restrain trade. The possibility that the jury might disbelieve the respondents' assertions of innocence is not enough to forestall the entry of summary judgment in their favor. Dyer v. MacDougall, 201 F.2d 265.\n\nDespite the ample opportunity afforded him by the availability of pretrial discovery procedures, petitioner, as will be shown, was able to produce no evidence to support his charges that a conspiracy, narrow or far-reaching, had been hatched. He should not be permitted to proceed to trial just on the hope that in the more formal atmosphere of the courtroom witnesses will revise their testimony or that a clever trial tactic will produce helpful evidence. Courts do not exist to afford opportunities for such litigating gambles. See Radio City Music Hall Corp. v. United States, 135 F.2d 715; Schneider v. McKesson & Robbins, Inc., supra; cf. Orvis v. Brickman, 90 U.S. App. D.C. 266, 270, 196 F.2d 762, 765-766; Lavine v. Shapiro, 257 F.2d 14, 20-21.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nI find nothing in this record to support a claim that CBS, in proceeding as it did, was actuated by a desire to restrain or monopolize trade.\n\nIt appears from questions asked of Stanton and Salant, two CBS officers, that petitioner sought to imply an unlawful motive to destroy competition from CBS' failure to negotiate with him in the first instance for the purchase of WCAN. Were it shown that respondents refused to consider purchasing petitioner's instead of Bartell's station, although the former was available on satisfactory \n\n[368 \nU.S. 464, 481]\n\u00a0\n terms, such a showing might be some evidence of an intent to eliminate petitioner as a competitor of the other station bought by CBS. But the record shows that respondents throughout insisted that their refusal to deal with petitioner was the result of information that he had placed an exorbitant price on his station. That insistence, which Poller did not controvert or himself impugn, is confirmed by his own computation of damages in this case, as well as by his deposition testimony which reveals that he valued the WCAN property at $2,000,000 and demanded that price of all interested purchasers. CBS bought the Bartell station, although to be sure it had substantially inferior facilities, for $335,000.\n\nNor is there any evidence in the record to indicate that the respondents anticipated petitioner's offer to sell his facilities to CBS. It is clear from the affidavits and depositions, and is, in fact, conceded in petitioner's brief before this Court, that it was petitioner who initiated the negotiations and \"importuned CBS to take his equipment off his hands.\" Petitioner contends that the respondents knew he would have no use for the recently enlarged plant once his CBS affiliation was canceled, so that his offer of sale was a necessary consequence of the disaffiliation. But this proves only that petitioner's injury may as readily have been the result of CBS' lawful program of expansion as of an invidious scheme to restrain competition. It buttresses the conclusion reached by the Court of Appeals (109 U.S. App. D.C. 170, 173, 176, 284 F.2d 599, 602, 605) that the diminution in the value of petitioner's property was attributable to petitioner's imprudent investment\n8\n rather than to any antitrust conspiracy \n\n[368 \nU.S. 464, 482]\n\u00a0\n by the respondents. In addition, petitioner's surmise that the respondents must have known that the cancellation of Poller's affiliation would result in his offering his equipment to CBS is hardly consistent with the fact, sworn to by Salant and never traversed, that CBS had its engineering department draw up complete plans as to how the Bartell facilities could be expanded to make them suitable for CBS' intended use.\n\nFinally, it is entirely clear from the record that petitioner was unable to prove that the respondents' motive was to eliminate his station. It is undisputed that at the time Holt obtained the option on the Bartell station both the American Broadcasting and DuMont networks had no primary affiliates in the Milwaukee market. There is nothing to indicate that respondents should have anticipated at the birth of their alleged conspiracy that such affiliations would be unavailable to petitioner if the CBS tie were broken. Moreover, it is patent from the terms of the contract under which CBS purchased petitioner's equipment that petitioner represented to the respondents that he would continue broadcasting operations as an independent from the studio formerly occupied by Bartell.\n9\n It was only after this representation was made, albeit, as petitioner now claims, with only \"about a 5 per \n\n[368 \nU.S. 464, 483]\n\u00a0\n cent hope\" that he would be able to continue, that the exchange of facilities was consummated. The transaction was in all ways consistent with the parties' written intention to maintain two operating UHF stations in Milwaukee. For it was surely much more likely that petitioner could survive as an independent by using the smaller Bartell plant than by remaining in his enlarged studio, which had absorbed a large amount of capital that could not, at least immediately, be put to fruitful use.\n\nIn sum, the District Court had before it on this motion for summary judgment a record on which it was apparent that petitioner could prove only that CBS had undertaken to cancel its affiliation with petitioner's station and, with Holt's assistance, to purchase a competing UHF station. Only if such a \"conspiracy\" is prohibited by 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act should the petitioner have been permitted to proceed to trial.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nRespondents freely admit that the purchase of the Bartell station and the cancellation of petitioner's affiliation were parts of one course of action. They maintain, however, that their intention was to purchase a UHF station in Milwaukee as the first step in an incipient program of expansion into the UHF market, made possible by the Federal Communications Commission's then recently adopted \"5-and-2\" amendment to its multiple-ownership rule. By reason of this amendment, a single licensee was permitted to own two UHF stations in addition to the maximum five VHF stations theretofore allowed. I would hold that an arrangement to attain this objective did not, of itself, violate 1 of the Sherman Act.\n\nIt must be obvious that the cancellation of an affiliation agreement by one network, not acting in concert with any other, does not alone give rise to a cause of action under the antitrust laws. Federal Broadcasting System, Inc., \n\n[368 \nU.S. 464, 484]\n\u00a0\n v. American Broadcasting Co., 167 F.2d 349. A network is surely free to cut its ties to one station and affiliate with another in the same market. Such an act is analogous to a manufacturer's transfer of an exclusive distributorship from one dealer in the market to another. This freedom to choose with whom one deals is preserved under the antitrust laws not only because it is a unilateral decision, but because it does not amount to an unreasonable restraint of trade in any meaningful sense of the term, cf. Packard Motor Car Co. v. Webster Motor Car Co., 100 U.S. App. D.C. 161, 243 F.2d 418; Fargo Glass & Paint Co. v. Globe American Corp., 201 F.2d 534.\n\nTo overcome these apparent barriers to any holding that 1 of the Sherman Act was here violated, petitioner suggests two theories under which respondents' conduct might constitute a forbidden restraint of trade: (1) That by reason of the \"leverage of its network power\" CBS was able to restrain trade among the independently owned UHF stations in the Milwaukee area; and (2) that CBS' purchase of a television station amounted, per se, to an unreasonable restraint of trade. How either of these alleged restraints, assuming they are unlawful, caused petitioner's alleged loss is left a mystery. Regardless of any question of causation, however, petitioner can prevail on neither theory.\n\nTo the extent that the \"leverage\" complained of charges CBS with monopolizing a market, petitioner's claim falls under 2, a matter to which I will revert in a moment. Infra, pp. 485-486. Apart from monopoly power, the respondents could have violated the antitrust laws only by conspiring in some manner to use CBS' \"leverage\" to restrain trade. Clearly, the disaffiliation alone was not an unlawful use of the network's power. Having built up the value of his station substantially because of its CBS affiliation, petitioner is hardly in a position to claim that by depriving him, in the exercise of a contract right, of \n\n[368 \nU.S. 464, 485]\n\u00a0\n the benefit of such an affiliation CBS was unreasonably exercising its superior power to restrain trade. And there is no indication in the record that this \"leverage\" in any way affected the purchase price of petitioner's equipment, even were it to be assumed that the respondents foresaw that petitioner would be willing to sell. The charges here are unlike those in United States v. Radio Corporation of America, 158 F. Supp. 333, reversed, \n358 \nU.S. 334\n, in which the Government sought to enjoin, as violating 1, a network's attempt to coerce an independent owner into selling his station to the network under threat of canceling the network's affiliation with other stations under the same ownership. In this case there is no claim made that CBS conditioned the continuation of some network service upon petitioner's consent to sell his equipment, or on his willingness to reduce his price.\n\nNor can I agree that the contract whereby CBS became a station owner in the Milwaukee market was, in and of itself, a contract in restraint of trade. Petitioner is unable to point to any convincing differences between the vertical integration that is accomplished when a network purchases a station and that which results from an affiliation contract. Moreover, the very contention now being made here by the petitioner has repeatedly been presented to the Federal Communications Commission, and that agency has consistently adhered to the view that network ownership of stations, subject, of course, to the maximum-ownership limitation, is not contrary to the public interest. E. g., ABC-Paramount Merger, 8 Pike and Fischer Radio Reg. 541; St. Louis Telecast, Inc., 12 Pike and Fischer Radio Reg. 1289, 1372; National Broadcasting Co., 20 Pike and Fischer Radio Reg. 411, 419.\n\nThis Court has also been reluctant to hold that vertical expansion alone can amount to an unreasonable restraint prohibited by 1 of the Sherman Act. United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., \n334 \nU.S. 131, 173\n-174; United \n\n[368 \nU.S. 464, 486]\n\u00a0\n States v. Columbia Steel Co., \n334 \nU.S. 495, 525\n. Without of course suggesting that the Federal Communications Commission has authority to alleviate an applicant for a station license from the requirements of the antitrust laws, United States v. Radio Corporation of America, \n358 \nU.S. 334\n, in light of the uniform course of decisions by the agency familiar with the field, and in the absence of any indication that this particular purchase in fact restrained trade, I think it is clear that petitioner's injury, even if it be assumed partially attributable to CBS' purchase, may not be made the basis of a treble-damage action.\n\nPetitioner's 2 claim is if anything even more insubstantial. He contends that respondents conspired to monopolize the UHF market in Milwaukee, and perhaps across the country, and that they succeeded in their attempt, at least in Milwaukee. But it is undisputed that the television sets being produced and sold in the Milwaukee area at the time of the alleged conspiracy were all equipped to receive VHF broadcasts and could be adapted to receive UHF signals as well. Thus, any UHF station was necessarily in competition with all VHF stations in the market with respect to both the viewing and the advertising public. Indeed, as the record uncontrovertedly shows, the CBS station ultimately succumbed because the VHF competition was too strong. Since CBS was patently not a monopolist in the Milwaukee market (which included both UHF and VHF), and since there was no allegation that it approached monopoly power in any other market in which petitioner was a competitor, the entry of summary judgment in favor of the respondents on this claim too was eminently correct.\n\nI have gone into this matter at some length because in my opinion the Court's encouragement of this sort of antitrust \"enforcement\" does disservice to the healthy observance of these laws. I would affirm.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Under 15 U.S.C. 15 \"Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws is given a private right of action.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The last of these allegations was not included in the complaint since the station acquired by CBS did not cease operations until after this suit was brought. It was alleged, however, in petitioner's supplemental affidavit in response to the motion for summary judgment.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] If such issues of fact were open and petitioner could prove at the trial that respondents' motives were unlawful, I think it would still be incumbent upon him to prove that the disaffiliation of WCAN was part of the illegal scheme. There is evidence in the record, not contradicted, tending to show that CBS would have canceled that affiliation without regard to its purchase of the Bartell station. If so, much, if not all, of petitioner's alleged loss would have been incurred because of this unilateral act, and not \"by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] While I do not reach respondents' contention that no consensual arrangement of any kind was shown, I must say that the Court has stretched very far in suggesting that Holt may have been a \"conspirator.\" The record shows, beyond any real possibility of contradiction, that Holt was simply engaged by CBS to act for it, as undisclosed principal, in procuring from Bartell an option to purchase WOKY. So far as Bartell is concerned, it stands uncontroverted in the record that he never knew of CBS' interest in Holt's option until it was exercised by CBS.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The record shows that the undisclosed employment of Holt was due to CBS' desire to keep its competitors, particularly the National Broadcasting Company, from knowledge of its intentions respecting WOKY. This is, of course, a perfectly normal business phenomenon.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] There is no suggestion that petitioner was not afforded opportunity to examine any witness he wanted, either before or after respondents made their motion for summary judgment.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The assertion that respondents sought to destroy \"the UHF industry . . . because of the enormous economic investment they had in VHF,\" upon which the Court relies (ante, p. 469), was not made in any of the papers filed with the District Court. It was first raised during oral argument on the motion for summary judgment. There is nothing in the record to support this charge except the hindsight inference arising from the fact that after four years of operating the UHF station in Milwaukee, CBS discontinued it, claiming that the VHF competition was too powerful.\n\nThe Court's opinion takes out of context certain statements in a CBS report and infers from them that CBS was intending to make only a short-term venture out of its UHF purchase. But a full reading of the report in question, which was appended to petitioner's affidavit in opposition to the motion for summary judgment, reveals that CBS rejected the suggestion that it purchase a UHF station in a market that was primarily VHF, for the very reason that it would have only short-term advantages. Moreover, the Court's construction of the passage on which it relies hardly reflects its real meaning. The central question on which the report focused was \"the degree of short-term cost and inconvenience that is to be undergone in order to obtain the eventual gain\" in the purchase of a UHF station. In this context, the report noted that CBS television programs, broadcast by a CBS affiliate in the area (i. e., WCAN), had already built up a UHF viewing market, so that the losses that might be expected at the outset of any such venture would be minimized. The inference is that it would be wise for CBS to capitalize on this headstart before it was cut into by more VHF stations, not that CBS should purchase the station and abandon it as soon as other VHF stations entered the market.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] The record shows that Poller from the beginning had unsuccessfully tried to persuade CBS to enlarge the term of his affiliation contract cancellation clause from six months to two years, and that, with eyes thus open, he nonetheless proceeded with his substantial equipment investment.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] One of the introductory clauses of the contract provided:\n\n\"WHEREAS, Midwest [petitioner] has represented to CBS that Midwest intends to continue the operation of WCAN and all business incidental thereto, and for that purpose CBS proposes to make the sale and transfers hereinafter set forth; . . .\"\n\n\n I find no persuasive basis in the record for petitioner's assertion that this was designed as a self-serving declaration to cloak CBS' alleged antitrust malefactions. By that same contract CBS sold to Poller the WOKY equipment, in part consideration for the purchase of his equipment, the thought quite evidently being that such equipment would suffice for his continued operations, while the superior WCAN equipment would relieve CBS from the necessity of completely re-equipping WOKY. \n\n[368 \nU.S. 464, 487]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","154":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPORTER v.

With him on the brief were Solicitor General Cox, Assistant Attorney General Orrick and Herbert E. Morris.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis case raises the question of whether benefits paid by the United States Veterans' Administration retain their exempt status under 38 U.S.C. 3101 (a)\n1\n after being \n\n[370 \nU.S. 159, 160]\n\u00a0\n deposited in an account in a federal savings and loan association. Petitioner, an incompetent Air Force veteran, had suffered a judgment at the hands of respondent. The latter in an effort to satisfy its judgment attached a checking account and two accounts in local federal savings and loan associations, all of which had been established by petitioner's Committee with funds received from the Veterans' Administration as disability compensation due the petitioner. The District Court, on motion, held all three of the accounts exempt under the statute. 185 F. Supp. 302. Respondent appealed as to the savings and loan association accounts, and the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia reversed in a divided opinion. 111 U.S. App. D.C. 267, 296 F.2d 389. Certiorari was granted in view of the importance of the question in the administration of the Act. \n368 \nU.S. 937\n. We agree with the District Court that the funds involved here are exempt under the statute; therefore we reverse the judgment below.\n\nSince 1873 it has been the policy of the Congress to exempt veterans' benefits from creditor actions as well as from taxation.\n2\n In 1933 in Trotter v. Tennessee, \n290 \nU.S. 354\n, the Court had occasion to pass upon the exemptive provision of the World War Veterans' Act of 1924, 43 Stat. 607, 613. It held that the exemption spent its force when the benefit funds \"lost the quality of moneys\" and were converted into \"permanent investments.\" This distinction was adopted by the Congress when the Act was \n\n[370 \nU.S. 159, 161]\n\u00a0\n amended in 1935, 49 Stat. 607, 609, to provide, inter alia, that such payments shall be exempt \"either before or after receipt by the beneficiary\" but that the exemption shall not \"extend to any property purchased in part or wholly out of such payments.\"\n3\n Thereafter in Lawrence v. Shaw, \n300 \nU.S. 245\n (1937), the Court held that bank credits derived from veterans' benefits were within the exemption, the test being whether as so deposited the benefits remained subject to demand and use as the needs of the veteran for support and maintenance required. It was noted that the allowance of interest on such deposits would not destroy the exemption. Two years later the Court held that negotiable notes and United States bonds purchased with veterans' benefits and \"held as investments\" had no federal statutory immunity. Carrier v. Bryant, \n306 \nU.S. 545\n (1939). The Act was again amended in 1958, but no significant changes were made in the exemption provision. As so written it is here at issue.\n\nIt appears that the practices and procedures vary as to withdrawal of funds from federal savings and loan associations. Under the law the depositor is a shareholder rather than a creditor, and his deposits are subject to withdrawal only after a 30-day demand. However, the District Court found that a withdrawal from the accounts here involved could be made \"as quickly as a withdrawal from a checking account . . . .\" In addition, the integrity of the deposits was assured by federal supervision of the associations plus federal insurance of the accounts. Under such conditions the funds were subject to immediate \n\n[370 \nU.S. 159, 162]\n\u00a0\n and certain access and thus plainly had \"the quality of moneys.\" As to whether the deposits were \"permanent investments,\" we note they were not of a speculative character nor were they time deposits at interest. Moreover, it affirmatively appears that at times petitioner drew moneys from the savings and loan fund for his support and maintenance requirements and that no other funds whatever are now available to him, his disability payments having been cut off. It therefore appears clear to us that the savings and loan deposits here, rather than being investments, are the only funds presently available to meet petitioner's needs.\n\nSince legislation of this type should be liberally construed, see Trotter v. Tennessee, supra, at 356, to protect funds granted by the Congress for the maintenance and support of the beneficiaries thereof, Lawrence v. Shaw, supra, at 250, we feel that deposits such as are involved here should remain inviolate. The Congress, we believe, intended that veterans in the safekeeping of their benefits should be able to utilize those normal modes adopted by the community for that purpose - provided the benefit funds, regardless of the technicalities of title and other formalities, are readily available as needed for support and maintenance, actually retain the qualities of moneys, and have not been converted into permanent investments.\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\n THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"(a) Payments of benefits due or to become due under any law administered by the Veterans' Administration shall not be assignable except to the extent specifically authorized by law, and such payments made to, or on account of, a beneficiary shall be exempt from taxation, shall be exempt from the claim of creditors, and shall not be liable to attachment, levy, or seizure by or under any legal or equitable process whatever, either before or after receipt by the beneficiary.

However, in Carrier v. Bryant, \n306 \nU.S. 545\n (1939), the Court held that benefits invested in property were also nonexempt from creditor actions, since they were not \"payments of benefits due or to become due\" and thus did not fall within the initial immunizing language.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS.\n\nHeretofore the test of exemption under this Act has been whether the funds had taken the form of \"permanent investments,\" on the one hand (Trotter v. Tennessee, \n290 \nU.S. 354, 357\n), or on the other were \"subject to \n\n[370 \nU.S. 159, 163]\n\u00a0\n draft upon demand,\" as in the case of checking accounts. Lawrence v. Shaw, \n300 \nU.S. 245, 250\n. Negotiable notes and United States bonds were held to be nonexempt in Carrier v. Bryant, \n306 \nU.S. 545\n. Yet so far as we know, those notes and bonds may have had the same or a comparable degree of liquidity as the present share account in the federal savings and loan association enjoys. Today, however, we hold these accounts exempt. Stocks and bonds cannot, of course, be fractionalized and converted into cash in small amounts, such as may be done with savings accounts and checking accounts. But stocks and bonds may be so liquid as to be tantamount to cash in hand and therefore serve, as well as any bank deposit, the needs of the veteran.\n\nBy the standards announced in the earlier decisions share accounts in federal savings and loan associations are \"investments.\" See Wisconsin Bankers Assn. v. Robertson, 111 U.S. App. D.C. 85, 294 F.2d 714. They can be withdrawn only after 30 days' notice. The owner of a share account is a voting member of the association which, as the Court of Appeals noted, makes him \"more nearly comparable to a stockholder of a bank than one of its depositors.\" 111 U.S. App. D.C. 267, 270, 296 F.2d 389, 392. Moreover, the Home Owners' Loan Act, under which this federal association was created, makes clear that its purpose is \"to provide local mutual thrift institutions in which people may invest their funds.\" 12 U.S.C. 1464 (a). (Italics added.) Its capital\n1\n is in \"shares\" (12 U.S.C. 1464 (b)) such as are involved here. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 159, 164]\n\u00a0\n The holders of savings accounts who apply for a withdrawal of funds do not thereby become \"creditors.\"\n2\n\u00a0\n\nIn some States these share accounts may not be as liquid as checking accounts or even as liquid as stocks and bonds listed on an exchange or actively traded over-the-counter. The true test seems to me to be liquidity - that is to say, whether or not the moneys are kept in a form in which they are usable, if need be, \"for the maintenance and support of the veteran,\" as Chief Justice Hughes said in Lawrence v. Shaw, supra, at 250.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"Capital\" means \"the aggregate of the payments on savings accounts,\" plus earnings, less deductions.

Public Affairs Associates, Inc., Trading as Public Affairs Press, also on certiorari to the same Court.\n\n In this action under the Declaratory Judgment Act for a determination of the rights of Vice Admiral Rickover with respect to his speeches, the record, consisting mainly of a sketchy agreed statement of facts, is not a satisfactory basis for a discretionary grant of declaratory relief relating to claims to intellectual property arising out of public employment. Pp. 111-114.\n\n 109 U.S. App. D.C. 128, 284 F.2d 262, judgment vacated and cause remanded.\n\nHarry N. Rosenfield argued the cause for Public Affairs Associates, Inc. With him on the briefs was Stanley B. Frosh.\n\nJoseph A. McDonald argued the cause for Vice Admiral Rickover. With him on the briefs were Edwin S. Nail and Harry Buchman.\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\nThese two cases arose under the Declaratory Judgment Act of June 14, 1934, 48 Stat. 955, as amended, now 28 U.S.C. (1958 ed.) 2201 and 2202. The plaintiff, an educational publishing corporation, asked defendant, Vice Admiral Rickover, for leave to publish, to an undefined extent, uncopyrighted speeches he had theretofore delivered. He refused on the ground that what he claimed to be exclusive publishing rights had been sold \n\n[369 \nU.S. 111, 112]\n\u00a0\n to another publisher, and he gave notice of copyright on speeches subsequent to the plaintiff's demand. Since the defendant threatened restraint of plaintiff's use of his speeches, the plaintiff sought this declaratory relief. The District Court dismissed the complaint on the merits, 177 F. Supp. 601. The Court of Appeals (one judge dissenting), agreeing with the District Court that the defendant had, as to his uncopyrighted speeches, the common-law rights of an author, held that he had forfeited his rights by reason of their \"publication\"; as to his copyrighted speeches, that court remanded the case to the District Court for determination of the extent to which \"fair use\" was open to the plaintiff. 109 U.S. App. D.C. 128, 284 F.2d 262. By petition for certiorari and cross-petition both parties sought review and because serious public questions were in issue we brought the cases here. \n365 \nU.S. 841\n.\n\nThe Declaratory Judgment Act was an authorization, not a command. It gave the federal courts competence to make a declaration of rights; it did not impose a duty to do so. Brillhart v. Excess Ins. Co., \n316 \nU.S. 491, 494\n, 499; Great Lakes Co. v. Huffman, \n319 \nU.S. 293, 299\n-300; Federation of Labor v. McAdory, \n325 \nU.S. 450, 462\n; Mechling Barge Lines v. United States, \n368 \nU.S. 324, 331\n. Of course a District Court cannot decline to entertain such an action as a matter of whim or personal disinclination. \"A declaratory judgment, like other forms of equitable relief, should be granted only as a matter of judicial discretion, exercised in the public interest.\" Eccles v. Peoples Bank, \n333 \nU.S. 426, 431\n. We have cautioned against declaratory judgments on issues of public moment, even falling short of constitutionality, in speculative situations. Eccles v. Peoples Bank, supra, at 432.\n\nIn these cases we are asked to determine matters of serious public concern. They relate to claims to intellectual \n\n[369 \nU.S. 111, 113]\n\u00a0\n property arising out of public employment. They thus raise questions touching the responsibilities and immunities of those engaged in the public service, particularly high officers, and the rightful demands of the Government and the public upon those serving it. These are delicate problems; their solution is bound to have far-reaching import. Adjudication of such problems, certainly by way of resort to a discretionary declaratory judgment, should rest on an adequate and full-bodied record. The record before us is woefully lacking in these requirements.\n\nThe decisions of the courts below rested on an Agreed Statement of Facts which sketchily summarized the circumstances of the preparation and of the delivery of the speeches in controversy in relation to the Vice Admiral's official duties. The nature and scope of his duties were not clearly defined and less than an adequate exposition of the use by him of government facilities and government personnel in the preparation of these speeches was given. Administrative practice, insofar as it may relevantly shed light, was not explored. The Agreed Statement of Facts was in part phrased, modified and interpreted in the course of a running exchange between trial judge and counsel. The extent of the agreement of counsel to the Agreed Statement of Facts was in part explained in the course of oral argument in the District Court. None of the undetailed and loose, if not ambiguous, statements in the Agreed Statement of Facts was subject to the safeguards of critical probing through examination and cross-examination. This is all the more disturbing where vital public interests are implicated in a requested declaration and the Government asserted no claim (indeed obliquely may be deemed not to have disapproved of the defendant's claim) although the Government was invited to appear in the litigation as amicus curiae and chose not \n\n[369 \nU.S. 111, 114]\n\u00a0\n to do so. So fragile a record is an unsatisfactory basis on which to entertain this action for declaratory relief.\n\nAccordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, with direction to return the case to the District Court for disposition not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n    It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE DOUGLAS, concurring.\n\nIt is conceded that the Declaratory Judgment Act is an authorization, not a command - a conclusion as well settled as is the proposition that the jurisdiction of federal courts is confined to \"cases\" or \"controversies.\" Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, \n300 \nU.S. 227\n. The requirements of a \"case\" or \"controversy\" and the propriety of the use of the declaratory judgment are at times closely enmeshed. In resolving those issues the Court has on the whole been niggardly in the exercise of its authority. Thus, in Doremus v. Board of Education, \n342 \nU.S. 429\n, a taxpayer's suit to declare that a public school system could not be used for religious instruction was dismissed because there was not \"the requisite financial interest.\" Id., at 435. Frothingham v. Mellon, \n262 \nU.S. 447\n - a decision with which I have great difficulty - was given new dimensions. That case held that a taxpayer of the United States had no standing to challenge a federal appropriation, since the question was essentially a matter of public, not private, concern.\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 111, 115]\n\u00a0\n Id., at 487. This ruling was projected into the state field by the Doremus case, barring relief to those legitimately concerned with the operation of the public school system.\n\nAt times the question of the \"ripeness\" of an issue for judicial review is brigaded with the appropriateness of declaratory relief. In Public Service Comm'n v. Wycoff Co., \n344 \nU.S. 237, 244\n, relief was denied though a carrier's certificate to do an interstate business was placed in jeopardy by threatened state action. That principle was extended in Eccles v. Peoples Bank, \n333 \nU.S. 426\n, to deny relief in a situation comparable to a suit to remove a cloud from one's title. For a bank was being saddled with conditions by the Federal Reserve System that crippled its activities and restricted the market for its stock. On other occasions, \"mootness\" has been used as the rubric to deny relief through the route of a declaratory judgment, even though the litigant was still insecure and in peril as a result of administrative action. Mechling Barge Lines v. United States, \n368 \nU.S. 324\n.\n\nAt other times the issue is said to be \"abstract\" because of the lack of immediacy in the threatened enforcement of a law. Thus, a person must risk going to jail or losing his job to get relief. That was true in Poe v. Ullman, \n367 \nU.S. 497\n, a case involving Connecticut's birth-control \n\n[369 \nU.S. 111, 116]\n\u00a0\n law, and in United Public Workers v. Mitchell, \n330 \nU.S. 75\n, involving Civil Service Rules restricting the political rights of federal employees.\n\nThe list is not complete. But these cases illustrate the restrictive nature of the judge-made rules which have made the federal courts so inhospitable to litigation to vindicate private rights. At no time has the Court been wholly consistent; not have I. Compare Connecticut Ins. Co. v. Moore, \n333 \nU.S. 541, 556\n (dissenting opinion), with Western Union Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n368 \nU.S. 71\n. But my maturing view is that courts do law and justice a disservice when they close their doors to people who, though not in jail nor yet penalized, live under a regime of peril and insecurity. What are courts for, if not for removing clouds on title, as well as adjudicating the rights of those against whom the law is aimed, though not immediately applied?\n\nEvers v. Dwyer, \n358 \nU.S. 202\n, is illustrative of what I deem to be the important role served by the declaratory judgment. A Negro who had not been arrested for riding a segregated bus brought a class action to have his rights and those of his class adjudicated. We held there was an \"actual controversy,\" because it was clear that the local authorities were bent on enforcing the segregation law, though they had not enforced it against this plaintiff.\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 111, 117]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe opinion of the Court in this case seems to set declaratory relief apart as suspect; it leaves the innuendo that if the case were here under a different complaint, the result might be different. I share none of these disparaging thoughts. I agree, however, that no matter what the cause of action might be, the present record leaves gaps which make an adjudication impossible. The lack of evidence as to the extent to which Rickover's literary works were products of his office is fatal for me, though, of course, it would not be to one who considers those facts irrelevant to the legal issue. The approach we take today has often been used to abdicate the judicial function under resounding utterances concerning the importance of judicial self-denial. See, e. g., United States v. Auto. Workers, \n352 \nU.S. 567, 590\n-592. It has also served to place undue emphasis upon the clarity and precision of the questions presented, as in Rescue Army v. Municipal Court, \n331 \nU.S. 549\n, where the Court subjected the appellant \"to the burden of undergoing a third trial\" in order that the issues might be in a more \"clean-cut and concrete form.\" Id., at 584. But on the present record I have no other choice, for without additional facts I must withhold decision.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"Back in 1923, the Court went further and held that the mere fact that a person could show he paid federal taxes made no difference in this respect and gave him no standing to challenge an act of Congress appropriating public funds. The Court recognized that an unconstitutional spending of public money might conceivably necessitate a rise in subsequent tax levies. Nevertheless it held that the causal connection between any specific expenditure and future tax rates would be too remote and uncertain to constitute an immediate \n\n[369 \nU.S. 111, 115]\n\u00a0\n personal injury to a taxpayer. Hence he would have no more to complain about than others.\n\n\"Rulings of this kind, designed to keep peace among the departments of government, are eminently sensible as over-all policies. Yet they also provide a way to immunize a bad law from attack in the courts: one need only frame the law in such a way as to violate the basic rights of nobody in particular but everybody in general, that is, of the entire American people. Then, since no one can point to an injury that is distinguishable from his neighbors', no one can come into court and challenge the legislation!\" Edmond Cahn, How to Destroy the Churches, Harper's Magazine, Nov. 1961, p. 36.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] And see Mitchell v. United States, \n313 \nU.S. 80\n, where we held that a Negro who filed a complaint with the Interstate Commerce Commission against an interstate carrier for discriminating against him had standing to complain, though it did not appear that he intended to make a similar railroad journey:\n\n\"He is an American citizen free to travel, and he is entitled to go by this particular route whenever he chooses to take it and in that event to have facilities for his journey without any discrimination against him which the Interstate Commerce Act forbids.\" Id., at 93.\n\n\nMR. \nCHIEF JUSTICE WARREN, with whom MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER concurs, dissenting.\n\nWith respect to those of Admiral Rickover's speeches written and delivered prior to December 1, 1958, I would affirm. The record made below and filed here is, I believe, adequate to support the judgment of the Court of Appeals that the Admiral's practice of distributing numerous copies of his speeches, without limitations as to the persons who would receive them or the purposes to which they would be put by the recipients, and without \n\n[369 \nU.S. 111, 118]\n\u00a0\n so much as a suggestion of a copyright claim, amounted to a dedication of those works to the public domain. At the same time, I recognize the inadequacy of the present record for determining now whether speeches on which a copyright notice had been placed were effectively protected by that notice from other than \"fair use,\" and whether Public Affairs intended to make only \"fair use\" of those works. I would, therefore, also affirm the remand to the District Court ordered by the Court of Appeals as to such speeches.\n\nIn the light of these views, I find it unnecessary to pass now on the questions raised in No. 36, and would dismiss that case as premature.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, dissenting.\n\nThe basic issue which brought these cases here was whether Admiral Rickover's speeches were copyrightable in light of the following provision of the Copyright Act: \"No copyright shall subsist in . . . any publication of the United States Government.\" (17 U.S.C. 8.) As I see it, decision of that issue turns not merely on whether such speeches were made by the Admiral in the \"line of duty,\" but also, and in my view more fundamentally, on whether such speeches were in any event \"publication[s] of the United States Government.\" In my opinion the record is sufficient to require adjudication on both aspects of that issue, and on this phase of the controversy I agree with the result reached by the Court of Appeals. I also agree with its determination as to the adequacy of the copyright notice affixed to speeches delivered after December 1, 1958.\n\nHowever, I consider the record inadequate to justify adjudication as to whether Admiral Rickover's right to copyright was lost with respect to speeches delivered \n\n[369 \nU.S. 111, 119]\n\u00a0\n before December 1, 1958, by reason of their alleged entry into \"the public domain.\"\n*\n As to that issue I would vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the District Court for further proceedings. In all other respects I would affirm the judgment below.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] The stipulation states that with respect to 20 of the 22 speeches made before December 1, 1958, \"Admiral Rickover mailed some to individuals who had requested copies or who Admiral Rickover believed would be interested in the subject. Some were sent by Admiral Rickover . . . to the sponsor of the speech to be made available to the press and others at the place where the speech was to be delivered.\" (Emphasis added.) It appears from the stipulation that no further distribution other than for press use was ever made. Whether the foregoing publications were general enough to amount to a dedication to the public of all or any of these speeches depends on more precise information than is afforded by the stipulation. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 111, 120]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","157":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPULLEY v.

JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nSection 301 (a) of the Labor Management Relations Act,\n1\n provides that \"Suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce as defined in this chapter, or between any such labor organizations, may be brought in any district court of the United States having jurisdiction of the parties, without respect to the amount in controversy or without regard to the citizenship of the parties.\" The questions presented in this case are: (1) Does the scope of \"contracts\" within 301 (a) include the agreement at bar, claimed to be not a \"collective bargaining contract\" but a \"strike settlement agreement\"? (2) If otherwise includible, is the \"strike settlement agreement\" cognizable under 301 (a), although the petitioners, the labor-organization parties to the agreement, acknowledged that they were not entitled to recognition as exclusive representatives of the employees of the respondents?\n\nThe opinions below appear to rest upon alternative holdings, answering in the negative each of these questions. The District Court's conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter, 179 F. Supp. 564, was affirmed in a brief per curiam by the Court of Appeals, saying: \"The contract here involved is not a collective bargaining agreement between an employer and a labor organization representing its employees. We think that the trial court was correct in reaching the conclusion that collective bargaining contracts between a union and an employer are the only contracts intended to be actionable in a United States District Court under the provisions of section 301 (a).\" 286 F.2d 235. We granted certiorari because of the importance of the questions to the enforcement \n\n[369 \nU.S. 17, 19]\n\u00a0\n of the national labor policy as expressed in 301 (a). \n366 \nU.S. 917\n. We hold that the lower courts erred and remand the cause for trial and further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n2\n\u00a0\n\nThe petitioners, local unions of the Retail Clerks International Association, brought this action on the sole jurisdictional basis of 301 (a) and (b), seeking to compel respondents' compliance with two allegedly binding arbitration awards. Respondents are two department stores in Toledo, Ohio, covered by the Labor Management Relations Act. For some years prior to 1957, petitioners had been the collective bargaining representatives of respondents' employees and had been parties to collective bargaining agreements with respondents. In November 1957, negotiations for renewal contracts ended in impasse. A strike ensued against one of the respondents, Lasalle's, and continued until December 24, 1958; the dispute with the other respondent, Lion Dry Goods, continued during the whole of those 13 months although no strike occurred. On December 24, 1958, the parties ended their dispute with the aid of the Toledo Labor-Management-Citizens' Committee (hereinafter, L-M-C), a local mediation and arbitration body.\n3\n Negotiations \n\n[369 \nU.S. 17, 20]\n\u00a0\n by means of L-M-C mediation had produced a \"Statement of Understanding\"\n4\n satisfactory to all parties.\n\nThe Statement contained such key points of settlement as the unions' acknowledgment that they were not then \n\n[369 \nU.S. 17, 21]\n\u00a0\n entitled to recognition as exclusive representatives, and would not seek such recognition unless and until certified as so entitled in single store unit elections conducted by the National Labor Relations Board, and Lasalle's agreement \n\n[369 \nU.S. 17, 22]\n\u00a0\n to reinstate striking employees without discrimination. Both stores also agreed to continue in effect detailed wage and hour schedules and provisions as to working conditions and other benefits, incorporated as exhibits to the Statement. All terms of employment had been in force prior to December 24, 1958, except an agreement by the stores to provide and pay fully for specified insurance coverage. The stores wrote the L-M-C delivering the Statement, calling it \"the basis on which the heretofore existing dispute between [the Locals] and our compan[ies] is to be fully and finally resolved,\" and specifying that \"The conditions to be performed and met by us are, of course, subject to and conditioned upon the receipt by your organization of guarantees from the respective \n\n[369 \nU.S. 17, 23]\n\u00a0\n labor organizations to make the principles enumerated [in the Statement] completely effective.\" A few days later the Locals wrote the L-M-C that \"we herewith agree to the conditions and guarantees of the Statement of Understanding.\" The conditions to be performed by each side were performed and the dispute was terminated. In a few months, however, new grievances arose, including the two that generated this case. First. The unions claimed under the Statement the right of access to the employees' cafeteria in order to communicate with employees during their non-working time. The stores claimed that Statement \u00a7 6 gave no right of access to the employees' cafeterias, for those are not \"areas of the store which are open to customers.\"\n5\n Second. Two Lasalle's employees, salesladies in the men's furnishings department, had been fully reinstated except that the saleslady formerly assigned to sell men's shirts was assigned to sell men's sweaters, and the other saleslady, who had been selling sweaters, now was assigned to sell shirts. The Locals submitted these matters to the L-M-C under the procedure of Statement \u00a7 7; the stores and the Locals participated fully in the ensuing arbitration proceedings; and the award went to the Locals on both grievances. The stores' refusal to accede to those awards prompted this suit.\n\nThe District Court viewed as crucial the question whether the Statement given by the stores to the L-M-C and then concurred in by the Locals, constituted \"such a contract as is contemplated by Section 301 (a).\" 179 F. Supp., at 567. Although the opinion is somewhat ambiguous, we read it as holding that there was a contract between the Locals and the stores but that only certain kinds of contracts are within the purview of 301 (a) and \n\n[369 \nU.S. 17, 24]\n\u00a0\n this was not one of them.\n6\n We interpret the District Court as holding that to be within 301 (a), contracts must be \"collective bargaining contracts, or agreements arrived at through collective bargaining,\" ibid.; and further, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 17, 25]\n\u00a0\n must be with a union that is the recognized majority representative of the employees. The court found that the Statement of Understanding met neither test.\n7\n The Court of Appeals' brief affirmance, supra, fails to make clear whether it agreed with both of those limitations on 301 (a), or with only one and if so which one.\n\nIt is argued that Congress limited 301 (a) jurisdiction to contracts that are \"collective bargaining contracts,\" meaning, so runs the argument, only agreements concerning wages, hours, and conditions of employment concluded in direct negotiations between employers and unions entitled to recognition as exclusive representatives of employees.\n\nThe words of 301 (a) require no such narrow construction as is suggested; rather, they negate it. First. The Section says \"contracts\" though Congress knew well the phrase \"collective bargaining contracts,\" see, e. g., 8 (d), 9 (a), 201 (c), 203 (d), 204 (a) (2), 211 (a). Had Congress contemplated a restrictive differentiation, we may assume that it would not have eschewed \"collective bargaining contracts\" unwittingly. Moreover, Congress provided in 211 (a): \"For the guidance and information of interested representatives of employers, employees, and the general public, the Bureau of Labor Statistics . . . shall maintain a file of copies of all available collective bargaining agreements and other available agreements and actions thereunder settling or adjusting labor disputes.\"\n8\n Whatever the proper construction of that Section, insofar as it reflects upon \n\n[369 \nU.S. 17, 26]\n\u00a0\n 301 (a) at all, it supports the inference that \"contracts\" does include more than \"collective bargaining agreements,\" at least as respondents would define them. Second. If \"contracts\" means only collective bargaining contracts, the subsequent words \"or between any such labor organizations\" are superfluous, for if there is a collective bargaining agreement between unions it follows that as to that agreement, one union is the employer and the other represents employees. See Office Employees Union v. Labor Board, \n353 \nU.S. 313\n. Congress was not indulging in surplusage: A federal forum was provided for actions on other labor contracts besides collective bargaining contracts. See, e. g., United Textile Workers v. Textile Workers Union, 258 F.2d 743 (no-raiding agreement). But, it is urged, though Congress meant that labor organizations could sue one another in federal courts on other contracts between themselves, suits between employers and unions were still limited to actions on collective bargaining contracts: The provision for suits between labor organizations was inserted in Conference.\n9\n Differing House and Senate bills were reconciled in Conference. The House bill spoke of suits involving a violation of \"an agreement between an employer and a labor organization or other representative of employees . . . .\" The Senate bill read \"contracts concluded as the result of collective bargaining between an employer and a labor organization . . . .\"\n10\n It is urged that the Conference compromise upon the word \"contracts\" reflects a desire to use one word to cover both suits between employers and unions, and suits between unions. But it seems obvious that had Congress intended any limiting differentiation, this would have been accomplished by retaining the Senate bill's phrasing for agreements between employers and \n\n[369 \nU.S. 17, 27]\n\u00a0\n unions and then providing specifically for the application of the statute to \"contracts between any such labor organizations.\" Third. A 1959 enactment, 8 (f),\n11\n explicitly contemplates contracts that would not fit respondents' concept of \"collective bargaining agreements.\" It authorizes contracting with unions that represent persons not yet even hired by the employer. Such a contract might cover only hiring procedures and not wages, hours, and conditions of employment. Nothing supports the improbable congressional intent that the federal courts be closed to such contracts.\n\nWe find, then, from a reading of the words of 301 (a), both in isolation and in connection with the statute as a whole, no basis for denying jurisdiction of the action based upon the alleged violation of the \"strike settlement agreement.\"\n\nFurthermore, the statute's purpose would be defeated by excluding such contracts from \"contracts\" cognizable under 301 (a). See Charles Dowd Box Co. v. Courtney, \n368 \nU.S. 502\n. If this kind of strike settlement were not enforceable under 301 (a), responsible and stable labor relations would suffer, and the attainment of the labor policy objective of minimizing disruption of interstate commerce would be made more difficult. It is no answer that in a particular case the agreement might be enforceable in state courts: a main goal of 301 was precisely to end \"checkerboard jurisdiction,\" Seymour v. Schneckloth, \n368 \nU.S. 351\n, at 358. See Charles Dowd Box Co. v. Courtney, supra.\n\nLastly, legislative history refutes the argument that Congress intended to omit agreements of the kind in suit from \"contracts\" falling within the purview of 301 (a).\n12\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 17, 28]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe need not decide whether or not this strike settlement agreement is a \"collective bargaining agreement\" to hold, as we do, that it is a \"contract\" for purposes of 301 (a). \"Contract in labor law is a term the implications of which must be determined from the connection in which it appears.\" J. I. Case Co. v. Labor Board, \n321 \nU.S. 332, 334\n. It is enough that this is clearly an agreement between employers and labor organizations significant to the maintenance of labor peace between them. It came into being as a means satisfactory to both sides for terminating a protracted strike and labor dispute. Its terms affect the working conditions of the employees of both respondents. It effected the end of picketing and resort by the labor organizations to other economic weapons, and restored strikers to their jobs. It resolved a controversy arising out of, and importantly and directly affecting, the employment relationship. Plainly it falls within 301 (a). \"[F]ederal courts should enforce these agreements on behalf of or against labor organizations and . . . industrial peace can be best obtained only in that way.\" Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills, \n353 \nU.S. 448, 455\n.\n\nOnly a few words are necessary to dispose of respondents' second contention, that even if this agreement were otherwise within 301 (a), petitioners' disclaimer of entitlement to recognition as exclusive representatives puts them out of court. This issue does not touch upon whether minority unions may demand that employers enter into particular kinds of contracts or the circumstances under which employers may accord recognition to \n\n[369 \nU.S. 17, 29]\n\u00a0\n unions as exclusive bargaining agents. The question is only whether \"labor organization representing employees\" in 301 (a) has a meaning different from \"labor organization which represents employees\" in 301 (b). In United States v. Ryan, \n350 \nU.S. 299\n, we rejected the argument that 301 (b) was limited to majority representatives. Neither the words, purpose, nor history of the statute suggests any reason for a different construction of the virtually identical words of subsection (a). Nor can \"labor organization representing employees\" in 301 (a) be read as differing from \"any such labor organizations\" in that subsection's very next phrase, and plainly, in suits between labor organizations, their right to recognition as exclusive representatives vis-a-vis employers has no relevance whatever.\n\n\"Members only\" contracts have long been recognized. See, e. g., Consolidated Edison Co. v. Labor Board, \n305 \nU.S. 197\n. Had Congress thought that there was any merit in limiting federal jurisdiction to suits on contracts with exclusive bargaining agents, we might have expected Congress explicitly so to provide, for example, by enacting that 301 (a) should be read with 9 (a). Compare 8 (a) (3), 8 (a) (5), 8 (b) (3), 8 (b) (4), 8 (d). Moreover, 8 (f), the 1959 amendment considered supra, p. 27, contemplates contracting with unions that would not represent a majority. Lastly, if the federal courts' jurisdiction under 301 (a) required a preliminary determination of the representative status of the labor organization involved, potential conflict with the National Labor Relations Board would be increased, cf. La Crosse Telephone Corp. v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Board, \n336 \nU.S. 18\n; Amazon Cotton Mill Co. v. Textile Workers Union, 167 F.2d 183, and litigation would be much hindered.\n\n\n We conclude that the petitioners' action for alleged violation of the strike settlement agreement was cognizable \n\n[369 \nU.S. 17, 30]\n\u00a0\n by the District Court under 301 (a). The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 61 Stat. 156, 29 U.S.C. 185 (a).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Respondents claim that the cause is moot since, after the commencement of this action, the petitioners merged with Local 954 of the same International Union to form a new Local 954. Petitioners deny mootness and move to add or substitute Local 954 as a party. The facts of the merger make this case indistinguishable from De Veau v. Braisted, \n363 \nU.S. 144\n; see also Labor Board v. Insurance Agents' International Union, \n361 \nU.S. 477\n. We therefore hold that the case is not moot, and the petitioners' motion to add Local 954 as a party is granted.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Before 1957, the respondents and two other downtown Toledo department stores, through an organization, Retail Associates, Inc., recognized the petitioners as representatives of their employees and executed collective bargaining agreements with the petitioners on a multi-employer basis. When the 1957 impasse developed, the petitioners \n\n[369 \nU.S. 17, 20]\n\u00a0\n struck one of those two other stores and it promptly contracted separately with the petitioners. Respondents and the second of the two other stores petitioned the National Labor Relations Board to conduct an election among the employees of the three stores as a single bargaining unit. The petitioners reacted with a demand that each store negotiate separately. Simultaneously, the petitioners called the strike at respondent Lasalle's. The dispute produced considerable litigation. See Local 128, Retail Clerks v. Leedom, 42 LRR Man. 2031; Retail Associates, Inc., 120 N. L. R. B. 388; Retail Clerks Assn. v. Leedom, 43 LRR Man. 2004, 2029.\n\nA few days before December 24, 1958, the L-M-C proposed a plan for settling the dispute. Discussions ensued between the Committee and the respondents, and between the Committee and the petitioners. At no time were direct negotiations carried on between petitioners and the respondents. Each side made known to the L-M-C the conditions under which it was willing to resolve the dispute and the L-M-C discussed these conditions with the other side. In this manner a basis for settlement was fashioned which was embodied in the Statement referred to in the text.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The Lasalle's Statement of Understanding (exhibits omitted) reads as follows:\n\n\"1. Employees of Lasalle's, who have been absent due to the strike, will be re-instated without discrimination because of any strike activities and without loss of seniority provided they make application for reinstatement in the form and manner provided for by the employer within fifteen days of receipt of notice from the employer.\n\n\n\"2. All such employees who have complied with the provisions of Paragraph 1 above, will be returned to work not later than February 2, 1959, as scheduled by the Company, in their former position classifications if vacant or in positions comparable in duties and earning opportunities.\n\n\n\"3. It is understood that returning strikers will devote their best efforts to their work and to serving the customers of Lasalle's, recognizing that stability of employment depends upon the success of the business.\n\n\n\"4. Lasalle's will warrant to the L-M-C that the Company will not reduce rates of pay presently in effect or withdraw or reduce \n\n[369 \nU.S. 17, 21]\n\u00a0\n employee benefit programs currently provided. This assurance includes all improvements offered by the Company through the L-M-C on November 15th, 1957, which are already in effect. No employee will be discriminated against, by reason of Union activities, membership or non-membership. All employees will continue to have job security and no employee will be discharged except for just cause. Wage schedules currently in effect are appended as Exhibit A. Copies of hours and working conditions and other existing benefits, as requested by L-M-C are attached as Exhibit B.\n\n\n\"5. Neither the Company nor the Union will interfere with the employee's right to join or not to join a union, as provided and guaranteed by the Labor-Management-Relations Act. Nothing contained herein is to be construed as giving recognition to the union unless at some future time within the discretion of the union, the union is certified as having been chosen by a majority of employees in a single store unit election conducted by the National Labor Relations Board.\n\n\n\"6. The Union agrees that it will not request bargaining rights unless it proves its right to represent the employees as provided in Paragraph 5 above; nor will the employer recognize any union except upon certification by the N. L. R. B.; nor will the Company file a petition for election unless a claim for representation is made upon the employer. Nothing herein shall preclude an employee representative from entering areas of the store which are open to customers; or from communicating with employees, provided such communication is on the employee's non-working time and in no way interferes with the operating of the business.\n\n\n\"7. Any individual employee who may have a grievance involving an interpretation or application of or arising under the terms of this understanding with the L-M-C, and who has presented such grievance to his supervisor and the Personnel Department without reaching a satisfactory solution, may take his case to the chairman of the L-M-C who in turn shall refer the case to a panel of the L-M-C, whose majority decision and order shall be final and binding. The panel shall render its decision and order within fifteen days after the grievance has been submitted to it. The procedure regulating the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 17, 22]\n\u00a0\n hearing of the grievance by the L-M-C panel shall be determined by the panel.\n\n\n\"8. The Union will agree that immediately upon receipt of this statement of understanding by the Toledo Labor-Management-Citizens Committee it will cease all picketing, boycotting or other interference with the business of Lasalle's, or R. H. Macy & Co., Inc. wherever located. The Union, the strikers, and the Company shall withdraw forthwith all petitions, unfair labor practice charges and litigation before the National Labor Relations Board and the Courts and further agree not to institute in the future any litigation involving or arising out of the instant dispute. The Union and the Employer shall execute mutually satisfactory releases, releasing and discharging each other, the International Union, the local unions involved, and representatives of the union in their representative or individual capacity, labor papers, and all other labor organizations or their representatives who acted in concert or cooperation in connection with the dispute, from any and all claims, demands, causes of action, of whatever nature or description arising out of the labor dispute, including but not limited to the strikes, picketing, boycotting, and all other activities which may have taken place up to the present date.\n\n\n\"9. This understanding shall become effective in accordance with the letter of transmittal dated December 24, 1958.\"\n\n\n The Lion Store's Statement is identical except for the omission of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The parties' trial stipulation says, inter alia: \"[T]he employee cafeterias in the downtown stores of the defendants . . . are located in areas in each of the stores not open to customers; . . .\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The District Court relied for its view of the limited meaning of \"contracts\" under 301 (a) upon Schatte v. International Alliance, 84 F. Supp. 669. However, that case decided as to 301 only that the section did not apply to a cause of action which arose before its enactment. 182 F.2d 158, 164-165.\n\nApart from the question of its cognizability under 301 (a), it is clear that the Statement constitutes a contract between the parties. This is so, although they did not negotiate directly but through a mediator, and did not conjoin their signatures on one document. The record makes obvious that neither the parties nor L-M-C contemplated two independent agreements, one by each side with L-M-C only, unenforceable by either side against the other.\n\nThe parties stipulated as to the arbitration proceedings that it was \"assumed by all parties in attendance to be a meeting of a panel chosen . . . to perform proper functions delegated to such a panel under the provisions of . . . [the] Statements of Understanding . . . .\" They further stipulated that \"nothing . . . [herein] is to preclude the Court from finding that the settlement of December 24, 1958, was a collective bargaining agreement.\" In their answer in the District Court, respondents denied \"that there is in existence any contract between the plaintiffs, or either of them, and the defendants, or either of them, or that there is in existence any agreement between the parties, collectively or singly, whereby the [L-M-C] is given any right or authority to arbitrate any grievance which the plaintiffs might claim to have.\" Petitioners claim and the respondents do not deny that at no time prior to their answer had respondents suggested there was no contract: they complied with the conditions for ending the dispute, they continued following the old wage and hour schedules and other provisions, they participated in the arbitration proceedings and they asked the L-M-C to reconsider their awards on the merits.\n\nRespondents' contention throughout, whether because of the stipulation or otherwise, has been not to negate the existence of any contract at all, but rather to deny that there is a contract of the kind contemplated by 301 (a). The District Court so construed the defense, 179 F. Supp., at 565. The Court of Appeals appears to have \n\n[369 \nU.S. 17, 25]\n\u00a0\n agreed; see supra. And at no point in their brief in this Court do respondents argue that no contract exists; they agree that the only issue is jurisdictional.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The court emphasized that the Statement disclaimed the Locals' right to be recognized as exclusive bargaining agent until so certified by the National Labor Relations Board.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] 61 Stat. 156, 29 U.S.C. 181 (a).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] 2 N.

None of the many references to \"collective bargaining contracts\" evinces a consideration of the meaning or scope of that phrase.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, concurring.\n\nI wholly agree with the Court in rejecting the restrictive meaning given by the Court of Appeals to \"contracts\" in 301 (a) of the Labor Management Relations Act. I have, however, serious doubt whether the \"statement of understanding\" on the basis of which the strike was settled was in fact a contract, in the sense of a consensual arrangement between the Retail Clerks and Lion Dry Goods, rather than a formulation of the results of the intercession of a public-spirited intermediary on the basis of which each side was prepared to lay down its arms. However, on a matter of construing a particular document, in light of the surrounding circumstances, I do not desire to dissent. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 17, 31]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","161":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRICHARDS v. UNITED STATES(1962)\nNo. 59\nArgued: November 15, 1961Decided: February 26, 1962\n\n\n\n\n Petitioners are the personal representatives of passengers killed when a commercial airplane crashed in Missouri while en route from Oklahoma to New York. The maximum amount recoverable under the Missouri Wrongful Death Act had either been paid or tendered to them by the airline; but they sued in a Federal District Court in Oklahoma to recover from the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act additional amounts which they claimed to be due them under the Oklahoma Wrongful Death Act, which contains no limitation on the amount a single person may recover from a tortfeasor. They claimed that the Government, through the Federal Aviation Agency, had negligently failed to enforce the terms of the Civil Aeronautics Act and regulations thereunder which prohibited the practices then being used by the airline in its overhaul depot in Oklahoma. The District Court dismissed the complaint and the Court of Appeals affirmed. Held: The judgment is affirmed. Pp. 2-16.\n\n (a) In the Tort Claims Act, Congress has enacted a rule which requires federal courts, in multistate tort actions, to look in the first instance to the law of the State where the acts of negligence took place. Pp. 6-10.\n\n\n (b) A reading of the statute as a whole, with due regard to its purpose, requires application of the whole law of the State where \n\n[369 \nU.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n the act or omission occurred, including its choice-of-laws rules. Pp. 10-15.\n\n\n (c) Both the Federal District Court in Oklahoma and the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit have interpreted the pertinent Oklahoma decisions as declaring that an action for wrongful death is based on the statute of the place where the injury occurred that caused the death; that determination of the question of state law is accepted by this Court and is controlling here; the Missouri statute, therefore, controls this case; and petitioners have failed to state claims upon which relief could be granted. Pp. 15-16.\n\n\n 285 F.2d 521, affirmed.\n\nTruman B. Rucker argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the briefs was Edward M. O'Brien.\n\nRichard J. Medalie argued the cause for the United States. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Cox, Assistant Attorney General Orrick, Alan S. Rosenthal and Sherman L. Cohn.\n\nW. B. Patterson argued the cause for American Airlines, Inc., respondent. With him on the briefs was Fred M. Mock.\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe question to be decided in this case is what law a Federal District Court should apply in an action brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act\n1\n where an act of negligence occurs in one State and results in an injury and death in another State. The basic provision of the Tort Claims Act states that the Government shall be liable for tortious conduct committed by its employees acting within the scope of their employment \"under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n law of the place where the act or omission occurred.\"\n2\n The parties urge that the alternatives in selecting the law to determine liability under this statute are: (1) the internal law of the place where the negligence occurred, or (2) the whole law (including choice-of-law rules) of the place where the negligence occurred, or (3) the internal law of the place where the operative effect of the negligence took place.\n\nAlthough the particular facts of this case are relatively unimportant in deciding the question before us, a brief recitation of them is necessary to set the context for our decision. The petitioners are the personal representatives of passengers killed when an airplane, owned by the respondent American Airlines, crashed in Missouri while en route from Tulsa, Oklahoma, to New York City. Suit was brought by the petitioners against the United States in the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma, on the theory that the Government, through the Federal Aviation Agency, had \"negligently failed to enforce the terms of the Civil Aeronautics Act and the regulations thereunder which prohibited the practices then being used by American Airlines, Inc., in the overhaul depot of Tulsa, Oklahoma.\"\n3\n The petitioners in each case either had already received a $15,000 settlement from the Airlines, the maximum amount recoverable under the Missouri Wrongful Death Act,\n4\n or had been tendered that amount. They sought additional amounts from the United States under the Oklahoma Wrongful \n\n[369 \nU.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n Death Act\n5\n which contains no limitation on the amount a single person may recover from a tortfeasor. The Government filed a third-party complaint against American Airlines, seeking reimbursement for any amount that the petitioners might recover against the United States.\n\nAfter a pretrial hearing, the District Court ruled that the complaints failed to state claims upon which relief could be granted under the Oklahoma Act since that statute could not be applied extraterritorially \"where an act or omission occurring in Oklahoma results in injury and death in the State of Missouri.\"\n6\n Alternatively, the court noted that if Oklahoma law was applicable under the Federal Tort Claims Act, \"then the general law of Oklahoma, including its conflicts of law rule, is applicable thereunder,\" thus precluding further recovery since the Oklahoma conflicts rule would refer the court to the law of Missouri, the place where the negligence had its operative effect.\n7\n In dismissing the petitioners' complaints against the United States, the court found it unnecessary to pass upon the third-party complaint asserted by the Government against American. On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed the judgment by a divided vote,\n8\n the majority agreeing with the lower court that the complaints failed to state a cause of action upon which relief could be based under either the Oklahoma or the Missouri Wrongful Death Act. In dissent, the chief judge, believing that Congress intended the internal law of the place where the act or omission occurred to control the rights and liabilities of the parties, stated that he thought it was error to apply the Oklahoma \n\n[369 \nU.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n conflict-of-laws rule, and would have remanded the case for a determination of liability under the Oklahoma Act.\n\nThat the question confronting us is an important one and of a recurring nature is made apparent by the conflicting views expressed in its solution by the lower federal courts. In the five circuits in which it has arisen, resolution of the question has been reached by adoption of one or another of the alternatives urged upon us by the parties to this suit. The petitioners' contention, that the reference in Section 1346 (b) to the \"place where the act or omission occurred\" directs application of only the internal law of that State - here, Oklahoma - is supported by the Seventh Circuit's decision in Voytas v. United States, 256 F.2d 786, and by the District of Columbia Circuit in Eastern Air Lines v. Union Trust Co., 95 U.S. App. D.C. 189, 221 F.2d 62, as well as by the dissenting judge of the Tenth Circuit in the instant case. The Government's interpretation of the Act, that in order also to give effect to Section 2674,\n9\n providing that the United States shall be liable in the same manner as a private individual, a court must refer to the whole law of the State where the act or omission occurred, was adhered to by the Second Circuit in Landon v. United States, 197 F.2d 128, as well as by the Tenth Circuit in the case at bar. American Airlines, although willing to abide by the interpretation advanced by the Government, suggests, as an alternative, that the internal law of the place where the negligence had its operative effect - here, Missouri - should control. This construction of the Act is supported by the Ninth Circuit's decision in United States v. Marshall, 230 F.2d 183, and by the dissenting opinion in the Union Trust case, supra. It was to resolve the threefold conflict and to enunciate a rule that can be applied uniformly in Tort Claims Act cases that we granted certiorari. \n366 \nU.S. 916\n. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nThe principal provision of the Federal Tort Claims Act, originally enacted as Title IV of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946,\n10\n is Section 1346 (b), reading in pertinent part:\n\n \". . . the district courts . . . shall have exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the United States, for money damages . . . for injury or loss of property, or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.\"\n\n\n Section 2674, also relevant to our decision, provides:\n\n \"The United States shall be liable, respecting . . . tort claims, in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances, but shall not be liable for interest prior to judgment or for punitive damages.\"\n\n\n The Tort Claims Act was designed primarily to remove the sovereign immunity of the United States from suits in tort and, with certain specific exceptions, to render the Government liable in tort as a private individual would be under like circumstances.\n11\n It is evident that the Act was not patterned to operate with complete independence \n\n[369 \nU.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n from the principles of law developed in the common law and refined by statute and judicial decision in the various States. Rather, it was designed to build upon the legal relationships formulated and characterized by the States, and, to that extent, the statutory scheme is exemplary of the generally interstitial character of federal law. If Congress had meant to alter or supplant the legal relationships developed by the States, it could specifically have done so to further the limited objectives of the Tort Claims Act. That is, notwithstanding the generally interstitial character of the law, Congress, in waiving the immunity of the Government for tortious conduct of its employees, could have imposed restrictions and conditions on the extent and substance of its liability.\n12\n We must determine whether, and to what extent, Congress exercised this power in selecting a rule for the choice of laws to be applied in suits brought under the Act. And, because the issue of the applicable law is controlled by a formal expression of the will of Congress, we need not pause to consider the question whether the conflict-of-laws rule applied in suits where federal jurisdiction rests upon diversity of citizenship shall be extended to a case such as this, in which jurisdiction is based upon a federal statute.\n13\n In addition, and even though Congress has left to judicial implication the task of giving content to its will in selecting the controlling law, because of the formal expression found in the Act itself, we are presented with a situation wholly distinguishable from those cases in which our initial inquiry has been whether the appropriate rule should be the simple adoption of state \n\n[369 \nU.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n law.\n14\n Here, we must decide, first, to which State the words \"where the act or omission occurred\" direct us, and, second, whether application of the internal law or the whole law of that State would be most consistent with the legislative purpose in enacting the Tort Claims Act.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nThe legislative history of the Act, although generally extensive,\n15\n is not, except in a negative way, helpful in solving the problem of the law to be applied in a multi-state tort action such as is presented by the facts of this case. It has been repeatedly observed that Congress did not consider choice-of-law problems during the long period that the legislation was being prepared for enactment.\n16\n The concern of Congress, as illustrated by the legislative history,\n17\n was the problem of a person injured by an employee operating a government vehicle or otherwise acting within the scope of his employment, situations \n\n[369 \nU.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n rarely involving a conflict-of-laws question.\n18\n In these instances, where the negligence and the injury normally occur simultaneously and in a single jurisdiction, the law to be applied is clear, and no solution to the meaning of the words \"the law of the place where the act or omission occurred\" is required. Here, however, we are faced with events touching more than one \"place\" - a problem which Congress apparently did not explicitly consider - and, thus, we are compelled to give content to those critical words.\n\nIn the Tort Claims Act Congress has expressly stated that the Government's liability is to be determined by the application of a particular law, the law of the place where the act or omission occurred,\n19\n and we must, of course, start with the assumption that the legislative purpose is expressed by the ordinary meaning of the words used. We believe that it would be difficult to conceive of any more precise language Congress could have used to command application of the law of the place where the negligence occurred than the words it did employ in the Tort Claims Act. Thus we first reject the alternative urged by American Airlines. The legislative materials cited to us by American\n20\n not only lack probative force \n\n[369 \nU.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n in a judicial sense, but they are completely unpersuasive to support the argument that Congress intended the words \"act or omission\" to refer to the place where the negligence had its operative effect. The ease of application inherent in the rule urged by American lends a certain attractiveness, but we are bound to operate within the framework of the words chosen by Congress and not to question the wisdom of the latter in the process of construction. We conclude that Congress has, in the Tort Claims Act, enacted a rule which requires federal courts, in multistate tort actions, to look in the first instance to the law of the place where the acts of negligence took place.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nHowever, our task is not completed. Having rejected the third alternative stated initially as inconsistent with the express terminology of the Act, we must now determine the reach of the words \"law of the place.\" Do they embrace the whole law of the place where the negligence occurred, or only the internal law of that place? This problem, unlike the initial question discussed under II, supra, has not been dealt with by any formal expression of Congress and we must therefore establish the rule to be applied uniformly by lower federal courts, with due regard to the variant interests and policies expressed by the Tort Claims Act legislation. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe believe it fundamental that a section of a statute should not be read in isolation from the context of the whole Act,\n21\n and that in fulfilling our responsibility in interpreting legislation, \"we must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence, but [should] look to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and policy.\"\n22\n We should not assume that Congress intended to set the courts completely adrift from state law with regard to questions for which it has not provided a specific and definite answer in an act such as the one before us which, as we have indicated, is so intimately related to state law. Thus, we conclude that a reading of the statute as a whole, with due regard to its purpose, requires application of the whole law of the State where the act or omission occurred.\n\nWe are led to our conclusion by other persuasive factors notwithstanding the fact that the very conflict among the lower federal courts that we must here resolve illustrates the also reasonable alternative view expressed by the petitioners. First, our interpretation enables the federal courts to treat the United States as a \"private individual under like circumstances,\" and thus is consistent with the Act considered as a whole.\n23\n The general conflict-of-laws rule, followed by a vast majority of the States,\n24\n is to apply the law of the place of injury to the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n substantive rights of the parties. Therefore, where the forum State is the same as the one in which the act or omission occurred, our interpretation will enable the federal courts to treat the United States as an individual would be treated under like circumstances.\n25\n Moreover, this interpretation of the Act provides a degree of flexibility to the law to be applied in federal courts that would not be possible under the view advanced either by the petitioners or by American. Recently there has been a tendency on the part of some States to depart from the general conflicts rule in order to take into account the interests of the State having significant contact with the parties to the litigation.\n26\n We can see no compelling reason to saddle the Act with an interpretation that would \n\n[369 \nU.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n prevent the federal courts from implementing this policy in choice-of-law rules where the State in which the negligence occurred has adopted it. Should the States continue this rejection of the older rule in those situations where its application might appear inappropriate or inequitable,\n27\n the flexibility inherent in our interpretation will also be more in step with that judicial approach, as well as with the character of the legislation and with the purpose of the Act considered as a whole.\n\nIn the absence of persuasive evidence to the contrary, we do not believe that Congress intended to adopt the inflexible rule urged upon us by the petitioners. Despite the power of Congress to enact for litigation of this type a federal conflict-of-laws rule independent of the States' development of such rules, we should not, particularly in the type of interstitial legislation involved here, assume that it has done so. Nor are we persuaded to require such an independent federal rule by the petitioners' argument that there are other instances, specifically set forth in the Act,\n28\n where the liability of the United States is not co-extensive \n\n[369 \nU.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n with that of a private person under state law. It seems sufficient to note that Congress has been specific in those instances where it intended the federal courts to depart completely from state law and, also, that this list of exceptions contains no direct or indirect modification of the principles controlling application of choice-of-law rules. Certainly there is nothing in the legislative history that even remotely supports the argument that Congress did not intend state conflict rules to apply to multistate tort actions brought against the Government.\n29\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n\n\nUnder our interpretation of the Act we find it unnecessary to judge the effect of the Oklahoma courts' pronouncements that the Oklahoma Wrongful Death Act cannot be given extraterritorial effect.\n30\n\u00a0\n\n\nIV.\n\n\n\nOur view of a State's power to adopt an appropriate conflict-of-laws doctrine in a situation touching more than one place has been indicated by our discussion in Part III of this opinion.\n31\n Where more than one State has sufficiently substantial contact with the activity in question, the forum State, by analysis of the interests possessed by the States involved, could constitutionally apply to the decision of the case the law of one or another state having such an interest in the multistate activity.\n32\n Thus, an Oklahoma state court would be free to apply either its own law, the law of the place where the negligence occurred, or the law of Missouri, the law of the place where the injury occurred, to an action brought in its courts and involving this factual situation.\n33\n Both the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n Federal District Court sitting in Oklahoma, and the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, have interpreted the pertinent Oklahoma decisions,\n34\n which we have held are controlling, to declare that an action for wrongful death is based on the statute of the place where the injury occurred that caused the death.\n35\n Therefore, Missouri's statute controls the case at bar. It is conceded that each petitioner has received $15,000, the maximum amount recoverable under the Missouri Act, and the petitioners thus have received full compensation for their claims. Accordingly, the courts below were correct in holding that, in accordance with Oklahoma law, petitioners had failed to state claims upon which relief could be granted. The judgment is\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The provisions of the Tort Claims Act are now found in 28 U.S.C. 1291, 1346, 1402, 1504, 2110, 2401, 2402, 2411, 2412, and 2671-2680.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 28 U.S.C. 1346 (b).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Under 72 Stat. 778, 49 U.S.C. 1425, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Agency is charged with the responsibility of enforcing rules and regulations controlling inspection, maintenance, overhaul and repair of all equipment used in air transportation.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Mo.

American suggests that support for its argument is found in the testimony of Mr. Francis Shea, then Assistant Attorney General of the United States, before the House Committee on the Judiciary, who stated, when asked where a claimant might bring suit under the Act, that the venue \n\n[369 \nU.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n provision allowed suit to be brought either where the claimant resides or where the injury took place. Because the venue provision of the Act also contains the words \"wherein the act or omission complained of occurred\" (28 U.S.C. 1402 (b)), American contends that the reference to the place where the injury occurred should control the meaning of the \"act or omission\" language in Section 1346 (b). In addition to the fact that this testimony bears no relation to the choice-of-laws problems, and that considerations underlying the problem of venue are substantially different from those determining applicable law, we are not persuaded to allow an isolated piece of legislative history to detract from the Act the words Congress expressly employed.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 21\n] Labor Board v.

Under our construction of the Act, however, both defendants' liability would be determined by the law of Missouri. However, because of the venue provision in the statute, allowing suit to be brought where all the plaintiffs reside as well as where the act or omission occurred (28 U.S.C. 1402 (b); see Knecht v. United States, 242 F.2d 929; Olson v. United States, 175 F.2d 510), a situation may arise where a District Court could not determine the Government's and a private individual's liability in exactly the same manner.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 26\n] Grant v.

Determination requires the exercise of an informed judgment in the balancing of all the interests of the states with the most significant contacts in order best to accommodate the equities among the parties to the policies of those states.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 28\n] The Act permits claimants to sue only in the federal courts, and not in the state courts which are available in actions against a private individual, 1346 (b); the Act prescribes its own period of limitations which may be shorter or longer than that of the State, 2401 (b); the claimant cannot obtain a trial by jury under the Act, although he could against a private individual, 2402; the claimant cannot obtain interest prior to judgment in suits under the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n Act regardless of the state rule governing private individuals, 2674; the claimant cannot obtain punitive damages under the Act, even though state law may provide for it as against a private defendant, 2674; the claimant cannot recover any damages against the United States on any claim arising out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract rights, whereas he could recover such damages against a private individual, 2680 (h); the claimant cannot obtain any recovery against the United States on a claim arising in a foreign country, although he could against a private individual, 2680 (k); and the Act exempts the Government from liability for claims based on various types of activities, although a private individual would be liable in the same circumstances, 2680.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 29\n] In fact, despite the ambiguity that exists in the history due to the fact that Congress did not specifically consider the choice-of-laws problem, the legislative material indicates that Congress thought in terms of state law being applicable.

CALIFORNIA(1962)\nNo. 554\nArgued: April 17, 1962Decided: June 25, 1962\n\n\n\n\n A California statute makes it a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for any person to \"be addicted to the use of narcotics,\" and, in sustaining petitioner's conviction thereunder, the California courts construed the statute as making the \"status\" of narcotic addiction a criminal offense for which the offender may be prosecuted \"at any time before he reforms,\" even though he has never used or possessed any narcotics within the State and has not been guilty of any antisocial behavior there. Held: As so construed and applied, the statute inflicts a cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. Pp. 660-668.\n\n Reversed.\n\nSamuel Carter McMorris argued the cause and filed briefs for appellant.\n\nWilliam E. Doran argued the cause for appellee. With him on the brief were Roger Arnebergh and Philip E. Grey.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nA California statute makes it a criminal offense for a person to \"be addicted to the use of narcotics.\"\n1\n This \n\n[370 \nU.S. 660, 661]\n\u00a0\n appeal draws into question the constitutionality of that provision of the state law, as construed by the California courts in the present case.\n\nThe appellant was convicted after a jury trial in the Municipal Court of Los Angeles. The evidence against him was given by two Los Angeles police officers. Officer Brown testified that he had occasion to examine the appellant's arms one evening on a street in Los Angeles some four months before the trial.\n2\n The officer testified that at that time he had observed \"scar tissue and discoloration on the inside\" of the appellant's right arm, and \"what appeared to be numerous needle marks and a scab which was approximately three inches below the crook of the elbow\" on the appellant's left arm. The officer also testified that the appellant under questioning had admitted to the occasional use of narcotics.\n\nOfficer Lindquist testified that he had examined the appellant the following morning in the Central Jail in Los Angeles. The officer stated that at that time he had observed discolorations and scabs on the appellant's arms, \n\n[370 \nU.S. 660, 662]\n\u00a0\n and he identified photographs which had been taken of the appellant's arms shortly after his arrest the night before. Based upon more than ten years of experience as a member of the Narcotic Division of the Los Angeles Police Department, the witness gave his opinion that \"these marks and the discoloration were the result of the injection of hypodermic needles into the tissue into the vein that was not sterile.\" He stated that the scabs were several days old at the time of his examination, and that the appellant was neither under the influence of narcotics nor suffering withdrawal symptoms at the time he saw him. This witness also testified that the appellant had admitted using narcotics in the past.\n\nThe appellant testified in his own behalf, denying the alleged conversations with the police officers and denying that he had ever used narcotics or been addicted to their use. He explained the marks on his arms as resulting from an allergic condition contracted during his military service. His testimony was corroborated by two witnesses.\n\nThe trial judge instructed the jury that the statute made it a misdemeanor for a person \"either to use narcotics, or to be addicted to the use of narcotics . . . .\n3\n That portion of the statute referring to the `use' of narcotics is based upon the `act' of using. That portion of the statute referring to `addicted to the use' of narcotics is based upon a condition or status. They are not identical. . . . To be addicted to the use of narcotics is said to be a status or condition and not an act. It is a continuing offense and differs from most other offenses in the fact that [it] is \n\n[370 \nU.S. 660, 663]\n\u00a0\n chronic rather than acute; that it continues after it is complete and subjects the offender to arrest at any time before he reforms. The existence of such a chronic condition may be ascertained from a single examination, if the characteristic reactions of that condition be found present.\"\n\nThe judge further instructed the jury that the appellant could be convicted under a general verdict if the jury agreed either that he was of the \"status\" or had committed the \"act\" denounced by the statute.\n4\n \"All that the People must show is either that the defendant did use a narcotic in Los Angeles County, or that while in the City of Los Angeles he was addicted to the use of narcotics . . . .\"\n5\n\u00a0\n\nUnder these instructions the jury returned a verdict finding the appellant \"guilty of the offense charged.\" \n\n[370 \nU.S. 660, 664]\n\u00a0\n An appeal was taken to the Appellate Department of the Los Angeles County Superior Court, \"the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had\" in this case. 28 U.S.C. 1257. See Smith v. California, \n361 \nU.S. 147, 149\n; Edwards v. California, \n314 \nU.S. 160, 171\n. Although expressing some doubt as to the constitutionality of \"the crime of being a narcotic addict,\" the reviewing court in an unreported opinion affirmed the judgment of conviction, citing two of its own previous unreported decisions which had upheld the constitutionality of the statute.\n6\n We noted probable jurisdiction of this appeal, \n368 \nU.S. 918\n, because it squarely presents the issue whether the statute as construed by the California courts in this case is repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution.\n\nThe broad power of a State to regulate the narcotic drugs traffic within its borders is not here in issue. More than forty years ago, in Whipple v. Martinson, \n256 \nU.S. 41\n, this Court explicitly recognized the validity of that power: \"There can be no question of the authority of the State in the exercise of its police power to regulate the administration, sale, prescription and use of dangerous and habit-forming drugs . . . . The right to exercise this power is so manifest in the interest of the public health and welfare, that it is unnecessary to enter upon a discussion of it beyond saying that it is too firmly established to be successfully called in question.\" \n256 \nU.S., at 45\n.\n\nSuch regulation, it can be assumed, could take a variety of valid forms. A State might impose criminal sanctions, for example, against the unauthorized manufacture, prescription, sale, purchase, or possession of narcotics within its borders. In the interest of discouraging the violation \n\n[370 \nU.S. 660, 665]\n\u00a0\n of such laws, or in the interest of the general health or welfare of its inhabitants, a State might establish a program of compulsory treatment for those addicted to narcotics.\n7\n Such a program of treatment might require periods of involuntary confinement. And penal sanctions might be imposed for failure to comply with established compulsory treatment procedures. Cf. Jacobson v. Massachusetts, \n197 \nU.S. 11\n. Or a State might choose to attack the evils of narcotics traffic on broader fronts also - through public health education, for example, or by efforts to ameliorate the economic and social conditions under which those evils might be thought to flourish. In short, the range of valid choice which a State might make in this area is undoubtedly a wide one, and the wisdom of any particular choice within the allowable spectrum is not for us to decide. Upon that premise we turn to the California law in issue here.\n\nIt would be possible to construe the statute under which the appellant was convicted as one which is operative only upon proof of the actual use of narcotics within the State's jurisdiction. But the California courts have not so construed this law. Although there was evidence in the present case that the appellant had used narcotics in Los Angeles, the jury were instructed that they could convict him even if they disbelieved that evidence. The appellant could be convicted, they were told, if they found simply that the appellant's \"status\" or \"chronic condition\" was that of being \"addicted to the use of narcotics.\" And it is impossible to know from the jury's verdict that the defendant was not convicted upon precisely such a finding. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 660, 666]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe instructions of the trial court, implicitly approved on appeal, amounted to \"a ruling on a question of state law that is as binding on us as though the precise words had been written\" into the statute. Terminiello v. Chicago, \n337 \nU.S. 1, 4\n. \"We can only take the statute as the state courts read it.\" Id., at 6. Indeed, in their brief in this Court counsel for the State have emphasized that it is \"the proof of addiction by circumstantial evidence . . . by the tell-tale track of needle marks and scabs over the veins of his arms, that remains the gist of the section.\"\n\nThis statute, therefore, is not one which punishes a person for the use of narcotics, for their purchase, sale or possession, or for antisocial or disorderly behavior resulting from their administration. It is not a law which even purports to provide or require medical treatment. Rather, we deal with a statute which makes the \"status\" of narcotic addiction a criminal offense, for which the offender may be prosecuted \"at any time before he reforms.\" California has said that a person can be continuously guilty of this offense, whether or not he has ever used or possessed any narcotics within the State, and whether or not he has been guilty of any antisocial behavior there.\n\nIt is unlikely that any State at this moment in history would attempt to make it a criminal offense for a person to be mentally ill, or a leper, or to be afflicted with a venereal disease. A State might determine that the general health and welfare require that the victims of these and other human afflictions be dealt with by compulsory treatment, involving quarantine, confinement, or sequestration. But, in the light of contemporary human knowledge, a law which made a criminal offense of such a disease would doubtless be universally thought to be an infliction of cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eight and Fourteenth Amendments. See Francis v. Resweber, \n329 \nU.S. 459\n. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 660, 667]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe cannot but consider the statute before us as of the same category. In this Court counsel for the State recognized that narcotic addiction is an illness.\n8\n Indeed, it is apparently an illness which may be contracted innocently or involuntarily.\n9\n We hold that a state law which imprisons a person thus afflicted as a criminal, even though he has never touched any narcotic drug within the State or been guilty of any irregular behavior there, inflicts a cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. To be sure, imprisonment for ninety days is not, in the abstract, a punishment which is either cruel or unusual. But the question cannot be considered in the abstract. Even one day in prison would be a cruel and unusual punishment for the \"crime\" of having a common cold.\n\nWe are not unmindful that the vicious evils of the narcotics traffic have occasioned the grave concern of government. There are, as we have said, countless fronts on \n\n[370 \nU.S. 660, 668]\n\u00a0\n which those evils may be legitimately attacked. We deal in this case only with an individual provision of a particularized local law as it has so far been interpreted by the California courts.\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The statute is 11721 of the California Health and Safety Code. It provides:\n\n\"No person shall use, or be under the influence of, or be addicted to the use of narcotics, excepting when administered by or under the direction of a person licensed by the State to prescribe and administer narcotics. It shall be the burden of the defense to show that it comes within the exception. Any person convicted of violating any provision of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be sentenced \n\n[370 \nU.S. 660, 661]\n\u00a0\n to serve a term of not less than 90 days nor more than one year in the county jail. The court may place a person convicted hereunder on probation for a period not to exceed five years and shall in all cases in which probation is granted require as a condition thereof that such person be confined in the county jail for at least 90 days. In no event does the court have the power to absolve a person who violates this section from the obligation of spending at least 90 days in confinement in the county jail.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] At the trial the appellant, claiming that he had been the victim of an unconstitutional search and seizure, unsuccessfully objected to the admission of Officer Brown's testimony. That claim is also pressed here, but since we do not reach it there is no need to detail the circumstances which led to Officer Brown's examination of the appellant's person. Suffice it to say, that at the time the police first accosted the appellant, he was not engaging in illegal or irregular conduct of any kind, and the police had no reason to believe he had done so in the past.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The judge did not instruct the jury as to the meaning of the term \"under the influence of\" narcotics, having previously ruled that there was no evidence of a violation of that provision of the statute. See note 1, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] \"Where a statute such as that which defines the crime charged in this case denounces an act and a status or condition, either of which separately as well as collectively, constitute the criminal offense charged, an accusatory pleading which accuses the defendant of having committed the act and of being of the status or condition so denounced by the statute, is deemed supported if the proof shows that the defendant is guilty of any one or more of the offenses thus specified. However, it is important for you to keep in mind that, in order to convict a defendant in such a case, it is necessary that all of you agree as to the same particular act or status or condition found to have been committed or found to exist. It is not necessary that the particular act or status or condition so agreed upon be stated in the verdict.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The instructions continued \"and it is then up to the defendant to prove that the use, or of being addicted to the use of narcotics was administered by or under the direction of a person licensed by the State of California to prescribe and administer narcotics or at least to raise a reasonable doubt concerning the matter.\" No evidence, of course, had been offered in support of this affirmative defense, since the appellant had denied that he had used narcotics or been addicted to their use.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The appellant tried unsuccessfully to secure habeas corpus relief in the District Court of Appeal and the California Supreme Court.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] California appears to have established just such a program in 5350-5361 of its Welfare and Institutions Code. The record contains no explanation of why the civil procedures authorized by this legislation were not utilized in the present case.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] In its brief the appellee stated: \"Of course it is generally conceded that a narcotic addict, particularly one addicted to the use of heroin, is in a state of mental and physical illness. So is an alcoholic.\" Thirty-seven years ago this Court recognized that persons addicted to narcotics \"are diseased and proper subjects for [medical] treatment.\" Linder v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 5, 18\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Not only may addiction innocently result from the use of medically prescribed narcotics, but a person may even be a narcotics addict from the moment of his birth. See Schneck, Narcotic Withdrawal Symptoms in the Newborn Infant Resulting from Maternal Addiction, 52 Journal of Pediatrics 584 (1958); Roman and Middelkamp, Narcotic Addiction in a Newborn Infant, 53 Journal of Pediatrics 231 (1958); Kunstadter, Klein, Lundeen, Witz, and Morrison, Narcotic Withdrawal Symptoms in Newborn Infants, 168 Journal of the American Medical Association 1008 (1958); Slobody and Cobrinik, Neonatal Narcotic Addiction, 14 Quarterly Review of Pediatrics 169 (1959); Vincow and Hackel, Neonatal Narcotic Addiction, 22 General Practitioner 90 (1960); Dikshit, Narcotic Withdrawal Syndrome in Newborns, 28 Indian Journal of Pediatrics 11 (1961).\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, concurring.\n\nWhile I join the Court's opinion, I wish to make more explicit the reasons why I think it is \"cruel and unusual\" punishment in the sense of the Eighth Amendment to treat as a criminal a person who is a drug addict.\n\nIn Sixteenth Century England one prescription for insanity was to beat the subject \"until he had regained his reason.\" Deutsch, The Mentally Ill in America (1937), p. 13. In America \"the violently insane went to the whipping post and into prison dungeons or, as sometimes happened, were burned at the stake or hanged\"; and \"the pauper insane often roamed the countryside as wild men and from time to time were pilloried, whipped, and jailed.\" Action for Mental Health (1961), p. 26.\n\nAs stated by Dr. Isaac Ray many years ago:\n\n\"Nothing can more strongly illustrate the popular ignorance respecting insanity than the proposition, equally objectionable in its humanity and its logic, that the insane should be punished for criminal acts, in order to deter other insane persons from doing the same thing.\" Treatise on the Medical Jurisprudence of Insanity (5th ed. 1871), p. 56.\n\n\n Today we have our differences over the legal definition of insanity. But however insanity is defined, it is in end effect treated as a disease. While afflicted people \n\n[370 \nU.S. 660, 669]\n\u00a0\n may be confined either for treatment or for the protection of society, they are not branded as criminals.\n\nYet terror and punishment linger on as means of dealing with some diseases. As recently stated:\n\n\". . . the idea of basing treatment for disease on purgatorial acts and ordeals is an ancient one in medicine. It may trace back to the Old Testament belief that disease of any king, whether mental or physical, represented punishment for sin; and thus relief could take the form of a final heroic act of atonement. This superstition appears to have given support to fallacious medical rationales for such procedures as purging, bleeding, induced vomiting, and blistering, as well as an entire chamber of horrors constituting the early treatment of mental illness. The latter included a wide assortment of shock techniques, such as the `water cures' (dousing, ducking, and near-drowning), spinning in a chair, centrifugal swinging, and an early form of electric shock. All, it would appear, were planned as means of driving from the body some evil spirit or toxic vapor.\" Action for Mental Health (1961), pp. 27-28.\n\n\n That approach continues as respects drug addicts. Drug addiction is more prevalent in this country than in any other nation of the western world.\n1\n S. Rep. No. 1440, 84th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 2. It is sometimes referred to as \"a contagious disease.\" Id., at p. 3. But those living in a world of black and white put the addict in the category \n\n[370 \nU.S. 660, 670]\n\u00a0\n of those who could, if they would, forsake their evil ways.\n\nThe first step toward addiction may be as innocent as a boy's puff on a cigarette in an alleyway. It may come from medical prescriptions. Addiction may even be present at birth. Earl Ubell recently wrote:\n\n \"In Bellevue Hospital's nurseries, Dr. Saul Krugman, head of pediatrics, has been discovering babies minutes old who are heroin addicts.\n\n\n \"More than 100 such infants have turned up in the last two years, and they show all the signs of drug withdrawal: irritability, jitters, loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, sometimes convulsions and death.\n\n\n \"`Of course, they get the drug while in the womb from their mothers who are addicts,' Dr. Krugman said yesterday when the situation came to light. `We control the symptoms with Thorazine, a tranquilizing drug.\n\n\n \"`You should see some of these children. They have a high-pitched cry. They appear hungry but they won't eat when offered food. They move around so much in the crib that their noses and toes become red and excoriated.'\n\n\n \"Dr. Lewis Thomas, professor of medicine at New York University-Bellevue, brought up the problem of the babies Monday night at a symposium on narcotics addiction sponsored by the New York County Medical Society. He saw in the way the babies respond to treatment a clue to the low rate of cure of addiction.\n\n\n \"`Unlike the adult addict who gets over his symptoms of withdrawal in a matter of days, in most cases,' Dr. Thomas explained later, `the infant has to be treated for weeks and months. The baby continues to show physical signs of the action of the drugs. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 660, 671]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \"`Perhaps in adults the drugs continue to have physical effects for a much longer time after withdrawal than we have been accustomed to recognize. That would mean that these people have a physical need for the drug for a long period, and this may be the clue to recidivism much more than the social or psychological pressures we've been talking about.'\" N. Y. Herald Tribune, Apr. 25, 1962, p. 25, cols. 3-4.\n\n\n The addict is under compulsions not capable of management without outside help. As stated by the Council on Mental Health:\n\n \"Physical dependence is defined as the development of an altered physiological state which is brought about by the repeated administration of the drug and which necessitates continued administration of the drug to prevent the appearance of the characteristic illness which is termed an abstinence syndrome. When an addict says that he has a habit, he means that he is physically dependent on a drug. When he says that one drug is habit-forming and another is not, he means that the first drug is one on which physical dependence can be developed and that the second is a drug on which physical dependence cannot be developed. Physical dependence is a real physiological disturbance. It is associated with the development of hyperexcitability in reflexes mediated through multineurone arcs. It can be induced in animals, it has been shown to occur in the paralyzed hind limbs of addicted chronic spinal dogs, and also has been produced in dogs whose cerebral cortex has been removed.\" Report on Narcotic Addiction, 165 A. M. A. J. 1707, 1713.\n\n\n Some say the addict has a disease. See Hesse, Narcotics and Drug Addiction (1946), p. 40 et seq. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 660, 672]\n\u00a0\n\n\nOthers say addiction is not a disease but \"a symptom of a mental or psychiatric disorder.\" H. R. Rep. No. 2388, 84th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 8. And see Present Status of Narcotic Addiction, 138 A. M. A. J. 1019, 1026; Narcotic Addiction, Report to Attorney General Brown by Citizens Advisory Committee to the Attorney General on Crime Prevention (1954), p. 12; Finestone, Narcotics and Criminality, 22 Law & Contemp. Prob. 69, 83-85 (1957).\n\nThe extreme symptoms of addiction have been described as follows:\n\n \"To be a confirmed drug addict is to be one of the walking dead . . . . The teeth have rotted out; the appetite is lost and the stomach and intestines don't function properly. The gall bladder becomes inflamed; eyes and skin turn a billious yellow. In some cases membranes of the nose turn a flaming red; the partition separating the nostrils is eaten away - breathing is difficult. Oxygen in the blood decreases; bronchitis and tuberculosis develop. Good traits of character disappear and bad ones emerge. Sex organs become affected. Veins collapse and livid purplish scars remain. Boils and abscesses plague the skin; gnawing pain racks the body. Nerves snap; vicious twitching develops. Imaginary and fantastic fears blight the mind and sometimes complete insanity results. Often times, too, death comes - much too early in life . . . . Such is the torment of being a drug addict; such is the plague of being one of the walking dead.\" N. Y. L. J., June 8, 1960, p. 4, col. 2.\n\n\n Some States punish addiction, though most do not. See S. Doc. No. 120, 84th Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 41, 42. Nor does the Uniform Narcotic Drug Act, first approved in 1932 and now in effect in most of the States. Great Britain, beginning in 1920 placed \"addiction and the \n\n[370 \nU.S. 660, 673]\n\u00a0\n treatment of addicts squarely and exclusively into the hands of the medical profession.\" Lindesmith, The British System of Narcotics Control, 22 Law & Contemp. Prob. 138 (1957). In England the doctor \"has almost complete professional autonomy in reaching decisions about the treatment of addicts.\" Schur, British Narcotics Policies, 51 J. Crim. L. & Criminology 619, 621 (1961). Under British law \"addicts are patients, not criminals.\" Ibid. Addicts have not disappeared in England but they have decreased in number (id., at 622) and there is now little \"addict-crime\" there. Id., at 623.\n\nThe fact that England treats the addict as a sick person, while a few of our States, including California, treat him as a criminal, does not, of course, establish the unconstitutionality of California's penal law. But we do know that there is \"a hard core\" of \"chronic and incurable drug addicts who, in reality, have lost their power of self-control.\" S. Rep. No. 2033, 84th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 8. There has been a controversy over the type of treatment - whether enforced hospitalization or ambulatory care is better. H. R. Rep. No. 2388, 84th Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 66-68. But there is little disagreement with the statement of Charles Winick: \"The hold of drugs on persons addicted to them is so great that it would be almost appropriate to reverse the old adage and say that opium derivatives represent the religion of the people who use them.\" Narcotics Addiction and its Treatment, 22 Law & Contemp. Prob. 9 (1957). The abstinence symptoms and their treatment are well known. Id., at 10-11. Cure is difficult because of the complex of forces that make for addiction. Id., at 18-23. \"After the withdrawal period, vocational activities, recreation, and some kind of psychotherapy have a major role in the treatment program, which ideally lasts from four to six months.\" Id., at 23-24. Dr. Marie Nyswander tells us that normally a drug addict \n\n[370 \nU.S. 660, 674]\n\u00a0\n must be hospitalized in order to be cured. The Drug Addict as a Patient (1956), p. 138.\n\nThe impact that an addict has on a community causes alarm and often leads to punitive measures. Those measures are justified when they relate to acts of transgression. But I do not see how under our system being an addict can be punished as a crime. If addicts can be punished for their addiction, then the insane can also be punished for their insanity. Each has a disease and each must be treated as a sick person.\n2\n As Charles Winick has said:\n\n \"There can be no single program for the elimination of an illness as complex as drug addiction, which \n\n[370 \nU.S. 660, 675]\n\u00a0\n carries so much emotional freight in the community. Cooperative interdisciplinary research and action, more local community participation, training the various healing professions in the techniques of dealing with addicts, regional treatment facilities, demonstration centers, and a thorough and vigorous post-treatment rehabilitation program would certainly appear to be among the minimum requirements for any attempt to come to terms with this problem. The addict should be viewed as a sick person, with a chronic disease which requires almost emergency action.\" 22 Law & Contemp. Prob. 9, 33 (1957).\n\n\n The Council on Mental Health reports that criminal sentences for addicts interferes \"with the possible treatment and rehabilitation of addicts and therefore should be abolished.\" 165 A. M. A. J. 1968, 1972.\n\nThe command of the Eighth Amendment, banning \"cruel and unusual punishments,\" stems from the Bill of Rights of 1688. See Francis v. Resweber, \n329 \nU.S. 459, 463\n. And it is applicable to the States by reason of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Ibid.\n\nThe historic punishments that were cruel and unusual included \"burning at the stake, crucifixion, breaking on the wheel\" (In re Kemmler, \n136 \nU.S. 436, 446\n), quartering, the rack and thumbscrew (see Chambers v. Florida, \n309 \nU.S. 227, 237\n), and in some circumstances even solitary confinement (see Medley, \n134 \nU.S. 160, 167\n-168). \n\n[370 \nU.S. 660, 676]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe question presented in the earlier cases concerned the degree of severity with which a particular offense was punished or the element of cruelty present.\n3\n A punishment out of all proportion to the offense may bring it within the ban against \"cruel and unusual punishments.\" See O'Neil v. Vermont, \n144 \nU.S. 323, 331\n. So may the cruelty of the method of punishment, as, for example, disemboweling a person alive. See Wilkerson v. Utah, \n99 \nU.S. 130, 135\n. But the principle that would deny power to exact capital punishment for a petty crime would also deny power to punish a person by fine or imprisonment for being sick.\n\nThe Eighth Amendment expresses the revulsion of civilized man against barbarous acts - the \"cry of horror\" against man's inhumanity to his fellow man. See O'Neil v. Vermont, supra, at 340 (dissenting opinion); Francis v. Resweber, supra, at 473 (dissenting opinion).\n\nBy the time of Coke, enlightenment was coming as respects the insane. Coke said that the execution of a madman \"should be a miserable spectacle, both against law, and of extreame inhumanity and cruelty, and can be no example to others.\" 6 Coke's Third Inst. (4th ed. 1797), p. 6. Blackstone endorsed this view of Coke. 4 Commentaries (Lewis ed. 1897), p. 25.\n\nWe should show the same discernment respecting drug addiction. The addict is a sick person. He may, of course, be confined for treatment or for the protection of society.\n4\n Cruel and unusual punishment results not from confinement, but from convicting the addict of a crime. The purpose of 11721 is not to cure, but to penalize. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 660, 677]\n\u00a0\n Were the purpose to cure, there would be no need for a mandatory jail term of not less than 90 days. Contrary to my Brother CLARK, I think the means must stand constitutional scrutiny, as well as the end to be achieved. A prosecution for addiction, with its resulting stigma and irreparable damage to the good name of the accused, cannot be justified as a means of protecting society, where a civil commitment would do as well. Indeed, in 5350 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, California has expressly provided for civil proceedings for the commitment of habitual addicts. Section 11721 is, in reality, a direct attempt to punish those the State cannot commit civilly.\n5\n This prosecution has no relationship to the curing \n\n[370 \nU.S. 660, 678]\n\u00a0\n of an illness. Indeed, it cannot, for the prosecution is aimed at penalizing an illness, rather than at providing medical care for it. We would forget the teachings of the Eighth Amendment if we allowed sickness to be made a crime and permitted sick people to be punished for being sick. This age of enlightenment cannot tolerate such barbarous action.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Drug Addiction: Crime or Disease? (1961), p. XIV. \". . . even if one accepts the lowest estimates of the number of addicts in this country there would still be more here than in all the countries of Europe combined. Chicago and New York City, with a combined population of about 11 million or one-fifth that of Britain, are ordinarily estimated to have about 30,000 addicts, which is from thirty to fifty times as many as there are said to be in Britain.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] \"The sick addict must be quarantined until cured, and then carefully watched until fully rehabilitated to a life of normalcy.\" Narcotics, N. Y. Leg. Doc. No. 27 (1952), p. 116. And see the report of Judge Morris Ploscowe printed as Appendix A, Drug Addiction: Crime or Disease? (1961), pp. 18, 19-20, 21.\n\n\"These predilections for stringent law enforcement and severer penalties as answers to the problems of drug addiction reflect the philosophy and the teachings of the Bureau of Narcotics. For years the Bureau has supported the doctrine that if penalties for narcotic drug violations were severe enough and if they could be enforced strictly enough, drug addiction and the drug traffic would largely disappear from the American scene. This approach to problems of narcotics has resulted in spectacular modifications of our narcotic drug laws on both the state and federal level. . . .\n\n.  .   .   .  .\n\n\n\n\"Stringent law enforcement has its place in any system of controlling narcotic drugs. However, it is by no means the complete answer to American problems of drug addiction. In the first place it is doubtful whether drug addicts can be deterred from using drugs by threats of jail or prison sentences. The belief that fear of punishment is a vital factor in deterring an addict from using drugs rests upon a superficial view of the drug addiction process and the nature of drug addiction. . . .\n\n\n\". . . The very severity of law enforcement tends to increase the price of drugs on the illicit market and the profits to be made therefrom. The lure of profits and the risks of the traffic simply challenge the \n\n[370 \nU.S. 660, 675]\n\u00a0\n ingenuity of the underworld peddlers to find new channels of distribution and new customers, so that profits can be maintained despite the risks involved. So long as a non-addict peddler is willing to take the risk of serving as a wholesaler of drugs, he can always find addict pushers or peddlers to handle the retail aspects of the business in return for a supply of the drugs for themselves. Thus, it is the belief of the author of this report that no matter how severe law enforcement may be, the drug traffic cannot be eliminated under present prohibitory repressive statutes.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See 3 Catholic U. L. Rev. 117 (1953); 31 Marq. L. Rev. 108 (1947); 22 St. John's L. Rev. 270 (1948); 2 Stan. L. Rev. 174 (1949); 33 Va. L. Rev. 348 (1947); 21 Tul. L. Rev. 480 (1947); 1960 Wash. U. L.

The latter cannot be construed to provide treatment, unless jail sentences, without more, are suddenly to become medicinal. A comparison of the lengths of confinement under the two sections is irrelevant, for it is the purpose of the confinement that must be measured against the constitutional prohibition of cruel and unusual punishments.\n\nHealth and Safety Code 11391, to be sure, indicates that perhaps some form of treatment may be given an addict convicted under 11721. Section 11391, so far as here relevant, provides:\n\n\"No person shall treat an addict for addiction except in one of the following:\n\n\n\"(a) An institution approved by the Board of Medical Examiners, and where the patient is at all times kept under restraint and control.\n\n\n\"(b) A city or county jail.\n\n\n\"(c) A state prison.\n\n\n\"(d) A state narcotic hospital.\n\n\n\"(e) A state hospital.\n\n\n\"(f) A county hospital.\n\n\n\"This section does not apply during emergency treatment or where the patient's addiction is complicated by the presence of incurable disease, serious accident, or injury, or the infirmities of old age.\" (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n Section 11391 does not state that any treatment is required for either part or the whole of the mandatory 90-day prison term imposed by 11721. Should the necessity for treatment end before the 90-day \n\n[370 \nU.S. 660, 678]\n\u00a0\n term is concluded, or should no treatment be given, the addict clearly would be undergoing punishment for an illness. Therefore, reference to 11391 will not solve or alleviate the problem of cruel and unusual punishment presented by this case.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring.\n\nI am not prepared to hold that on the present state of medical knowledge it is completely irrational and hence unconstitutional for a State to conclude that narcotics addiction is something other than an illness nor that it amounts to cruel and unusual punishment for the State to subject narcotics addicts to its criminal law. Insofar as addiction may be identified with the use or possession of narcotics within the State (or, I would suppose, without the State), in violation of local statutes prohibiting such acts, it may surely be reached by the State's criminal law. But in this case the trial court's instructions permitted the jury to find the appellant guilty on no more proof than that he was present in California while he was addicted to narcotics.\n*\n Since addiction alone cannot \n\n[370 \nU.S. 660, 679]\n\u00a0\n reasonably be thought to amount to more than a compelling propensity to use narcotics, the effect of this instruction was to authorize criminal punishment for a bare desire to commit a criminal act.\n\nIf the California statute reaches this type of conduct, and for present purpose we must accept the trial court's construction as binding, Terminiello v. Chicago, \n337 \nU.S. 1, 4\n, it is an arbitrary imposition which exceeds the power that a State may exercise in enacting its criminal law. Accordingly, I agree that the application of the California statute was unconstitutional in this case and join the judgment of reversal.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] The jury was instructed that \"it is not incumbent upon the People to prove the unlawfulness of defendant's use of narcotics. All that the People must show is either that the defendant did use a narcotic in Los Angeles County, or that while in the City of Los Angeles he was addicted to the use of narcotics.\" (Emphasis added.) Although the jury was told that it should acquit if the appellant proved that his \"being addicted to the use of narcotics was administered [sic] by or under the direction of a person licensed by the State of California to prescribe and administer narcotics,\" this part of the instruction did not cover other possible lawful uses which could have produced the appellant's addiction.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK, dissenting.\n\nThe Court finds 11721 of California's Health and Safety Code, making it an offense to \"be addicted to the use of narcotics,\" violative of due process as \"a cruel and unusual punishment.\" I cannot agree.\n\nThe statute must first be placed in perspective. California has a comprehensive and enlightened program for the control of narcotism based on the overriding policy of prevention and cure. It is the product of an extensive investigation made in the mid-Fifties by a committee of distinguished scientists, doctors, law enforcement officers and laymen appointed by the then Attorney General, now Governor, of California. The committee filed a detailed study entitled \"Report on Narcotic Addiction\" which was given considerable attention. No recommendation was made therein for the repeal of 11721, and the State Legislature in its discretion continued the policy of that section.\n\nApart from prohibiting specific acts such as the purchase, possession and sale of narcotics, California has taken certain legislative steps in regard to the status of being a narcotic addict - a condition commonly recognized as a threat to the State and to the individual. The \n\n[370 \nU.S. 660, 680]\n\u00a0\n Code deals with this problem in realistic stages. At its incipiency narcotic addiction is handled under 11721 of the Health and Safety Code which is at issue here. It provides that a person found to be addicted to the use of narcotics shall serve a term in the county jail of not less than 90 days nor more than one year, with the minimum 90-day confinement applying in all cases without exception. Provision is made for parole with periodic tests to detect readdiction.\n\nThe trial court defined \"addicted to narcotics\" as used in 11721 in the following charge to the jury:\n\n \"The word `addicted' means, strongly disposed to some taste or practice or habituated, especially to drugs. In order to inquire as to whether a person is addicted to the use of narcotics is in effect an inquiry as to his habit in that regard. Does he use them habitually. To use them often or daily is, according to the ordinary acceptance of those words, to use them habitually.\"\n\n\n There was no suggestion that the term \"narcotic addict\" as here used included a person who acted without volition or who had lost the power of self-control. Although the section is penal in appearance - perhaps a carry-over from a less sophisticated approach - its present provisions are quite similar to those for civil commitment and treatment of addicts who have lost the power of self-control, and its present purpose is reflected in a statement which closely follows 11721: \"The rehabilitation of narcotic addicts and the prevention of continued addiction to narcotics is a matter of statewide concern.\" California Health and Safety Code 11728.\n\nWhere narcotic addiction has progressed beyond the incipient, volitional stage, California provides for commitment of three months to two years in a state hospital. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 660, 681]\n\u00a0\n California Welfare and Institutions Code 5355. For the purposes of this provision, a narcotic addict is defined as\n\n\"any person who habitually takes or otherwise uses to the extent of having lost the power of self-control any opium, morphine, cocaine, or other narcotic drug as defined in Article 1 of Chapter 1 of Division 10 of the Health and Safety Code.\" California Welfare and Institutions Code 5350. (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n This proceeding is clearly civil in nature with a purpose of rehabilitation and cure. Significantly, if it is found that a person committed under 5355 will not receive substantial benefit from further hospital treatment and is not dangerous to society, he may be discharged - but only after a minimum confinement of three months. 5355.1.\n\nThus, the \"criminal\" provision applies to the incipient narcotic addict who retains self-control, requiring confinement of three months to one year and parole with frequent tests to detect renewed use of drugs. Its overriding purpose is to cure the less seriously addicted person by preventing further use. On the other hand, the \"civil\" commitment provision deals with addicts who have lost the power of self-control, requiring hospitalization up to two years. Each deals with a different type of addict but with a common purpose. This is most apparent when the sections overlap: if after civil commitment of an addict it is found that hospital treatment will not be helpful, the addict is confined for a minimum period of three months in the same manner as is the volitional addict under the \"criminal\" provision.\n\nIn the instant case the proceedings against the petitioner were brought under the volitional-addict section. There was testimony that he had been using drugs only four months with three to four relatively mild doses a \n\n[370 \nU.S. 660, 682]\n\u00a0\n week. At arrest and trial he appeared normal. His testimony was clear and concise, being simply that he had never used drugs. The scabs and pocks on his arms and body were caused, he said, by \"overseas shots\" administered during army service preparatory to foreign assignment. He was very articulate in his testimony but the jury did not believe him, apparently because he had told the clinical expert while being examined after arrest that he had been using drugs, as I have stated above. The officer who arrested him also testified to like statements and to scabs - some 10 or 15 days old - showing narcotic injections. There was no evidence in the record of withdrawal symptoms. Obviously he could not have been committed under 5355 as one who had completely \"lost the power of self-control.\" The jury was instructed that narcotic \"addiction\" as used in 11721 meant strongly disposed to a taste or practice or habit of its use, indicated by the use of narcotics often or daily. A general verdict was returned against petitioner, and he was ordered confined for 90 days to be followed by a two-year parole during which he was required to take periodic Nalline tests.\n\nThe majority strikes down the conviction primarily on the grounds that petitioner was denied due process by the imposition of criminal penalties for nothing more than being in a status. This viewpoint is premised upon the theme that 11721 is a \"criminal\" provision authorizing a punishment, for the majority admits that \"a State might establish a program of compulsory treatment for those addicted to narcotics\" which \"might require periods of involuntary confinement.\" I submit that California has done exactly that. The majority's error is in instructing the California Legislature that hospitalization is the only treatment for narcotics addiction - that anything less is a punishment denying due process. California has found otherwise after a study which I suggest was more extensive than that conducted by the Court. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 660, 683]\n\u00a0\n Even in California's program for hospital commitment of nonvolitional narcotic addicts - which the majority approves - it is recognized that some addicts will not respond to or do not need hospital treatment. As to these persons its provisions are identical to those of 11721 - confinement for a period of not less than 90 days. Section 11721 provides this confinement as treatment for the volitional addicts to whom its provisions apply, in addition to parole with frequent tests to detect and prevent further use of drugs. The fact that 11721 might be labeled \"criminal\" seems irrelevant,\n*\n not only to the majority's own \"treatment\" test but to the \"concept of ordered liberty\" to which the States must attain under the Fourteenth Amendment. The test is the overall purpose and effect of a State's act, and I submit that California's program relative to narcotic addicts - including both the \"criminal\" and \"civil\" provisions - is inherently one of treatment and lies well within the power of a State.\n\nHowever, the case in support of the judgment below need not rest solely on this reading of California law. For even if the overall statutory scheme is ignored and a purpose and effect of punishment is attached to 11721, that provision still does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. The majority acknowledges, as it must, that a State can punish persons who purchase, possess or use narcotics. Although none of these acts are harmful to society in themselves, the State constitutionally may attempt to deter and prevent them through punishment because of the grave threat of future harmful conduct which they pose. Narcotics addiction - including the incipient, volitional addiction to which this provision speaks - is no different. California courts have taken judicial notice that \"the inordinate use of a narcotic drug tends \n\n[370 \nU.S. 660, 684]\n\u00a0\n to create an irresistible craving and forms a habit for its continued use until one becomes an addict, and he respects no convention or obligation and will lie, steal, or use any other base means to gratify his passion for the drug, being lost to all considerations of duty or social position.\" People v. Jaurequi, 142 Cal. App. 2d 555, 561, 298 P.2d 896, 900 (1956). Can this Court deny the legislative and judicial judgment of California that incipient, volitional narcotic addiction poses a threat of serious crime similar to the threat inherent in the purchase or possession of narcotics? And if such a threat is inherent in addiction, can this Court say that California is powerless to deter it by punishment?\n\nIt is no answer to suggest that we are dealing with an involuntary status and thus penal sanctions will be ineffective and unfair. The section at issue applies only to persons who use narcotics often or even daily but not to the point of losing self-control. When dealing with involuntary addicts California moves only through 5355 of its Welfare Institutions Code which clearly is not penal. Even if it could be argued that 11721 may not be limited to volitional addicts, the petitioner in the instant case undeniably retained the power of self-control and thus to him the statute would be constitutional. Moreover, \"status\" offenses have long been known and recognized in the criminal law. 4 Blackstone, Commentaries (Jones ed. 1916), 170. A ready example is drunkenness, which plainly is as involuntary after addiction to alcohol as is the taking of drugs.\n\nNor is the conjecture relevant that petitioner may have acquired his habit under lawful circumstances. There was no suggestion by him to this effect at trial, and surely the State need not rebut all possible lawful sources of addiction as part of its prima facie case.\n\nThe argument that the statute constitutes a cruel and unusual punishment is governed by the discussion above. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 660, 685]\n\u00a0\n Properly construed, the statute provides a treatment rather than a punishment. But even if interpreted as penal, the sanction of incarceration for 3 to 12 months is not unreasonable when applied to a person who has voluntarily placed himself in a condition posing a serious threat to the State. Under either theory, its provisions for 3 to 12 months' confinement can hardly be deemed unreasonable when compared to the provisions for 3 to 24 months' confinement under 5355 which the majority approves.\n\nI would affirm the judgment.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Any reliance upon the \"stigma\" of a misdemeanor conviction in this context is misplaced, as it would hardly be different from the stigma of a civil commitment for narcotics addiction.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITE, dissenting.\n\nIf appellant's conviction rested upon sheer status, condition or illness or if he was convicted for being an addict who had lost his power of self-control, I would have other thoughts about this case. But this record presents neither situation. And I believe the Court has departed from its wise rule of not deciding constitutional questions except where necessary and from its equally sound practice of construing state statutes, where possible, in a manner saving their constitutionality.\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 660, 686]\n\u00a0\n\n\nI am not at all ready to place the use of narcotics beyond the reach of the States' criminal laws. I do not consider appellant's conviction to be a punishment for having an illness or for simply being in some status or condition, but rather a conviction for the regular, repeated or habitual use of narcotics immediately prior to his arrest and in violation of the California law. As defined by the trial court,\n2\n addiction is the regular use of narcotics and can be proved only by evidence of such use. To find addiction in this case the jury had to believe that appellant had frequently used narcotics in the recent past.\n3\n California is entitled to have its statute and the record so read, particularly where the State's only purpose in allowing prosecutions for addiction was to supersede its own venue requirements applicable to prosecutions for the use of narcotics and in effect to allow convictions for use \n\n[370 \nU.S. 660, 687]\n\u00a0\n where there is no precise evidence of the county where the use took place.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nNor do I find any indications in this record that California would apply 11721 to the case of the helpless addict. I agree with my Brother CLARK that there was no evidence at all that appellant had lost the power to control his acts. There was no evidence of any use within 3 days prior to appellant's arrest. The most recent marks might have been 3 days old or they might have been 10 \n\n[370 \nU.S. 660, 688]\n\u00a0\n days old. The appellant admitted before trial that he had last used narcotics 8 days before his arrest. At the trial he denied having taken narcotics at all. The uncontroverted evidence was that appellant was not under the influence of narcotics at the time of his arrest nor did he have withdrawal symptoms. He was an incipient addict, a redeemable user, and the State chose to send him to jail for 90 days rather than to attempt to confine him by civil proceedings under another statute which requires a finding that the addict has lost the power of self-control. In my opinion, on this record, it was within the power of the State of California to confine him by criminal proceedings for the use of narcotics or for regular use amounting to habitual use.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nThe Court clearly does not rest its decision upon the narrow ground that the jury was not expressly instructed not to convict if it believed appellant's use of narcotics was beyond his control. The Court recognizes no degrees of addiction. The Fourteenth Amendment is today held to bar any prosecution for addiction regardless of the degree or frequency of use, and the Court's opinion bristles with indications of further consequences. If it is \"cruel and unusual punishment\" to convict appellant for addiction, it is difficult to understand why it would be any less offensive to the Fourteenth Amendment to convict him for use on the same evidence of use which proved he was an addict. It is significant that in purporting to reaffirm the power of the States to deal with the narcotics traffic, the Court does not include among the obvious powers of the State the power to punish for the use of narcotics. I cannot think that the omission was inadvertent. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 660, 689]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Court has not merely tidied up California's law by removing some irritating vestige of an outmoded approach to the control of narcotics. At the very least, it has effectively removed California's power to deal effectively with the recurring case under the statute where there is ample evidence of use but no evidence of the precise location of use. Beyond this it has cast serious doubt upon the power of any State to forbid the use of narcotics under threat of criminal punishment. I cannot believe that the Court would forbid the application of the criminal laws to the use of narcotics under any circumstances. But the States, as well as the Federal Government, are now on notice. They will have to await a final answer in another case.\n\nFinally, I deem this application of \"cruel and unusual punishment\" so novel that I suspect the Court was hard put to find a way to ascribe to the Framers of the Constitution the result reached today rather than to its own notions of ordered liberty. If this case involved economic regulation, the present Court's allergy to substantive due process would surely save the statute and prevent the Court from imposing its own philosophical predilections upon state legislatures or Congress. I fail to see why the Court deems it more appropriate to write into the Constitution its own abstract notions of how best to handle the narcotics problem, for it obviously cannot match either the States or Congress in expert understanding.\n\nI respectfully dissent.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] It has repeatedly been held in this Court that its practice will not be \"to decide any constitutional question in advance of the necessity for its decision . . . or . . . except with reference to the particular facts to which it is to be applied,\" Alabama State Federation v. McAdory, \n325 \nU.S. 450, 461\n, and that state statutes will always be construed, if possible, to save their constitutionally despite the plausibility of different but unconstitutional interpretation of the language. Thus, the Court recently reaffirmed the principle in Oil Workers Unions v. Missouri, \n361 \nU.S. 363, 370\n: \"When that claim is litigated it will be subject to review, but it is not for us now to anticipate its outcome. `\"Constitutional questions are not to be dealt with abstractly\". . . . They will not be anticipated but will be dealt with only as they are appropriately raised upon a record before us. . . . Nor will we assume in advance that a State will so \n\n[370 \nU.S. 660, 686]\n\u00a0\n construe its law as to bring it into conflict with the federal Constitution or an act of Congress.' Allen-Bradley Local v. Wisconsin Board, \n315 \nU.S. 740\n, at 746.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The court instructed the jury that, \"The word `addicted' means, strongly disposed to some taste or practice or habituated, especially to drugs. In order to inquire as to whether a person is addicted to the use of narcotics is in effect an inquiry as to his habit in that regard. . . . To use them often or daily is, according to the ordinary acceptance of those words, to use them habitually.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] This is not a case where a defendant is convicted \"even though he has never touched any narcotic drug within the State or been guilty of any irregular behavior there.\" The evidence was that appellant lived and worked in Los Angeles. He admitted before trial that he had used narcotics for three or four months, three or four times a week, usually at his place with his friends. He stated to the police that he had last used narcotics at 54th and Central in the City of Los Angeles on January 27, 8 days before his arrest. According to the State's expert, no needle mark or scab found on appellant's arms was newer than 3 days old and the most recent mark might have been as old as 10 days, which was consistent with appellant's own pretrial admissions. The State's evidence was that appellant had used narcotics at least 7 times in the 15 days immediately preceding his arrest.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The typical case under the narcotics statute, as the State made clear in its brief and argument, is the one where the defendant makes no admissions, as he did in this case, and the only evidence of use or addiction is presented by an expert who, on the basis of needle marks and scabs or other physical evidence revealed by the body of the defendant, testifies that the defendant has regularly taken narcotics in the recent past. See, e. g., People v. Williams, 164 Cal. App. 2d 858, 331 P.2d 251; People v. Garcia, 122 Cal. App. 2d 962, 266 P.2d 233; People v. Ackles, 147 Cal. App. 2d 40, 304 P.2d 1032. Under the local venue requirements, a conviction for simple use of narcotics may be had only in the county where the use took place, People v. Garcia, supra, and in the usual case evidence of the precise location of the use is lacking. Where the charge is addiction, venue under 11721 of the Health and Safety Code may be laid in any county where the defendant is found. People v. Ackles, supra, 147 Cal. App. 2d, at 42-43, 304 P.2d, at 1033, distinguishing People v. Thompson, 144 Cal. App. 2d 854, 301 P.2d 313. Under California law a defendant has no constitutional right to be tried in any particular county, but under statutory law, with certain exceptions, \"an accused person is answerable only in the jurisdiction where the crime, or some part or effect thereof, was committed or occurred.\" People v. Megladdery, 40 Cal. App. 2d 748, 762, 106 P.2d 84, 92. A charge of narcotics addiction is one of the exceptions and there are others. See, e. g., 781, 784, 785, 786, 788, Cal. Penal Code. Venue is to be determined from the evidence and is for the jury, but it need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. People v. Megladdery, supra, 40 Cal. App. 2d, at 764, 106 P.2d, at 93. See People v. Bastio, 55 Cal. App. 2d 615, 131 P.2d 614; People v. Garcia, supra. In reviewing convictions in narcotics cases, appellate courts view the evidence of venue \"in the light most favorable to the judgment.\" People v. Garcia, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Health and Safety Code 11391 expressly permits and contemplates the medical treatment of narcotics addicts confined to jail. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 660, 690]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","163":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRUDOLPH v. UNITED STATES(1962)\nNo. 396\nArgued: April 3, 1962Decided: June 18, 1962\n\n\n\n\n An insurance company paid the expenses of a group of its agents and their wives, including petitioners, to New York City to attend an annual convention, and the Commissioner assessed the value of the trip to petitioners as taxable income. In a suit for refund, the District Court found that the trip was provided by the company primarily for the purpose of affording a pleasure trip in the nature of a bonus, reward, and compensation for a job well done and that, from the point of view of petitioners, it was primarily a pleasure trip and that, therefore, the value of the trip was income and the costs were personal and nondeductible. The Court of Appeals approved these findings. Held: Since the ultimate facts are subject to the \"clearly erroneous\" rule and their review would be of no importance save to the litigants themselves, the writ of certiorari is dismissed as improvidently granted. Pp. 269-270.\n\n Reported below: 291 F.2d 841.\n\nRichard A. Freling argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the briefs was Felix Atwood.\n\nJohn B. Jones, Jr. argued the cause for the United States. With him on the briefs were Solicitor General Cox, Assistant Attorney General Oberdorfer, Wayne G. Barnett, I. Henry Kutz and Norman H. Wolfe.\n\nCharles W. Merritt filed a brief for the American Hotel Association, as amicus curiae, urging reversal.\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\nThe petition for certiorari in this case was granted because it was thought to present important questions involving the definition of \"income\" and \"ordinary and necessary\" business expenses under the Internal Revenue Code. \n368 \nU.S. 913\n. An insurance company provided \n\n[370 \nU.S. 269, 270]\n\u00a0\n a trip from its home office in Dallas, Texas, to New York City for a group of its agents and their wives. Rudolph and his wife were among the beneficiaries of this trip, and the Commissioner assessed its value to them as taxable income.\n*\n It appears to be agreed between the parties that the tax consequences of the trip turn upon the Rudolphs' \"dominant motive and purpose\" in taking the trip and the company's in offering it. In this regard the District Court, on a suit for a refund, found that the trip was provided by the company for \"the primary purpose of affording a pleasure trip . . . in the nature of a bonus, reward, and compensation for a job well done\" and that from the point of view of the Rudolphs it \"was primarily a pleasure trip in the nature of a vacation . . . .\" 189 F. Supp. 2, 4-5. The Court of Appeals approved these findings. 291 F.2d 841. Such ultimate facts are subject to the \"clearly erroneous\" rule, cf. Commissioner v. Duberstein, \n363 \nU.S. 278, 289\n-291 (1960), and their review would be of no importance save to the litigants themselves. The appropriate disposition in such a situation is to dismiss the writ as improvidently granted. See Rice v. Sioux City Memorial Park Cemetery, \n349 \nU.S. 70, 78\n n. 2 (1955).\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the decision of this case.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] A joint return had been filed.\n\nSeparate opinion of MR. JUSTICE HARLAN.\n\nAlthough the reasons given by the Court for dismissing the writ as improvidently granted should have been persuasive against granting certiorari, now that the case is here I think it better to decide it, two members of the Court having dissented on the merits. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 269, 271]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe courts below concluded (1) that the value of this \"all expense\" trip to the company-sponsored insurance convention constituted \"gross income\" to the petitioners within the meaning of 61 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, and (2) that the amount reflected was not deductible as an \"ordinary and necessary\" business expense under 162 of the Code.\n1\n Both conclusions are, in my opinion, unassailable unless the findings of fact on which they rested are to be impeached by us as clearly erroneous. I do not think they can be on this record, especially in light of the \"seasoned and wise rule of this Court\" which \"makes concurrent findings of two courts below final here in the absence of very exceptional showing of error.\" Comstock v. Group of Institutional Investors, \n335 \nU.S. 211, 214\n.\n\nThe basic facts, found by the District Court, are as follows. Petitioners, husband and wife, reside in Dallas, Texas, where the home office of the husband's employer, the Southland Life Insurance Company, is located. By having sold a predetermined amount of insurance, the husband qualified to attend the company's convention in New York City in 1956 and, in line with company policy, to bring his wife with him. The petitioners, together with 150 other employees and officers of the insurance company and 141 wives, traveled to and from New York City on special trains, and were housed in a single hotel during their two-and-one-half-day visit. One morning was devoted to a \"business meeting\" and group luncheon, the rest of the time in New York City to \"travel, sight-seeing, entertainment, fellowship or free time.\" The entire trip lasted one week. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 269, 272]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe company paid all the expenses of the convention-trip which amounted to $80,000; petitioners' allocable share being $560. When petitioners did not include the latter amount in their joint income tax return, the Commissioner assessed a deficiency which was sustained by the District Court, 189 F. Supp. 2, and also by the Court of Appeals, one judge dissenting, in a per curiam opinion, 291 F.2d 841, citing its recent decision in Patterson v. Thomas, 289 F.2d 108, where the same result had been reached. The District Court held that the value of the trip being \"in the nature of a bonus, reward, and compensation for a job well done,\" was income to Rudolph, but being \"primarily a pleasure trip in the nature of a vacation,\" the costs were personal and nondeductible.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nUnder 61 of the 1954 Code was the value of the trip to the taxpayer-husband properly includible in gross income? That section defines gross income as \"all income from whatever source derived,\" including, among other items, \"compensation for services.\" Certain sections of the 1954 Code enumerate particular receipts which are included in the concept of \"gross income,\"\n2\n including prizes and awards (with certain exceptions);\n3\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 269, 273]\n\u00a0\n while other sections, 101-121, specifically exclude certain receipts from \"gross income,\" including, for example, gifts and inheritances\n4\n (see Commissioner v. Duberstein, \n363 \nU.S. 278\n), and meals or lodgings furnished for the convenience of the employer.\n5\n The Treasury Regulations emphasize the inclusiveness of the concept of \"gross income.\"\n6\n\u00a0\n\nIn light of the sweeping scope of 61 taxing \"all gains except those specifically exempted,\" Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co., \n348 \nU.S. 426, 430\n; see Commissioner v. LoBue, \n351 \nU.S. 243, 246\n; James v. United States, \n366 \nU.S. 213, 219\n, and its purpose to include as taxable income \"any economic or financial benefit conferred on the employee as compensation, whatever the form or mode by which it is effected,\" Commissioner v. Smith, \n324 \nU.S. 177, 181\n, it seems clear that the District Court's findings, if sustainable, bring the value of the trip within the reach of the statute.\n\nPetitioners do not claim that the value of the trip is within one of the statutory exclusions from \"gross income\" (see notes 4 and 5, supra) as did the taxpayer in Patterson v. Thomas, 289 F.2d 108, 111-112; rather they characterize the amount as a \"fringe benefit\" not specifically \n\n[370 \nU.S. 269, 274]\n\u00a0\n excluded from 61 by other sections of the statute, yet not intended to be encompassed by its reach. Conceding that the statutory exclusions from \"gross income\" are not exhaustive, as the Government seems to recognize is so under Glenshaw, it is not now necessary to explore the extent of any such nonstatutory exclusions.\n7\n For it was surely within the Commissioner's competence to consider as \"gross income\" a \"reward, or a bonus given to . . . employees for excellence in service,\" which the District Court found was the employer's primary purpose in arranging this trip. I cannot say that this finding, confirmed as it has been by the Court of Appeals, is inadequately supported by this record.\n8\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 269, 275]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nThere remains the question whether, though income, this outlay for transportation, meals, and lodging was deductible by petitioners as an \"ordinary and necessary\" business expense under 162.\n9\n The relevant factors on this branch of the case are found in Treas. Reg. 1.162-2.\n10\n In summary, the regulation in pertinent part provides:\n\n Traveling expenses, including meals, lodgings and other incidentals, reasonable and necessary in the conduct of the taxpayer's business and directly attributable to it are deductible, but expenses of a trip \n\n[370 \nU.S. 269, 276]\n\u00a0\n \"undertaken for other than business purposes\" are \"personal expenses\" and the meals and lodgings are \"living expenses.\" Treas. Reg. 1.162-2 (a).\n\n\n If a taxpayer who travels to a destination engages in both \"business and personal activities,\" the traveling expenses are deductible only if the trip is \"related primarily\" to the taxpayer's business; if \"primarily personal,\" the traveling expenses are not deductible even though the taxpayer engages in some business there; yet expenses allocable to the taxpayer's trade or business there are deductible even though the travel expenses to and fro are not.\n11\n Id.,  1.162-2 (b) (1).\n\n\n Whether a trip is related primarily to the taxpayer's business or is primarily personal in nature \"depends on the facts and circumstances in each case.\" Id., 1.162-2 (b) (2); so too with expenses paid or incurred in attending a convention. Id.,  1.162-2 (d).\n\n\n Finally, the deductibility of the expenses of a taxpayer's wife who accompanies her husband depends, first, on whether his trip is a \"business trip.\" Id.,  1.162-2 (c); if so, it must further be shown that the wife's presence on the trip also had a bona fide business purpose. Ibid.\n\n\n Where, as here, it may be arguable that the trip was both for business and personal reasons, the crucial question is whether, under all the facts and circumstances of the case, the purpose of the trip was \"related primarily to business\" or was, rather, \"primarily personal in nature.\" \n\n[370 \nU.S. 269, 277]\n\u00a0\n That other trips to other conventions or meetings by other taxpayers were held to be primarily related to business is of no relevance here; that certain doctors, lawyers, clergymen, insurance agents or others\n12\n have or have not been permitted similar deductions only shows that in the circumstances of those cases, the courts thought that the expenses were or were not deductible as \"related primarily to business.\"\n\nThe husband places great emphasis on the fact that he is an entrapped \"organization man,\" required to attend such conventions, and that his future promotions depend on his presence. Suffice it to say that the District Court did not find any element of compulsion; to the contrary, it found that the petitioners regarded the convention in New York City as a pleasure trip in the nature of a vacation. Again, I cannot say that these findings are without adequate evidentiary support. Supra, pp. 273-274.\n\nThe trip not having been primarily a business trip, the wife's expenses are not deductible. It is not necessary, therefore, to examine whether they would or would not be deductible if, to the contrary, the husband's trip was related primarily to business.\n\nWhere, as here, two courts below have resolved the determinative factual issues against the taxpayers, according to the rules of law set forth in the statute and regulations, \n\n[370 \nU.S. 269, 278]\n\u00a0\n it is not for this Court to re-examine the evidence, and disturb their findings, unless \"clearly erroneous.\" That is not the situation here.\n\nI would affirm.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] As I see this case, there is no need to explore whether the proper reporting procedure for a deductible expense is not to include it in income in the first place, cf. Treas. Reg. 1.162-17 (b), or to \"run it through\" the taxpayer's income with an offsetting deduction in the same amount.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] E. g., 71 (Alimony and separate maintenance payments), 72 (Annuities; certain proceeds of endowment and life insurance contracts), 73 (Services of child).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 74: \"(a) GENERAL RULE. - Except as provided in subsection (b) and in section 117 (relating to scholarships and fellowship grants), gross income includes amounts received as prizes and awards.\n\n\"(b) EXCEPTION. - Gross income does not include amounts received as prizes and awards made primarily in recognition of religious, charitable, scientific, educational, artistic, literary, or civic achievement, but only if -\n\n\n\"(1) the recipient was selected without any action on his part to enter the contest or proceeding; and\n\n\n\"(2) the recipient is not required to render substantial future services as a condition to receiving the prize or award.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] 102.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] 119. Some of the other exclusions are 101 (Certain death payments), 103 (Interest on certain governmental obligations), 104 (Compensation for injuries or sickness), 105 (Amounts received under accident and health plans), 113 (Mustering-out payments for members of the Armed Forces), 117 (Scholarship and fellowship grants).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Treas. Reg. 1.61-1 (a) provides:\n\n\"Gross income means all income from whatever source derived, unless excluded by law. Gross income includes income realized in any form, whether in money, property, or services. Income may be realized, therefore, in the form of services, meals, accommodations, stock, or other property, as well as in cash.\" See also Treas. Reg. 1.61-2 (a) (1), (d) and 1.74-1 (a).\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Petitioners rely on 3401 of the 1954 Code, relating to withholding taxes, and more especially on Treas. Reg. 31.3401 (a)-1 (b) (10) providing that certain fringe benefits are not considered \"wages\" subject to withholding. The Government admits that not all \"fringe benefits\" have been taxed as income, but it is enough to point out here that the withholding tax analogy is not perfect, for payments to laid-off employees from company-financed supplemental unemployment benefit plans are \"taxable income\" to the employees although not \"wages\" subject to withholding. Rev. Rul. 56-249, 1956-1 Cum. Bull. 488, as amplified by Rev. Rul. 60-330, 1960-2 Cum. Bull. 46.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] The District Court said (189 F. Supp., at 4-5):\n\n\"All of the evidence considered, we think it irrefutably leads to this conclusion: That the insurance company was just doing a gracious magnanimous thing of awarding those leading agents a trip just as much as if it had awarded them an automobile, or suit of clothes . . . .\n\n.  .  .  .   .\n\n\n\n\". . . [W]e conclude, that the trip was earned by . . . Rudolph, and was in the nature of a bonus, reward, and compensation for a job well done.\"\n\n\n It is pertinent to note that in addition to the facts referred to on p. 271, supra, the record shows that company-sponsored conventions of the same kind have in recent years been held in Canada, Mexico City, Havana, Colorado and California, places well known for their appeal to tourists, and far removed from the home office in Dallas. While this factor alone does not render the expenses nondeductible, see I. R. S. News Rel. No. IR-394, August 3, 1961, it certainly was a relevant circumstance for the District Court to consider.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] \"(a) IN GENERAL. - There shall be allowed as a deduction all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business, including -\n\n .   .  .  .  .\n\n\n\"(2) traveling expenses (including the entire amount expended for meals and lodging) while away from home in the pursuit of a trade or business . . . .\"\n\n\n No question is raised in this case as to whether the $80,000 paid by the company for the total convention expense is deductible by the corporation.\n\nThere is no need to explore the lack of symmetry in certain \"income\" and \"deductibility\" areas in the 1954 Code permitting employers to provide certain \"fringe benefits\" to employees - such as parking facilities, swimming pools, medical services - which have not generally been considered income to the employee, but which, if paid for by the employee with his own funds, would not be a deductible expense. The practicalities of a tax system do not demand hypothetical or theoretical perfection, and these workaday problems are properly the concern of the Commissioner, not of the Courts.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Although this Regulation is part of those promulgated on April 3, 1958, it is applicable to this 1956 transaction. The power to make the Regulations prospective only, Int. Rev. Code of 1954, 7805 (b), was not exercised, and they were made applicable to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1953. T. D. 6291, 1958-1 Cum. Bull. 63. Moreover, the result here would not be different under the prior comparable Regulation. Treas. Reg. 118, 39.23 (a)-2 (a).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] No claim has been made by the husband in this case that specific business expenses which may have been incurred at the convention in New York are deductible. The only issue is the deductibility of the entire trip expense. Compare Patterson v. Thomas, 289 F.2d 108, 114 and n. 13.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] Deductions allowed: Coffey v. Commissioner, 21 B. T.

M. 334 (railroad fireman).\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK joins, dissenting.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nIt could not, I think, be seriously contended that a professional man, say a Senator or a Congressman, who attends a convention to read a paper or conduct a seminar with all expenses paid has received \"income\" within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code. Nor would it matter, I assume, that he took his wife and that her expenses were also paid. Income has the connotation of something other than the mere payment of expenses. The statute, 26 U.S.C. 61, speaks in terms of financial gain, of compensation for services, \"including fees, commissions, and similar items.\" The form of payment for services covers a wide range. Treasury Regulations 1.61-1 provide:\n\n \"Gross income includes income realized in any form, whether in money, property, or services. Income may be realized, therefore, in the form of services, meals, accommodations, stock, or other property, as well as in cash.\"\n\n\n The formula \"all expenses paid\" might be the disguise whereby compensation \"for services\" is paid. Yet it would be a rare case indeed where one could conclude that a person who gets only his expenses for attendance at one convention gets \"income\" in the statutory sense. If this arrangement were regular and frequent or if it had the earmarks of a sham device as a cloak for remuneration, there would be room for fact-finders to conclude that \n\n[370 \nU.S. 269, 279]\n\u00a0\n it was evasive. But isolated engagements of the kind here in question have no rational connection with compensation \"for services\" rendered.\n\nIt is true that petitioner was an employee and that the expenses for attending the convention were paid by his employer. He qualified to attend the convention by selling an amount of insurance that met a quota set by the company. Other salesmen also qualified, some attending and some not attending. They went from Dallas, Texas, to New York City, where they stayed two and a half days. One day was given to a business session and a luncheon; the rest of the time was left for social events.\n\nOn this record there is no room for a finding of fact that the \"expenses paid\" were \"for services\" rendered. They were apparently a proper income tax deduction for the employer. The record is replete with evidence that from management's point of view it was good business to spend money on a convention for its leading agents - a convention that not only kept the group together in New York City, but in transit as well, giving ample time for group discussions, exchanges of experience, and educational training. It was the exigencies of the employment that gave rise to the convention. There was nothing dishonest, illegitimate, or unethical about this transaction. No services were rendered. New York City may or may not have been attractive to the agents and their wives. Whether a person enjoys or dislikes the trip that he makes \"with all expenses paid\" has no more to do with whether the expenses paid were compensation \"for services\" rendered than does his attitude toward his job.\n\nIn popular understanding a trip to a convention \"with all expenses paid\" may be an award. Yet the tax laws are filled with exemptions for \"awards\" which are not considered to be income. The exemption of gifts is one example. Others are the exemptions of the proceeds \n\n[370 \nU.S. 269, 280]\n\u00a0\n of life insurance payable at death, disability benefits, the rental values of parsonages, scholarship and fellowship grants, allowances of U.S. employees abroad, mustering-out payments to members of the Armed Forces, etc. Employees may receive from their employers many fringe benefits that are not income. Treasury Regulations 31.3401 (a)-1 (b) (10) provide:\n\n \"Ordinarily, facilities or privileges (such as entertainment, medical services, or so-called `courtesy' discounts on purchases), furnished or offered by an employer to his employees generally, are not considered as wages subject to withholding if such facilities or privileges are of relatively small value and are offered or furnished by the employer merely as a means of promoting the health, good will, contentment, or efficiency of his employees.\"\n\n\n The fringe benefits of this one convention trip are less obviously income than the fringe benefits listed in the Regulations. For the latter are constantly recurring - day after day, week after week. Moreover, on this record the convention promotes the \"efficiency\" of the agents as much as the other fringe benefits enumerated in the Regulations.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nThe expenses, if \"income,\" are plainly deductible. The Government, however, says that our problem is to determine \"whether it is consistent with the ends of an equitable and workable tax system\" to make them such. The problem of designing an \"equitable\" tax system is, however, for Congress, not for the Court.\n\nThe test of deductibility to be applied here is whether the expenses are \"ordinary and necessary\" in the carrying on of petitioner's business. The Act is explicit in permitting the deduction of traveling expenses (including the \n\n[370 \nU.S. 269, 281]\n\u00a0\n entire amount expended for meals and lodging) while away from home in the \"pursuit of a trade or business,\" 26 U.S.C. 162 (a) (2).\n\nThe Regulations are even more explicit. Section 1.162-2 (b) (1) provides:\n\n \"If a taxpayer travels to a destination and while at such destination engages in both business and personal activities, traveling expenses to and from such destination are deductible only if the trip is related primarily to the taxpayer's trade or business. If the trip is primarily personal in nature, the traveling expenses to and from the destination are not deductible even though the taxpayer engages in business activities while at such destination.\" (Italics added.)\n\n\n Thus, by the very terms of the Regulations a taxpayer who combines business and pleasure may deduct all \"traveling expenses,\" provided the business purpose is dominant.\n\nSection 1.162-2 (b) (2) of the Regulations states:\n\n \"Whether a trip is related primarily to the taxpayer's trade or business or is primarily personal in nature depends on the facts and circumstances in each case. The amount of time during the period of the trip which is spent on personal activity compared to the amount of time spent on activities directly relating to the taxpayer's trade or business is an important factor in determining whether the trip is primarily personal. If, for example, a taxpayer spends one week while at a destination on activities which are directly related to his trade or business and subsequently spends an additional five weeks for vacation or other personal activities, the trip will be considered primarily personal in nature in the absence of a clear showing to the contrary.\" \n\n[370 \nU.S. 269, 282]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Where, as here, at least one-half of the time is spent on mundane \"business\" activities,\n1\n the case is nowhere near the colorable transaction described in 1.162-2 (b) (2).\n\nI see no reason to take this case out of the main stream of precedents and establish a special rule for insurance conventions. Judge Brown, dissenting in the Court of Appeals, shows how discriminatory this decision is:\n\n\"Deductions have been allowed as `ordinary and necessary' to clergymen attending a church convention; to expenses of an employee attending conventions of a related business group; to a lawyer attending a meeting of the American Bar Association; to a legal secretary attending the national convention of the National Association; to physicians attending medical conventions; to certified public accountants attending conventions; to university teachers in attending conventions or scientific meetings; to professional cartoonists attending political conventions; to persons attending the Red Cross Convention; to school teachers attending summer school; to attorneys attending an institute on Federal taxation; to employees sent to refresher courses to become more acquainted with new processes in the industry; to a furniture store sending its buyers to the annual furniture mart; to representatives to annual conventions of trade associations; and to an insurance agent away from home on business.\" 291 F.2d 841, 844-845.\n\n\n Insurance conventions go back at least to 1924 (Report No. 15, Life Insurance Sales Research Bureau, Nov. 1924) and are premised on the idea that agents and companies \n\n[370 \nU.S. 269, 283]\n\u00a0\n benefit from the knowledge and increase in morale which result from them.\n2\n Why they should be treated differently from other conventions is a mystery. It cannot be, as the district judge thought and as the Government seems to argue, because going to New York City is, as a matter of law, a \"pleasure trip.\" If we are in the field of judicial notice, I would think that some might conclude that the weekend in New York City was a chore and that those who went sacrificed valuable time that might better have \n\n[370 \nU.S. 269, 284]\n\u00a0\n been spent on the farm, in the woods, or along the seashore.\n\nMoreover, federal revenue agents attending their convention are given a deduction for the expenses they incur. We are advised that\n\n \". . . the Commissioner has recently withdrawn his objections in two Tax Court cases to the deduction of convention expenses incurred by two IRS employees in attending conventions of the National Association of Internal Revenue Employees.\n\n\n \"No explanation has been given publicly for the Tax Court action of the Commissioner, it being generally presumed that the IRS employees met the tests of Reg. 1.162-2 (d) by showing a sufficient relationship between the trade or business of being an IRS employee and attendance at conventions of the NAIRE. The National Association of Internal Revenue Employees has hailed the Commissioner's actions as setting a precedent which can be cited by IRS employees when taking deductions for expenses incurred in attending NAIRE conventions.\" CCH Standard Federal Tax Reports No. 23, April 19, 1961, pt. 1, p. 2.\n\n\n It is odd, indeed, that revenue agents need make no accounting of the movies they saw or the nightclubs they attended, in order to get the deduction, while insurance agents must.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nThe wife's expenses\n3\n are, on this record, also deductible. The Treasury Regulations state in 1.162-2 (c):\n\n \"Where a taxpayer's wife accompanies him on a business trip, expenses attributable to her travel are \n\n[370 \nU.S. 269, 285]\n\u00a0\n not deductible unless it can be adequately shown that the wife's presence on the trip has a bona fide business purpose. The wife's performance of some incidental service does not cause her expenses to qualify as deductible business expenses. The same rules apply to any other members of the taxpayer's family who accompany him on such a trip.\"\n\n\n The civil law philosophy, expressed in the community property concept, attributes half of the husband's earnings to the wife - an equitable idea that at long last was reflected in the idea of income splitting under the federal income tax law.\n4\n The wife's contribution to the business productivity of the husband in at least some activities is well known. It was specially recognized in the insurance field long before the issue of deductibility of her expenses arose under the federal income tax.\n5\n Business reasons \n\n[370 \nU.S. 269, 286]\n\u00a0\n motivated the inclusion of wives in this particular insurance convention. An insurance executive testified at this trial:\n\n \"Q. I hand you Plaintiff's Exhibit 15, and you will notice it is a letter addressed to `John Doe'; also a bulletin entitled `A New Partner Has Been Formed.'\n\n\n \"Will you tell us what that consists of?\n\n\n \"A. This is a letter addressed to the wife of an agent, a new agent, as we make the contract with him. This letter is sent to his wife within a few days after the contract, enclosing this booklet explaining to her how she can help her husband in the life insurance business.\n\n\n  .   .   .  .  .\n\n\n \"Q. Please tell us, as briefly as you can and yet in detail, how you as agency director for Southland attempt to integrate the wives' performance with the performance of agents in the life insurance business.\n\n\n \"A. One of the important functions we have in mind is the attendance at these conventions. In addition to that communication, occasionally there are letters that will be written to the wife concerning any special sales effort that might be desired or promoted. The company has a monthly publication for the agents and employees that is mailed to their homes so the wife will have a convenient opportunity to see the magazine and read it.\n\n\n \"At most of our convention program[s], we have some specific reference to the wife's work, and in quite a few of the convention programs we have had wives appear on the program.\n\n\n \"Q. Suppose you didn't have the wives and didn't seek to require their attendance at a convention, would there be some danger that your meetings \n\n[370 \nU.S. 269, 287]\n\u00a0\n and conventions would kind of degenerate into stag affairs, where the whole purpose of the meeting would be lost?\n\n\n \"A. I think that would definitely be a tendency.\"\n\n\n I would reverse the judgments below and leave insurance conventions in the same category as conventions of revenue agents, lawyers, doctors, business men, accountants, nurses, clergymen and all others, until and unless Congress decides otherwise.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The travel to and from the convention was in a group, so arranged as to develop solidarity among the agents, and to provide a continuing seminar.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] \"One of the chief things to be accomplished by a convention is to secure unanimous understanding of the principle underlying the company's sales operations and the rules which experience has proved to be essential in carrying out those principles. There is no sales organization anywhere which has a complete and unanimous grasp of these matters but a convention can do more to give the men that grasp than anything else. Home Offices are constantly under the necessity of formulating principles and rules, and they are similarly in a constant state of disappointment because they are not understood. The convention is the place above all others where this can be accomplished.\n\n.  .  .  .  .\n\n\n\"The extent to which the Home Office arranges for transportation depends largely upon the situation of the convention city. If it is centrally located with many lines of approach, it would be impracticable to arrange for many men to meet on their way to the convention. But if the convention is to be held in an isolated spot, or one at considerable distance from the home of the majority of the members attending, then specific plans may be made for assembling at some nearer location and proceeding together to the destination. If this latter is at all feasible, it is desirable for several reasons. It gives the men a peculiar feeling of satisfaction to travel on a `special' train or on `special' cars, it encourages a friendlier feeling than is generally present at conventions at which the men arrive as strangers, it makes the men more anxious to get down to the real work of the convention when they arrive at their destination, and, above all, it has a decided educational value in its contacts and ever present business discussions.\" Report No. 15, Life Insurance Sales Research Bureau, Nov. 1924, pp. 13, 17-18.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] For reasons not germane to the problems of the federal income tax, the New York Superintendent of Insurance has ruled that the payment of a wife's expenses in attending an insurance convention is not permissible.

In fact, it has been said that a wife can not usually be so wholly lacking in contact with her husband's work as to have no influence at all upon it.\n\n\"In many cases, this influence is negative rather than positive, and this is particularly true in the careers of many life insurance agents because their work frequently involves evening appointments - a condition usually resented by a wife. Many a wife has thoroughly discouraged her husband because the only thing which she ever knew about his work was that he had to go out at night or that he had failed to `write that ten' which would give her a new dress. She knew nothing about the bigger things which life insurance accomplishes and of which her husband was or could be a part. The recognition of the very great desirability of `selling' the wife on her husband's job has spread rapidly in recent years, and today many husbands are helped over the rough spots of their career by the enthusiasm and vision of their wives, much of which can be aroused or increased at a convention.\" Report No. 15, supra note 2, pp. 25-26. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 269, 288]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","164":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRUSK v.

His original passport having expired, he applied to the United States Embassy in Prague, Czechoslovakia, for a new one. This was denied on the ground that he had lost his citizenship under 349 (a) (10) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 by remaining outside the United States for the purpose of avoiding military service. He sued in a Federal District Court for declaratory and injunctive relief against appellant, the Secretary of State, alleging that he had not remained abroad to evade military service and that 349 (a) (10) was unconstitutional. A three-judge District Court convened to try the case denied a motion to dismiss which was based on the claim that 360 (b) and (c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 provide the exclusive procedure under which appellee could attack the administrative determination that he was not a citizen. It also held that 349 (a) (10) was unconstitutional and awarded appellee a judgment declaring him to be a citizen and enjoining appellant from denying him a passport on the ground that he was not a citizen. Appellant appealed directly to this Court. Held:\n\n 1. Since the District Court held 349 (a) (10) unconstitutional, this appeal is properly before this Court under 28 U.S.C. 1252. P. 370, n. 4.\n\n\n 2. A person outside the United States who has been denied a right of citizenship is not confined to the procedures prescribed by 360 (b) and (c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, and the remedy pursued in the present case under the Administrative Procedure Act and the Declaratory Judgment Act was an appropriate one. Pp. 370-380.\n\n\n 3. With respect to the other issues presented by this appeal, the case is set for reargument during the October Term, 1962. P. 380.\n\n\n Reported below: 187 F. Supp. 683. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 367, 368]\n\u00a0\n\n\nOscar H. Davis argued the cause for appellant. With him on the briefs were Solicitor General Cox, Assistant Attorney General Miller, Beatrice Rosenberg and Jerome M. Feit.\n\nLeonard B. Boudin argued the cause for appellee. With him on the brief was Victor Rabinowitz.\n\nBriefs of amici curiae, urging affirmance, were filed by Jack Wasserman, David Carliner, Rowland Watts and Lawrence Speiser for the American Civil Liberties Union, and by Milton V. Freeman, Robert E. Herzstein, Horst Kurnik and Charles A. Reich for Angelika Schneider.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nSection 349 (a) (10) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 provides:\n\n \"From and after the effective date of this Act a person who is a national of the United States whether by birth or naturalization, shall lose his nationality by -\n\n\n  .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"(10) departing from or remaining outside of the jurisdiction of the United States in time of war or during a period declared by the President to be a period of national emergency for the purpose of evading or avoiding training and service in the military, air, or naval forces of the United States. For the purposes of this paragraph failure to comply with any provision of any compulsory service laws of the United States shall raise the presumption that the departure from or absence from the United States was for the purpose of evading or avoiding training and service in the military, air, or naval forces of the United States.\"\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 367, 369]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The appellee, Joseph Cort, is a physician and research physiologist. He was born in Massachusetts in 1927. In May of 1951 he registered with his Selective Service Board under the so-called \"Doctors' Draft Act.\"\n2\n A few days later he left the United States for Cambridge, England. In 1953, while still in England, he was repeatedly notified by his draft board to report for a physical examination either in the United States or at an examining facility in Europe. He disregarded these communications, and in September of 1953 his draft board ordered him to report to Brookline, Massachusetts, for induction into the Armed Forces. He failed to report as directed and remained in England. In 1954 an indictment charging him with draft evasion was returned in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Earlier that year, after the British Home Office had refused to renew his residence permit, Cort had gone to Prague, Czechoslovakia. He has been there ever since.\n\nIn 1959 Cort applied to our Embassy in Prague for a United States passport, his original passport having long since expired. His application was denied by the Passport Office of the Department of State on the ground that he had lost his citizenship under 349 (a) (10) of the 1952 Act by remaining outside the United States for the purpose of avoiding military service. Subsequently, the State Department's Board of Review on Loss of Nationality affirmed the decision of the Passport Office, on the same ground.\n\nCort then instituted the present action against the Secretary of State in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. His complaint alleged that he had not remained abroad to evade his military obligations, and \n\n[369 \nU.S. 367, 370]\n\u00a0\n that 349 (a) (10) was in any event unconstitutional. A three-judge court was convened. The Secretary of State moved to dismiss the action upon the ground that 360 (b) and (c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 provide the exclusive procedure under which Cort could attack the administrative determination that he was not a citizen. The District Court rejected this contention, holding that it had jurisdiction of the action for a declaratory judgment and an injunction. On motions for summary judgment, the court determined that the appellee had remained abroad to avoid service in the Armed Forces. Relying upon Trop v. Dulles,\n3\n the court held, however, that 349 (a) (10) was unconstitutional, and that consequently the appellee's citizenship had not been divested. The court accordingly entered a judgment declaring the appellee to be a citizen of the United States and enjoining the Secretary of State from denying him a passport on the ground that he is not a citizen. Cort v. Herter, 187 F. Supp. 683. This is a direct appeal from that judgment.\n\nThe only question we decide today is whether the District Court was correct in holding that it had jurisdiction to entertain this action for declaratory and injunctive relief. If not, we must vacate the judgment and direct the District Court to dismiss the complaint.\n4\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 367, 371]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn support of its jurisdiction the District Court relied upon the Declaratory Judgment Act and the Administrative Procedure Act. 187 F. Supp., at 685. The Declaratory Judgment Act, 48 Stat. 955, as amended, 28 U.S.C. 2201, provides:\n\n \"In a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction, except with respect to Federal taxes, any court of the United States, upon the filing of an appropriate pleading, may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought. Any such declaration shall have the force and effect of a final judgment or decree and shall be reviewable as such.\"\n\n\n Section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act provides:\n\n \"Except so far as (1) statutes preclude judicial review or (2) agency action is by law committed to agency discretion -\n\n\n \"(a) RIGHT OF REVIEW. - Any person suffering legal wrong because of any agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by such action within the meaning of any relevant statute, shall be entitled to judicial review thereof.\n\n\n \"(b) FORM AND VENUE OF ACTION. - The form of proceeding for judicial review shall be any special statutory review proceeding relevant to the subject matter in any court specified by statute or, in the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 367, 372]\n\u00a0\n absence or inadequacy thereof, any applicable form of legal action (including actions for declaratory judgments or writs of prohibitory or mandatory injunction or habeas corpus) in any court of competent jurisdiction. Agency action shall be subject to judicial review in civil or criminal proceedings for judicial enforcement except to the extent that prior, adequate, and exclusive opportunity for such review is provided by law.\" 60 Stat. 243, 5 U.S.C. 1009.\n\n\n Section 12 of the Administrative Procedure Act provides in part:\n\n\"No subsequent legislation shall be held to supersede or modify the provisions of this Act except to the extent that such legislation shall do so expressly.\" 60 Stat. 244, 5 U.S.C. 1011.\n\n\n On their face the provisions of these statutes appear clearly to permit an action such as was brought here to review the final administrative determination of the Secretary of State. This view is confirmed by our decisions establishing that an action for a declaratory judgment is available as a remedy to secure a determination of citizenship - decisions rendered both before and after the enactment of the Administrative Procedure Act. Perkins v. Elg, \n307 \nU.S. 325\n; McGrath v. Kristensen, \n340 \nU.S. 162\n. Moreover, the fact that the plaintiff is not within the United States has never been thought to bar an action for a declaratory judgment of this nature. Stewart v. Dulles, 101 U.S. App. D.C. 280, 248 F.2d 602; Bauer v. Acheson, 106 F. Supp. 445; see Flemming v. Nestor, \n363 \nU.S. 603\n.\n\nIt is the appellant's position, however, that despite these broad provisions of the Declaratory Judgment Act and the Administrative Procedure Act, Cort could not litigate his claim to citizenship in an action such as the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 367, 373]\n\u00a0\n one he brought in the District Court, but is confined instead to the procedures set out in subsections (b) and (c) of 360 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. Section 360 establishes procedures for determining claims to American citizenship by those within and without the country. Subsection (a) covers claimants \"within the United States\" and authorizes an action for a declaratory judgment against the head of the agency denying the claimant a right or privilege of citizenship - except that such an action cannot be instituted if the issue of citizenship arises in connection with an exclusion proceeding.\n5\n Subsections (b) and (c) deal with citizenship claimants \"not within the United States.\" The former provides, with limitations, for the issuance abroad of certificates of identity \"for the purpose of traveling to a port of entry in the United States and applying for admission.\" The latter subsection declares that a person issued such a certificate \"may apply for admission to the United States at any port of entry, and shall be subject \n\n[369 \nU.S. 367, 374]\n\u00a0\n to all the provisions of this Act relating to the conduct of proceedings involving aliens seeking admission to the United States.\" Judicial review of those proceedings is to be by habeas corpus and not otherwise.\n6\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 367, 375]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThus, the question posed is whether the procedures specified in 360 (b) and (c) provide the only method of reviewing the Secretary of State's determination that Cort has forfeited his citizenship. More precisely stated, the question in this case is whether, despite the liberal provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, Congress intended that a native of this country living abroad must travel thousands of miles, be arrested, and go to jail in order to attack an administrative finding that he is not a citizen of the United States. We find nothing in the statutory language, in the legislative history, or in our prior decisions which leads us to believe that Congress had any such purpose.\n\nThe Administrative Procedure Act confers the right to judicial review of \"any agency action.\" The procedures of 360 (b) and (c) would culminate in litigation not against the Secretary of State whose determination is here being attacked, but against the Attorney General. Whether such litigation could properly be considered review of the Secretary of State's determination presents a not insubstantial question. Putting to one side this conceptual difficulty, it is to be noted that subsections (b) and (c) by their very terms simply provide that a person outside of the United States who wishes to assert his citizenship \"may\" apply for a certificate of identity and that a holder of a certificate of identity \"may\" apply for admission to the United States. As the District Court said, \"The language of the section shows no intention to provide an exclusive remedy, or any remedy, for persons outside the United States who have not adopted the procedures outlined in subsections (b) and (c). Neither does the section indicate that such persons are to be denied existing remedies.\" 187 F. Supp., at 685.\n\nThe predecessor of 360 of the 1952 Act was 503 of the Nationality Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 1137. That section provided \n\n[369 \nU.S. 367, 376]\n\u00a0\n that a claimant whose citizenship was denied by administrative authorities could institute a declaratory judgment suit in the federal courts to determine his right to citizenship, whether he was in the United States or abroad. In addition, the section broadened the venue of such an action by permitting suit to be brought in the \"district in which such person claims a permanent residence.\" Finally, the section provided a method by which a claimant could enter the United States and prosecute his claim personally.\n7\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 367, 377]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe legislative history of 503 indicates that Congress understood the provision for a declaratory judgment action to be merely a confirmation of existing law, or at most a clarification of it.\n8\n What was concededly novel about 503 was the provision designed to permit a citizenship claimant outside the United States to be admitted to this country upon a certificate of identity in order personally to prosecute his claim to citizenship, subject to the condition of deportation in the event of an adverse decision. At the time of the enactment of this provision some misgivings were expressed that it might be utilized by aliens to gain physical entry into \n\n[369 \nU.S. 367, 378]\n\u00a0\n the United States and then to disappear into the general populace.\n9\n\u00a0\n\nIn the ensuing years the abuses which some had anticipated did, indeed, develop, and the legislative history of 360 of the 1952 Act shows that the predominate concern of Congress was to limit the easy-entry provision of 503 of the 1940 Act, under which these abuses had occurred. Thus the report of the Senate Committee which studied immigration and nationality problems for two and a half years found that 503 \"has been used, in a considerable number of cases, to gain entry into the United States where no such right existed.\" S. Rep. No. 1515, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 777; see also Joint Hearings before the Subcommittees of the Committees on the Judiciary on S. 716, H. R. 2379 and H. R. 2816, 82d Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 108-110, 443-445. In describing the purpose of the legislation which became 360 of the 1952 Act the Senate Judiciary Committee, stating that \"[t]he bill modifies section 503 of the Nationality Act of 1940,\" explained that it provides:\n\n\"that any person who has previously been physically present in the United States but who is not within the United States who claims a right or privilege as a national of the United States and is denied such right or privilege by any government agency may be issued a certificate of identity for the purpose of traveling to the United States and applying for admission to the United States. The net effect of \n\n[369 \nU.S. 367, 379]\n\u00a0\n this provision is to require that the determination of the nationality of such person shall be made in accordance with the normal immigration procedures. These procedures include review by habeas corpus proceedings where the issue of the nationality status of the person can be properly adjudicated.\" S. Rep. No. 1137, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 50.\n\n\n As a matter simply of grammatical construction, it seems obvious that the \"such person\" referred to in the Committee Report is a person who has chosen to obtain a certificate of identity and to seek admission to the United States in order to prosecute his claim. The appellee in the present case is, of course, not such a person.\n\nThis legislative history is sufficient, we think, to show that the purpose of 360 (b) and (c) was to cut off the opportunity which aliens had abused under 503 of the 1940 Act to gain fraudulent entry to the United States by prosecuting spurious citizenship claims. We are satisfied that Congress did not intend to foreclose lawsuits by claimants, such as Cort, who do not try to gain entry to the United States before prevailing in their claims to citizenship.\n\nFor these reasons, we hold that a person outside the United States who has been denied a right of citizenship is not confined to the procedures prescribed by 360 (b) and (c), and that the remedy pursued in the present case was an appropriate one. This view is in accord with previous decisions of this Court concerning the relationship of 10 and 12 of the Administrative Procedure Act to the subsequently enacted Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. See Shaughnessy v. Pedreiro, \n349 \nU.S. 48\n; Brownell v. Tom We Shung, \n352 \nU.S. 180\n. The teaching of those cases is that the Court will not hold that the broadly remedial provisions of the Administrative Procedure \n\n[369 \nU.S. 367, 380]\n\u00a0\n Act are unavailable to review administrative decisions under the 1952 Act in the absence of clear and convincing evidence that Congress so intended.\n\nWith respect to the other issues presented by this appeal, the case is set for reargument during the October Term, 1962, to follow No. 19.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 66 Stat. 163, 267-268, 8 U.S.C. 1481 (a) (10).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 50 U.S.C. App. 454 et seq. Appellee had previously registered as a regular registrant under the Universal Military Training and Service Act of 1948.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] \n356 \nU.S. 86\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] We postponed consideration of the question of our jurisdiction of this appeal until the hearing of the case on the merits. \n365 \nU.S. 808\n. Under 28 U.S.C. 1252, a direct appeal may be taken from a District Court decision holding unconstitutional an Act of Congress in a civil action in which an officer of the United States is a party. Since the District Court held 349 (a) (10) unconstitutional, this appeal is properly before us under 1252.\n\nAn alternative basis for our jurisdiction over this appeal might be found in 28 U.S.C. 1253, providing for direct appeals from the decisions of three-judge courts convened under 28 U.S.C. 2282, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 367, 371]\n\u00a0\n 2284. But since jurisdiction is clearly authorized by 28 U.S.C. 1252, we need not inquire further into the applicability of 28 U.S.C. 2282 to this case. In view of the unanimous decision below, the fact that three judges heard the case originally would not affect an otherwise final and reviewable decision of the District Court. See Thompson v. Whittier, \n365 \nU.S. 465\n; compare Garment Workers v. Donnelly Co., \n304 \nU.S. 243, 251\n-252.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Section 360 (a), 66 Stat. 163, 273, 8 U.S.C. 1503 (a):\n\n\"(a) If any person who is within the United States claims a right or privilege as a national of the United States and is denied such right or privilege by any department or independent agency, or official thereof, upon the ground that he is not a national of the United States, such person may institute an action under the provisions of section 2201 of title 28, United States Code, against the head of such department or independent agency for a judgment declaring him to be a national of the United States, except that no such action may be instituted in any case if the issue of such person's status as a national of the United States (1) arose by reason of, or in connection with any exclusion proceeding under the provisions of this or any other act, or (2) is in issue in any such exclusion proceeding. An action under this subsection may be instituted only within five years after the final administrative denial of such right or privilege and shall be filed in the district court of the United States for the district in which such person resides or claims a residence, and jurisdiction over such officials in such cases is hereby conferred upon those courts.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Section 360 (b) and (c), 66 Stat. 163, 273-274, 8 U.S.C. 1503 (b) and (c):\n\n\"(b) If any person who is not within the United States claims a right or privilege as a national of the United States and is denied such right or privilege by any department or independent agency, or official thereof, upon the ground that he is not a national of the United States, such person may make application to a diplomatic or consular officer of the United States in the foreign country in which he is residing for a certificate of identity for the purpose of traveling to a port of entry in the United States and applying for admission. Upon proof to the satisfaction of such diplomatic or consular officer that such application is made in good faith and has a substantial basis, he shall issue to such person a certificate of identity. From any denial of an application for such certificate the applicant shall be entitled to an appeal to the Secretary of State, who, if he approves the denial, shall state in writing his reasons for his decision. The Secretary of State shall prescribe rules and regulations for the issuance of certificates of identity as above provided. The provisions of this subsection shall be applicable only to a person who at some time prior to his application for the certificate of identity has been physically present in the United States, or to a person under sixteen years of age who was born abroad of a United States citizen parent.\n\n\n\"(c) A person who has been issued a certificate of identity under the provisions of subsection (b), and while in possession thereof, may apply for admission to the United States at any port of entry, and shall be subject to all the provisions of this Act relating to the conduct of proceedings involving aliens seeking admission to the United States. A final determination by the Attorney General that any such person is not entitled to admission to the United States shall be subject to review by any court of competent jurisdiction in habeas corpus proceedings and not otherwise. Any person described in this section who is finally excluded from admission to the United States shall be subject to all the provisions of this Act relating to aliens seeking admission to the United States.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Section 503 of the Nationality Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 1137, 1171-1172, provided:\n\n\"If any person who claims a right or privilege as a national of the United States is denied such right or privilege by any Department or agency, or executive official thereof, upon the ground that he is not a national of the United States, such person, regardless of whether he is within the United States or abroad, may institute an action against the head of such Department or agency in the District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia or in the district court of the United States for the district in which such person claims a permanent residence for a judgment declaring him to be a national of the United States. If such person is outside the United States and shall have instituted such an action in court, he may, upon submission of a sworn application showing that the claim of nationality presented in such action is made in good faith and has a substantial basis, obtain from a diplomatic or consular officer of the United States in the foreign country in which he is residing a certificate of identity stating that his nationality status is pending before the court, and may be admitted to the United States with such certificate upon the condition that he shall be subject to deportation in case it shall be decided by the court that he is not a national of the United States. Such certificate of identity shall not be denied solely on the ground that such person has lost a status previously had or acquired as a national of the United States; and from any denial of an application for such certificate the applicant shall be entitled to an appeal to the Secretary of State, who, if he approves the denial, shall state in writing the reasons for his decision. The Secretary of State, with approval of the Attorney General, shall prescribe rules and regulations for the issuance of certificates of identity as above provided.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] For example, one of the managers of the bill in the House explained the declaratory judgment provisions as follows:\n\n\"We have a rather new situation here, and that is we are cutting off the claim to citizenship of these thousands of persons under this provision in the bill who do not comply with its terms and therefore it was deemed advisable that some chance be given them to have what might be called their day in court. We have safeguarded the situation extremely carefully and feel that so far as possible we have prevented any abuse of it. It was my contention when this measure was up for consideration in the committee that such people did have the right to go into court either on a declaratory judgment or under a writ of habeas corpus, but there was a feeling on the part of others that they may not have that right.\" 86 Cong. Rec. 13247.\n\n\n A similar understanding of the measure was indicated during the House Committee Hearings on the bill.\n\n\"Mr. FLOURNOY. . . . The question remains, whether while still abroad he would not be able to resort to a petition for declaratory judgment or for a writ of mandamus.\n\n\n\"The CHAIRMAN. I should think, gentlemen, that we ought to go a little step further . . . to say that such person may, upon application, be permitted under certain conditions . . . to enter the United States for a short period of time as a temporary person only.\" Hearings before the House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization on H. R. 6127, superseded by H. R. 9980, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 291-292.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] For instance, a representative of the Immigration and Naturalization Service testified at the House Committee hearings that after a citizen claimant had been permitted to enter the United States, \"[I]t would be open to question, in my mind, whether you would ever get him out again.\" Hearings before the House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization on H. R. 6127, superseded by H. R. 9980, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 292; see also, id., at 294, 296.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, concurring.\n\nWhile I agree with the reasoning of the Court and join its opinion, I wish to note my view that its interpretation of 360 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 is further supported by serious doubt as to whether the statute as construed and applied by the dissenting opinion would be constitutional. Compare, e. g., United States v. Witkovich, \n353 \nU.S. 194, 201\n-202.\n\nNecessarily implicit in the administrative denial of a right or privilege of citizenship on the ground that the individual affected has committed an expatriating act enumerated in 401 of the 1940 Act or 349 of the 1952 Act, is the assumption that the individual was theretofore a citizen. Accordingly, it follows from the interpretation advanced by the dissent that a person abroad who just prior to the adverse administrative action admittedly had been deemed a citizen, entitled to all the incidents of citizenship including the freedom to re-enter the country, may by unreviewable administrative action be relegated to the status of an alien confronted by all the barriers to alien entry and the limited access to judicial review that an alien enjoys. That Congress may, consistently with the requirements of due process, circumscribe general grants of jurisdiction\n1\n so as to deny judicial review of administrative action which peremptorily initiates \n\n[369 \nU.S. 367, 381]\n\u00a0\n the treatment as an alien of one who had been a citizen seems at least doubtful enough that we should, if reasonably possible, avoid interpreting any statute to accomplish such a result.\n\nIf 360 (b), (c) provided the sole avenue to judicial review for one who while abroad is denied a right of citizenship, the following consequences would result: He would have to apply for a certificate of identity, which would be granted only if an administrative official was satisfied that the application was made in good faith and had a substantial basis. If the certificate were initially denied, an administrative appeal would have to be taken. If that failed, an attempt might be made to secure judicial review. A holding that no such review is available would mean that one who admittedly had been a citizen would have been conclusively converted into an alien without ever having gained access to any court. On the other hand, if review were forthcoming at this stage, and if issuance of a certificate were ordered, the individual would have gained only the right to travel to a United States port of entry - if he could afford the passage - there to be \"subject to all the provisions of this chapter relating to the conduct of proceedings involving aliens seeking admission to the United States.\" He would, in other words, have to submit to detention as an alien although it is assumed that he was once a citizen and no court had ever determined that he had been expatriated. Should he still encounter an administrative denial of the right to enter, he would finally get into court, but \"in habeas corpus proceedings and not otherwise,\" with whatever limitations upon the scope of review such language may imply.\n\nThe dissent would construe 360 to mean that administrative action resulting in such a stark limitation of such fundamental rights is totally unreviewable. For the very procedures of subsections (b) and (c), which according to \n\n[369 \nU.S. 367, 382]\n\u00a0\n the dissent's interpretation are the only avenues to review open to the putative expatriate abroad, accomplish a conversion of citizenship into alienage. To read Congress as having denied judicial review of administrative action which throws an individual into this bind would be to tread upon a constitutional quicksand.\n\nThe dissent finds shelter in United States v. Ju Toy, \n198 \nU.S. 253\n, but that case does not resolve the constitutional doubts I have suggested. The precise issue there was the degree of finality to be accorded in habeas corpus proceedings to an administrative refusal of entry based on a finding that the petitioner was not, as he claimed, native-born and so had never been a citizen. Ju Toy was not an expatriation case in which administrative officials purported to withdraw rights of citizenship which admittedly once existed. Even if \"the mere fact that [persons seeking entry] . . . claimed to be citizens would not have entitled them under the Constitution to a judicial hearing,\"\n2\n it does not follow that rights attaching to admitted citizenship may be forfeited without a judicial hearing. To deny the rights of citizenship to one who previously enjoyed them \"obviously deprives him of liberty . . . . It may result also in loss of both property and life; or of all that makes life worth living. Against the danger of such deprivation without the sanction afforded by judicial proceedings, the Fifth Amendment affords protection \n\n[369 \nU.S. 367, 383]\n\u00a0\n in its guarantee of due process of law. The difference in security of judicial over administrative action has been adverted to by this court.\" Ng Fung Ho v. White, \n259 \nU.S. 276, 284\n-285.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 1009; Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. 2201.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Ng Fung Ho v.

Ju Toy, \n198 \nU.S. 253, 261\n:\n\n\"This petition should have been denied . . ., irrespective of what more we have to say, because it alleged nothing except citizenship. It disclosed neither abuse of authority nor the existence of evidence not laid before the Secretary. It did not even set forth that evidence or allege its effect. But as it was entertained and the District Court found for the petitioner it would be a severe measure to order the petition to be dismissed on that ground now, and we pass on to further considerations.\"\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER and MR. JUSTICE CLARK join, dissenting.\n\nThe decision that the District Court had jurisdiction to entertain this declaratory judgment action, notwithstanding that the appellee is a foreign resident, seems to me manifestly wrong, in light of the governing statute and its legislative history which could hardly be more clear.\n\nThis issue depends upon 360 of the 1952 Act. That section is entitled: \"Proceedings For Declaration of United States Nationality In The Event of [the administrative] Denial of Rights And Privileges as National.\" The provisions of the section set out in full in the margin,\n1\n may be summarized as follows:\n\n (1) If the person whose rights as a national have been administratively denied \"is within the United \n\n[369 \nU.S. 367, 384]\n\u00a0\n States,\" he may bring a declaratory judgment action under 28 U.S.C. 2201 to establish his citizenship,\n2\n unless that issue was, or is, already involved in an \"exclusion\" proceeding. The action must be brought \n\n[369 \nU.S. 367, 385]\n\u00a0\n within five years after the final administrative denial, and in the district where such person resides or claims residence. (Subsection \"(a).\")\n\n\n (2) If such person is \"not within the United States,\" but had previously been \"physically\" there, or was born abroad of an American citizen parent and is under the age of 16, (i) he may apply abroad for a \"certificate of identity\" to enable him to seek admission to the United States (subsection \"(b)\"); and (ii) if admission at a port of entry is finally denied him by the Attorney General, he may have that determination judicially reviewed \"in habeas corpus proceedings and not otherwise.\" If ultimately excluded from the United States, such person is made subject to all the provisions of the immigration law relating to the admission of aliens to the United States. (Subsection \"(c).\")\n\n\n As will be shown later, these provisions of the 1952 Act, among other things, departed from the comparable procedural provisions of 503 of the Nationality Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 1137, 1171-1172, which had expressly made declaratory relief available to all citizenship claimants, whether \"within the United States or abroad,\" following an administrative denial of that status.\n3\n The purpose \n\n[369 \nU.S. 367, 386]\n\u00a0\n and effect of the new provisions are shown by the following extract from the Senate Judiciary Committee's report on the bill (S. 2550), 360 of which, with only a minor addition and deletion,\n4\n now bears the same number in the 1952 Act:\n\n   \"G. DECLARATORY JUDGMENT\n\n\n \"Under the provisions of section 503 of the Nationality Act of 1940 any person who claims a right or privilege as a national of the United States and who is denied such right or privilege by a governmental agency on the ground that he is not a national of the United States may institute an action in a district Federal court for a judgment declaring him to be a national of the United States. If such person is outside the United States and shall have instituted the action in court, he may obtain from a diplomatic or consular officer a certificate of identity and may be admitted to the United States with the certificate upon the condition that he shall be subject \n\n[369 \nU.S. 367, 387]\n\u00a0\n to deportation in case it shall be decided by the court that he is not a national of the United States.\n\n\n \"The bill modifies section 503 of the Nationality Act of 1940 by limiting the court action exclusively to persons who are within the United States, and prohibits the court action in any case if the issue of the person's status as a national of the United States (1) arose by reason of, or in connection with, any deportation or exclusion proceeding or (2) is an issue in any such deportation or exclusion proceeding. The reason for the modification is that the issue of citizenship is always germane in an exclusion and deportation proceeding, in which case an adjudication of nationality status can be appropriately made.\n\n\n \"The bill further provides that any person who has previously been physically present in the United States but who is not within the United States who claims a right or privilege as a national of the United States and is denied such right or privilege by any government agency may be issued a certificate of identity for the purpose of traveling to the United States and applying for admission to the United States. The net effect of this provision is to require that the determination of the nationality of such person shall be made in accordance with the normal immigration procedures. These procedures include review by habeas corpus proceedings where the issue of the nationality status of the person can be properly adjudicated.\" S. Rep. No. 1137, to accompany S. 2550, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 50. (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n The Court now holds, however, that under 360 declaratory relief is still available to those \"not within the United States\" as well as those \"within the United States,\" as was so under 503 of the 1940 Act; that the certificate of identity procedure provided in subsections \n\n[369 \nU.S. 367, 388]\n\u00a0\n (b) and (c) of 360 is not the exclusive remedy available to nonresident citizenship claimants; that Congress' \"predominant concern\" in enacting those subsections was to fend against possible misuse of certificates of identity in effecting fraudulent entry into this country; and that jurisdiction of this action accordingly lies under the Declaratory Judgment Act and the Administrative Procedure Act. These conclusions, which I believe are plainly inconsistent with the congressional purpose, as reflected on the fact of 360 itself and in the foregoing Senate Judiciary Committee report, are refuted beyond any doubt by the background and legislative history of 360.\n\nPrior to 1940, immigration and nationality statutes were silent on the form and scope of judicial review in deportation, exclusion, and nationality cases. In 1905 this Court, in a habeas corpus proceeding involving an administrative denial of admission to this country of a nonresident citizenship claimant who had temporarily departed, held that due process did not require a judicial trial of the issue of citizenship; and that the courts could inquire into the administrative decision only within the conventional limits of habeas corpus review.\n5\n United States v. Ju Toy, \n198 \nU.S. 253\n (Holmes, J.). In 1922, however, the Court held that a resident claimant in a deportation proceeding was entitled to a judicial determination of his citizenship status, thus turning the availability of full judicial relief on the geographical location of the claimant. Ng Fung Ho v. White, \n259 \nU.S. 276\n (Brandeis, J.).\n\nIn 1934 the Declaratory Judgment Act was passed. 48 Stat. 955-956; 28 U.S.C. 2201, as since amended. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 367, 389]\n\u00a0\n In a case decided in 1939, this Court held that remedy applicable to resident citizenship claimants, see Perkins v. Elg, \n307 \nU.S. 325\n. However, despite the Elg decision, and no doubt because of the Ju Toy and Ng Fung Ho cases, the continuing prevailing view prior to 1940 seems to have been that relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act was not available to nonresidents seeking a determination of their citizenship claims.\n\nIt was not until 1940 that Congress, in the Nationality Act of 1940, first specifically dealt with the availability of declaratory relief in nationality cases. Under that statute the requirements for citizenship were greatly tightened and the provisions for loss of citizenship expanded. During the debates concern was expressed lest under existing law some persons might not get their \"day in court\" with respect to claims to citizenship. 86 Cong. Rec. 13247. This led to the enactment of 503 under which declaratory relief was made available to resident and nonresident claimants alike, and, in the case of the latter, authorizing, but not requiring, their provisional entry into the United States under certificates of identity, issuable in aid of a declaratory judgment suit already filed. Note 3, supra.\n\nAt the same time Congress recognized the possibility of abuse of this liberalized procedure on the part of nonresident claimants who might seek certificates of identity only to achieve entry into this country, without any thought of pressing their citizenship claims; and an attempt was made to guard against such abuse. Accordingly, the section was written to provide that certificates of identity should be furnished only upon \"a sworn application showing that the claim of nationality presented in such [declaratory judgment] action is made in good faith and has a substantial basis\"; it also authorized the Secretary of State, with the approval of the Attorney General, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 367, 390]\n\u00a0\n to prescribe regulations for the issuance of such certificates.\n6\n Note 3, supra.\n\nCommencing soon after the close of World War II, and perhaps in part as a result of the then recent repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act and continuing Communist successes in China, a large number of suits were filed in the federal courts by Chinese citizenship claimants. These carried in their wake consequences which Congress could hardly have fully anticipated when it enacted 503. Such consequences were principally of three kinds. First, there was an increase in the volume of fraudulent entries into this country; many Chinese who had obtained certificates of identity incident to the institution of a declaratory judgment citizenship action would abandon the suit upon arrival here and disappear into the stream of the population. Second, the courts experienced difficulty in adjudicating \"derivative\" citizenship claims without the claimants having been first exposed to normal immigration screening; such claims were often based on the assertion that the claimant was the foreign-born child of an American citizen who had temporarily returned to China, an assertion frequently difficult to disprove. Third, the federal court dockets became cluttered with these suits. See, e. g., United States ex rel. Dong Wing Ott v. Shaughnessy, 116 F. Supp. 745, 751-752, aff'd, 220 F.2d 537; Mar Gong v. McGranery, 109 F. Supp. 821, rev'd sub nom. Mar Gong v. Brownell, 209 F.2d 448. By the end of 1952, 1,288 such cases had been instituted. See Ly Shew v. Acheson, 110 F. Supp. 50, 54-55, vacated and remanded sub nom. Ly Shew v. Dulles, 219 F.2d 413; \n\n[369 \nU.S. 367, 391]\n\u00a0\n Annual Reports of the Attorney General for 1956 (pp. 111-113) and 1957 (pp. 121-123). This state of affairs contributed in no small degree to the revamping of 503 by 360 of the statute now before us, enacted after five years of investigation pursuant to a 1947 Senate Resolution authorizing a general study of the immigration laws. S. Res. No. 137, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. (1947).\n\nThe first step in this direction occurred in 1950 when Senator McCarran introduced S. 3455, 359 of which, entitled \"Judicial Proceedings for Declaration of United States Nationality in the Event of Denial of Rights and Privileges as a National,\"\n7\n was the earliest version of what ultimately became 360 of the 1952 Act. Section 359 provided declaratory relief only for \"any person in the United States.\" The Senate Report\n8\n accompanying that bill, after observing that 503 of the 1940 Act permitted persons \"within or without\" the United States to file declaratory judgment suits, went on to say of proposed new 359:\n\n \"In spite of the definite restrictions on the use and application of section 503 to bona fide cases [see supra, pp. 389-390], the subcommittee finds that the section had been subject to broad interpretation, and that it has been used, in a considerable number of cases, to gain entry into the United States where no such right existed. . . . The subcommittee therefore recommends that the provisions of section 503 as set out in the proposed bill be modified to limit the privilege to persons who are in the United States . . . .\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n Read in connection with this report it is surely beyond doubt that the 503 \"privilege\" which was intended to be changed was not merely the right to a certificate of \n\n[369 \nU.S. 367, 392]\n\u00a0\n identity, which, under the existing statute, was an optional, not a necessary, appurtenance of a declaratory judgment suit, but the right of one abroad to maintain such a suit itself. Since a person \"in\" the United States had no need for a certificate of identity, the \"privilege\" limited by this bill to persons \"in\" the United States can only mean the privilege of bringing a declaratory suit. In other words, the new proposal did not view the \"entry\" problem as something that could be dealt with independently of the character of the judicial remedy to be afforded those administratively denied citizenship.\n9\n This, as will be seen, remained in the forefront of the subsequent legislative discussions.\n\nEarly in the following year three additional bills were placed before the Congress, one in the Senate and two in the House. S. 716,\n10\n a revision of the earlier McCarran bill, and H. R. 2379,\n11\n introduced by Representative Walter, both provided for \"citizenship\" declaratory relief only as to persons \"within the United States.\" The third, H. R. 2816,\n12\n introduced by Representative Celler, afforded such relief to \"any person\" (making no reference to location), and in other respects was also substantially like existing 503.\n\nIn the ensuing Joint Hearings on these bills\n13\n attention became sharply focused on the question of what, if \n\n[369 \nU.S. 367, 393]\n\u00a0\n any, judicial relief (other than habeas corpus) should be available to nonresident citizenship claimants. The most revealing points of view are found in the statements submitted on behalf of the Departments of State and Justice.\n14\n While both Departments took the position that some such relief should be afforded nonresidents,\n15\n their proposals were quite different. State suggested declaratory relief for persons abroad limited to those whose original citizenship status was not in doubt, but who were deemed to have lost it; and that certificates of identity should be made available to such persons, on an optional basis, to permit their coming to this country in aid of their suits.\n16\n Justice, on the other hand, recommended that all nonresidents whose claims to citizenship were not frivolous should be required to obtain a special certificate of identity, or its equivalent, so as to permit them to come to this country to test their claims in accordance with normal immigration procedures.\n17\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 367, 394]\n\u00a0\n\n\nHowever, it is evident that the proposals of both State and Justice were intended to fill the remedial gap in S. 716 respecting nonresidents; that they contemplated either limiting, or entirely doing away with, the unrestricted declaratory relief available to nonresidents under 503 of the 1940 statute; that they were envisaged as constituting the exclusive remedy for those living abroad; and that they negative any idea that one so situated was to have the choice between such procedures and the general remedies provided by the Declaratory Judgment Act or the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nFollowing the Joint Hearings, the McCarran bill, S. 716, was redrawn as S. 2055,\n18\n and the Walter bill, H. R. 2379, was revised as H. R. 5678,\n19\n in consultation with representatives of the State and Justice Departments.\n20\n The \n\n[369 \nU.S. 367, 395]\n\u00a0\n revised McCarran bill adopted the Department of Justice proposals, in effect limiting the judicial remedy for testing nonresident citizenship claims to that afforded in connection with \"exclusion\" cases, that is habeas corpus.\n21\n The new Walter bill was in effect a combination of existing 503 and the suggestions of the State Department.\n22\n That bill was eventually passed by the House.\n23\n The McCarran bill, except for two minor deletions,\n24\n was \n\n[369 \nU.S. 367, 396]\n\u00a0\n reported out by the Senate Judiciary Committee as S. 2550 and passed by the Senate. Supra, pp. 386-387.\n\nCongress, thus squarely faced with making, or not making, declaratory relief available to nonresident citizenship claimants, chose the latter course. It accepted S. 2550,\n25\n the judicial remedy provisions of which became 360 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. Note 1, supra.\n\nIn light of this unambiguous course of events, I do not understand how the Government's contention that the District Court lacked jurisdiction over this declaratory judgment action can be successfully challenged, the appellee at all relevant times having resided abroad. To say the least, the Court's contrary conclusion seems to me to rest on the most insecure kind of reasoning.\n\nCertainly, the past cases in this Court lend no support to this decision. Perkins v. Elg, \n307 \nU.S. 325\n, holding that a resident, threatened with deportation, could maintain a declaratory judgment action to establish citizenship, was of course quite in line with Ng Fung Ho v. White, supra. Moreover, the case was decided in 1939, before Congress, for the first time, addressed itself to the availability of declaratory relief in nationality cases. Supra, p. 389. McGrath v. Kristensen, \n340 \nU.S. 162\n, is even more inapposite. The issue there was simply whether, in the circumstances involved, an alien then in this country was eligible for naturalization, so that the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 367, 397]\n\u00a0\n Attorney General had power to stay his deportation. The Court noted that 503 of the 1940 Act was not available to the alien, since his citizenship status was not in issue. Incidentally, the Court did not reach the applicability of the Administrative Procedure Act. Flemming v. Nestor, \n363 \nU.S. 603\n, involved a nonresident alien's right to social security benefits, not citizenship.\n26\n\u00a0\n\nShaughnessy v. Pedreiro, \n349 \nU.S. 48\n, and Brownell v. Tom We Shung, \n352 \nU.S. 180\n, the two cases relied on by the Court as supporting the applicability of the Administrative Procedure Act in this instance, were, respectively, simply straightforward deportation and exclusion cases, neither involving a citizenship claim. Unlike the sections in the 1952 Act relating to nationality, those governing deportation and exclusion then had no specific provisions dealing with judicial relief,\n27\n and unlike this case, the relief in those cases was sought only after the administrative process had run its full course, and a \"final\" determination had been made by the Attorney General.\n\nWhen it comes to 360 itself and the legislative history of the section, the Court's analysis is, if anything, even \n\n[369 \nU.S. 367, 398]\n\u00a0\n more cursory and unpersuasive. The Court initially finds that the declaratory judgment provision respecting nonresidents, contained in the predecessor of 360 - 503 of the 1940 Act - was understood \"to be merely a confirmation of existing law, or at most a clarification of it.\" In this, the Court has overlooked the Ju Toy and Ng Fung Ho cases which of course indicate precisely the contrary. Supra, p. 388, and note 6.\n\nProceeding from that premise, and despite the unequivocal directive in subsection (c) of 360 that a final determination of the Attorney General denying admission to a citizenship claimant shall be subject to judicial review \"in habeas corpus proceedings and not otherwise,\" the Court concludes that such is not indeed the exclusive remedy. This is said to be so because 360 provides only that the claimant \"may\" apply abroad for a certificate of identity (subsection (b)), and upon arrival at our shores \"may\" apply for admission (subsection (c)). This conclusion is supported only by a quotation from the District Court's opinion in this very case. It cannot withstand the statute and legislative history already discussed.\n\nFinally, the Court considers that Congress' \"predominate concern\" in enacting subsections (b) and (c) of 360 was with fraudulent entry, not judicial remedies. It is said that this \"seems obvious\" because the phrase \"such person,\" contained in the extract quoted by the Court from the Judiciary Committee Report on S. 2550 (ante, pp. 378-379), refers grammatically only to those persons who had elected to pursue the certificate of identity procedure in prosecuting their citizenship claims. But this conclusion also will hardly stand up when the full text of the Judiciary Committee Report, especially the clause \"The bill modifies section 503 of the Nationality Act of 1940 by limiting the court action exclusively to persons who are within the United States . . .,\" is read (supra, p. 387), and the relevant legislative history is considered. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 367, 399]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn deciding the jurisdictional issue as it has, I fear that the Court has become the victim of the manner in which it has put that issue to itself:\n\n\"More precisely stated, the question in this case is whether, despite the liberal provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, Congress intended that a native of this country living abroad must travel thousands of miles, be arrested, and go to jail in order to attack an administrative finding that he is not a citizen of the United States.\"\n\n\n But to sustain the Government's position on this issue it is not necessary to find that Congress, in enacting 360, suddenly became severe, irrational, or capricious. As a result of the unfavorable experience with 503 of the 1940 Act, Congress simply restored, with some alleviations, what until 1940 had been the procedure in such cases - a procedure whose constitutionality had long since been upheld by this Court with the firm support of such men as Holmes and Brandeis, JJ. And in so doing Congress acted only after the fullest inquiry, debate, and deliberation.\n\nI am unable to grasp how the Court could have reached the conclusion that the present declaratory action is not precluded by 360, except by making its own wish father to the thought.\n28\n\u00a0\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"(a) If any person who is within the United States claims a right or privilege as a national of the United States and is denied such right or privilege by any department or independent agency, or official thereof, upon the ground that he is not a national of the United States, such person may institute an action under the provisions of section 2201 of title 28, United States Code, against the head of such department or independent agency for a judgment declaring him to be a national of the United States, except that no such action may be instituted in any case if the issue of such person's status as a national of the United States (1) arose by reason of, or in connection with any exclusion proceeding under the provisions of this or any other act, or (2) is in issue in any such exclusion proceeding. An action under this subsection may be instituted only within five years after the final administrative denial of such right or privilege and shall be filed in the district court of the United States for the district in \n\n[369 \nU.S. 367, 384]\n\u00a0\n which such person resides or claims a residence, and jurisdiction over such officials in such cases is hereby conferred upon those courts.\n\n\"(b) If any person who is not within the United States claims a right or privilege as a national of the United States and is denied such right or privilege by any department or independent agency, or official thereof, upon the ground that he is not a national of the United States, such person may make application to a diplomatic or consular officer of the United States in the foreign country in which he is residing for a certificate of identity for the purpose of traveling to a port of entry in the United States and applying for admission.

A final determination by the Attorney General that any such person is not entitled to admission to the United States shall be subject to review by any court of competent jurisdiction in habeas corpus proceedings and not otherwise.

(Supra, pp. 390-391.) On the other hand, it is entirely evident from the questioning of all witnesses that the problem which was uppermost in the minds of the committee members on this aspect of the bills was how best to afford adequate judicial relief to nonresidents under tight controls which would minimize the dangers of abuse.

To protect such persons the Department recommends adding to section 360 language which would permit the issuance to such persons of a special certificate of identity or a special `visa.' That document should be described in such a manner as merely to authorize the person in question to proceed to a port in the United States and apply for admission as a national, in the usual manner. . . . However, the intent of this suggestion is that the person claiming citizenship shall be required to apply for admission to the United States at a port of entry and go through the usual screening, interrogation, and investigation, applicable in the cases of other persons seeking admission to the United States, so that the Immigration and Naturalization Service will have as complete a record as possible on each person entering this country claiming to be a national thereof.\" Joint Hearings, p. 721. (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] S. 2055, 82d Cong., 1st Sess., 360, pp. 277-279 (1951).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] H. R. 5678, 82d Cong., 1st Sess., 360, pp. 150-152 (1951). The Celler bill, H. R. 2816, which, like 503, proposed a judicial remedy for both resident and nonresident citizenship claimants, scarcely figured in the Joint Hearings discussion.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] \"Following the joint hearings and in the course of numerous conferences attended by advisers representing unofficially the Departments of State and Justice, two modified versions of the above \n\n[369 \nU.S. 367, 395]\n\u00a0\n mentioned three bills [S. 716, H. R. 2379, H. R. 2816] were introduced . . . .\" H. R. Rep. No. 1365, to accompany H. R. 5678, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 28 (1952).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 21\n] It should be noted that there was added to what in the final result became subsection (a) of 360, relating to resident claimants, a specific reference to 28 U.S.C. 2201, the Declaratory Judgment Act, which had not been in 503. No reference to 28 U.S.C. 2201 was included in what ultimately became subsection (b).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 22\n] Whereas the State Department had proposed that declaratory relief, as to nonresidents, should be limited to those who had lost their American citizenship, the Walter bill provided declaratory relief for any claimant abroad, but limited eligibility for a certificate of identity to those who had been \"physically\" in the United States at some prior time, or to a person who was born abroad of an American-citizen parent and who wished to come to the United States to meet residential requirements for the retention of citizenship. After a declaratory action was filed, the bill provided that the claimant \"may\" make application for a certificate of identity \"for the purpose of traveling to the United States to prosecute his action for determination of his citizenship status.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 23\n] At p. 22 of his brief before this Court the appellee, Cort, quotes extensively from the House Report which accompanied H. R. 5678 - H. R. Rep. No. 1365, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 87-88 (1952) - to support his contention that present 360 was not designed to prohibit a suit for a declaratory judgment by a nonresident claimant, but only to limit the use of certificates of identity to gain entry in this country. However true this may be as to 360 of H. R. 5678, Cort's reliance on that bill is misplaced since the House bill was rejected in conference and the Senate version of 360 was eventually passed by both Houses and became law.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 24\n] A qualifying phrase, \"as a national of the United States,\" was deleted from subsections (b) and (c).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 25\n] The conferees modified 360 of S. 2550 in two minor respects. In subsection (a), a reference to \"deportation proceedings\" was deleted, so that the disability to bring declaratory relief for a person \"within the United States\" was limited only if the issue of nationality arose in an \"exclusion\" proceeding. (Compare note 1 and text accompanying note 2, supra, with S. Rep. No. 1137, supra, pp. 386-387.) In subsection (b) \"a person under sixteen years of age who was born abroad of a United States citizen parent\" was also made eligible for a certificate of identity. (Compare note 1 with S. Rep. No. 1137, supra, pp. 386-387.)\n\n\n[\nFootnote 26\n] In addition to Flemming v. Nestor, the Court cites two opinions from the District of Columbia Circuit, Stewart v. Dulles, 101 U.S. App. D.C. 280, 248 F.2d 602; Bauer v. Acheson, 106 F. Supp. 445, in support of its sweeping statement that \"the fact that the plaintiff is not within the United States has never been thought to bar an action for a declaratory judgment of this nature.\" If the phrase \"of this nature\" is intended to refer to citizenship claims, the two cases are inapposite since neither determined citizenship; in both cases the issue was whether the State Department could refuse to renew a passport, except for the limited purpose of returning to this country, without affording a hearing. Moreover, taking that phrase as referring to citizenship claims, compare both the decision of the District Court in the present case, 187 F. Supp. 683, and Tom Mung Ngow v. Dulles, 122 F. Supp. 709, with D'Argento v. Dulles, 113 F. Supp. 933.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 27\n] This is not so now. See the 1961 amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, note 28, infra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 28\n] It is not without irony that less than a year ago Congress, with the support of the Department of Justice, acted to tighten still further the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. Public Law 87-301, 75 Stat. 650 (effective October 26, 1961), amending the 1952 Act in various respects, among other things makes habeas corpus the sole judicial remedy in exclusion proceedings, thereby in effect rejecting Brownell v. Tom We Shung, supra, which had held the Administrative Procedure Act also available in such cases. See 8 U.S.C. 1105a (Supp. III 1962); H. R. Rep.

UNITED STATES(1962)\nNo. 10\nArgued: December 7, 1961Decided: May 21, 1962\n\n\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Together with No. 9, Shelton v. United States, argued December 6-7, 1961; No. 10, Whitman v. United States, argued December 7, 11, 1961; No. 11, Liveright v. United States, argued December 11, 1961; No. 12, Price v. United States, argued December 11, 1961; and No. 128, Gojack v. United States, argued December 11-12, 1961, also on certiorari to the same Court.\n\n The petitioners in these six cases were convicted of violating 2 U.S.C. 192, which makes it a misdemeanor for any person summoned to testify before a committee of Congress to refuse to answer \"any question pertinent to the question under inquiry.\" In each case the indictment returned by the grand jury stated that the questions to which answers were refused \"were pertinent to the question then under inquiry\" by the subcommittee; but it failed to identify the subject under subcommittee inquiry when the witness was interrogated. In each case a motion was filed to quash the indictment before trial for failure to state the subject under inquiry; but in each case the motion was denied and the issue thus raised was preserved and properly presented in this Court. Held: The grand jury indictment required by 2 U.S.C. 194 as a prerequisite to a prosecution for a violation of 192 must state the question which was under inquiry at the time of the defendant's alleged default or refusal to answer, as found by the grand jury; and the judgment affirming the conviction of each of the petitioners is reversed. Pp. 751-772.\n\n (a) The Congress which originally enacted in 1857 the law which was a predecessor of 2 U.S.C. 192 was expressly aware that pertinency to the subject under inquiry was the basic preliminary question which the federal courts would have to decide in determining whether a violation of the statute had been alleged or proved. Pp. 756-758. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 750]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n (b) Many decisions of this Court arising under 2 U.S.C. 192 have recognized the crucial importance of determining the issue of pertinency; and the obvious first step in determining whether the questions asked were pertinent to the subject under inquiry is to ascertain what that subject was. Pp. 758-760.\n\n\n (c) While convictions are no longer reversed because of minor and technical deficiencies which did not prejudice the accused, the substantial safeguards to those charged with serious crimes cannot be eradicated under the guise of technical departures from the rules. Pp. 760-763.\n\n\n (d) Omission from the indictments here involved of statements of the subject under inquiry deprived the defendants of one of the significant protections which the guaranty of a grand jury indictment was intended to confer - i. e., they failed adequately to apprise the defendants of what they must be prepared to meet. Pp. 763-768.\n\n\n (e) These indictments were also insufficient to serve the corollary purpose of enabling the courts to decide whether the facts alleged were sufficient in law to support convictions. Pp. 768-769.\n\n\n (f) The deficiencies in these indictments could not have been cured by bills of particulars, because under 2 U.S.C. 194 only a grand jury may determine whether a person should be held to answer in a criminal trial for refusing to give testimony pertinent to a question under congressional committee inquiry, and the grand jury itself must necessarily determine what the question under inquiry was.

JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nIn these six cases we review judgments of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia,\n1\n which affirmed convictions obtained in the District Court under 2 U.S.C. 192.\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 752]\n\u00a0\n Each of the petitioners was convicted for refusing to answer certain questions when summoned before a congressional subcommittee.\n3\n The cases were separately briefed and argued here, and many issues were presented. We decide each case upon a single ground common to all, and we therefore reach no other questions.\n\nIn each case the indictment returned by the grand jury failed to identify the subject under congressional subcommittee inquiry at the time the witness was interrogated. The indictments were practically identical in this respect, stating only that the questions to which answers were refused \"were pertinent to the question then under inquiry\" by the subcommittee.\n4\n In each case a motion \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 753]\n\u00a0\n was filed to quash the indictment before trial upon the ground that the indictment failed to state the subject under investigation at the time of the subcommittee's interrogation of the defendant.\n5\n In each case the motion was denied. In each case the issue thus raised was preserved on appeal, in the petition for writ of certiorari, and in brief and argument here.\n\nCongress has expressly provided that no one can be prosecuted under 2 U.S.C. 192 except upon indictment by a grand jury.\n6\n This Court has never decided whether \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 754]\n\u00a0\n the indictment must identify the subject which was under inquiry at the time of the defendant's alleged default or refusal to answer.\n7\n For the reasons that follow, we hold \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 755]\n\u00a0\n that the indictment must contain such an averment, and we accordingly reverse the judgments before us.\n\nIn enacting the criminal statute under which these petitioners were convicted Congress invoked the aid of the federal judicial system in protecting itself against contumacious conduct. Watkins v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 178, 207\n. The obvious consequence, as the Court has repeatedly emphasized, was to confer upon the federal courts the duty to accord a person prosecuted for this statutory offense every safeguard which the law accords in all other federal criminal cases. Sinclair v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 263, 296\n-297; Watkins v. United States, supra, at 208; Sacher v. United States, \n356 \nU.S. 576, 577\n; Flaxer v. United States, \n358 \nU.S. 147, 151\n; Deutch v. United States, \n367 \nU.S. 456, 471\n.\n\nRecognizing this elementary concept, the Sinclair case established several propositions which provide a relevant starting point here. First, there can be criminality under the statute only if the question which the witness refused to answer pertained to a subject then under investigation by the congressional body which summoned him. \"[A] witness rightfully may refuse to answer where . . . the questions asked are not pertinent to the matter under inquiry.\" Sinclair v. United States, supra, at 292. Secondly, because the defendant is presumed to be innocent, it is \"incumbent upon the United States to plead and show that the question [he refused to answer] pertained to some matter under investigation.\" Id., at 296-297. Finally, Sinclair held that the question of \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 756]\n\u00a0\n pertinency is one for determination by the court as a matter of law. Id., at 298.\n\nIn that case the Court had before it an indictment which set out in specific and lengthy detail the subject under investigation by the Senate Committee which had summoned Sinclair. The Court was thereby enabled to make an enlightened and precise determination that the question he had refused to answer was pertinent to that subject. Id., at 285-289, 296-298.\n\nThat the making of such a determination would be a vital function of the federal judiciary in a prosecution brought under 2 U.S.C. 192 was clearly foreseen by the Congress which originally enacted the law in 1857.\n8\n Congress not only provided that a person could be prosecuted only upon an indictment by a grand jury, but, as the record of the legislative debates shows, Congress was expressly aware that pertinency to the subject under inquiry was the basic preliminary question which the federal courts were going to have to decide in determining \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 757]\n\u00a0\n whether a criminal offense had been alleged or proved. The principal spokesman for the bill, Senator Bayard, repeatedly made this very point:\n\n \"The bill provides for punishing a witness who shall refuse to answer any question `pertinent' to the matter of inquiry under consideration before the House or its committee. If he refuses to answer an irrelevant question, he is not subject to the penalties of the bill. The question must be pertinent to the subject-matter, and that will have to be decided by the courts of justice on the indictment. That power is not given to Congress; it is given appropriately to the judiciary.\" Cong. Globe, 34th Cong., 3d Sess. 439 (1857).\n\n\n .  . .  .  .\n\n\n \"This law does not propose to give to this miscellaneous political body the power of punishment; but one of its greatest recommendations is, that it transfers that power of punishment to a court of justice after judicial inquiry. All that is to be done in the case of a refusal to testify is to certify the fact to the district attorney, who is to lay it before the grand jury, and if the party is indicted he is bound to answer according to the terms of the law, as any other person would for an offense against the laws of the land. . . . I am aware that legislative bodies have transcended their powers - that under the influence of passion and political excitement they have very often invaded the rights of individuals, and may have invaded the rights of coordinate branches of the Government; but if our institutions are to last, there can be no greater safeguard than will result from transferring that which now stands on an indefinite power (the punishment as well as the offense resting \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 758]\n\u00a0\n in the breast of either House) from Congress to the courts of justice. When a case of this kind comes before a court, will not the first inquiry be, have Congress jurisdiction of the subject-matter? - has the House which undertakes to inquire, jurisdiction of the subject? If they have not, the whole proceedings are coram non judice and void, and the party cannot be held liable under indictment. The Court would quash the indictment if this fact appeared on its face; and if it appeared on the trial they would direct the jury to acquit.\" Cong. Globe, 34th Cong., 3d Sess. 440 (1857).\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \". . . The law prescribes that, in case of such refusal, the House shall certify the fact to the district attorney, and he shall bring the matter before the grand jury. When that comes up by indictment before the court, must not the court decide whether the question put was pertinent to the inquiry? Of course they must; and they cannot hold the party guilty without doing it.\" Cong. Globe, 34th Cong., 3d Sess. 440 (1857).\n\n\n These forecasts of the office which the federal courts would be called upon to perform under 2 U.S.C. 192 have been amply borne out by the cases which have arisen under the statute. The crucial importance of determining the issue of pertinency is reflected in many cases which have come here since Sinclair, supra. Watkins v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 178, 208\n; Sacher v. United States, \n356 \nU.S. 576, 577\n; Barenblatt v. United States, \n360 \nU.S. 109, 123\n-125; Wilkinson v. United States, \n365 \nU.S. 399, 407\n-409, 413; Braden v. United States, \n365 \nU.S. 431, 435\n-436; Deutch v. United States, \n367 \nU.S. 456, 467\n-471. Our decisions have pointed out that the obvious first step in determining whether the questions asked were pertinent \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 759]\n\u00a0\n to the subject under inquiry is to ascertain what that subject was. See, e. g., Deutch v. United States, supra, at 469. Identification of the subject under inquiry is also an essential preliminary to the determination of a host of other issues which typically arise in prosecutions under the statute. In Wilkinson v. United States, supra, for example, the Court pointed out that in order properly to consider any of the many issues there presented, \"the starting point must be to determine the subject matter of the subcommittee's inquiry.\" \n365 \nU.S., at 407\n.\n\nWhere, as in the Sinclair case, the subject under inquiry has been identified in the indictment, this essential first step has presented no problem. Where, as in the more recent cases, the indictment has not identified the topic under inquiry, the Court has often found it difficult or impossible to ascertain what the subject was. The difficulty of such a determination in the absence of an allegation in the indictment is illustrated by Deutch v. United States, supra. In that case the members of this Court were in sharp disagreement as to what the subject under subcommittee inquiry had been. Moreover, all of us disagreed with the District Court's theory, and the Court of Appeals had not even ventured a view on the question. \n367 \nU.S., at 467\n. In Watkins v. United States, supra, the Court found it not merely difficult, but actually impossible, to determine what the topic under subcommittee inquiry had been at the time the petitioner had refused to answer the questions addressed to him. \"Having exhausted the several possible indicia of the `question under inquiry,' we remain unenlightened as to the subject to which the questions asked petitioner were pertinent.\" \n354 \nU.S., at 214\n.\n9\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 760]\n\u00a0\n\n\nTo be sure, the fact that difficulties and doubts have beset the federal courts in trying to ascertain the subject under inquiry in cases arising under 2 U.S.C. 192 could hardly justify, in the abstract, a requirement that indictments under the statute contain averments which would simplify the courts' task. Difficult and doubtful questions are inherent in the judicial process, particularly under a system of criminal law which places heavy emphasis upon the protection of the rights and liberties of the individual. Courts sit to resolve just such questions, and rules of law are not to be made merely to suit judicial convenience. But a proliferation of doubtful issues which not only burden the judiciary, but, because of uncertainties inherent in their resolution, work a hardship upon both the prosecution and the defense in criminal cases, is hardly a desideratum. And the repeated appearance in prosecutions under a particular criminal statute of the same critical and difficult question, which could be obviated by a simple averment in the indictment, invites inquiry into the purposes and functions which a grand jury indictment is intended to serve. The cases we have discussed, therefore, furnish an appropriate background for the inquiry to which we now turn.\n\nAny discussion of the purpose served by a grand jury indictment in the administration of federal criminal law must begin with the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the Constitution. The Fifth Amendment provides that \"No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; . . .\" We need not pause \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 761]\n\u00a0\n to consider whether an offense under 2 U.S.C. 192 is an \"infamous crime,\" Duke v. United States, \n301 \nU.S. 492\n, since Congress has from the beginning explicitly conferred upon those prosecuted under the statute the protection which the Fifth Amendment confers, by providing that no one can be prosecuted for this offense except upon an indictment by a grand jury. This specific guaranty, as well as the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause, are, therefore, both brought to bear here. Of like relevance is the guaranty of the Sixth Amendment that \"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; . . .\"\n\nThe constitutional provision that a trial may be held in a serious federal criminal case only if a grand jury has first intervened reflects centuries of antecedent development of common law, going back to the Assize of Clarendon in 1166.\n10\n \"The grand jury is an English institution, brought to this country by the early colonists and incorporated in the Constitution by the Founders. There is every reason to believe that our constitutional grand jury was intended to operate substantially like its English progenitor. The basic purpose of the English grand jury was to provide a fair method for instituting criminal proceedings against persons believed to have committed crimes.\" Costello v. United States, \n350 \nU.S. 359, 362\n. See McClintock, Indictment by a Grand Jury, 26 Minn. L. Rev. 153; Orfield, Criminal Procedure from Arrest to Appeal, 137-140, 144-146.\n\nFor many years the federal courts were guided in their judgments concerning the construction and sufficiency of grand jury indictments by the common law alone. Not until 1872 did Congress enact general legislation touching \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 762]\n\u00a0\n upon the subject. In that year a statute was enacted which reflected the drift of the law away from the rules of technical and formalized pleading which had characterized an earlier era. The 1872 statute provided that \"no indictment found and presented by a grand jury in any district or circuit or other court of the United States shall be deemed insufficient, nor shall the trial, judgment, or other proceeding thereon be affected by reason of any defect or imperfection in matter of form only, which shall not tend to the prejudice of the defendant.\" 17 Stat. 198. This legislation has now been repealed, but its substance is preserved in the more generalized provision of Rule 52 (a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which states that \"Any error, defect, irregularity or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.\"\n11\n\u00a0\n\nThere was apparently no other legislation dealing with the subject of indictments generally until the promulgation of Rule 7 (c), Fed. Rules Crim. Proc., in 1946. The Rule provides:\n\n \"The indictment or the information shall be a plain, concise and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged. It shall be signed by the attorney for the government. It need not contain a formal commencement, a formal conclusion or any other matter not necessary to such statement. Allegations made in one count may be incorporated by reference in another count. It may be alleged in a single count that the means by which the defendant committed the offense are unknown or that he committed it by one or more specified means. The indictment or information \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 763]\n\u00a0\n shall state for each count the official or customary citation of the statute, rule, regulation or other provision of law which the defendant is alleged therein to have violated. Error in the citation or its omission shall not be ground for dismissal of the indictment or information or for reversal of a conviction if the error or omission did not mislead the defendant to his prejudice.\"\n\n\n As we have elsewhere noted, \"This Court has, in recent years, upheld many convictions in the face of questions concerning the sufficiency of the charging papers. Convictions are no longer reversed because of minor and technical deficiencies which did not prejudice the accused. [Citing cases.] This has been a salutary development in the criminal law.\" Smith v. United States, \n360 \nU.S. 1, 9\n. \"But,\" as the Smith opinion went on to point out, \"the substantial safeguards to those charged with serious crimes cannot be eradicated under the guise of technical departures from the rules.\" Ibid. Resolution of the issue presented in the cases before us thus ultimately depends upon the nature of \"the substantial safeguards\" to a criminal defendant which an indictment is designed to provide. Stated concretely, does the omission from an indictment under 2 U.S.C. 192 of the subject under congressional committee inquiry amount to no more than a technical deficiency of no prejudice to the defendant? Or does such an omission deprive the defendant of one of the significant protections which the guaranty of a grand jury indictment was intended to confer?\n\nIn a number of cases the Court has emphasized two of the protections which an indictment is intended to guarantee, reflected by two of the criteria by which the sufficiency of an indictment is to be measured. These criteria are, first, whether the indictment \"contains the elements of the offense intended to be charged, `and sufficiently apprises the defendant of what he must be prepared to meet,'\" \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 764]\n\u00a0\n and, secondly, \"`in case any other proceedings are taken against him for a similar offence, whether the record shows with accuracy to what extent he may plead a former acquittal or conviction.' Cochran and Sayre v. United States, \n157 \nU.S. 286, 290\n; Rosen v. United States, \n161 \nU.S. 29, 34\n.\" Hagner v. United States, \n285 \nU.S. 427, 431\n. See Potter v. United States, \n155 \nU.S. 438, 445\n; Bartell v. United States, \n227 \nU.S. 427, 431\n; Berger v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 78, 82\n; United States v. Debrow, \n346 \nU.S. 374, 377\n-378.\n\nWithout doubt the second of these preliminary criteria was sufficiently met by the indictments in these cases. Since the indictments set out not only the times and places of the hearings at which the petitioners refused to testify, but also specified the precise questions which they then and there refused to answer, it can hardly be doubted that the petitioners would be fully protected from again being put in jeopardy for the same offense, particularly when it is remembered that they could rely upon other parts of the present record in the event that future proceedings should be taken against them. See McClintock, Indictment by a Grand Jury, 26 Minn. L. Rev. 153, 160; Bartell v. United States, \n227 \nU.S. 427, 433\n. The vice of these indictments, rather, is that they failed to satisfy the first essential criterion by which the sufficiency of an indictment is to be tested, i. e., that they failed to sufficiently apprise the defendant \"of what he must be prepared to meet.\"\n\nAs has been pointed out, the very core of criminality under 2 U.S.C. 192 is pertinency to the subject under inquiry of the questions which the defendant refused to answer. What the subject actually was, therefore, is central to every prosecution under the statute. Where guilt depends so crucially upon such a specific identification of fact, our cases have uniformly held that an indictment must do more than simply repeat the language of the criminal statute. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 765]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\"It is an elementary principle of criminal pleading, that where the definition of an offence, whether it be at common law or by statute, `includes generic terms, it is not sufficient that the indictment shall charge the offence in the same generic terms as in the definition; but it must state the species, - it must descend to particulars.'\" United States v. Cruikshank, \n92 \nU.S. 542, 558\n. An indictment not framed to apprise the defendant \"with reasonable certainty, of the nature of the accusation against him . . . is defective, although it may follow the language of the statute.\" United States v. Simmons, \n96 \nU.S. 360, 362\n. \"In an indictment upon a statute, it is not sufficient to set forth the offence in the words of the statute, unless those words of themselves fully, directly, and expressly, without any uncertainty or ambiguity, set forth all the elements necessary to constitute the offence intended to be punished; . . .\" United States v. Carll, \n105 \nU.S. 611, 612\n. \"Undoubtedly the language of the statute may be used in the general description of an offence, but it must be accompanied with such a statement of the facts and circumstances as will inform the accused of the specific offence, coming under the general description, with which he is charged.\" United States v. Hess, \n124 \nU.S. 483, 487\n. See also Pettibone v. United States, \n148 \nU.S. 197, 202\n-204; Blitz v. United States, \n153 \nU.S. 308, 315\n; Keck v. United States, \n172 \nU.S. 434, 437\n; Morissette v. United States, \n342 \nU.S. 246, 270\n, n. 30. Cf. United States v. Petrillo, \n332 \nU.S. 1, 10\n-11.\n12\n That these basic principles of fundamental \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 766]\n\u00a0\n fairness retain their full vitality under modern concepts of pleading, and specifically under Rule 7 (c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, is illustrated by many recent federal decisions.\n13\n\u00a0\n\n\n The vice which inheres in the failure of an indictment under 2 U.S.C. 192 to identify the subject under inquiry is thus the violation of the basic principle \"that the accused must be apprised by the indictment, with reasonable certainty, of the nature of the accusation against him, . . .\" United States v. Simmons, supra, at 362. A cryptic form of indictment in cases of this kind requires the defendant to go to trial with the chief issue undefined. It enables his conviction to rest on one point and the affirmance of the conviction to rest on another. It gives the prosecution free hand on appeal to fill in the gaps of proof by surmise or conjecture. The Court has had occasion before now to condemn just such a practice in a quite different factual setting. Cole v. Arkansas, \n333 \nU.S. 196, 201\n-202. And the unfairness and uncertainty which have characteristically infected criminal proceedings under this statute which were based upon indictments which failed to specify the subject under inquiry are illustrated by the cases in this Court we have already discussed. The same uncertainty and unfairness are underscored by the records of the cases now before us. A single example will suffice to illustrate the point.\n\nIn No. 12, Price v. United States, the petitioner refused to answer a number of questions put to him by the Internal \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 767]\n\u00a0\n Security Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee. At the beginning of the hearing in question, the Chairman and other subcommittee members made widely meandering statements purporting to identify the subject under inquiry. It was said that the hearings were \"not . . . an attack upon the free press,\" that the investigation was of \"such attempt as may be disclosed on the part of the Communist Party . . . to influence or to subvert the American press.\" It was also said that \"We are simply investigating communism wherever we find it.\" In dealing with a witness who testified shortly before Price, counsel for the subcommittee emphatically denied that it was the subcommittee's purpose \"to investigate Communist infiltration of the press and other forms of communication.\" But when Price was called to testify before the subcommittee no one offered even to attempt to inform him of what subject the subcommittee did have under inquiry. At the trial the Government took the position that the subject under inquiry had been Communist activities generally. The district judge before whom the case was tried found that \"the questions put were pertinent to the matter under inquiry\" without indicating what he thought the subject under inquiry was. The Court of Appeals, in affirming the conviction, likewise omitted to state what it thought the subject under inquiry had been. In this Court the Government contends that the subject under inquiry at the time the petitioner was called to testify was \"Communist activity in news media.\"\n14\n\u00a0\n\nIt is difficult to imagine a case in which an indictment's insufficiency resulted so clearly in the indictment's failure to fulfill its primary office - to inform the defendant of the nature of the accusation against him. Price refused to answer some questions of a Senate subcommittee. He \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 768]\n\u00a0\n was not told at the time what subject the subcommittee was investigating. The prior record of the subcommittee hearings, with which Price may or may not have been familiar, gave a completely confused and inconsistent account of what, if anything, that subject was. Price was put to trial and convicted upon an indictment which did not even purport to inform him in any way of the identity of the topic under subcommittee inquiry. At every stage in the ensuing criminal proceeding Price was met with a different theory, or by no theory at all, as to what the topic had been. Far from informing Price of the nature of the accusation against him, the indictment instead left the prosecution free to roam at large - to shift its theory of criminality so as to take advantage of each passing vicissitude of the trial and appeal. Yet Price could be guilty of no criminal offense unless the questions he refused to answer were in fact pertinent to a specific topic under subcommittee inquiry at the time he was interrogated. Sinclair v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 263\n, at 292.\n\nIt has long been recognized that there is an important corollary purpose to be served by the requirement that an indictment set out \"the specific offence, coming under the general description,\" with which the defendant is charged. This purpose, as defined in United States v. Cruikshank, \n92 \nU.S. 542, 558\n, is \"to inform the court of the facts alleged, so that it may decide whether they are sufficient in law to support a conviction, if one should be had.\"\n15\n This criterion is of the greatest relevance \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 769]\n\u00a0\n here, in the light of the difficulties and uncertainties with which the federal trial and reviewing courts have had to deal in cases arising under 2 U.S.C. 192, to which reference has already been made. See, e. g., Watkins v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 178\n; Deutch v. United States, \n367 \nU.S. 456\n. Viewed in this context, the rule is designed not alone for the protection of the defendant, but for the benefit of the prosecution as well, by making it possible for courts called upon to pass on the validity of convictions under the statute to bring an enlightened judgment to that task. Cf. Watkins v. United States, supra.\n\nIt is argued that any deficiency in the indictments in these cases could have been cured by bills of particulars.\n16\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 770]\n\u00a0\n But it is a settled rule that a bill of particulars cannot save an invalid indictment. See United States v. Norris, \n281 \nU.S. 619, 622\n; United States v. Lattimore, 215 F.2d 847; Babb v. United States, 218 F.2d 538; Steiner v. United States, 229 F.2d 745; United States v. Dierker, 164 F. Supp. 304; 4 Anderson, Wharton's Criminal Law and Procedure, 1870. When Congress provided that no one could be prosecuted under 2 U.S.C. 192 except upon an indictment, Congress made the basic decision that only a grand jury could determine whether a person should be held to answer in a criminal trial for refusing to give testimony pertinent to a question under congressional committee inquiry. A grand jury, in order to make that ultimate determination, must necessarily determine what the question under inquiry was. To allow the prosecutor, or the court, to make a subsequent guess as to what was in the minds of the grand jury at the time they returned the indictment would deprive the defendant of a basic protection which the guaranty of the intervention of a grand jury was designed to secure. For a defendant could then be convicted on the basis of facts not found by, and perhaps not even presented to, the grand jury which indicted him. See Orfield, Criminal Procedure from Arrest to Appeal, 243.\n\nThis underlying principle is reflected by the settled rule in the federal courts that an indictment may not be amended except by resubmission to the grand jury, unless the change is merely a matter of form. Ex parte Bain, \n121 \nU.S. 1\n; United States v. Norris, \n281 \nU.S. 619\n; Stirone v. United States, \n361 \nU.S. 212\n. \"If it lies within the province of a court to change the charging part of an indictment to suit its own notions of what it ought to have been, or what the grand jury would probably have made it if their attention had been called to suggested changes, the great importance which the common law attaches to \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 771]\n\u00a0\n an indictment by a grand jury, as a prerequisite to a prisoner's trial for a crime, and without which the Constitution says `no person shall be held to answer,' may be frittered away until its value is almost destroyed. . . . Any other doctrine would place the rights of the citizen, which were intended to be protected by the constitutional provision, at the mercy or control of the court or prosecuting attorney; for, if it be once held that changes can be made by the consent or the order of the court in the body of the indictment as presented by the grand jury, and the prisoner can be called upon to answer to the indictment as thus changed, the restriction which the Constitution places upon the power of the court, in regard to the prerequisite of an indictment, in reality no longer exists.\" Ex parte Bain, supra, at 10, 13. We reaffirmed this rule only recently, pointing out that \"The very purpose of the requirement that a man be indicted by grand jury is to limit his jeopardy to offenses charged by a group of his fellow citizens acting independently of either prosecuting attorney or judge.\" Stirone v. United States, supra, at 218.\n17\n\u00a0\n\nFor these reasons we conclude that an indictment under 2 U.S.C. 192 must state the question under congressional committee inquiry as found by the grand jury.\n18\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 772]\n\u00a0\n Only then can the federal courts responsibly carry out the duty which Congress imposed upon them more than a century ago:\n\n \"The question must be pertinent to the subject-matter, and that will have to be decided by the courts of justice on the indictment.\"\n19\n\u00a0\n\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the decision of these cases.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN took no part in the consideration or decision of No. 10. Whitman v. United States.\n\nMR.

The other four cases grew out of hearings before the Internal Security Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The indictment in No. 8 is typical:\n\n\"The Grand Jury charges:\n\n   \"INTRODUCTION\n\n\n\n\"On November 17, 1954, in the District of Columbia, a subcommittee of the Committee on Un-American Activities of the House of Representatives was conducting hearings, pursuant to Public Law 601, Section 121, 79th Congress, 2d Session, (60 Stat. 828), and to H. Res. 5, 83d Congress.\n\n\n\"Defendant, Norton Anthony Russell, appeared as a witness before that subcommittee, at the place and on the date above stated, and \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 753]\n\u00a0\n was asked questions which were pertinent to the question then under inquiry. Then and there the defendant unlawfully refused to answer those pertinent questions. The allegations of this introduction are adopted and incorporated into the counts of this indictment which follow, each of which counts will in addition merely describe the question which was asked of the defendant and which he refused to answer.\"\n\n\n (The questions which Russell allegedly refused to answer were then quoted verbatim under separately numbered counts.)\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The motion in No. 9 is typical:\n\n\"The defendant moves that the indictment be dismissed on the following grounds:\n\n\n\"1. The indictment fails to plead the following essential and material elements of the offense:\n\n .   .   .   .   .\n\n\n\n\"c. the nature of the `question then under inquiry' to which the questions addressed to defendant are alleged to be relevant.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] 2 U.S.C. 194 provides:\n\n\"Whenever a witness summoned as mentioned in section 192 of this title fails to appear to testify or fails to produce any books, papers, records, or documents, as required, or whenever any witness so summoned refuses to answer any question pertinent to the subject under inquiry before either House, or any joint committee established by a joint or concurrent resolution of the two Houses of Congress, or any committee or subcommittee of either House of Congress, and the fact of such failure or failures is reported to either House while Congress is in session, or when Congress is not in session, a statement of fact constituting such failure is reported to and filed with the President of the Senate or the Speaker of the House, it shall be the duty of the said President of the Senate or Speaker of the House, as the case \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 754]\n\u00a0\n may be, to certify, and he shall so certify, the statement of facts aforesaid under the seal of the Senate or House, as the case may be, to the appropriate United States attorney, whose duty it shall be to bring the matter before the grand jury for its action.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The question was presented but not reached in Sacher v. United States, \n356 \nU.S. 576\n, where the conviction was reversed on other grounds. The question was also raised in the petition for certiorari in Braden v. United States, \n365 \nU.S. 431\n, but was abandoned when the case was briefed and argued on the merits. Although the question was decided by the lower court in Barenblatt v. United States, 100 U.S. App. D.C. 13, 240 F.2d 875, it was not raised in this Court, \n360 \nU.S. 109\n.\n\nThe Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has passed on the question, holding that the indictment need not set forth the subject under committee inquiry. See Barenblatt v. United States, 100 U.S. App. D.C. 13, 240 F.2d 875; Sacher v. United States, 102 U.S. App. D.C. 264, 252 F.2d 828. Indictments returned in that circuit of course reflect this rule. See cases cited in MR. JUSTICE HARLAN'S dissenting opinion, post, p. 782, n. 2. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit sustained an indictment under 2 U.S.C. 192 which did not set forth the subject under inquiry in United States v. Josephson, 165 F.2d 82. However, Josephson appears to have been substantially limited by the same court in United States v. Lamont, 236 F.2d 312, and indictments under 2 U.S.C. 192 currently being returned in the Second Circuit do in fact set forth the subject under inquiry. See the unreported indictments in United States v. Yarus (D.C. S. D. N. Y.) No. C 152-239 (the opinion acquitting defendant Yarus is reported at 198 F. Supp. 425); United States v. Turoff (D.C. W. D. N. Y.) No. 7539-C (the opinion of the Court of Appeals reversing defendant Turoff's conviction is reported at 291 F.2d 864).\n\nNo other Court of Appeals has passed squarely on the point. In Braden v. United States, 272 F.2d 653, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that the indictment need not explain how and why the questions were pertinent to the subject under inquiry, but did not discuss whether the subject itself had to be specified. In a number of other recent cases arising under 2 U.S.C. 192 the indictments have stated the subject under inquiry. See, in addition \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 755]\n\u00a0\n to the examples cited above, the indictment set forth in United States v. Yellin, 287 F.2d 292, 293, n. 2 (C. A. 7th Cir.); the indictment described in Davis v. United States, 269 F.2d 357, 359 (C. A. 6th Cir.); and the unreported indictment in United States v. Lorch (D.C. S. D. Ohio) Cr. No. 3185 (an indictment arising out of the same series of hearings in which Russell, the petitioner in No. 8, was initially summoned to testify).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] 11 Stat. 155-156. The statute, now 2 U.S.C. 192-194, was enacted to supplement the established contempt power of Congress itself. Jurney v. MacCracken, \n294 \nU.S. 125, 151\n. The specific background of the statute's adoption is sketched in Watkins v. United States, \n354 \nU.S., at 207\n, n. 45. See Cong. Globe, 34th Cong., 3d Sess. 405. See also id., at 403-413, 426-433, 434-445. Except for a basic change in the immunity provisions in 1862, 12 Stat. 333, the legislation has continued substantially unchanged to the present time, with only a slight modification in language in R. S. 102 and 104. The only other amendment in the substantive provisions was made in 1938, 52 Stat. 942, so as to make the statute applicable to joint committees. The provision requiring grand jury indictment has been amended twice since 1857. The original legislation provided for certification only to the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia. In 1936 an amendment was made to permit certification to any United States Attorney, 49 Stat. 2041. In 1938 the provision was amended to bring it into accord with the joint committee amendment of the substantive provisions of the law.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] In the Watkins case the Court's primary concern was not whether pertinency had been proved at the criminal trial, but whether the petitioner had been apprised of the pertinency of the questions at the time he had been called upon to answer them. These two issues \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 760]\n\u00a0\n are, of course, quite different. See Deutch v. United States, \n367 \nU.S., at 467\n-468. But identification of the subject under inquiry is essential to the determination of either issue. See Barenblatt v. United States, \n360 \nU.S., at 123\n-125.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] See I Holdsworth, History of English Law (7th ed. 1956), 321-323; I Pollock and Maitland, History of English Law (2d ed. 1909), 137-155, and Vol. II, pp. 647-653.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] The 1872 statute became Rev. Stat. 1025 and ultimately 18 U.S.C. (1940 ed.) 556. The statute was repealed in the 1948 legislative reorganization of Title 18, 62 Stat. 862, because its substance was contained in Fed. Rules Crim. Proc., 52 (a).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] Rosen v. United States, \n161 \nU.S. 29\n, heavily relied upon in the dissenting opinion, is inapposite. In that case the Court held that an indictment charging the mailing of obscene material did not need to specify the particular portions of the publication which were allegedly obscene. As pointed out in Bartell v. United States, \n227 \nU.S. 427, 431\n, the rule established in Rosen was always regarded as a \"well recognized exception\" to usual indictment rules, applicable only to \"the pleading of printed or written matter which is alleged to be \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 766]\n\u00a0\n too obscene or indecent to be spread upon the records of the court.\" Under Roth v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 476, 488\n-489, the issue dealt with in Rosen would presumably no longer arise.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] United States v. Lamont, 236 F.2d 312; Meer v. United States, 235 F.2d 65; Babb v. United States, 218 F.2d 538; United States v. Simplot, 192 F. Supp. 734; United States v. Devine's Milk Laboratories, Inc., 179 F. Supp. 799; United States v. Apex Distributing Co., 148 F. Supp. 365.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] Brief for the United States, p. 26.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] This principle enunciated in Cruikshank retains undiminished vitality, as several recent cases attest. \"Another reason [for the requirement that every ingredient of the offense charged must be clearly and accurately alleged in the indictment], and one sometimes overlooked, is to enable the court to decide whether the facts alleged are sufficient in law to withstand a motion to dismiss the indictment or to support a conviction in the event that one should be had.\" United States v. Lamont, 18 F. R. D. 27, 31. \"In addition to informing the defendant, another purpose served by the indictment is to \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 769]\n\u00a0\n inform the trial judge what the case involves, so that, as he presides and is called upon to make rulings of all sorts, he may be able to do so intelligently.\" Puttkammer, Administration of Criminal Law, 125-126. See Flying Eagle Publications, Inc., v. United States, 273 F.2d 799; United States v. Goldberg, 225 F.2d 180; United States v. Silverman, 129 F. Supp. 496; United States v. Richman, 190 F. Supp. 889; United States v. Callanan, 113 F. Supp. 766. See 4 Anderson, Wharton's Criminal Law and Procedure, 506; Orfield, Indictment and Information in Federal Criminal Procedure, 13 Syracuse L. Rev. 389, 392. See also Orfield, Criminal Procedure from Arrest to Appeal, 226-230.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] In No. 128, Gojack v. United States, the petitioner filed a timely motion for a bill of particulars, requesting that he be informed of the question under subcommittee inquiry. The motion was denied.\n\nIn No. 9, Shelton v. United States, the petitioner filed a similar motion. The motion was granted, and the Government responded orally as follows:\n\n\"As to the second asking, the Government contends, and the indictment states, that the inquiry being conducted was pursuant to this resolution. We do not feel, and it is not the case, that there was any smaller, more limited inquiry being conducted.\n\n\n\"This committee was conducting the inquiry for the purposes contained in the resolution and no lesser purpose so that, in that sense, the asking No. 2 of counsel will be supplied by his reading the resolution.\"\n\n\n In the four other cases no motions for bills of particulars were filed.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] See also Smith v. United States, \n360 \nU.S. 1, 13\n (dissenting opinion); Comment, 35 Mich. L. Rev. 456.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] The federal perjury statute, 18 U.S.C. 1621, makes it a crime for a person under oath willfully to state or subscribe to \"any material matter which he does not believe to be true.\" The Government, pointing to the analogy between the perjury materiality requirement and the pertinency requirement in 2 U.S.C. 192 recognized in Sinclair v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 263, 298\n, contends that the present cases are controlled by Markham v. United States, \n160 \nU.S. 319\n, where the Court sustained a perjury indictment. But Markham is inapposite. The analogy between the perjury statute and 2 U.S.C. 192, while persuasive for some purposes, is not persuasive here, for the determination of the subject under inquiry does not play the central \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 772]\n\u00a0\n role in a perjury prosecution which it plays under 2 U.S.C. 192. But even were the analogy perfect Markham would still not control, for it holds only that a perjury indictment need not set forth how and why the statements were allegedly material. The Court carefully pointed out that the indictment did in fact reveal the subject under inquiry, stating that \"as [the fourth count of indictment] charged that such statement was material to an inquiry pending before, and within the jurisdiction of, the Commissioner of Pensions; and as the fair import of that count was that the inquiry before the Commissioner had reference to a claim made by the accused under the pension laws, on account of personal injuries received while he was a soldier, and made it necessary to ascertain whether the accused had, since the war or after his discharge from the army, received an injury to the forefinger of his right hand, we think that the fourth count, although unskilfully drawn, sufficiently informed the accused of the matter for which he was indicted, and, therefore, met the requirement that it should set forth the substance of the charge against him.\" \n160 \nU.S., at 325\n-326. (Emphasis added.) This has been equally true of other perjury indictments sustained by the Court. See Hendricks v. United States, \n223 \nU.S. 178\n; United States v. Debrow, \n346 \nU.S. 374\n (the indictment in Debrow is set forth in the opinion of the Court of Appeals, 203 F.2d 699, 702, n. 1).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] See p. 757, supra. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 773]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, concurring.\n\nWhile I join the opinion of the Court, I think it is desirable to point out that in a majority of the six cases that we dispose of today no indictment, however drawn, could in my view be sustained under the requirements of the First Amendment.\n\nThe investigation was concededly an investigation of the press. This was clearly brought out by the record in Shelton, wherein the following colloquy was alleged to have taken place at the commencement of the Subcommittee hearings:\n\n \"Senator Hennings. On the same subject matter. I do believe it is very important at the outset for us to make it abundantly clear, if that is the purpose of counsel, and if it is the purpose of this committee, that this is not in any sense an attack upon the free press of the United States.\n\n\n \"The Chairman. Why, certainly, that is true.\n\n\n \"Senator Hennings. And I think, too, that it should be clear that the best evidence of any subversion or infiltration into any news-dispensing agency or opinion-forming journal is certainly the product itself.\n\n\n \"The Chairman. That is correct.\n\n\n \"Senator Hennings. Of course, the committee is interested in the extent and nature of so-called Communist infiltration, if such exists, into any news-dispensing agency.\n\n\n \"The Chairman. Correct.\n\n\n \"Senator Hennings. But I would like to have the position of the committee, if it be the position of the majority of this committee, since the committee has not met to determine whether one policy or another is to be pursued in the course of these hearings - that it be generally known and understood that this is not \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 774]\n\u00a0\n an attack upon any one newspaper, upon any group of newspapers as such, but an effort on the part of this committee to show such participation and such attempt as may be disclosed on the part of the Communist Party in the United States or elsewhere, indeed, to influence or to subvert the American press.\n\n\n \"And I do think that at some later time, perhaps, it might be appropriate for executives of some of the newspapers under inquiry, whose employees are under inquiry, to be called and to testify and for them to show, if they can show, that the end product, the newspaper itself, has not been influenced by these efforts.\n\n\n \"The Chairman. The Chair thinks that is a very fine and very accurate statement, one with which the Chair certainly agrees, in its entirety.\n\n\n \"We are not singling out any newspaper and not investigating any newspaper or any group of newspapers. We are simply investigating communism wherever we find it,\n*\n and I think that when this series \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 775]\n\u00a0\n of hearing is over that no one can say that any newspaper or any employees of any one newspaper has been singled out.\n\n\n \"Senator Hennings. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\n\n \"Senator Watkins. I would like to say I agree with Senator Hennings' statement, Mr. Chairman.\" R. 72-73.\n\n\n The New York Times was a prime target of the investigation, 30 of the 38 witnesses called at the 1955 executive session and 15 of the 18 called at the 1956 public hearings being present or past employees of that paper.\n\nThe power to investigate is limited to a valid legislative function. Inquiry is precluded where the matter investigated \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 776]\n\u00a0\n is one on which \"no valid legislation\" can be enacted. Kilbourn v. Thompson, \n103 \nU.S. 168, 195\n. Since the First Amendment provides that \"Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom . . . of the press,\" this present investigation was plainly unconstitutional. As we said in Watkins v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 178, 197\n:\n\n\"Clearly, an investigation is subject to the command that the Congress shall make no law abridging freedom of speech or press or assembly. While it is true that there is no statute to be reviewed, and that an investigation is not a law, nevertheless an investigation is part of lawmaking. It is justified solely as an adjunct to the legislative process. The First Amendment may be invoked against infringement of the protected freedoms by law or by lawmaking.\"\n\n\n Under our system of government, I do not see how it is possible for Congress to pass a law saying whom a newspaper or news agency or magazine shall or shall not employ. If this power exists, it can reach the rightist as well as the leftist press, as United States v. Rumely, \n345 \nU.S. 41\n, shows. Whether it is used against the one or the other will depend on the mood of the day. Whenever it is used to ferret out the ideology of those collecting news or writing articles or editorials for the press, it is used unconstitutionally. The theory of our Free Society is that government must be neutral when it comes to the press - whether it be rightist or leftist, orthodox or unorthodox. The theory is that in a community where men's minds are free, all shades of opinion must be immune from governmental inquiry lest we end with regimentation. Congress has no more authority in the field of the press than it does where the pulpit is involved. Since the editorials written and the news printed and the policies advocated by the press are none of the Government's \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 777]\n\u00a0\n business, I see no justification for the Government investigating the capacities, leanings, ideology, qualifications, prejudices or politics of those who collect or write the news. It was conceded on oral argument that Congress would have no power to establish standards of fitness for those who work for the press. It was also conceded that Congress would have no power to prescribe loyalty tests for people who work for the press. Since this investigation can have no legislative basis as far as the press is concerned, what then is its constitutional foundation?\n\nIt is said that Congress has the power to determine the extent of Communist infiltration so that it can know how much tighter the \"security\" laws should be made. This proves too much. It would give Congress a roving power to inquire into fields in which it could not legislate. If Congress can investigate the press to find out if Communists have infiltrated it, it could also investigate the churches for the same reason. Are the pulpits being used to promote the Communist cause? Were any of the clergy ever members of the Communist Party? How about the governing board? How about those who assist the pastor and perhaps help prepare his sermons or do the research? Who comes to the confession and discloses that he or she once was a Communist?\n\nThere is a dictum in United States v. Rumely, \n345 \nU.S. 41, 43\n, that the reach of the investigative power of Congress is measured by the \"informing function of Congress,\" a phrase taken from Woodrow Wilson's Congressional Government (1885), p. 303. But the quotation from Wilson was mutilated, because the sentences which followed his statement that \"The informing function of Congress should be preferred even to its legislative function\" were omitted from the Rumely opinion. Those omitted sentences make abundantly clear that Wilson was speaking, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 778]\n\u00a0\n not of a congressional inquiry roaming at large, but of one that inquired into and discussed the functions and operations of government. Wilson said:\n\n\"The informing function of Congress should be preferred even to its legislative function. The argument is not only that discussed and interrogated administration is the only pure and efficient administration, but, more than that, that the only really self-governing people is that people which discusses and interrogates its administration. The talk on the part of Congress which we sometimes justly condemn is the profitless squabble of words over frivolous bills or selfish party issues. It would be hard to conceive of there being too much talk about the practical concerns and processes of government. Such talk it is which, when earnestly and purposefully conducted, clears the public mind and shapes the demands of public opinion.\" Id., at 303-304.\n\n\n The power to inform is, in my view, no broader than the power to legislate.\n\nCongress has no power to legislate either on \"religion\" or on the \"press.\" If an editor or a minister violates the law, he can be prosecuted. But the investigative power, as I read our Constitution, is barred from certain areas by the First Amendment. If we took the step urged by the prosecution, we would allow Congress to enter the forbidden domain.\n\nThe strength of the \"press\" and the \"church\" is in their freedom. If they pervert or misuse their power, informed opinion will in time render the verdict against them. A paper or pulpit might conceivably become a mouthpiece for Communist ideology. That is typical of the risks a Free Society runs. The alternative is governmental oversight, governmental investigation, governmental questioning, governmental harassment, governmental exposure for \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 779]\n\u00a0\n exposure's sake. Once we crossed that line, we would sacrifice the values of a Free Society for one that has a totalitarian cast.\n\nSome think a certain leeway is necessary or desirable, leaving it to the judiciary to curb what judges may from time to time think are excessive practices. Thus, a judge with a professorial background may put the classroom in a preferred position. One with a background of a prosecutor dealing with \"subversives\" may be less tolerant. When a subjective standard is introduced, the line between constitutional and unconstitutional conduct becomes vague, uncertain, and unpredictable. The rationalization, of course, reduces itself ultimately to the idea that \"the judges know best.\" My idea is and has been that those who put the words of the First Amendment in the form of a command knew best. That is the political theory of government we must sustain until a constitutional amendment is adopted that puts the Congress astride the \"press.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] The Subcommittee in its Report to the Senate Judiciary Committee, S. Rep. No. 131, 85th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 95, stated:\n\n\"The Communists in the United States have their own daily newspaper, the Daily Worker, and control various weekly and monthly periodicals, including Political Affairs and Masses and Mainstream. But those publications are so brazenly slanted that their propaganda value, except for certain elements of the foreign language press in this country, is sharply limited (pts. 28 and 29).\n\n\n\"In order to overcome this disadvantage, and for other reasons, Communists have made vigorous and sustained efforts to infiltrate the American press and radio and to entrench their members in all other forms of mass communications, where, by emphasis or omission of the written or spoken word, it may be turned to the advantage of the conspiracy.\"\n\n\n The Report referred to the ruling of an arbiter in a case where a paper had discharged a \"rewrite man\" because he invoked the Fifth \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 775]\n\u00a0\n Amendment. It said that the following quotations from his opinion were \"of more than passing interest:\"\n\n\"A metropolitan newspaper in America today is more than a mirror to the happenings of the day. It is a moulder of public opinion; capable of leading crusades; capable of introducing new ideas; capable of propagating truth or propaganda as it wills. By its very nature, whether it would abdicate or not, a newspaper maintains a position of leadership and responsibility in this cold war that is vital to our national security. Other industries (atomic energy, defense, et cetera) may be more vital but this fact does not impair the vital role of our press.\n\n\n\"Each worker performs his task in life with tools, and these tools run the gamut from an ax to a zither. The rewrite man has his tools, too. They are words. Words but express ideas and so it follows that the rewrite man works all day with ideas. This is a war of ideas. Can his position then be deemed nonsensitive? A rewrite man can select the facts he considers important as relayed to him by the reporter in the field. His is the choice of the topic sentence and the lead paragraph. His selection of words sets the tone of the article and influences, too, the choice of headline. The conclusion is irresistible that a rewrite man occupies a sensitive position on a newspaper.\" Id., at 97.\n\n\n The Committee concluded, \"Communists have infiltrated mass communications media in the United States, and efforts to increase such infiltration continue.\" Id., at 117.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK, dissenting.\n\nAlthough I have joined Brother HARLAN in dissenting on the grounds ably expressed in his opinion, the Court today so abruptly breaks with the past that I must visually add my voice in protest. The statute under which these cases were prosecuted, 2 U.S.C. 192, was originally passed 105 years ago. Case after case has come here during that period. Still the Court is unable to point to one case - not one - in which there is the remotest suggestion that indictments thereunder must include any of the underlying facts necessary to evaluate the propriety of the unanswered questions. Following the universal art and practice, indictments under this statute have commonly phrased the element of pertinency in the statutory language, i. e., the unanswered question was \"pertinent to the question under inquiry.\" This Court in Sacher v. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 780]\n\u00a0\n United States, \n356 \nU.S. 576\n (1958), had an opportunity to put a stop to this widespread practice but instead reversed on other, rather unsubstantial grounds without even acknowledging that numerous defendants were being denied \"one of the significant protections which the guaranty of a grand jury indictment was intended to confer.\" In requiring these indictments to \"identify the subject which was under inquiry at the time of the defendant's alleged default or refusal to answer,\" the Court has concocted a new and novel doctrine to upset congressional contempt convictions. A rule has been sown which, as pointed out by Brother HARLAN, has no seeds in general indictment law and which will reap no real benefits in congressional contempt cases. If knowing the subject matter under investigation is actually important to these recalcitrant witnesses, they can utilize the right recognized in Watkins v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 178\n (1957), of demanding enlightenment from the questioning body or the time-honored practice of requesting a bill of particulars from the prosecutor. Let us hope that the reasoning of the Court today does not apply to indictments under other criminal statutes, for if it does an uncountable number of indictments will be invalidated. If, however, the rule is only cast at congressional contempt cases, it is manifestly unjust.\n\nBy fastening upon indictment forms under 192 its superficial luminosity requirement the Court creates additional hazards to the successful prosecution of congressional contempt cases, which impair the informing procedures of the Congress by encouraging contumacy before its committees. It was only five years ago in my dissenting opinion in Watkins that I indicated the rule in that case might \"well lead to trial of all contempt cases before the bar . . .\" of the House of Congress affected. Watkins v. United States, supra, at p. 225. In that short period the Court has now upset 10 convictions \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 781]\n\u00a0\n under 192. This continued frustration of the Congress in the use of the judicial process to punish those who are contemptuous of its committees indicates to me that the time may have come for Congress to revert to \"its original practice of utilizing the coercive sanction of contempt proceedings at the bar of the House [affected].\" Id., at 206. Perhaps some simplified method may be found to handle such matters without consuming too much of the time of the full House involved. True, a recalcitrant witness would have to be released at the date of adjournment, but at least contumacious conduct would then receive some punishment. The dignity of the legislative process deserves at least that much sanction.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE CLARK joins, dissenting.\n\nThe ground rules for testing the sufficiency of an indictment are twofold: (1) does the indictment adequately inform the defendant of the nature of the charge he will have to meet; (2) if the defendant is convicted, and later prosecuted again, will a court, under what has been charged, be able to determine the extent to which the defense of double jeopardy is available? United States v. Debrow, \n346 \nU.S. 374\n.\n\nRule 7 (c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, effective in 1946, was of course not intended to abrogate or weaken either of these yardsticks. Its purpose simply was to do away with the subtleties and uncertainties that had characterized criminal pleading at common law. The rule provides in pertinent part:\n\n\"The indictment . . . shall be a plain, concise and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged. . . . It need not contain . . . any other matter not necessary to such statement.\" \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 782]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The rule was \"designed to eliminate technicalities\" and is \"to be construed to secure simplicity in procedure.\" Debrow, at 376.\n\nAn essential element of the offense established by 2 U.S.C. 192\n1\n is that the questions which the defendant refused to answer were \"pertinent to the question under inquiry\" before the inquiring congressional committee. Each of the indictments in these cases charged this element of the offense in the language of the statute, following the practice consistently employed since 1950 in the District of Columbia, where most of the 192 cases have been brought.\n2\n The Court now holds, however, that \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 783]\n\u00a0\n without a statement of the actual subject under inquiry, this allegation was inadequate to satisfy the \"apprisal\" requisite of a valid indictment. At the same time the allegation is found sufficient to satisfy the \"jeopardy\" requisite.\n\nThe Court's holding is contrary to the uniform course of decisions in the lower federal courts. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, sitting first as a panel and later en banc, has upheld \"pertinency\" allegations which, like the present indictment, did not identify the particular subject being investigated. Barenblatt v. United States, 100 U.S. App. D.C. 13, 240 F.2d 875 (panel); Sacher v. United States, 102 U.S. App. D.C. 264, 252 F.2d 828 (en banc).\n3\n The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is of the same view. United States \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 784]\n\u00a0\n v. Josephson, 165 F.2d 82;\n4\n United States v. Lamont, 236 F.2d 312.\n5\n And so, quite evidently, is the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Braden v. United States, 272 F.2d 653.\n6\n No Court of Appeals has held otherwise. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 785]\n\u00a0\n And nothing in this Court's more recent cases could possibly be taken as foreshadowing the decision made today.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nThe reasons given by the Court for its sudden holding, which unless confined to contempt of Congress cases bids fair to throw the federal courts back to an era of criminal pleading from which it was thought they had finally emerged, are novel and unconvincing.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nIt is first argued that an allegation of \"pertinency\" in the statutory terms will not do, because that element is at \"the very core of criminality\" under 192. This is said to follow from what \"our cases have uniformly held.\" Ante, p. 764. I do not so understand the cases on which the Court relies. It will suffice to examine the three cases from which quotations have been culled. Ante, pp. 765-766.\n\nUnited States v. Cruikshank, \n92 \nU.S. 542\n, involved an indictment under the Enforcement Act of 1870 (16 Stat. 140) making it a felony to conspire to prevent any person from exercising and enjoying \"any right or privilege granted or secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\" Most of the counts were dismissed on the ground that they stated no federal offense whatever. The remainder were held inadequate from the standpoint of \"apprisal,\" in that they simply alleged a conspiracy to prevent certain citizens from enjoying rights \"granted and secured to them by the constitution and laws of the United States,\" such rights not being otherwise described or identified. Small wonder that these opaque allegations drew from the Court the comment \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 786]\n\u00a0\n that the indictment \"`must descend to particulars.'\" Id., at 558. Indeed, the Court observed: \"According to the view we take of these counts, the question is not whether it is enough, in general, to describe a statutory offence in the language of the statute, but whether the offence has here been described at all.\" Id., at 557. (Emphasis supplied.)\n\nUnited States v. Simmons, \n96 \nU.S. 360\n, was concerned with an indictment involving illegal distilling. Revised Statutes 3266 made it an offense to distill spirits on premises where vinegar \"is\" manufactured. One count of the indictment charged the defendant with causing equipment on premises where vinegar \"was\" manufactured to be used for distilling. This count was dismissed for its failure (1) to identify the person who had so used the equipment or to allege that his identity was unknown to the grand jurors; and (2) to allege that the distilling and manufacture of vinegar were coincidental, as required by the statute.\n8\n What is more significant from the standpoint of the present cases is that in sustaining another count of the indictment charging the defendant with engaging in the business of distilling \"with the intent to defraud the United States of the tax\" on the spirits (R. S. 3281), the Court held that it was not necessary to allege \"the particular means by which the United States was to be defrauded of the tax.\" Id., at 364. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 787]\n\u00a0\n\n\nUnited States v. Carll, \n105 \nU.S. 611\n, held no more than that an indictment charging forgery was insufficient for failure to allege scienter, which, though not expressly required by the statute, the Court found to be a necessary element of the crime. Hence a charge in the statutory language would not suffice. Section 192 of course contains no such gap in its provisions. What the Court now requires of these indictments under 192 involves not the supplying of a missing element of the crime, but the addition of the particulars of an element already clearly alleged.\n\nTo me it seems quite clear that even under these cases, decided long before Rule 7 (c) came into being, the \"pertinency\" allegations of the present indictments would have been deemed sufficient. Other early cases indicate the same thing. See, e. g., United States v. Mills, 7 Pet. 138, 142; Evans v. United States, \n153 \nU.S. 584, 587\n;\n9\n Markham v. United States, \n160 \nU.S. 319, 325\n;\n10\n Bartell \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 788]\n\u00a0\n v. United States, \n227 \nU.S. 427, 433\n-434.\n11\n I think there can be no doubt about the matter after Rule 7 (c).\n\nIn United States v. Debrow, supra, the Court in reversing the dismissal of perjury indictments which had gone on the ground that they had not alleged the name or authority of the persons administering the oath, said (\n346 \nU.S., at 376\n-378):\n\n \"The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure were designed to eliminate technicalities in criminal pleading and are to be construed to secure simplicity in procedure.\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"The charges of the indictments followed substantially the wording of the statute, which embodies all the elements of the crime, and such charges clearly informed the defendants of that with which they \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 789]\n\u00a0\n were accused, so as to enable them to prepare their defense and to plead the judgment in bar of any further prosecutions for the same offense. It is inconceivable to us how the defendants could possibly be misled as to the offense with which they stood charged. The sufficiency of the indictment is not a question of whether it could have been more definite and certain. If the defendants wanted more definite information as to the name of the person who administered the oath to them, they could have obtained it by requesting a bill of particulars. Rule 7 (f), F. R. Crim. Proc.\" (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n It is likewise \"inconceivable\" to me how the indictments in the present cases can be deemed insufficient to advise these petitioners of the nature of the charge they would have to meet. The indictments gave them the name of the committee before which they had appeared; the place and the dates of their appearances; the references to the enabling legislation under which the committee acted; and the questions which the petitioners refused to answer. The subject matter of the investigations had been stated to the petitioners at the time of their appearances before the committees. And the committee transcripts of the hearings were presumably in their possession and, if not, were of course available to them.\n\nGranting all that the Court says about the crucial character of pertinency as an element of this offense, it is surely not more so than the element of premeditation in the crime of first degree murder. If from the standpoint of \"apprisal\" it is necessary to particularize \"pertinency\" in a 192 indictment, it should follow, a fortiori, that, contrary to what is prescribed in Forms 1 and 2 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, a first degree murder indictment should particularize \"premeditation.\" \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 790]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nThe Court says that its holding is needed to prevent the Government from switching on appeal, to the prejudice of the defendants, to a different theory of pertinency from that on which the conviction may have rested. Ante, pp. 766-768. There are several good answers to this.\n\nTo the extent that this fear relates to the subject under investigation, the Government cannot of course travel outside the confines of the trial record, of which the defendant has full knowledge. If what is meant is that the Government may not modify on appeal its \"trial\" view of the \"connective reasoning\" (supra, p. 784, note 6) relied on to establish the germaneness of the questions asked to the subject matter of the inquiry, surely it would be free to do so, this aspect of pertinency being simply a matter of law, Sinclair v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 263, 299\n. Moreover the Court does not find these indictments deficient because they failed to allege the \"connective reasoning.\"\n\nBeyond these considerations, a defendant has ample means for protecting himself in this regard. By objecting at the committee hearing to the pertinency of any question asked him he may \"freeze\" this issue, since the Government's case on this score must then stand or fall on the pertinency explanation given by the committee in response to such an objection. Deutch v. United States, \n367 \nU.S. 456, 472\n-473 (dissenting opinion); cf. Watkins v. United States, supra, at 214-215; Barenblatt v. United States, \n360 \nU.S. 109, 123\n-125. If he has failed to make a pertinency objection at the committee hearing, thereby leaving the issue \"at large\" for the trial (Deutch, ibid.), he may still seek a particularization through a bill of particulars. Cf. United States v. Kamin, 136 F. Supp. 791, 795 n. 4. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 791]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt should be noted that no pertinency objection was made by any of these petitioners at the committee hearings. Further, no motions for a bill of particulars were made in No. 12, Price, to which the Court especially addresses itself (ante, pp. 766-768), or in No. 8, Russell, No. 10, Whitman, and No. 11, Liveright. In No. 9, Shelton, and No. 128, Gojack, such motions were made. However, no appeal was taken from the denial of the motion in Gojack, and in Shelton the sufficiency of the particulars furnished by the Government was not questioned either by a motion for a further bill or on appeal.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nReferring to certain language in the Cruikshank case, supra, the Court suggests that the present holding is supported by a further \"important corollary purpose\" which an indictment is intended to serve: to make \"it possible for courts called upon to pass on the validity of convictions under the statute to bring an enlightened judgment to that task.\" Ante, pp. 768, 769.\n\nBut whether or not the Government has established its case on \"pertinency\" is something that must be determined on the record made at the trial, not upon the allegations of the indictment. There is no such thing as a motion for summary judgment in a criminal case. While appellate courts might be spared some of the tedium of going through these 192 records were the allegations of indictments to spell out the \"pertinency\" facts, the Court elsewhere in its opinion recognizes that the issue at hand can hardly be judged in terms of whether fuller indictments \"would simplify the courts' task.\" Ante, p. 760.\n\nThe broad language in Cruikshank on which the Court relies cannot properly be taken as meaning more than that an indictment must set forth enough to enable a court to determine whether a criminal offense over which \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 792]\n\u00a0\n the court has jurisdiction has been alleged. Cf. McClintock, Indictment by a Grand Jury, 26 Minn. L. Rev. 153, 159-160 (1942); Orfield, Criminal Procedure from Arrest to Appeal, 222-226, 227 n. 107.\n12\n Certainly the allegations of these indictments meet such requirements.\n\n\nIV.\n\n\n\nThe final point made by the Court is perhaps the most novel of all. It is said that a statement of the subject under inquiry is necessary in the indictment in order to fend against the possibility that a defendant may be convicted on a theory of pertinency based upon a subject under investigation different from that which may have been found by the grand jury. An argument similar to this was rejected by this Court many years ago in Rosen v. United States, \n161 \nU.S. 29, 34\n, where an indictment charging the defendant with mailing obscene matter, only generally described, was upheld over strong dissent (id., at 45-51) asserting that the accused was entitled to know the particular parts of the material which the grand jury had deemed obscene.\n13\n\u00a0\n\nThis proposition is also certainly unsound on principle. In the last analysis it would mean that a prosecutor could not safely introduce or advocate at a trial evidence or theories, however relevant to the crime charged in the indictment, which he had not presented to the grand jury. Such cases as Ex parte Bain, \n121 \nU.S. 1\n, United States v. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 793]\n\u00a0\n Norris, \n281 \nU.S. 619\n, and Stirone v. United States, \n361 \nU.S. 212\n, lend no support to the Court's thesis. They held only that, consistently with the Fifth Amendment, a trial judge could not amend the indictment itself, either by striking or adding material language, or, amounting to the latter, by permitting a conviction on evidence or theories not fairly embraced in the charges made in the indictment. To allow this would in effect permit a defendant to be put to trial upon an indictment found not by a grand jury but by a judge.\n14\n\u00a0\n\nIf the Court's reasoning in this part of its opinion is sound, I can see no escape from the conclusion that a defendant convicted on a lesser included offense, not alleged by the grand jury in an indictment for the greater offense, would have a good plea in arrest of judgment. (Fed. Rules Crim. Proc., 34.)\n\nIn conclusion, I realize that one in dissent is sometimes prone to overdraw the impact of a decision with which he does not agree. Yet I am unable to rid myself of the view that the reversal of these convictions on such insubstantial grounds will serve to encourage recalcitrance to legitimate congressional inquiry, stemming from the belief that a refusal to answer may somehow be requited in this Court. And it is not apparent how the seeds which this decision plants in other fields of criminal pleading can well be prevented from sprouting. What is done today calls \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 794]\n\u00a0\n to mind the trenchant observation made by Mr. Justice Holmes many years ago in Paraiso v. United States, \n207 \nU.S. 368, 372\n:\n\n\"The bill of rights for the Philippines giving the accused the right to demand the nature and cause of the accusation against him does not fasten forever upon those islands the inability of the seventeenth century common law to understand or accept a pleading that did not exclude every misinterpretation capable of occurring to intelligence fired with a desire to pervert.\"\n\n\n No more so does the Bill of Rights of the United States Constitution \"fasten\" on this country these primitive notions of the common law.\n\nOn the merits these convictions are of course squarely ruled against the petitioners by principles discussed in our recent decisions in the Barenblatt, Wilkinson, and Braden\n15\n cases, as was all but acknowledged at the bar.\n\nI would affirm.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"Every person who having been summoned as a witness by the authority of either House of Congress to give testimony or to produce papers upon any matter under inquiry before either House, or any joint committee established by a joint or concurrent resolution of the two Houses of Congress, or any committee of either House of Congress, willfully makes default, or who, having appeared, refuses to answer any question pertinent to the question under inquiry, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000 nor less than $100 and imprisonment in a common jail for not less than one month nor more than twelve months.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] [The following abbreviations have been used to indicate where the indictment may be found: TR, the transcript of the record in this Court; JA, the joint appendix in the Court of Appeals; Cr.

No. 1743-50).\n\nFor a short period after Rule 7 (c), Fed. Rules Crim. Proc., came into effect in 1946, vestiges of common-law pleading continued to be found in some, but not all, 192 indictments. Compare United States v. Fleischman, \n339 \nU.S. 349\n (TR, pp. 2-3), with United States v. Bryan, \n339 \nU.S. 323\n (TR, p. 2A). By 1950, however, all such indictments had come to be in statutory form.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Four judges dissented on other grounds.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The record on appeal shows that one of the grounds of attack was the indictment's failure to allege \"the nature of any matter under inquiry before said Committee.\" Record on Appeal in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, No. 91, Doc. 20790, p. 7.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] This case evinces no purpose to depart from Josephson. The District Court, although dismissing the indictment on other grounds, quite evidently found the statutory \"pertinency\" allegation sufficient. 18 F. R. D., at 30, 37. And in affirming, the Court of Appeals, citing the Josephson case among others, stated that \"the result might well be different\" had the authority of the investigating committee appeared in the indictment. 236 F.2d, at 316 (note 6). (The committee in Lamont was a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Government Operations whose enabling legislation the court found did not authorize investigation of \"subversive activities.\") As regards the issue decided in the present cases, the following observations by Chief Judge Clark, who speaks with special authority in procedural matters, are significant (id., at 317):\n\n\"Pleading, either civil or criminal, should be a practical thing. Its purpose is to convey information succinctly and concisely. In older days the tendency was to defeat this purpose by overelaboration and formalism. Now we should avoid the opposite trend, but of like consequence, that of a formalism of generality. There seems to be some tendency to confuse general pleadings with entire absence of statement of claim or charge. [Footnote omitted.] But this is a mistake, for general pleadings, far from omitting a claim or charge, do convey information to the intelligent and sophisticated circle for which they are designed. Thus the charge that at a certain time and place `John Doe with premeditation shot and murdered John Roe,' F. R. Cr. P., Form 2, even though of comparatively few words, has made clear the offense it is bringing before the court. [Footnote omitted.] The present indictments, however, do not show the basis upon which eventual conviction can be had; rather, read in the light of the background of facts and Congressional action, they show that conviction cannot be had.\" (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] That case was concerned with the \"connective reasoning\" aspect of \"pertinency,\" Watkins v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 178, 214\n-215, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 785]\n\u00a0\n rather than the \"subject under inquiry\" aspect; but it is not perceived how this can be thought to make a difference in principle.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] This is not the first opportunity the Court has had to consider the matter. Ante, p. 754, note 7.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] The Court stated (id., at 362):\n\n\"Where the offence is purely statutory . . . it is, `as a general rule, sufficient in the indictment to charge the defendant with acts coming fully within the statutory description, in the substantial words of the statute, without any further expansion of the matter.' 1 Bishop, Crim. Proc., sect. 611, and authorities there cited. But to this general rule there is the qualification, fundamental in the law of criminal procedure, that the accused must be apprised by the indictment, with reasonable certainty, of the nature of the accusation against him . . . . An indictment not so framed is defective, although it may follow the language of the statute.\" (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] The Mills and Evans cases suggest that a more lenient rule of pleading applies in misdemeanor than in felony cases. Although that distinction seems to have disappeared in the later cases, it may be noted that 192 in terms makes this offense a misdemeanor. Note 1, supra.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] In that case the Court spoke, doubtless by way of dictum, concerning the method of pleading \"materiality\" in a perjury indictment (an element akin to \"pertinency\" under 192, Sinclair v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 263, 298\n):\n\n\"It was not necessary that the indictment should set forth all the details or facts involved in the issue as to materiality of [the false] statement . . . . In 2 Chittey's Criminal Law, 307, the author says: `It is undoubtedly necessary that it should appear on the face of the indictment that the false allegations were material to the matter in issue. But it is not requisite to set forth all the circumstances which render them material; the simple averment that they were so, will suffice.' In King v. Dowlin . . . Lord Kenyon said that it had always been adjudged to be sufficient in an indictment for perjury, to allege generally that the particular question became a material question. . . .\" \n160 \nU.S., at 325\n.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] There, under an exception, prevailing in \"obscenity\" cases, to the then general rule that in \"documentary\" crimes the contents of the document must be set forth in the indictment, the Court in sustaining an indictment charging the unlawful mailing of an \"indecent\" letter, only generally described, said (id., at 433-434):\n\n\"The present indictment specifically charged that the accused had knowingly violated the laws of the United States by depositing on a day named, in the post-office specifically named, a letter of such indecent character as to render it unfit to be set forth in detail, enclosed in an envelope bearing a definite address. In the absence of a demand for a bill of particulars we think this description sufficiently advised the accused of the nature and cause of the accusation against him. This fact is made more evident when it is found that this record shows no surprise to the accused in the production of the letter at the trial . . . .\"\n\n\n The Court suggests that Bartell and Rosen v. United States (infra, p. 792) are inapposite because of the special rule of pleading applicable in \"obscenity\" cases. Ante, p. 765. However, considering that the \"apprisal\" requisite of an indictment arises from constitutional requirements, this factor far from lessening the weight of these two cases adds to their authority.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] The other cases and commentaries referred to by the Court in Note 15, ante, pp. 768-769, indicate nothing different.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] It seems clear that the Court proceeded on the premise that the \"isolated excerpt\" rule of Regina v. Hicklin, 1868. L. R. 3 Q. B. 360, recently rejected in Roth v. United States, \n354 \nU.S. 476, 488\n-489, in favor of the \"whole book\" rule, obtained, for the Court relied on United States v. Bennett, 24 Fed. Cas. 1093 (16 Blatchford 338), where the \"excerpt\" test was applied.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] While the \"connective reasoning\" aspect of \"pertinency\" is again evidently not involved in the Court's reasoning, it is appropriate to note that it is scarcely realistic to consider that issue of law as one on which the grand jury has exercised an independent judgment in determining whether an indictment should be returned. For that body may be expected, quite naturally and properly, to follow the District Attorney's advice on this score, as with any other matter of law. That the legal premises on which the grand jury acted in this respect may turn out to have been wrong could hardly vitiate the indictment itself.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] \n360 \nU.S. 109\n; \n365 \nU.S. 399\n; \n365 \nU.S. 431\n. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 749, 795]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","166":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSALEM v. UNITED STATES LINES CO.(1962)\nNo. 283\nArgued: March 19, 1962Decided: May 28, 1962\n\n\n\n\n1. \nIn this suit under the Jones Act based on unseaworthiness and negligence, seeking damages for personal injuries sustained by a seaman who fell as he went to his post in the crow's nest, held: It was error for the Court of Appeals to order a new trial on the ground that a jury could not determine, in the absence of supporting testimony by an expert in naval architecture, a claim that the shipowner had failed to equip the ship with necessary and feasible safety devices to prevent such a mishap. Pp. 31-37.\n\n2. \nThe evidence in this record provides no support for the trial court's award to the seaman of future maintenance for three years. Pp. 37-38.\n\n 293 F.2d 121, affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n\nRobert Klonsky argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs was Philip F. Di Costanzo.\n\nWalter X. Connor argued the cause and filed briefs for respondent.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe first question to be decided in this seaman's personal injury suit for damages on the grounds of unseaworthiness and negligence under the Jones Act\n1\n is whether the jury should have been allowed to determine, in the absence of supporting testimony by an expert in naval architecture, a claim that the shipowner failed to equip his ship with necessary and feasible safety devices to prevent the mishap which befell the seaman.\n\nThe trial judge submitted for the jury's determination various bases of respondent's alleged liability, including \n\n[370 \nU.S. 31, 32]\n\u00a0\n the claim resting on the failure to provide certain safety devices. Because the jury returned a general verdict for the seaman, it cannot be said what basis of liability the jury found to exist. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Judge Smith dissenting, reversed and remanded for a new trial, holding that in the absence of expert evidence, it was error to have allowed the jury to consider the failure to provide safety devices. 293 F.2d 121, 123-124. Since the question whether supporting expert testimony is needed is important in litigation of this type, we granted certiorari. \n368 \nU.S. 811\n. We hold that the Court of Appeals erred.\n\nPetitioner was a lookout on the S. S. United States. He was injured as he moved from a ladder to a platform leading to his post in the crow's-nest. The crow's-nest was housed in a \"bubble\" half way up a hollow aluminum radar tower which rose 65 feet from the bridge deck. The ladder extended the full height of the tower along the inside of its after side. At various levels inside the tower were horizontal platforms, at the after ends of which were access openings slightly larger than manholes, through which the ladder passed straight up. The tower was more than six feet from fore to aft at the crow's-nest level, and tapered from four to three feet in width. There was only a narrow ledge around three-quarters of the opening in the platform at that level; the platform proper was toward the bow, and led to the door in the crow's-nest. As a seaman climbed the ladder to the crow's-nest, he faced astern until his feet were approximately level with the platform. To get from the ladder to the platform proper, he had to pivot, putting one foot on the starboard or port ledge, follow it with the other foot, complete his pivot and step forward along the ledge to the platform proper. Although the respondent describes the crow's-nest and its approach as \"purposely constructed \n\n[370 \nU.S. 31, 33]\n\u00a0\n so as to provide maximum protection and safety for members of the crew having to use it,\" there were no devices intended to facilitate safe maneuvering from ladder to platform; for support during this maneuver, the seaman could grasp one of the thin vertical beams located at intervals along the port and starboard sides, or a vertical, bulky rectangular pipe enclosing a radar cable and near the starboard side, or a horizontal stiffener or ledging that ran at shoulder-height around the tower. Respondent argues that the seaman also could simply spread his arms to brace himself against the sides of the tower.\n\nOn the night of February 15-16, 1958, as the United States went at high speed and rolled in rough seas, the tower was plunged into darkness, just as the petitioner was executing the movement to the crow's-nest platform from the ladder. Illumination within the tower was provided by five electric lights at various levels, but these burned out frequently. Two had been out for a long period and two others had gone out a few hours before the accident, leaving as the only light that which was at the crow's-nest platform. At some point after petitioner had begun the maneuver from ladder to platform, but before he reached a place on the platform proper and away from the access opening, that last light went out. An instant later petitioner fell backwards across the opening and struck his head against the ladder and his lower back against the fore edge of the opening, leaving his body suspended in the opening. He grasped the ladder rungs and called for help from the lookout on duty in the crow's-nest. With the lookout's aid he was able to seat himself on the starboard ledge with his legs hanging down through the opening and his right arm around the cable pipe. The lookout returned to the crow's-nest to phone the bridge for help. In his absence the petitioner became dizzy and fell through the opening to a place eight feet below the platform. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 31, 34]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe only issue before us on this phase of the case is whether the trial judge erred in instructing the jury that they might find the respondent liable for unseaworthiness or negligence for having failed to provide \"railings or other safety devices\" at the crow's-nest platform. The Court of Appeals held that it was error to submit that question to the jury because \"There was no expert testimony that proper marine architecture required the additional provision of railings or other safety devices on such a ladder or platform enclosed within a tower leading to a crow's nest. Should the jury, under these conditions, have been permitted to decide whether proper marine architecture required railings or other safety devices? In two recent cases, this court has held that a jury should not be permitted to speculate on such matters in the absence of expert evidence.\"\n2\n 293 F.2d, at 123. There was evidence, in the form of testimony and photographs, from which the jury might clearly see the construction at the \n\n[370 \nU.S. 31, 35]\n\u00a0\n crow's-nest level which we have described. If the holding of the Court of Appeals is only that in this case there are peculiar fact circumstances which made it impossible for a jury to decide intelligently, we are not told what those circumstances are, and our examination of the record discloses none.\n3\n If the holding is that claims which might be said to touch upon naval architecture can never succeed without expert evidence, neither the Court of Appeals nor the respondent refers us to authority or reason for any such broad proposition.\n\nThis is not one of the rare causes of action in which the law predicates recovery upon expert testimony. See Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed. 1940), 2090, 2090a. Rather, the general rule is as stated by Mr. Justice Van Devanter, when circuit judge, that expert testimony not only is unnecessary but indeed may properly be excluded in the discretion of the trial judge \"if all the primary facts can be accurately and intelligibly described to the jury, and if they, as men of common understanding, are as capable of comprehending the primary facts and of drawing correct conclusions from them as are witnesses possessed of special or peculiar training, experience, or observation in respect of the subject under investigation . . . .\" United States Smelting Co. v. Parry, 166 F. 407, 411, 415. Furthermore, the trial judge has broad discretion in the matter of the admission or exclusion of expert evidence, and his action is to be sustained unless manifestly erroneous. Spring Co. v. Edgar, \n99 \nU.S. 645, 658\n.\n\nThis Court has held, in a factual context similar to this, that there was no error, let alone manifest error, in having a jury decide without the aid of experts. Spokane & Inland Empire R. Co. v. United States, \n241 \nU.S. 344\n, \n\n[370 \nU.S. 31, 36]\n\u00a0\n was an action by the United States to recover penalties for violation of the Safety Appliance Act provision requiring handholds or grab-irons to be placed on the ends of railroad cars used in interstate commerce.\n4\n The defendant railroad offered expert testimony to establish that the substitutes provided on its cars would accomplish the statute's purposes. The jury had inspected the cars, and the expert evidence was excluded when the United States objected that this \"was a matter of common knowledge.\" We held that \"the court was clearly right in holding that the question was not one for experts and that the jury after hearing the testimony and inspecting the [cars] were competent to determine the issue . . . .\" \n241 \nU.S., at 351\n.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nIn sum, we agree with Judge Smith in dissent below:\n\n \"There was before the jury sufficient evidence, both  from oral testimony and from photographs, for it to  visualize the platform on and from which plaintiff  fell and to determine whether some railing or hand  hold in addition to the structures present was reasonably  necessary for the protection of a seaman passing  from the ladder to the platform in the swaying mast.\n\n\n  \". . . [There is no] blanket proposition that any  and all theories of negligence and\/or unseaworthiness  which might touch on the broad field of `naval architecture'  may be properly submitted to a jury only if  supported by expert testimony. Here the potential  danger was fairly obvious and a jury should be perfectly  competent to decide whether the handholds  furnished were sufficient to discharge the owner's \n\n[370 \nU.S. 31, 37]\n\u00a0\n  duty to provide his seamen with a safe place to work.  Such a determination hardly requires expert knowledge  of naval architecture . . . .\" 293 F.2d, at 126.\n\n\n Indeed, \"if there was a reason hidden from the ordinary mind why this condition of things must have existed, those facts called upon the defendant to make that reason known. Missouri, K. & T. R. Co. v. Williams, 103 Tex. 228, 231, 125 S. W. 881, 882; and see Poignant v. United States, 225 F.2d 595, 602 (concurring opinion).\n6\n\u00a0\n\nThere is another question to be decided. The petitioner also sought maintenance and cure. The trial judge awarded past maintenance, which the respondent has not disputed, and also future maintenance for three years. The Court of Appeals set aside the award of future maintenance, saying: \"There does not appear to be any sufficient basis, by opinion evidence or otherwise, for the finding that three years is the period reasonably to be \n\n[370 \nU.S. 31, 38]\n\u00a0\n expected for Salem to reach maximum improvement.\" 293 F.2d, at 125. The trial judge made no findings. We have therefore examined the evidence on the question in the light of what was said in Calmar S. S. Corp. v. Taylor, \n303 \nU.S. 525, 531\n-532: \". . . [A]mounts [for future maintenance should be such] as may be needful in the immediate future for the maintenance and cure of a kind and for a period which can be definitely ascertained.\" We agree that the evidence provides no support under that test for the award of three years' future maintenance.\n\nWe affirm as respects maintenance but otherwise reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. Since other grounds of reversal urged by the respondent were not reached by that court, the case is remanded to it for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n\n    It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the decision of this case.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 41 Stat. 1007, 46 U.S.C. 688.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The majority quoted from Martin v. United Fruit Co., 272 F.2d 347, as follows: \"`Finally, we reject the plaintiff's contention that the trial court committed error in not permitting the jury to determine whether the placement of the hinge at the bottom of the deadlight was an improper method of ship construction so as to make the vessel unseaworthy. Surely this is a technical matter in which an expert knowledge of nautical architecture is required in order to form an intelligent judgment. Since no expert testimony was introduced, it was correct to exclude this matter from the jury's consideration.'\" 293 F.2d, at 123. The majority also quoted from Fatovic v. Nederlandsch-Ameridaansche Stoomvaart, Maatschappij, 275 F.2d 188, in which the question was whether a stopping arrangement could feasibly be made part of a ten-and-a-half boom to keep it from swinging freely: \"`In any event, the question was one of nautical architecture about which jurors lack the knowledge to form an intelligent judgment in the absence of expert testimony. Martin . . . . Since there was no expert testimony on the matter, it should not have been submitted to the jury.'\" 293 F.2d, at 123-124. Whatever may have required that the jury have the aid of expert testimony in those cases, no showing is made of the necessity here.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Compare Texas & Pacific R. Co. v. Watson, \n190 \nU.S. 287, 290\n, in which there may have been peculiar difficulties impeding installation of any truly effective safety device.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] 27 Stat. 531, 45 U.S.C. 4.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Although it was later held that the Safety Appliance Act has no room for the doctrine of equivalent, substitute devices, St. Joseph & Grand Island R.

Kellogg, \n94 \nU.S. 469, 472\n, if the matter is only arguably beyond common experience, expert testimony will be admitted with care. The rule reflects the consideration of avoidance of unnecessarily prolonged trials and attendant expense and confusion. Winans v. New York & Erie R. Co., 21 How. 88, 100-101; and see Thorn v. Worthing Skating Rink Co. (1876), reported in Plimpton v. Spiller, 6 Ch. D. 412, footnote at 415-418 (1877).\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, dissenting in part and concurring in part.\n\nI do not read the Court of Appeals' opinion either as holding that, because of \"peculiar fact circumstances\" petitioner's claims respecting the alleged faulty construction of the radar tower required \"supporting expert testimony\" (ante, pp. 35, 32) (emphasis added), or as establishing a general proposition that such testimony is needed in every instance where a seaman claims to have been injured because of his employer's failure to equip a ship with safety devices. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 31, 39]\n\u00a0\n\n\nTaking its opinion in light of the record, I think it apparent that the Court of Appeals held no more than that reversal was required because \"there was no evidence of any kind in the record to support the view that railings or other safety devices could feasibly be constructed, or that failure to provide them constituted negligence or made the ship unseaworthy.\" 293 F.2d, at 123. (Emphasis added.) To me it seems clear that the court referred to expert testimony simply as an example of the kind of evidence that the petitioner might have offered on this score. Consequently, the District Court's charge that the jury could find the respondent negligent \"in failing to provide railings or other safety devices\" had injected into the case a theory of liability which had not been presented to the jury by the evidence introduced at the trial. This has uniformly been held to constitute reversible error. E. g., Mandel v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 291 F.2d 433; Smith v. Ellerman Lines, Ltd., 247 F.2d 761, 766; see Wilmington Star Mining Co. v. Fulton, \n205 \nU.S. 60, 78\n-79.\n\nThe trial transcript, insofar as it has been reproduced in the record before this Court, bears out the conclusion of the Court of Appeals that evidence with respect to the alleged failure to maintain appropriate safety devices was entirely lacking. Petitioner's evidence, apart from medical testimony concerning the extent of his injuries, related almost entirely to the alleged slippery condition of the platform leading to the crow's-nest, the inadequate and defective lighting, and the negligence of the lookout. Petitioner himself did testify that there was no \"grip\" or \"handrails\" at the crow's-nest level, and photographs that were introduced into evidence confirmed this undisputed assertion.\n\nWith nothing more before the jury than this, the trial court's instruction certainly left the jury entirely at large \n\n[370 \nU.S. 31, 40]\n\u00a0\n to reach an uninformed conclusion as to what would have constituted reasonable conduct on the part of the respondent with respect to the equipping of this part of the ship. No evidence of any kind was introduced to show whether radar towers on vessels of this sort ordinarily were equipped with safety devices or whether seamen assigned thereto had need of such equipment in the ordinary course of their activities. Expert testimony would have served this purpose, as would any other evidence bearing probatively on the reasonableness of respondent's conduct in failing to equip its vessel with these devices. In the absence of any such evidence the Court of Appeals was entirely justified in holding that the District Court's instruction amounted to reversible error.\n\nI agree with this Court's holding as to future maintenance. I would affirm. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 31, 41]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","167":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSCHOLLE v. HARE(1962)\nNo. 22\nArgued: Decided: April 23, 1962\n\n\n\n\n Appellant petitioned the Supreme Court of Michigan for a writ of mandamus to restrain appellees from conducting a state senatorial election in accordance with a 1952 amendment to the State Constitution providing for the election of each Senator from a district geographically described in the amendment and not subject to change because of fluctuations in the population. He claimed that the amendment denied him equal protection of the laws and due process of law contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment. The State Supreme Court dismissed the petition.

JUSTICE STEWART, concurring.\n\nIf we were able to read the several opinions in the Michigan Supreme Court the way our Brother HARLAN does, we would find much to persuade us that this case should not be remanded. But the state court opinions are not that clear to us. A careful reading of the opinions leaves us with the fixed impression that all but three members of the Michigan court were convinced that, whatever the underlying merits of the appellant's Equal Protection claim, it was, in the words of one of the justices, \"not enforcible in the courts.\" 360 Mich. 1, 112, 104 N. W. 2d 63, 121. In Baker v. Carr we held that such a claim is judicially cognizable. Accordingly, we join in the Court's order remanding this case to the Supreme Court of Michigan.\n\nThe present order of course reflects no views on the merits of the appellant's Equal Protection claim. It may well turn out that the assertion of invidious discrimination is not borne out by the record. Today's order simply reflects our belief that the Michigan Supreme Court should be the first to consider the merits of the federal constitutional claim, free from any doubts as to its justiciability.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, dissenting.\n\nThe Court remands this case to the Supreme Court of Michigan \"for further consideration in the light of Baker v. Carr, \n369 \nU.S. 186\n.\" In my opinion nothing decided or said by the majority in Baker casts any light upon, still less controls, the only issue actually adjudicated by the Michigan Supreme Court in the present case. I think that either this appeal should be dismissed for want of a substantial federal question or probable jurisdiction should be noted and the case set for argument. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 429, 431]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe sole and dispositive question decided by the Michigan Supreme Court was concisely put by Justice Edwards, speaking for four members of that eight-man court:\n\n\"Does the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibit any State from enacting provisions for electoral districts for 1 house of its legislature [the State Senate] which result in substantial inequality of popular representation in that house?\" Scholle v. Secretary of State, 360 Mich. 1, at 85, 104 N. W. 2d 63, at 107.\n\n\n These four members of the state court concluded that nothing in the Fourteenth Amendment or in the decisions of this Court construing the Equal Protection Clause \"prohibits a State from establishing senate electoral districts by geographic areas drawn generally along county lines which result in substantial inequality of voter representation favoring thinly populated areas as opposed to populous ones.\" 360 Mich., at 91, 104 N. W. 2d, at 110. Accordingly, the original petition for mandamus filed in the Supreme Court of Michigan was dismissed.\n1\n The \n\n[369 \nU.S. 429, 432]\n\u00a0\n opinion of the four judges did not so much as mention questions pertaining to the \"jurisdiction\" of the court, the \"standing\" of the appellant, or the \"justiciability\" of his claim.\n\nAppellant filed a timely notice of appeal to this Court, and on docketing the record submitted a jurisdictional statement which set forth the questions presented for review.\n2\n These papers, along with the motion to dismiss \n\n[369 \nU.S. 429, 433]\n\u00a0\n or affirm, taken in light of the prevailing opinion in the Michigan Supreme Court, leave no room for doubt but that the precise and single issue in this case is the one presented as Question IV in the jurisdictional statement: \"Do the 1952 amendments to Art. V, 2 and 4 of the Michigan Constitution, and the implementing legislation thereto, offend the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, including the due-process and equal protection clauses thereof?\" That issue is the more precisely delineated by three circumstances: (1) the legislative branch with which this case is concerned is the State Senate (not the entire State Legislature, as in Baker v. Carr); (2) the challenged electoral apportionment reflects the desires of Michigan's citizenry, as expressed in a 1952 popular referendum (and is not, as in Baker v. Carr, the product of legislative inaction);\n3\n and (3) the present apportionment is prescribed by the Michigan Constitution (and is not in conflict with the State Constitution, as in Baker v. Carr).\n\nWere there anything in this Court's recent decision in Baker v. Carr intimating that the constitutional question in this case ought to have been decided differently than it was by the Michigan Supreme Court, I would be content, for reasons given in my dissent in Baker (\n369 \nU.S. 186, 330\n), simply to note my dissent to the Court's failure to dismiss this appeal for want of a substantial \n\n[369 \nU.S. 429, 434]\n\u00a0\n federal question. But both the majority opinion in the Baker case and a separate concurrence written to dispel any \"distressingly inaccurate impression of what the Court decides,\" \n369 \nU.S., at 265\n, were at pains to warn that nothing more was decided than \"(a) that the [federal district] court possessed jurisdiction of the subject matter; (b) that a justiciable cause of action is stated upon which appellants would be entitled to appropriate relief; and (c) . . . that the appellants have standing to challenge the Tennessee apportionment statutes.\" \n369 \nU.S., at 197\n-198, 265. How any of the extensive discussion on these three subjects in the Baker majority opinion can be thought to shed light on the discrete federal constitutional question on which the present case turns - a question which was indeed studiously avoided in the majority opinion in Baker - is difficult to understand.\n\nMoreover, the remand cannot be justified on the theory that Baker v. Carr for the first time suggests - albeit sub silentio - that an arbitrary or capricious state legislative apportionment may violate the Equal Protection Clause. For the Michigan Supreme Court assumed precisely that proposition and nonetheless said of the existing apportionment: \"In the face of . . . history and . . . precedent, we find no way by which we can say that the classification we are concerned with herein is `wholly arbitrary,' and hence repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution as the United States supreme court has construed it to this date.\" 360 Mich., at 106, 104 N. W. 2d, at 118.\n\nWith all respect, I consider that in thus remanding this case the Court has been less than forthright with the Michigan Supreme Court. That court is left in the uncomfortable position where it will have to choose between adhering to its present decision - in my view a faithful reflection of this Court's past cases - or treating the remand as an oblique invitation from this Court to \n\n[369 \nU.S. 429, 435]\n\u00a0\n hold that the Equal Protection Clause prohibits a State from constitutionally freezing the seats in its Senate, with the effect of maintaining numerical voting inequalities, even though that course reflects the expressed will of the people of the State. (Note 3, supra.)\n\nIn my view the matter should not be left in this equivocal posture. Both the orderly solution of this particular case, and the wider ramifications that are bound to follow in the wake of Baker v. Carr, demand that the Court come to grips now with the basic issue tendered by this case. This should be done either by dismissing the appeal for want of a substantial federal question or by noting probable jurisdiction and then deciding the issue one way or another. For reasons given in my separate dissent in the Baker case, I think dismissal is the right course.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] On appeals to the Supreme Court of Michigan the result of an equally divided court is that the judgment below is affirmed. Mich. Stat. Ann. 27.46 (1938). Although no statute expressly controls, it appears that Michigan follows the general rule that no affirmative action may be taken on an original petition unless a majority of the justices considering the case vote to grant relief. Consequently the effect of an equal division on an original petition for a writ of mandamus would be a dismissal of the petition. Cf. In re Hartley, 317 Mich. 441, 27 N. W. 2d 48.\n\nIt appears, moreover, that in fact five members (a majority) of the Michigan Supreme Court concurred as to this issue. The separate concurring opinion of Justice Black of that court shows that he also concluded \"that a State may - unfettered juridically by the Fourteenth Amendment - determine what as a matter of State policy shall be `a proper diffusion of political initiative' as between the thinly and heavily populated areas of the State.\" 360 Mich., at 119-120, 104 N. W. 2d, at 125.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The appellant listed the following as the \"Questions Presented\":\n\n\"I.

Does the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibit the establishment by a state of permanent legislative districts lacking any discernible, rational, uniform, non-arbitrary and non-discriminatory basis of representation whatever (save, only, the freezing by such enactment of legislative malapportionment theretofore invalid under prior constitutional provisions)?\n\n\n\"III.

Although appellant's name and address could easily have been ascertained from deed records and tax rolls, no attempt was made to give notice to appellant except by publication in newspapers and by posting notices during the month of January on trees and poles along the river. Alleging that she had no actual knowledge of the proceedings until after the statutory period for filing damage claims had expired, appellant sought redress in the New York courts. Held: In the circumstances of this case, the newspaper publications and posted notices did not measure up to the quality of notice which the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires.

Fraenkel for the New York Civil Liberties Union.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe question presented by this case is whether the City of New York deprived the appellant of due process of law by failing to give her adequate notice of condemnation proceedings affecting certain property she owned on the \n\n[371 \nU.S. 208, 209]\n\u00a0\n Neversink River in Orange County, New York. The property in question consisted of a house and three and one-half acres of land, which the appellant and her family occupied only during the months of July and August each year.\n\nIn 1952 the city instituted a proceeding under the provisions of the New York City Water Supply Act\n1\n to acquire the right to divert a portion of the Neversink River at a point in Sullivan County, New York, some 25 miles upstream from the appellant's property. The Water Supply Act, which sets out the procedure to be followed by the New York Board of Water Supply in condemning land, easements, and rights affecting real property required for the New York City water system, provides that notice of such condemnation proceedings be given to affected landowners in the following manner:\n\n \"The corporation counsel shall give notice in the City Record, and in two public newspapers published in the city of New York and in two public newspapers published in each other county in which any real estate laid out on such maps may be located, and which it is proposed to acquire in the proceeding, of his intention to make application to such court for the appointment of commissioners of appraisal . . . . Such notice shall be so published, once in each week, in each of such newspapers, for six weeks immediately previous to the presentation of such petition; and the corporation counsel shall in addition to such advertisement cause copies of the same in hand bills to be posted up, for the same space of time in at least twenty conspicuous places on the line of the aqueduct or in the vicinity of the real estate so to be taken or affected.\"\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[371 \nU.S. 208, 210]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The Act further provides that all claims for damages resulting from the city's acquisition are barred after three years.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nProceeding in accordance with the statute, the city caused notice of its acquisition of the right to divert the Neversink to be published the requisite number of times in the City Record of the City of New York, in two New York City newspapers, and in two newspapers published in Orange County, and in addition posted 22 notices on trees and poles along a seven- or eight-mile stretch of the river in the general vicinity of the appellant's premises. No notice was posted anywhere on the appellant's property itself. The two Orange County newspapers in which publication was made were published in small communities many miles from the appellant's property, although at the time there were newspapers being published in larger Orange County towns nearby. The notices were posted on the trees and poles during the month of January, when the appellant's premises were vacant. Although the appellant's name and address were readily ascertainable from both deed records and tax rolls, neither the newspaper publications nor the posted notices contained the name of the appellant or of any other affected property owner. Neither the newspaper publications nor the posted notices explained what action a property owner might take to recover for damages caused by the city's acquisition, nor did they intimate any time limit upon the filing of a claim by an affected property owner.\n\nThe appellant did not file a claim for damages to her property within the three-year period prescribed by the Water Supply Act. In January 1960, however, she brought the present equitable action in a New York trial court. Her complaint alleged that she had never been notified of the condemnation proceedings, and knew nothing \n\n[371 \nU.S. 208, 211]\n\u00a0\n about them, nor of her right to make a claim against the city for damages to her property, until after she had consulted a lawyer in 1959. She alleged that by failing to give her adequate notice of the condemnation proceedings, the city had deprived her of property in violation of due process of law. The trial court granted the city's motion for judgment on the pleadings in an unreported opinion holding that \"the notice provisions of Section K 41-8.0 of the Water Supply Act - admittedly fully complied with by the defendant\" - were not \"violative of the due process provisions of the Federal and State Constitutions . . . .\" This judgment was affirmed by the Appellate Division,\n4\n and by the New York Court of Appeals, two judges dissenting.\n5\n The case is properly here on appeal under 28 U.S.C. 1257 (2).\n\nWe hold that the newspaper publications and posted notices in the circumstances of this case did not measure up to the quality of notice which the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires.\n\n\"An elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections. Milliken v. Meyer, \n311 \nU.S. 457\n; Grannis v. Ordean, \n234 \nU.S. 385\n; Priest v. Las Vegas, \n232 \nU.S. 604\n; Roller v. Holly, \n176 \nU.S. 398\n.\" Mullane v. Central \n\n[371 \nU.S. 208, 212]\n\u00a0\n Hanover Tr. Co., \n339 \nU.S. 306, 314\n. In the Mullane case, which involved notice by publication to the beneficiaries of a common trust fund, the Court thoroughly canvassed the problem of sufficiency of notice under the Due Process Clause, pointing out the reasons behind the basic constitutional rule, as well as the practical considerations which make it impossible to draw a standard set of specifications as to what is constitutionally adequate notice, to be mechanically applied in every situation.\n\n\n As was emphasized in Mullane, the requirement that parties be notified of proceedings affecting their legally protected interests is obviously a vital corollary to one of the most fundamental requisites of due process - the right to be heard. \"This right . . . has little reality or worth unless one is informed that the matter is pending and can choose for himself whether to appear or default, acquiesce or contest.\" \n339 \nU.S., at 314\n. The Court recognized the practical impossibility of giving personal notice in some cases, such as those involving missing or unknown persons. But the inadequacies of \"notice\" by publication were described in words that bear repeating here:\n\n\"Chance alone brings to the attention of even a local resident an advertisement in small type inserted in the back pages of a newspaper, and if he makes his home outside the area of the newspaper's normal circulation the odds that the information will never reach him are large indeed. The chance of actual notice is further reduced when, as here, the notice required does not even name those whose attention it is supposed to attract, and does not inform acquaintances who might call it to attention.\" \n339 \nU.S., at 315\n.\n\n\n The general rule that emerges from the Mullane case is that notice by publication is not enough with respect to a person whose name and address are known or very \n\n[371 \nU.S. 208, 213]\n\u00a0\n easily ascertainable and whose legally protected interests are directly affected by the proceedings in question. \"Where the names and post-office addresses of those affected by a proceeding are at hand, the reasons disappear for resort to means less likely than the mails to apprise them of its pendency.\" \n339 \nU.S., at 318\n.\n\nThis rule was applied in New York v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co., \n344 \nU.S. 293, 296\n, where the Court pointed out that \"[n]otice by publication is a poor and sometimes a hopeless substitute for actual service of notice,\" and that \"[i]ts justification is difficult at best.\" The rule was applied again in Walker v. Hutchinson City, \n352 \nU.S. 112\n, in a factual situation much akin to that in the present case. In Walker part of the appellant's land had been taken in condemnation proceedings, and he had been given \"notice\" of a proceeding to fix his compensation only by publication in the official city newspaper. The Court held that such notice was constitutionally insufficient, noting that the appellant's name \"was known to the city and was on the official records,\" and that \"[e]ven a letter would have apprised him that his property was about to be taken and that he must appear if he wanted to be heard as to its value.\" \n352 \nU.S., at 116\n.\n\nDecision in the case before us we think is clearly controlled by the rule stated in the Mullane case, and by the specifically relevant application of that rule in the Walker case. It is true that in addition to publishing in newspapers, the city in the present case did put some signs on trees and poles along the banks of the river. But no such sign was placed anywhere on the appellant's property, or ever seen by her. The posting of these signs, therefore, did not constitute the personal notice that the rule enunciated in the Mullane case requires.\n\nThe majority opinion in the New York Court of Appeals seems additionally to have drawn support from an assumption that the effect of the city's diversion of the \n\n[371 \nU.S. 208, 214]\n\u00a0\n river must have been apparent to the appellant before the expiration of the three-year period within which the statute required that her claim be filed. 10 N. Y. 2d, at 526-527, 180 N. E. 2d, at 569-570. There was no such allegation in the pleadings, upon which the case was decided by the trial court. But even putting this consideration aside, knowledge of a change in the appearance of the river is far short of notice that the city had diverted it and that the appellant had a right to be heard on a claim for compensation for damages resulting from the diversion.\n6\n That was the information which the city was constitutionally obliged to make at least a good faith effort to give personally to the appellant - an obligation which the mailing of a single letter would have discharged.\n\nThe judgment of the New York Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Administrative Code of City of New York, Title K41.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Administrative Code of City of New York, Title K41-8.0.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Administrative Code of City of New York, Title K41-18.0.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] 14 App. Div. 2d 183, 217 N.

Although the complaint prayed for a judgment enjoining the city from diverting the waters of the Neversink, the New York courts construed the pleading as the appropriate way to raise the question of the adequacy of the notice provisions and to assert the right to be heard on the issue of damages. In her brief the appellant has conceded that she is not entitled to an injunction. Cf. Walker v. Hutchinson City, \n352 \nU.S. 112, 114\n, n. 3.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The complaint alleged damages based upon the impairment of the river's value to the appellant for \"bathing, swimming, fishing and boating.\" This claimed impairment allegedly resulted not from any change in the river's course, depth, or configuration, but from a decrease in the velocity of its flow. \n\n[371 \nU.S. 208, 215]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","169":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSEELIG v.

SUPERINTENDENT(1962)\nNo. 62\nArgued: December 13, 1961Decided: January 15, 1962\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner is imprisoned in the Washington State Penitentiary under a sentence for attempted burglary imposed by a state court. He petitioned the State Supreme Court for habeas corpus, alleging that he is an Indian, that the alleged offense was committed in \"Indian country,\" and that, therefore, exclusive jurisdiction was in the United States under 18 U.S.C. 1153. The Court found that petitioner was a member of the Colville Tribe; but it denied habeas corpus on the ground that the place where the offense was committed was no longer an Indian reservation, though it had been a part of the Colville Indian Reservation. Held: The Colville Indian Reservation is still in existence; the land upon which the offense is alleged to have occurred is within the limits of that Reservation; the state courts had no jurisdiction to try petitioner for that offense; and the judgment denying habeas corpus is reversed. Pp. 352-359.\n\n (a) The Act of March 22, 1906, providing for the disposition of surplus lands remaining in the South Half of the diminished Colville Indian Reservation did not dissolve that Reservation, and it is still in existence. Pp. 354-357.\n\n\n (b) Even if the land upon which the alleged offense was committed was held by a non-Indian under a patent in fee, a different conclusion would not be required, since 18 U.S.C. 1151 defines \"Indian country\" as including \"all land within the limits of any Indian reservation . . ., notwithstanding the issuance of any patent.\" Pp. 357-358.\n\n\n (c) A different conclusion is not required by the fact that the land on which the offense occurred is located within a governmental townsite laid out by the Federal Government under 11 of the 1906 Act.

Spencer was with him on the briefs. \n\n[368 \nU.S. 351, 352]\n\u00a0\n\n\nStephen C. Way, Assistant Attorney General of Washington, argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was John J. O'Connell, Attorney General.\n\nAt the request of the Court, Solicitor General Rankin filed a memorandum for the United States.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe petitioner Paul Seymour was charged with burglary by the State of Washington in the Superior Court of Okanogan County and pleaded guilty to the lesser included offense of attempted burglary. Upon this plea he was convicted and sentenced to serve seven and one-half years in the state penitentiary. Later, he commenced this proceeding by filing a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the State Supreme Court urging that his state conviction was void for want of jurisdiction on the grounds that he was an enrolled, unemancipated member of the Colville Indian Tribe and therefore a ward of the United States; that the \"purported crime\" of burglary for which he had been convicted was committed in \"Indian country\" as defined in 18 U.S.C. 1151;\n1\n and that burglary committed by an Indian in Indian country is an offense \"within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States\" under 18 U.S.C. 1153.\n2\n Since the petition, return and answer raised issues of fact, the State Supreme Court referred the matter to the original trial court to determine (1) whether petitioner was a member of the Colville Tribe, and (2) whether the offense was \n\n[368 \nU.S. 351, 353]\n\u00a0\n committed in Indian country. After hearings, the trial court upheld petitioner's claim of membership in the Colville Tribe, but rejected his contention that the burglary upon which the state conviction was based had occurred in Indian country.\n\nThe trial court's conclusion that the crime did not take place in Indian country was not based upon any factual doubt as to the precise place where the burglary occurred for that fact was undisputed. Nor did that conclusion rest upon any uncertainty as to the proper definition of the term \"Indian country\" for the court expressly recognized the applicability of 1151 which defines the term to include \"all land within the limits of any Indian reservation under the jurisdiction of the United States Government, notwithstanding the issuance of any patent, and, including rights-of-way running through the reservation . . . .\" Rather, the trial court's conclusion rested solely upon its holding that, although the land upon which the burglary occurred had once been within the limits of an Indian reservation, that reservation had since been dissolved and the land in question restored to the public domain.\n\nAgreeing with the trial court, the State Supreme Court then denied the petition for habeas corpus,\n3\n holding as it previously had in State ex rel. Best v. Superior Court,\n4\n that \"What is still known as the south half of the diminished Colville Indian reservation is no longer an Indian reservation.\" Since the question of whether the place where the crime occurred is a part of an Indian reservation and therefore Indian country within the meaning of 1151 and 1153 depends upon the interpretation and application of federal law, and since the resolution of that question as presented in this case raises issues of importance pertaining \n\n[368 \nU.S. 351, 354]\n\u00a0\n to this country's relationship to its Indian wards, we granted certiorari.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nThe case turns upon the current status of the Colville Indian Reservation - a reservation created in 1872 by Executive Order of President Grant which declared that \"the country bounded on the east and south by the Columbia River, on the west by the Okanagan River, and on the north by the British possessions, be, and the same is hereby, set apart as a reservation for\" the Colville Indians.\n6\n In 1892, the size of this reservation was diminished when Congress passed an Act providing that, subject to reservations and allotments made to individual Colville Indians, about one-half of the original Colville reservation, since commonly referred to as the \"North Half,\" should be \"vacated and restored to the public domain . . . .\"\n7\n This Act did not, however, purport to affect the status of the remaining part of the reservation, since known as the \"South Half\" or the \"diminished Colville Indian Reservation,\" but instead expressly reaffirmed that this South Half was \"still reserved by the Government for their [the Colville Indians'] use and occupancy.\"\n8\n Since the burglary of which petitioner was convicted occurred on land within the South Half, it is clear that state jurisdiction over the offense charged, if it is to be found at all, must be based upon some federal action subsequent to the 1892 Act.\n\nThe Washington courts found authority for the assertion of state jurisdiction in a 1906 Act of Congress\n9\n implemented by a 1916 Presidential Proclamation.\n10\n The 1906 Act provided for the sale of mineral lands and \n\n[368 \nU.S. 351, 355]\n\u00a0\n for the settlement and entry under the homestead laws of other surplus lands remaining on the diminished Colville Reservation after allotments were first made and patents issued for 80 acres of land to \"each man, woman, and child\" either \"belonging to or having tribal relations on said Colville Indian Reservation . . . .\" The 1916 Presidential Proclamation issued pursuant to this Act simply prescribed the method for disposal of surplus lands under the homestead laws as the 1906 Act had authorized. The Washington courts viewed this 1906 Act and the 1916 Presidential Proclamation as completely wiping out the South Half of the Colville Reservation in precisely the same manner as the 1892 Act had \"vacated and restored\" the North Half of the reservation \"to the public domain.\" Upon careful consideration, however, we cannot agree with that conclusion for it has no support in the language of the 1906 Act and ignores important differences between that Act and the provisions of the 1892 Act restoring the North Half of the reservation to the public domain.\n\nNowhere in the 1906 Act is there to be found any language similar to that in the 1892 Act expressly vacating the South Half of the reservation and restoring that land to the public domain. Quite the contrary, the 1906 Act repeatedly refers to the Colville Reservation in a manner that makes it clear that the intention of Congress was that the reservation should continue to exist as such.\n11\n Moreover, the 1906 Act, unlike the 1892 Act, provides that the proceeds from the disposition of lands affected by its provisions shall be \"deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the Colville and confederated tribes of Indians belonging and having tribal rights on the Colville Indian Reservation, in the State of Washington . . . .\" The 1892 Act had provided for congressional power to appropriate the net proceeds \n\n[368 \nU.S. 351, 356]\n\u00a0\n from the sale and disposition of lands in the North Half of the original reservation for the general public use. Consequently, it seems clear that the purpose of the 1906 Act was neither to destroy the existence of the diminished Colville Indian Reservation nor to lessen federal responsibility for and jurisdiction over the Indians having tribal rights on that reservation. The Act did no more than open the way for non-Indian settlers to own land on the reservation in a manner which the Federal Government, acting as guardian and trustee for the Indians, regarded as beneficial to the development of its wards.\n\nThat this is the proper construction of the 1906 Act finds support in subsequent congressional treatment of the reservation. Time and time again in statutes enacted since 1906, Congress has explicitly recognized the continued existence as a federal Indian reservation of this South Half or diminished Colville Indian Reservation.\n12\n As recently as 1956, Congress enacted a statute which provides that \"the undisposed-of lands of the Colville Indian Reservation, Washington, dealt with by the Act of March 22, 1906 (34 Stat. 80), are hereby restored to tribal ownership to be held in trust by the United States to the same extent as all other tribal lands on the existing reservation, subject to any existing valid rights.\"\n13\n\u00a0\n\n[368 \nU.S. 351, 357]\n\u00a0\n (Emphasis supplied.) This same construction of the 1906 Act has been adopted by the Department of Interior, the agency of government having primary responsibility for Indian affairs.\n14\n And the Solicitor General has urged this construction upon the Court in this very case. We therefore conclude that the Washington courts erred in holding that the 1906 Act dissolved the Colville Indian Reservation because it seems clear that this reservation is still in existence.\n\nCounsel for the State of Washington present two alternative contentions which, if sound, would sustain the jurisdiction of the State over the land here in question even if the Act of 1906 did not completely dissolve the reservation in the manner held by the Washington courts. The first of these rests upon the assertion that the particular parcel of land upon which this burglary was committed is held under a patent in fee by a non-Indian. The contention is that, even though the reservation was not dissolved completely by the Act permitting non-Indian settlers to come upon it, its limits would be diminished by the actual purchase of land within it by non-Indians because land owned in fee by non-Indians cannot be said to be reserved for Indians. This contention is not entirely implausible on its face and, indeed, at one time had the support of distinguished commentators on Indian Law.\n15\n But the issue has since been squarely put to rest by congressional enactment of the currently prevailing definition of Indian country in 1151 to include \"all land within the limits of any Indian reservation under the jurisdiction \n\n[368 \nU.S. 351, 358]\n\u00a0\n of the United States Government, notwithstanding the issuance of any patent . . . .\"\n\nThe State urges that we interpret the words \"notwithstanding the issuance of any patent\" to mean only notwithstanding the issuance of any patent to an Indian. But the State does not suggest, nor can we find, any adequate justification for such an interpretation. Quite the contrary, it seems to us that the strongest argument against the exclusion of patented lands from an Indian reservation applies with equal force to patents issued to non-Indians and Indians alike. For that argument rests upon the fact that where the existence or nonexistence of an Indian reservation, and therefore the existence or non-existence of federal jurisdiction, depends upon the ownership of particular parcels of land, law enforcement officers operating in the area will find it necessary to search tract books in order to determine whether criminal jurisdiction over each particular offense, even though committed within the reservation, is in the State or Federal Government.\n16\n Such an impractical pattern of checkerboard jurisdiction was avoided by the plain language of 1151 and we see no justification for adopting an unwarranted construction of that language where the result would be merely to recreate confusion Congress specifically sought to avoid.\n\nThe second alternative contention pressed by the State of Washington rests upon the fact that the land on which the burglary occurred is located within the governmental townsite of Omak, a town laid out by the Federal Government pursuant to authority granted in 11 of the 1906 Act. The State contends that when this authorized townsite plot was filed for record in Okanogan County. \n\n[368 \nU.S. 351, 359]\n\u00a0\n all the lands encompassed within the townsite were thereby dedicated to the public interest and, since this dedication to the public is inconsistent with any reservation for the Indians, all these lands became subject to the exercise of criminal jurisdiction by the courts of Washington. This contention is nothing more than a variation of the State's first alternative contention for it simply attempts to make a special case for excluding from a reservation lands owned by towns as opposed to lands owned by individual non-Indians. The arguments which led us to reject the State's first alternative contention, though present only with somewhat less force here, are nonetheless entirely adequate to require the same answer to this contention. Moreover, the State can point to no language in 1151's definition of Indian country which lends the slightest support to the idea that by creating a townsite within an Indian reservation the Federal Government lessens the scope of its responsibility for the Indians living on that reservation.\n\nIn United States v. Celestine,\n17\n this Court said that \"when Congress has once established a reservation all tracts included within it remain a part of the reservation until separated therefrom by Congress.\" We are unable to find where Congress has taken away from the Colville Indians any part of the land within the boundaries of the area which has been recognized as their reservation since 1892. Since the burglary with which petitioner was charged occurred on property plainly located within the limits of that reservation, the courts of Washington had no jurisdiction to try him for that offense.\n\nThe judgment of the Washington Supreme Court denying petitioner's plea for a writ of habeas corpus is therefore reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 62 Stat. 757, as amended, 63 Stat. 94.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] \"Any Indian who commits against the person or property of another Indian or other person any of the following offenses, namely, murder, manslaughter, rape, incest, assault with intent to kill, assault with a dangerous weapon, arson, burglary, robbery, and larceny within the Indian country, shall be subject to the same laws and penalties as all other persons committing any of the above offenses, within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.\" 62 Stat. 758.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 55 Wash. 2d 109, 346 P.2d 669.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] 107 Wash. 238, 241, 181 P. 688, 689.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] \n365 \nU.S. 833\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] I Kappler, Indian Affairs, Laws and Treaties (2d ed.), p. 916.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] 27 Stat. 62, 63.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] 27 Stat., at 64.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] 34 Stat. 80.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] 39 Stat. 1778.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] See 2, 3, 6 and 12, 34 Stat., at 80-82.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] See, e. g., 39 Stat. 123, 154-155; 39 Stat. 672; 40 Stat. 449; 41 Stat. 535; 43 Stat. 21; 54 Stat. 703; 69 Stat. 141, 143; 70 Stat. 626-627. Two of these statutes, 40 Stat. 449 passed in 1918 and 41 Stat. 535 passed in 1920, do illustrate that there may have been some congressional confusion on this issue during that short period of time for they referred to the \"former Colville Indian Reservation.

JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThese two cases, consolidated for argument here, involve controversies between the United States and bankruptcy trustees concerning the right of the Government to recover federal tax penalties against the estate of a bankrupt.\n1\n Because the tax penalties constituted perfected liens on the estate of the bankrupt,\n2\n the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, following one of its own prior decisions which subsequently had been supported \n\n[369 \nU.S. 38, 39]\n\u00a0\n by both the Sixth and the Tenth Circuits,\n3\n sustained District Court judgments holding the penalty claims allowable. 287 F.2d 489, 491. Since the Fourth and Fifth Circuits have held to the contrary,\n4\n we granted certiorari to resolve the conflict. \n366 \nU.S. 943\n.\n\nTwo provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, 57j and 67b, are asserted to have particular relevance to the question. Section 57j provides:\n\n \"Debts owing to the United States or to any State or any subdivision thereof as a penalty or forfeiture shall not be allowed, except for the amount of the pecuniary loss sustained by the act, transaction, or proceeding out of which the penalty or forfeiture arose . . . .\"\n5\n\u00a0\n\n\n Section 67b provides, however:\n\n\"[S]tatutory liens . . . for taxes and debts owing to the United States . . . may be valid against the trustee, even though arising or perfected . . . within four months prior to the filing of the petition initiating a proceeding under this Act by or against him. . . .\"\n6\n\u00a0\n\n\n Despite the fact that the language of 57j broadly prohibits the allowance of penalty claims in bankruptcy without regard to whether such claims are secured or unsecured, the Government argues that this section should be interpreted to apply to unsecured penalty claims only and that secured claims, even though for penalties, should be allowed under 67b. Its argument \n\n[369 \nU.S. 38, 40]\n\u00a0\n starts from the fact that the Bankruptcy Act primarily provides a way to gather the unencumbered assets of an insolvent debtor for distribution among his unsecured creditors, but, though containing some provisions applicable to secured creditors, generally leaves those creditors secured by mortgages and liens free to enforce their claims directly against the property by which those claims are secured. From this and a section-by-section analysis of the Act, the Government reasons that the \"claims\" referred to in 57, which governs the \"Proof and allowance of claims,\" are not the claims of secured creditors but only the \"claims\" of unsecured creditors against the fund created by unencumbered assets, with which the Act primarily deals. On this basis the Government contends that 57j, being a part of 57, must be read as barring only those penalties that have not yet ripened into a lien so as to become a charge upon the bankrupt's property.\n\nWe think, however, that the language of 57j is itself a more dependable guide to its meaning than this argument from the general structure of the Bankruptcy Act. Unquestionably that language is broad enough to bar all penalties, whether secured by lien or not, and we think the section was designed to do precisely that. For it plainly manifests a congressional purpose to bar all claims of any kind against a bankrupt except those based on a \"pecuniary\" loss. So understood, this section, which has been a part of the Bankruptcy Act since its enactment in 1898, is in keeping with the broad aim of the Act to provide for the conservation of the estates of insolvents to the end that there may be as equitable a distribution of assets as is consistent with the type of claims involved. Moreover, the prohibition of all tax penalties in bankruptcy is wholly consistent with the policy of the penalty provisions themselves. Tax penalties are imposed at least in part as punitive measures against persons who \n\n[369 \nU.S. 38, 41]\n\u00a0\n have been guilty of some default or wrong.\n7\n Enforcement of penalties against the estates of bankrupts, however, would serve not to punish the delinquent taxpayers, but rather their entirely innocent creditors.\n\nWhen we turn to the language of 67b, we find nothing that indicates a purpose to require the general creditors of a bankrupt to suffer because of penalties designed to be inflicted upon the bankrupt himself. Indeed, there is not a single word in that section regarding penalties, and the plain purpose of the section is merely to prevent certain liens, including statutory tax liens, \"arising or perfected . . . within four months prior to the filing of the [bankruptcy] petition,\" from being set aside and declared invalid under 60 as preferential.\n8\n Thus 67b expressly declares that it is to take precedence over any \"provisions of section 60 of this Act to the contrary . . . .\" Section 67b cannot therefore be read as showing a congressional purpose to make penalties allowable contrary to the special and specific language of 57j which makes them not allowable.\n9\n\u00a0\n\nThe Government argues, however, that the legislative history of the two sections supports the allowance of penalties when they have ripened into liens. Without discussing the varied arguments to this effect in detail, we think the legislative history cited supports no such conclusion.\n10\n Nor do we think that any inference can be \n\n[369 \nU.S. 38, 42]\n\u00a0\n drawn from the failure of Congress to amend the Act for although some courts have held liened penalty claims allowable, others have held precisely the opposite.\n11\n\u00a0\n\nIt is true that the United States has long had an absolute priority for debts due from insolvent debtors and that the Bankruptcy Act generally accords secured creditors a preferred position. But 57j places penalties in a category quite different from ordinary debts, one not favored in bankruptcy, and the character of a penalty is by no means changed by calling it a lien.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In the first case, Simonson v.

Thus, the minority report on the Torrey Bill which eventually became the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 stated as an objection to 57j the fact that although \"penalties and forfeitures, when merged into judgment, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 38, 42]\n\u00a0\n . . . are liens upon the debtor's estate, this bill treats them as worthless and forbids their payment.\" H.

Farmers Bank, 139 F.2d 266, with United States v. Phillips, 267 F.2d 374, and In re Burch, 89 F. Supp. 249. In 1960 Congress passed an Act containing a provision applying 57j to penalties \"whether or not secured by lien,\" but this was vetoed by the President. 106 Cong. Rec. 19168.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, whom MR. JUSTICE HARLAN joins, dissenting.\n\nOf course one agrees with the Court that an important purpose of the Bankruptcy Act was to ensure an equitable distribution of assets among creditors. I also agree that 57j, 11 U.S.C. 93 (j), denying claims for penalties against the estate, reflects a policy against disadvantaging innocent creditors for the wrongs of the bankrupt. If that were the only policy of the Act, 57j would hold the exclusive field and there would be no problem. As it is, if there be a countervailing policy as a matter of historic bankruptcy law, it can neither be discarded nor disregarded in giving 57j its proper setting and its resulting scope. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 38, 43]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn bankruptcy a sharp distinction has always been drawn between secured and unsecured creditors. Secured creditors may not vote at creditors' meetings, 56b, nor may their claims be allowed against the bankrupt estate, 57e, except to the extent that these claims exceed the value of the security. Fully secured creditors are not counted in determining the total number of creditors in order to ascertain the number required to initiate involuntary bankruptcy, 59e. Liens have been held unaffected by a discharge under 17, e. g., Prebyl v. Prudential Ins. Co., 98 F.2d 199; see 1 Collier, Bankruptcy \u00a7 17.29 (14th ed. 1961).\n\nSections 64, 65, and 67 establish three classes of debts: those which are secured by lien, those which are given priority and all others. Those having neither security nor priority are satisfied on a pro rata basis, 65. Those with priority, as listed in 64, are to be paid in full in specified order before the distribution of pro rata dividends to other claimants. Liens, in 67d of the statute as enacted in 1898, 30 Stat. 544, 564, were declared to be unaffected by the statute - they were entirely without its scope. Consequently they were entitled to precedence over claims granted priority by 64. City of Richmond v. Bird, \n249 \nU.S. 174\n. This section was omitted in the 1938 revision because its wording permitted inferences that by negative implication it disallowed certain liens not otherwise invalidated by the Act, and because the substance of the provision was thought to be preserved in other sections - not because of disapproval in policy. S. Rep. No. 1916, 75th Cong., 3d Sess. 17 (1938); see 4 Collier, supra, \u00a7 67.20. This Court has held that liens remain immune from and are not displaced by the Act's priorities under the 1938 Act, Goggin v. California Labor Div., \n336 \nU.S. 118, 126\n-127, and liens for federal taxes are expressly preserved by 67b. A limited exception \n\n[369 \nU.S. 38, 44]\n\u00a0\n to the immunity of liens was made in 67c, but the extent of the invalidation or subordination of liens to other debts was carefully circumscribed, and the basic lien immunity remains. 4 Collier, supra, \u00a7 67.203.-67.207..\n\nCongress has thus treated liens as outside the policy of equal treatment of creditors in bankruptcy. 3 Collier, supra, \u00a7 57.07. A lienor does not hold simply a first priority; he has \"a right to enforcement independent of bankruptcy,\" id., \u00a7 64.02, at 2061. The Bankruptcy Act deals with the distribution of unencumbered assets among unsecured creditors. Id., \u00a7 60.01. Lienholders need no Bankruptcy Act. Liens are independent of and essentially unaffected by bankruptcy proceedings. I agree with the court below that liens are unaffected by 57j; they are outside its scope. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 38, 45]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","174":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSIMPSON v.

JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe question this case presents is whether 301 of the Taft-Hartley Act, in giving federal courts jurisdiction of suits between employers and unions for breach of collective bargaining agreements,\n1\n impliedly repealed 4 of the pre-existing Norris-LaGuardia Act, which, with certain exceptions not here material, barred federal courts from issuing injunctions \"in any case involving or growing out of any labor dispute.\"\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 195, 197]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe complaint here was filed by the petitioner Sinclair Refining Company against the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union and Local 7-210 of that union and alleged: that the International Union, acting by and with the authority of the Local Union and its members, signed a written collective bargaining contract with Sinclair which provided for compulsory, final and binding arbitration of \"any difference regarding wages, hours or working conditions between the parties hereto or between the Employer and an employee covered by this working agreement which might arise within any plant or within any region of operations\"; that this contract also included express provisions by which the unions agreed that \"there shall be no slowdowns for any reason whatsoever\" and \"no strikes or work stoppages . . . [f]or any cause which is or may be the subject of a grievance\"; and that notwithstanding these promises in the collective bargaining contract the members of Local 7-210 had, over a period of some 19 months, engaged in work stoppages and strikes on nine separate occasions, each of which, the complaint charged, grew out of a grievance which could have been submitted to arbitration under the contract and therefore fell squarely within the unions' promises not to strike. This pattern of repeated, deliberate violations of the contract, Sinclair alleged, indicated a complete disregard on the part of the unions for their obligations under the contract and a probability that they would continue to \"subvert the provisions of the contract\" forbidding strikes over grievances in the future unless they were enjoined from doing so. In this situation, Sinclair claimed, there was no adequate remedy at law which would protect its contractual rights and the court should therefore enter orders enjoining the unions and their agents \"preliminarily at first, and thereafter permanently, from aiding, abetting, fomenting, advising, participating in, ratifying, or condoning any strike, stoppage of work, \n\n[370 \nU.S. 195, 198]\n\u00a0\n slowdown or any other disruption of, or interference with normal employment or normal operation or production by any employee within the bargaining unit at plaintiff's East Chicago, Indiana refinery covered by the contract between the parties dated August 8, 1957, in support of, or because of, any matter or thing which is, or could be, the subject of a grievance under the grievance procedure of the said contract, or any extension thereof, or any other contract between the parties which shall contain like or similar provisions.\"\n3\n\u00a0\n\nThe unions moved to dismiss this complaint on the ground that it sought injunctive relief which United States courts, by virtue of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, have no jurisdiction to give. The District Court first denied the motion, but subsequently, upon reconsideration after full oral argument, vacated its original order and granted the unions' motion to dismiss.\n4\n In reaching this conclusion, the District Court reasoned that the controversy between Sinclair and the unions was unquestionably a \"labor dispute\" within the meaning of the Norris-LaGuardia Act and that the complaint therefore came within the proscription of 4 of that Act which \"withdraws jurisdiction from the federal courts to issue injunctions to prohibit the refusal `to perform work or remain in any relation of employment' in cases involving any labor dispute.\"\n5\n The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the order of dismissal for the same reasons.\n6\n Because this decision presented a conflict with the decision \n\n[370 \nU.S. 195, 199]\n\u00a0\n on this same important question by the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit,\n7\n we granted certiorari.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nWe agree with the courts below that this case does involve a \"labor dispute\" within the meaning of the Norris-LaGuardia Act. Section 13 of that Act expressly defines a labor dispute as including \"any controversy concerning terms or conditions of employment, or concerning the association or representation of persons in negotiating, fixing, maintaining, changing, or seeking to arrange terms or conditions of employment, regardless of whether or not the disputants stand in the proximate relation of employer and employee.\"\n9\n Sinclair's own complaint shows quite plainly that each of the alleged nine work stoppages and strikes arose out of a controversy which was unquestionably well within this definition.\n10\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 195, 200]\n\u00a0\n\n\nNor does the circumstance that the alleged work stoppages and strikes may have constituted a breach of a collective bargaining agreement alter the plain fact that a \"labor dispute\" within the meaning of the Norris-LaGuardia Act is involved. Arguments to the contrary proceed from the premise that 2 of that Act, which \n\n[370 \nU.S. 195, 201]\n\u00a0\n expresses the public policy upon which the specific anti-injunction provisions of the Act were based, contains language indicating that one primary concern of Congress was to insure workers the right \"to exercise actual liberty of contract\" and to protect \"concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining.\"\n11\n From that premise, Sinclair argues that an interpretation of the term \"labor dispute\" so as to include a dispute arising out of a union's refusal to abide by the terms of a collective agreement to which it freely acceded is to apply the Norris-LaGuardia Act in a way that defeats one of the purposes for which it was enacted. But this argument, though forcefully urged both here and in much current commentary on this question,\n12\n rests more upon considerations of what many \n\n[370 \nU.S. 195, 202]\n\u00a0\n commentators think would be the more desirable industrial and labor policy in view of their understanding as to the prevailing circumstances of contemporary labor-management relations than upon what is a correct judicial interpretation of the language of the Act as it was written by Congress.\n\nIn the first place, even the general policy declarations of 2 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, which are the foundation of this whole argument, do not support the conclusion urged. That section does not purport to limit the Act to the protection of collective bargaining but, instead, expressly recognizes the need of the anti-injunction provisions to insure the right of workers to engage in \"concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.\" Moreover, the language of the specific provisions of the Act is so broad and inclusive that it leaves not the slightest opening for reading in any exceptions beyond those clearly written into it by Congress itself.\n13\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 195, 203]\n\u00a0\n We cannot ignore the plain import of a congressional enactment, particularly one which, as we have repeatedly said, was deliberately drafted in the broadest of terms in order to avoid the danger that it would be narrowed by judicial construction.\n14\n\u00a0\n\nSince we hold that the present case does grow out of a \"labor dispute,\" the injunction sought here runs squarely counter to the proscription of injunctions against strikes contained in 4 (a) of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, to the proscription of injunctions against peaceful picketing contained in 4 (e) and to the proscription of injunctions prohibiting the advising of such activities contained in 4 (i).\n15\n For these reasons, the Norris-LaGuardia Act deprives the courts of the United States of jurisdiction to enter that injunction unless, as is contended here, the scope of that Act has been so narrowed by the subsequent enactment of 301 of the Taft-Hartley Act that it no longer prohibits even the injunctions specifically described in 4 where such injunctions are sought as a remedy for breach of a collective bargaining agreement. Upon consideration, we cannot agree with that view and agree instead with the view expressed by the courts below and supported by the Courts of Appeals for the First and Second Circuits that 301 was not intended to have any such partially repealing effect upon such a long-standing, carefully thought out and highly significant part of this country's labor legislation as the Norris-LaGuardia Act.\n16\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 195, 204]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe language of 301 itself seems to us almost if not entirely conclusive of this question. It is especially significant that the section contains no language that could by any stretch of the imagination be interpreted to constitute an explicit repeal of the anti-injunction provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act in view of the fact that the section does expressly repeal another provision of the Norris-LaGuardia Act dealing with union responsibility for the acts of agents.\n17\n If Congress had intended that 301 suits should also not be subject to the anti-injunction provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, it certainly seems likely that it would have made its intent known in this same express manner. That is indeed precisely what Congress did do in 101, amending 10 (h) of the National Labor Relations Act, and 208 (b) of the Taft-Hartley Act, by permitting injunctions to be obtained, not by private litigants, but only at the instance of the National Labor Relations Board and the Attorney General,\n18\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 195, 205]\n\u00a0\n and in 302 (e), by permitting private litigants to obtain injunctions in order to protect the integrity of employees' collective bargaining representatives in carrying out their responsibilities.\n19\n Thus the failure of Congress to include a provision in 301 expressly repealing the anti-injunction provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act must be evaluated in the context of a statutory pattern that indicates not only that Congress was completely familiar with those provisions but also that it regarded an express declaration of inapplicability as the normal and proper manner of repealing them in situations where such repeal seemed desirable.\n\nWhen the inquiry is carried beyond the language of 301 into its legislative history, whatever small doubts as to the congressional purpose could have survived consideration of the bare language of the section should be wholly dissipated. For the legislative history of 301 shows that Congress actually considered the advisability of repealing the Norris-LaGuardia Act insofar as suits based upon breach of collective bargaining agreements are concerned and deliberately chose not to do so.\n20\n The \n\n[370 \nU.S. 195, 206]\n\u00a0\n section as eventually enacted was the product of a conference between Committees of the House and Senate, selected to resolve the differences between conflicting provisions of the respective bills each had passed. Prior to this conference, the House bill had provided for federal jurisdiction of suits for breach of collective bargaining contracts and had expressly declared that the Norris-LaGuardia Act's anti-injunction provisions would not apply to such suits.\n21\n The bill passed by the Senate, like the House bill, granted federal courts jurisdiction over suits for breach of such agreements but it did not, like the House bill, make the Norris-LaGuardia Act's prohibition against injunctions inapplicable to such suits.\n22\n Instead it made breach of a collective agreement an unfair labor practice.\n23\n Under the Senate version, therefore, a breach \n\n[370 \nU.S. 195, 207]\n\u00a0\n of a collective bargaining agreement, like any unfair labor practice, could have been enjoined by a suit brought by the National Labor Relations Board,\n24\n but no provision of the Senate version would have permitted the issuance of an injunction in a labor dispute at the suit of a private party. At the conference the provision of the House bill expressly repealing the anti-injunction provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, as well as the provision of the bill passed by the Senate declaring the breach of a collective agreement to be an unfair labor practice, was dropped and never became law. Instead, the conferees, as indicated by the provision which came out of the conference and eventually became 301, agreed that suits for breach of such agreements should remain wholly private and \"be left to the usual processes of the law\"\n25\n and that, in view of the fact that these suits would be at the instance of private parties rather than at the instance of the Labor Board, no change in the existing anti-injunction provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act should be made. The House Conference Report expressly recognized that the House provision for repeal in contract actions of the anti-injunction prohibitions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act had been eliminated in Conference:\n\n \"Section 302 (e) of the House bill made the Norris-LaGuardia Act inapplicable in actions and proceedings involving violations of agreements between an employer and a labor organization. Only part of this provision is included in the conference agreement. Section 6 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act provides that no employer or labor organization \n\n[370 \nU.S. 195, 208]\n\u00a0\n participating or interested in a labor dispute shall be held responsible for the unlawful acts of their agents except upon clear proof of actual authorization of such acts, or ratification of such acts after actual knowledge thereof. This provision in the Norris-LaGuardia Act was made inapplicable under the House bill. Section 301 (e) of the conference agreement provides that for the purposes of section 301 in determining whether any person is acting as an agent of another so as to make such other person responsible for his actions, the question of whether the specific acts performed were actually authorized or subsequently ratified shall not be controlling.\"\n26\n\u00a0\n\n\n And Senator Taft, Chairman of the Conference Committee and one of the authors of this legislation that bore his name, was no less explicit in explaining the results of the Conference to the Senate: \"The conferees . . . rejected the repeal of the Norris-LaGuardia Act.\"\n27\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 195, 209]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe cannot accept the startling argument made here that even though Congress did not itself want to repeal the Norris-LaGuardia Act, it was willing to confer a power upon the courts to \"accommodate\" that Act out of existence whenever they might find it expedient to do so in furtherance of some policy they had fashioned under 301. The unequivocal statements in the House Conference Report and by Senator Taft on the floor of the Senate could only have been accepted by the Congressmen and Senators who read or heard them as assurances that they could vote in favor of 301 without altering, reducing or impairing in any manner the anti-injunction provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act. This is particularly true of the statement of Senator Taft, a man generally regarded in the Senate as a very able lawyer and one upon whom the Senate could rely for accurate, forthright explanations of legislation with which he was connected. Senator Taft was of course entirely familiar with the prohibitions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act and the impact those prohibitions would have upon the enforcement under 301 of all related contractual provisions, including contractual provisions dealing with arbitration. If, as this argument suggests, the intention of Congress in enacting 301 was to clear the way for judicial obliteration of that Act under the soft euphemism of \"accommodation,\" Senator Taft's flat statement that the Conference had rejected the repeal of the Norris-LaGuardia Act could only be regarded as disingenuous. We cannot impute any such intention to him.\n\nMoreover, we think that the idea that 301 sanctions piecemeal judicial repeal of the Norris-LaGuardia Act requires acceptance of a wholly unrealistic view of the manner in which Congress handles its business. The \n\n[370 \nU.S. 195, 210]\n\u00a0\n question of whether existing statutes should be continued in force or repealed is, under our system of government, one which is wholly within the domain of Congress. When the repeal of a highly significant law is urged upon that body and that repeal is rejected after careful consideration and discussion, the normal expectation is that courts will be faithful to their trust and abide by that decision. This is especially so where the fact of the controversy over repeal and the resolution of that controversy in Congress plainly appears in the formal legislative history of its proceedings.\n28\n Indeed, not a single instance has been called to our attention in which a carefully considered and rejected proposal for repeal has been revived and adopted by this Court under the guise of \"accommodation\" or any other pseudonym.\n\nNor have we found anything else in the previous decisions of this Court that would indicate that we should disregard all this overwhelming evidence of a congressional intent to retain completely intact the anti-injunction prohibitions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act in suits brought under 301. Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Chicago River & Indiana R. Co.,\n29\n upon which Sinclair places \n\n[370 \nU.S. 195, 211]\n\u00a0\n its primary reliance, is distinguishable on several grounds. There we were dealing with a strike called by the union in defiance of an affirmative duty, imposed upon the union by the Railway Labor Act itself, compelling unions to settle disputes as to the interpretation of an existing collective bargaining agreement, not by collective union pressures on the railroad but by submitting them to the Railroad Adjustment Board as the exclusive means of final determination of such \"minor\" disputes.\n30\n Here, on the other hand, we are dealing with a suit under a quite different law which does not itself compel a particular, exclusive method for settling disputes nor impose any requirement, either upon unions or employers, or upon the courts, that is in any way inconsistent with a continuation of the Norris-LaGuardia Act's proscription of federal labor injunctions against strikes and peaceful picketing. In addition, in Chicago River we were dealing with a statute that had a far different legislative history than the one now before us. Thus there was no indication in the legislative history of the Railway Labor Act, as there is in the history of 301, that Congress had, after full debate and careful consideration by both Houses and in Joint Conference, specifically rejected proposals to make the prohibitions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act inapplicable. Indeed, the Court was able to conclude in Chicago River \"that there was general understanding between both the supporters and the opponents of the 1934 amendment that the provisions dealing with the Adjustment Board were to be considered as compulsory arbitration in this limited field.\"\n31\n And certainly no one could \n\n[370 \nU.S. 195, 212]\n\u00a0\n contend that 301 was intended to set up any such system of \"compulsory arbitration\" as the exclusive method for settling grievances under the Taft-Hartley Act.\n\nTextile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills,\n32\n upon which some lesser reliance is placed, is equally distinguishable. There the Court held merely that it did not violate the anti-injunction provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act to compel the parties to a collective bargaining agreement to submit a dispute which had arisen under that agreement to arbitration where the agreement itself required arbitration of the dispute. In upholding the jurisdiction of the federal courts to issue such an order against a challenge based upon the Norris-LaGuardia Act, the Court pointed out that the equitable relief granted in that case - a mandatory injunction to carry out an agreement to arbitrate - did not enjoin any one of the kinds of conduct which the specific prohibitions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act withdrew from the injunctive powers of United States courts.\n33\n An injunction against work stoppages, peaceful picketing or the nonfraudulent encouraging of those activities would, however, prohibit the precise kinds of conduct which subsections (a), (e) and (i) of 4 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act unequivocally say cannot be prohibited.\n34\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 195, 213]\n\u00a0\n\n\nNor can we agree with the argument made in this Court that the decision in Lincoln Mills, as implemented by the subsequent decisions in United Steelworkers v. American Manufacturing Co.,\n35\n United Steelworkers v. Warrior & Gulf Navigation Co.,\n36\n and United Steelworkers v. Enterprise Wheel & Car Corp.,\n37\n requires us to reconsider and overrule the action of Congress in refusing to repeal or modify the controlling commands of the Norris-LaGuardia Act. To the extent that those cases relied upon the proposition that the arbitration process is \"a kingpin of federal labor policy,\" we think that proposition was founded not upon the policy predilections of this Court but upon what Congress said and did when it enacted 301. Certainly we cannot accept any suggestion which would undermine those cases by implying that the Court went beyond its proper power and itself \"forged . . . a kingpin of federal labor policy\" inconsistent with that section and its purpose. Consequently, we do not see how cases implementing the purpose of 301 can be said to have freed this Court from its duty to give effect to the plainly expressed congressional purpose with regard to the continued application of the anti-injunction provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act. The argument to the contrary seems to rest upon the notion that injunctions against peaceful strikes are necessary to make the arbitration process effective. But whatever might be said about the merits of this argument, Congress has itself rejected it. In doing so, it set the limit to which it was willing to go in permitting courts to effectuate the congressional policy favoring arbitration and it is not this Court's business to review the wisdom of that decision.\n\nThe plain fact is that 301, as passed by Congress, presents no conflict at all with the anti-injunction provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act. Obedience to the congressional \n\n[370 \nU.S. 195, 214]\n\u00a0\n commands of the Norris-LaGuardia Act does not directly affect the \"congressional policy in favor of the enforcement of agreements to arbitrate grievance disputes\"\n38\n at all for it does not impair the right of an employer to obtain an order compelling arbitration of any dispute that may have been made arbitrable by the provisions of an effective collective bargaining agreement. At the most, what is involved is the question of whether the employer is to be allowed to enjoy the benefits of an injunction along with the right which Congress gave him in 301 to sue for breach of a collective agreement. And as we have already pointed out, Congress was not willing to insure that enjoyment to an employer at the cost of putting the federal courts back into the business of enjoining strikes and other related peaceful union activities.\n\nIt is doubtless true, as argued, that the right to sue which 301 gives employers would be worth more to them if they could also get a federal court injunction to bar a breach of their collective bargaining agreements. Strong arguments are made to us that it is highly desirable that the Norris-LaGuardia Act be changed in the public interest. If that is so, Congress itself might see fit to change that law and repeal the anti-injunction provisions of the Act insofar as suits for violation of collective agreements are concerned, as the House bill under consideration originally provided. It might, on the other hand, decide that if injunctions are necessary, the whole idea of enforcement of these agreements by private suits should be discarded in favor of enforcement through the administrative machinery of the Labor Board, as Senator Taft provided in his Senate bill. Or it might decide that neither of these methods is entirely satisfactory and turn instead to a completely new approach. The question of what \n\n[370 \nU.S. 195, 215]\n\u00a0\n change, if any, should be made in the existing law is one of legislative policy properly within the exclusive domain of Congress - it is a question for lawmakers, not law interpreters. Our task is the more limited one of interpreting the law as it now stands. In dealing with problems of interpretation and application of federal statutes, we have no power to change deliberate choices of legislative policy that Congress has made within its constitutional powers. Where congressional intent is discernible - and here it seems crystal clear - we must give effect to that intent.\n39\n\u00a0\n\nThe District Court was correct in dismissing Count 3 of petitioner's complaint for lack of jurisdiction under the Norris-LaGuardia Act.

L. Rev. 635. That author, in urging that a strike in breach of a collective agreement should not now be held to involve or grow out of a \"labor dispute\" within the meaning of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, states: \"After all, 1932 was a long time ago and conditions have changed drastically. Judges who still confuse violations of collective agreements with 13 labor disputes and 4 conduct have, in my opinion, lost contact with reality. The passage of time has operated as a function of many other types of judicial output at the highest level. I do not see why it should not do so in this instance, as well.\" Id., at 645-646, n. 39.

It is \n\n[370 \nU.S. 195, 204]\n\u00a0\n sufficient here to note that the reasons which led to the passage of the Act were substantial and that the Act has been an important part of the pattern of legislation under which unions have functioned for nearly 30 years.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] Section 301 (e) of the Act, 61 Stat. 156, 29 U.S.C. 185 (e), provides: \"For the purposes of this section, in determining whether any person is acting as an `agent' of another person so as to make such other person responsible for his acts, the question of whether the specific acts performed were actually authorized or subsequently ratified shall not be controlling.\" This, of course, was designed to and did repeal for purposes of suits under 301 the previously controlling provisions of 6 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 47 Stat. 71, 29 U.S.C. 106: \"No officer or member of any association or organization, and no association or organization participating or interested in a labor dispute, shall be held responsible or liable in any court of the United States for the unlawful acts of individual officers, members, or agents, except upon clear proof of actual participation in, or actual authorization of, such acts, or of ratification of such acts after actual knowledge thereof.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 18\n] 61 Stat. 146, 155, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 160 (h), 178 (b).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 19\n] 61 Stat. 157, 29 U.S.C. 186 (e). That this section, which stands alone in expressly permitting suits for injunctions previously proscribed by the Norris-LaGuardia Act to be brought in the federal courts by private litigants under the Taft-Hartley Act, deals with an unusually sensitive and important problem is shown by the fact that 186 makes the conduct so enjoinable a crime punishable by both fine and imprisonment.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] This fact was expressly recognized by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in A.

Another commentator, though urging his own belief that a strike in breach of a collective agreement is not a \"labor dispute\" within the Norris-LaGuardia Act, nevertheless admits that Congress thought it was and deliberately \n\n[370 \nU.S. 195, 206]\n\u00a0\n decided to leave the anti-injunction provisions of that Act applicable to 301 suits.

Immediately prior to this remark, Senator Taft had inserted into the Record a written summary of his understanding as to the effect of the conference upon the bill passed by the Senate: \"When the bill passed the Senate it also contained a sixth paragraph in this subsection [8 (a)] which made it an unfair labor practice for an employer to violate the terms of a collective-bargaining agreement or the terms of an agreement to submit a labor dispute to arbitration. The House conferees objected to this provision on the ground that it would have the effect of making the terms of every collective agreement subject to interpretation and determination by the Board, rather than by the courts. The Senate conferees ultimately agreed to its elimination as well as the deletion of a similar provision contained in subsection 8 (b) (5) of the Senate amendment which made it an unfair labor practice for a labor organization to violate the terms of collective-bargaining agreements. The provisions of the Senate amendment which conferred a right of action for damages upon a party aggrieved by breach of a collective-bargaining \n\n[370 \nU.S. 195, 209]\n\u00a0\n contract, however, were retained in the conference agreement (section 301).\" 93 Cong. Rec. 6443, II Leg. Hist. 1539. (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n[\nFootnote 28\n] The legislative history of the Taft-Hartley Act shows that Congress actually considered and relied upon this normal functioning of the judicial power as insuring that no unintended repeal of the anti-injunction provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act would be declared. Thus Senator Taft, when pressed by Senator Morse with regard to the possibility that a provision inserted in 303 (a) declaring secondary boycotts unlawful might be held to justify an injunction previously forbidden by the Norris-LaGuardia Act, stated: \"Let me say in reply to the Senator or anyone else who makes the same argument, that that is not the intention of the author of the amendment. It is not his belief as to the effect of it. It is not the advice of counsel to the committee.

Lincoln Mills, \n353 \nU.S. 448\n, at 458-459.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 39\n] We have not ignored Sinclair's argument that to apply the Norris-LaGuardia Act here would deprive it of its constitutional right to equal protection of the law, both because of an allegedly unlawful discrimination between Taft-Hartley Act employers and Railway Labor Act employers by virtue of the decision in Chicago River, and because of an allegedly unlawful discrimination between Taft-Hartley Act employers and unions by virtue of the decision in Lincoln Mills. We deem it sufficient to say that we do not find either of these arguments compelling.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and MR. JUSTICE HARLAN join, dissenting.\n\nI believe that the Court has reached the wrong result because it has answered only the first of the questions which must be answered to decide this case. Of course 301 of the Taft-Hartley Act did not, for purposes of \n\n[370 \nU.S. 195, 216]\n\u00a0\n actions brought under it, \"repeal\" 4 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act. But the two provisions do coexist, and it is clear beyond dispute that they apply to the case before us in apparently conflicting senses. Our duty, therefore, is to seek out that accommodation of the two which will give the fullest possible effect to the central purposes of both. Since such accommodation is possible, the Court's failure to follow that path leads it to a result - not justified by either the language or history of 301 - which is wholly at odds with our earlier handling of directly analogous situations and which cannot be woven intelligibly into the broader fabric of related decisions.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nSection 301 of the Taft-Hartley Act, enacted in 1947, authorizes Federal District Courts to entertain \"[s]uits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization . . . .\" It does not in terms address itself to the question of remedies. As we have construed 301, it casts upon the District Courts a special responsibility to carry out contractual schemes for arbitration, by holding parties to that favored process for settlement when it has been contracted for, and by then regarding its result as conclusive.\n1\n At the same time, 4 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, enacted in 1932, proscribes the issuance by federal courts of injunctions against various concerted activities \"in any case involving or growing out of any labor dispute.\" But the enjoining of a strike over an arbitrable grievance may be indispensable to the effective enforcement of an arbitration scheme in a collective agreement; thus the power to grant that injunctive remedy may be essential to the uncrippled performance of the Court's \n\n[370 \nU.S. 195, 217]\n\u00a0\n function under 301.\n2\n Therefore, to hold that 301 did not repeal 4 is only a beginning. Having so held, the Court should - but does not - go on to consider how it is to deal with the surface conflict between the two statutory commands.\n\nThe Court has long acted upon the premise that the Norris-LaGuardia Act does not stand in isolation. It is one of several statutes which, taken together, shape the national labor policy. Accordingly, the Court has recognized that Norris-LaGuardia does not invariably bar injunctive relief when necessary to achieve an important objective of some other statute in the pattern of labor laws. See Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Chicago River R. Co., \n353 \nU.S. 30\n; Graham v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, \n338 \nU.S. 232\n; Virginian R. Co. v. System Federation, \n300 \nU.S. 515, 562\n-563. In Chicago River we insisted that there \"must be an accommodation of [the Norris-LaGuardia Act] and the Railway Labor Act so that the obvious purpose in the enactment of each is preserved.\"\n3\n\u00a0\n\nThese decisions refusing inflexible application of Norris-LaGuardia point to the necessity of a careful inquiry whether the surface conflict between 301 and 4 is irreconcilable in the setting before us: a strike over a \n\n[370 \nU.S. 195, 218]\n\u00a0\n grievance which both parties have agreed to settle by binding arbitration. I think that there is nothing in either the language of 301 or its history to prevent 4's here being accommodated with it, just as 4 was accommodated with the Railway Labor Act.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nIt cannot be denied that the availability of the injunctive remedy in this setting is far more necessary to the accomplishment of the purposes of 301 than it would be detrimental to those of Norris-LaGuardia. Chicago River makes this plain. We there held that the federal courts, notwithstanding Norris-LaGuardia, may enjoin strikes over disputes as to the interpretation of an existing collective agreement, since such strikes flout the duty imposed on the union by the Railway Labor Act to settle such \"minor disputes\" by submission to the National Railroad Adjustment Board rather than by concerted economic pressures. We so held, even though the Railway Labor Act contains no express prohibition of strikes over \"minor disputes,\" because we found it essential to the meaningful enforcement of that Act - and because the existence of mandatory arbitration eliminated one of the problems to which Norris-LaGuardia was chiefly addressed, namely, that \"the injunction strips labor of its primary weapon without substituting any reasonable alternative.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nThat reasoning is applicable with equal force to an injunction under 301 to enforce a union's contractual duty, also binding on the employer, to submit certain disputes to terminal arbitration and to refrain from striking over them. The federal law embodied in 301 stresses the effective enforcement of such arbitration \n\n[370 \nU.S. 195, 219]\n\u00a0\n agreements. When one of them is about to be sabotaged by a strike, 301 has as strong a claim upon an accommodating interpretation of 4 as does the compulsory arbitration law of the Railway Labor Act. It is equally true in both cases that \"[an injunction] alone can effectively guard the plaintiff's right,\" Machinists v. Street, \n367 \nU.S. 740, 773\n. It is equally true in both cases that the employer's specifically enforceable obligation to arbitrate provides a \"reasonable alternative\" to the strike weapon. It is equally true in both cases that a major contributing cause for the enactment of Norris-LaGuardia - the at-largeness of federal judges in enjoining activities thought to seek \"unlawful ends\" or to constitute \"unlawful means\"\n5\n - is not involved. Indeed, there is in this case a factor weighing in favor of the issuance of an injunction which was not present in Chicago River:\n6\n the express contractual commitment of the union to refrain from striking, viewed in light of the overriding purpose of 301 to assist the enforcement of collective agreements.\n\nIn any event, I should have thought that the question was settled by Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills, \n353 \nU.S. 448\n. In that case, the Court held that the procedural requirements of Norris-LaGuardia's 7, although in terms fully applicable, would not apply so as to frustrate a federal court's effective enforcement under 301 of an employer's obligation to arbitrate. It is strange, I think, that 7 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act need not be read, in the face of 301, to impose inapt procedural restrictions upon the specific enforcement of an employer's \n\n[370 \nU.S. 195, 220]\n\u00a0\n contractual duty to arbitrate; but that 4 must be read, despite 301, to preclude absolutely the issuance of an injunction against a strike which ignores a union's identical duty.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nThe legislative history of 301 affords the Court no refuge from the compelling effect of our prior decisions. That history shows that Congress considered and rejected \"the advisability of repealing the Norris-LaGuardia Act insofar as suits based upon breach of collective bargaining agreements are concerned . . . .\"\n7\n But congressional rejection of outright repeal certainly does not imply hostility to an attempt by the courts to accommodate all statutes pertinent to the decision of cases before them. Again, the Court's conclusion stems from putting the wrong question. When it is appreciated that there is no question here of \"repeal,\" but rather one of how the Court is to apply the whole statutory complex to the case before it, it becomes clear that the legislative history does not support the Court's conclusion. First, however, it seems appropriate to discuss, as the Court has done, the language of 301 considered in light of other provisions of the statute.\n\nThere is nothing in the words of 301 which so much as intimates any limitation to damage remedies when the asserted breach of contract consists of concerted activity. The section simply authorizes the District Courts to entertain and decide suits for violation of collective contracts. Taking the language alone, the irresistible implication would be that the District Courts were to employ their regular arsenal of remedies appropriately to the situation. That would mean, of course, that injunctive relief could be afforded when damages would not be an adequate remedy. This much, surely, is settled by Lincoln \n\n[370 \nU.S. 195, 221]\n\u00a0\n Mills. But the Court reasons that the failure of 301 explicitly to repeal 4 of Norris-LaGuardia completely negates the availability of injunctive relief in any case where that provision - in the absence of 301 - would apply. That reasoning stems from attaching undue significance to the fact that express repeal of Norris-LaGuardia provisions may be found in certain other sections of the Taft-Hartley Act - from which the Court concludes \"not only that Congress was completely familiar with those provisions but also that it regarded an express declaration of inapplicability as the normal and proper manner of repealing them in situations where such repeal seemed desirable.\"\n8\n Even on this analysis the most that can be deduced from such a comparative reading is that while repeal of Norris-LaGuardia seemed desirable to Congress in certain other contexts, repeal did not seem desirable in connection with 301.\n\nSound reasons explain why repeal of Norris-LaGuardia provisions, acceptable in other settings, might have been found ill-suited for the purpose of 301. And those reasons fall far short of a design to preclude absolutely the issuance under 301 of any injunction against an activity included in 4 of Norris-LaGuardia. Section 10 (h) of the Act\n9\n simply lifts the 4 barrier in connection with proceedings brought by the National Labor Relations Board - in the Courts of Appeals for enforcement of Board cease-and-desist orders against unfair labor practices, and in the District Courts for interlocutory relief against activities being prosecuted before the Board as unfair labor practices. This repeal in aid of government litigation to enforce carefully drafted prohibitions already in the Act as unfair labor practices was, obviously, entirely \n\n[370 \nU.S. 195, 222]\n\u00a0\n appropriate, definitely limited in scope, predictable in effect, and devoid of any risk of abuse or misunderstanding. Much the same is true of 208 (b) of Taft-Hartley,\n10\n which simply repeals Norris-LaGuardia in a case where the Attorney General seeks an injunction at the direction of the President, who must be of the opinion - after having been advised by a board of inquiry - that continuation of the strike in question would imperil the national health and safety.\n\nOnly in 302 (e) of Taft-Hartley\n11\n is there found a repeal of Norris-LaGuardia's anti-injunction provisions in favor of a suit by a private litigant.\n12\n The District Courts are there authorized to restrain the payment by employers and the acceptance by employee representatives of unauthorized payments in the nature of bribes. Not only is the problem thus dealt with \"unusually sensitive and important,\" as the Court notes,\n13\n but the repeal of Norris-LaGuardia is clearly, predictably, and narrowly confined to one kind of suit over one kind of injury; and obviously it presents no possible threat to the important purposes of that Act.\n\nHow different was the problem posed by 301, which broadly authorized District Courts to decide suits for breach of contract. The Congress understandably may not have felt able to predict what provisions would crop up in collective bargaining agreements, to foresee the settings in which these would become subjects of litigation, \n\n[370 \nU.S. 195, 223]\n\u00a0\n or to forecast the rules of law which the courts would apply. The consequences of repealing the anti-injunction provisions in this context would have been completely unknowable, and outright repeal, therefore, might well have seemed unthinkable. Congress, clearly, had no intention of abandoning wholesale the Norris-LaGuardia policies in contract suits; but it does not follow that 301 is not the equal of 4 in cases which implicate both provisions.\n\nIndeed, it might with as much force be said that Congress knew well how to limit remedies against employee activities to damages when that was what it intended, as that Congress knew how to repeal Norris-LaGuardia when that was what it intended. Section 303 of Taft-Hartley\n14\n authorizes private actions for damages resulting from certain concerted employee activities. When that section was introduced on the Senate floor, it provided for injunctive relief as well. Extended debate revealed strong sentiment against the injunction feature, which incorporated a repeal of Norris-LaGuardia. The section's supporters, therefore, proposed a different version which provided for damages only. In this form, the section was adopted by the Senate - and later by the Conference and the House.\n15\n Certainly, after this experience Congress would have used language confining 301 to damage remedies when it was invoked against concerted activity, if such had been the intention.\n\nThe statutory language thus fails to support the Court's position. The inference is at least as strong that Congress was content to rely upon the courts to resolve any seeming conflicts between 301 and 4 as they arose in the relatively manageable setting of particular cases, as that Congress intended to limit to damages the remedies \n\n[370 \nU.S. 195, 224]\n\u00a0\n courts could afford against concerted activities under 301. The Court then should so exercise its judgment as best to effect the most important purposes of each statute. It should not be bound by inscrutable congressional silence to a wooden preference for one statute over the other.\n\nNor does the legislative history of 301 suggest any different conclusion. As the Court notes, the House version would have repealed Norris-LaGuardia in suits brought under the new section.\n16\n The Senate version of 301, like the section as enacted, did not deal with Norris-LaGuardia, but neither did it limit the remedies available against concerted activity.\n17\n Thus any attempt to ascertain the Senate's intention would face the same choices as those I have suggested in dealing with the language of 301 as finally enacted. It follows that to construe the Conference Committee's elimination of the House repeal as leaving open the possibility of judicial accommodation is at least as reasonable as to conclude that Congress, by its silence, was directing the courts to disregard 301 whenever opposition from 4 was encountered.\n18\n\u00a0\n\nI emphasize that the question in this case is not whether the basic policy embodied in Norris-LaGuardia against the injunction of activities of labor unions has been abandoned in actions under 301; the question is simply whether injunctions are barred against strikes over grievances \n\n[370 \nU.S. 195, 225]\n\u00a0\n which have been routed to arbitration by a contract specifically enforceable against both the union and the employer. Enforced adherence to such arbitration commitments has emerged as a dominant motif in the developing federal law of collective bargaining agreements. But there is no general federal anti-strike policy; and although a suit may be brought under 301 against strikes which, while they are breaches of private contracts, do not threaten any additional public policy, in such cases the anti-injunction policy of Norris-LaGuardia should prevail. Insistence upon strict application of Norris-LaGuardia to a strike over a dispute which both parties are bound by contract to arbitrate threatens a leading policy of our labor relations law. But there may be no such threat if the union has made no binding agreement to arbitrate; and if the employer cannot be compelled to arbitrate, restraining the strike would cut deep into the core of Norris-LaGuardia. Therefore, unless both parties are so bound, limiting an employer's remedy to damages might well be appropriate. The susceptibility of particular concrete situations to this sort of analysis shows that rejection of an outright repeal of 4 was wholly consistent with acceptance of a technique of accommodation which would lead, in some cases, to the granting of injunctions against concerted activity. Accommodation requires only that the anti-injunction policy of Norris-LaGuardia not intrude into areas, not vital to its ends, where injunctive relief is vital to a purpose of 301; it does not require unconditional surrender.\n\n\nIV.\n\n\n\nToday's decision cannot be fitted harmoniously into the pattern of prior decisions on analogous and related matters. Considered in their light, the decision leads inescapably to results consistent neither with any imaginable legislative purpose nor with sound judicial administration. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 195, 226]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have held that uniform doctrines of federal labor law are to be fashioned judicially in suits brought under 301, Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills, \n353 \nU.S. 448\n; that actions based on collective agreements remain cognizable in state as well as federal courts, Dowd Box Co. v. Courtney, \n368 \nU.S. 502\n; and that state courts must apply federal law in such actions, Teamsters Local v. Lucas Flour Co., \n369 \nU.S. 95\n.\n\nThe question arises whether today's prohibition of injunctive relief is to be carried over to state courts as a part of the federal law governing collective agreements. If so, 301, a provision plainly designed to enhance the responsibility of unions to their contracts, will have had the opposite effect of depriving employers of a state remedy they enjoyed prior to its enactment.\n\nOn the other hand if, as today's literal reading suggests\n19\n and as a leading state decision holds,\n20\n States remain free to apply their injunctive remedies against concerted activities in breach of contract, the development of a uniform body of federal contract law is in for hard times. So long as state courts remain free to grant the injunctions unavailable in federal courts, suits seeking relief against concerted activities in breach of contract will be channeled to the States whenever possible. Ironically, state rather than federal courts will be the preferred instruments to protect the integrity of the arbitration process, which Lincoln Mills and the Steelworkers decisions forged into a kingpin of federal labor policy. Enunciation of uniform doctrines applicable in such cases will be severely impeded. Moreover, the type of relief available in a particular instance will turn on fortuities \n\n[370 \nU.S. 195, 227]\n\u00a0\n of locale and susceptibility to process - depending upon which States have anti-injunction statutes and how they construe them.\n\nI have not overlooked the possibility that removal of the state suit to the federal court might provide the answer to these difficulties. But if 4 is to be read literally, removal will not be allowed.\n21\n And if it is allowed, the result once again is that 301 will have had the strange consequence of taking away a contract remedy available before its enactment.\n\n\nV.\n\n\n\nThe decision deals a crippling blow to the cause of grievance arbitration itself. Arbitration is so highly regarded as a proved technique for industrial peace that even the Norris-LaGuardia Act fosters its use.\n22\n But since unions cannot be enjoined by a federal court from striking in open defiance of their undertakings to arbitrate, employers will pause long before committing themselves to obligations enforceable against them but not against their unions. The Court does not deny the desirability, indeed, necessity, for injunctive relief against a strike over an arbitrable grievance.\n23\n The Court says only that federal courts may not grant such relief, that Congress must amend 4 if those courts are to give substance to the congressional plan of encouraging peaceable settlements of grievances through arbitration. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 195, 228]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nVI.\n\n\n\nA District Court entertaining an action under 301 may not grant injunctive relief against concerted activity unless and until it decides that the case is one in which an injunction would be appropriate despite the Norris-LaGuardia Act. When a strike is sought to be enjoined because it is over a grievance which both parties are contractually bound to arbitrate, the District Court may issue no injunctive order until it first holds that the contract does have that effect; and the employer should be ordered to arbitrate, as a condition of his obtaining an injunction against the strike. Beyond this, the District Court must, of course, consider whether issuance of an injunction would be warranted under ordinary principles of equity - whether breaches are occurring and will continue, or have been threatened and will be committed; whether they have caused or will cause irreparable injury to the employer; and whether the employer will suffer more from the denial of an injunction than will the union from its issuance.\n\nIn the case before us, the union enjoys the contractual right to make the employer submit to final and binding arbitration of any employee grievance. At the same time, the union agrees that \"[T]here shall be no strikes . . . for any cause which is or may be the subject of a grievance.\"\n24\n The complaint alleged that the union had, over the past several months, repeatedly engaged in \"quickie\" strikes over arbitrable grievances. Under the contract and the complaint, then, the District Court might conclude that there have occurred and will continue to occur breaches of contract of a type to which the principle of accommodation applies. It follows that rather than dismissing the complaint's request for an injunction, the \n\n[370 \nU.S. 195, 229]\n\u00a0\n Court should remand the case to the District Court with directions to consider whether to grant the relief sought - an injunction against future repetitions. This would entail a weighing of the employer's need for such an injunction against the harm that might be inflicted upon legitimate employee activity. It would call into question the feasibility of setting up in futuro contempt sanctions against the union (for striking) and against the employer (for refusing to arbitrate) in regard to prospective disputes which might fall more or less clearly into the adjudicated category of arbitrable grievances. In short, the District Court will have to consider with great care whether it is possible to draft a decree which would deal equitably with all the interests at stake.\n\nI would reverse the Court of Appeals and remand to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this dissenting opinion.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills, \n353 \nU.S. 448\n; Steelworkers v. American Mfg. Co., \n363 \nU.S. 564\n; Steelworkers v. Warrior & Gulf Co., \n363 \nU.S. 574\n; Steelworkers v.

Chicago River R. Co., \n353 \nU.S. 30, 39\n, we recognized that allowing a strike over an arbitrable dispute would effectively \"defeat the jurisdiction\" of the arbitrator.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] \n353 \nU.S., at 40\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Id., at 41.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] See, e. g., S.

With him on the briefs were Stuart Rothman, Dominick L. Manoli and Norton J. Come.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nPetitioner is a building maintenance employee of respondent Evening News Association, a newspaper publisher engaged in interstate commerce, and is a member of the Newspaper Guild of Detroit, a labor organization having a collective bargaining contract with respondent. Petitioner, individually and as assignee of 49 other similar employees who were also Guild members, sued respondent for breach of contract in the Circuit Court of \n\n[371 \nU.S. 195, 196]\n\u00a0\n Wayne County, Michigan.\n1\n The complaint stated that in December 1955 and January 1956 other employees of respondent, belonging to another union, were on strike and respondent did not permit petitioner and his assignors to report to their regular shifts, although they were ready, able and available for work.\n2\n During the same period, however, employees of the editorial, advertising and business departments, not covered by collective bargaining agreements, were permitted to report for work and were paid full wages even though there was no work available. Respondent's refusal to pay full wages to petitioner and his assignors while paying the nonunion employees, the complaint asserted, violated a clause in the contract providing that \"there shall be no discrimination against any employee because of his membership or activity in the Guild.\"\n\nThe trial court sustained respondent's motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction on the ground that the allegations, if true, would make out an unfair labor practice under the National Labor Relations Act and hence the subject matter was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board. The Michigan Supreme Court affirmed, 362 Mich. 350, 106 N. W. 2d 785, relying upon San Diego Trades Council v. Garmon, \n359 \nU.S. 236\n, and like pre-emption cases.\n3\n Certiorari was granted, \n369 \nU.S. 827\n, after the decisions of this Court in Local 174, Teamsters v. Lucas Flour Co., \n369 \nU.S. 95\n, and Dowd Box Co. v. Courtney, \n368 \nU.S. 502\n. \n\n[371 \nU.S. 195, 197]\n\u00a0\n\n\nLucas Flour and Dowd Box, as well as the later Atkinson v. Sinclair Refining Co., \n370 \nU.S. 238\n, were suits upon collective bargaining contracts brought or held to arise under 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act\n4\n and in these cases the jurisdiction of the courts was sustained although it was seriously urged that the conduct involved was arguably protected or prohibited by the National Labor Relations Act and therefore within the exclusive jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board. In Lucas Flour as well as in Atkinson the Court expressly refused to apply the pre-emption doctrine of the Garmon case; and we likewise reject that doctrine here where the alleged conduct of the employer, not only arguably, but concededly, is an unfair labor practice within the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board.\n5\n The authority of the Board to deal with an unfair labor practice which also violates a collective bargaining contract is not displaced by 301, but it is not exclusive and does not destroy the jurisdiction of the courts in suits under 301. If, as respondent strongly urges, there are situations in which serious problems will arise from both the courts and the Board having jurisdiction over acts \n\n[371 \nU.S. 195, 198]\n\u00a0\n which amount to an unfair labor practice, we shall face those cases when they arise. This is not one of them, in our view, and the National Labor Relations Board is in accord.\n6\n\u00a0\n\nWe are left with respondent's claim that the predicate for escaping the Garmon rule is not present here because this action by an employee to collect wages in the form of damages is not among those \"suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization . . .,\" as provided in 301. There is support for respondent's position in decisions of the Courts of Appeals,\n7\n and in Association of Westinghouse Salaried Employees v. Westinghouse Corp., \n348 \nU.S. 437\n, a majority of the Court in three separate opinions concluded that 301 did not give the federal courts jurisdiction over a suit brought by a union to enforce employee rights which were variously characterized as \"peculiar in the individual benefit which is their subject matter,\" \"uniquely personal\" and arising \"from separate hiring contracts between the employer and each employee.\" Id., at 460, 461, 464. \n\n[371 \nU.S. 195, 199]\n\u00a0\n\n\nHowever, subsequent decisions here have removed the underpinnings of Westinghouse and its holding is no longer authoritative as a precedent. Three of the Justices in that case were driven to their conclusion because in their view 301 was procedural only, not substantive, and therefore grave constitutional questions would be raised if 301 was held to extend to the controversy there involved.\n8\n However, the same three Justices observed that if, contrary to their belief, \"Congress has itself defined the law or authorized the federal courts to fashion the judicial rules governing this question, it would be self-defeating to limit the scope of the power of the federal courts to less than is necessary to accomplish this congressional aim.\" Id., at 442. Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills, \n353 \nU.S. 448\n, of course, has long since settled that 301 has substantive content and that Congress has directed the courts to formulate and apply federal law to suits for violation of collective bargaining contracts. There is no constitutional difficulty and 301 is not to be given a narrow reading. Id., at 456, 457. Section 301 has been applied to suits to compel arbitration of such individual grievances as rates of pay, hours of work and wrongful discharge, Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills, supra; General Electric Co. v. Local 205, UEW, \n353 \nU.S. 547\n; to obtain specific enforcement of an arbitrator's award ordering reinstatement and back pay to individual employees, United Steelworkers v. Enterprise Wheel & Car Corp., \n363 \nU.S. 593\n; to recover wage increases in a contest over the validity of the collective bargaining contract, Dowd Box Co. v. Courtney, supra; and to suits against individual union members for violation of a \n\n[371 \nU.S. 195, 200]\n\u00a0\n no-strike clause contained in a collective bargaining agreement. Atkinson v. Sinclair Refining Co., supra.\n\nThe concept that all suits to vindicate individual employee rights arising from a collective bargaining contract should be excluded from the coverage of 301 has thus not survived. The rights of individual employees concerning rates of pay and conditions of employment are a major focus of the negotiation and administration of collective bargaining contracts. Individual claims lie at the heart of the grievance and arbitration machinery, are to a large degree inevitably intertwined with union interests and many times precipitate grave questions concerning the interpretation and enforceability of the collective bargaining contract on which they are based. To exclude these claims from the ambit of 301 would stultify the congressional policy of having the administration of collective bargaining contracts accomplished under a uniform body of federal substantive law. This we are unwilling to do.\n\nThe same considerations foreclose respondent's reading of 301 to exclude all suits brought by employees instead of unions. The word \"between,\" it suggests, refers to \"suits,\" not \"contracts,\" and therefore only suits between unions and employers are within the purview of 301. According to this view, suits by employees for breach of a collective bargaining contract would not arise under 301 and would be governed by state law, if not pre-empted by Garmon, as this one would be, whereas a suit by a union for the same breach of the same contract would be a 301 suit ruled by federal law. Neither the language and structure of 301 nor its legislative history requires or persuasively supports this restrictive interpretation, which would frustrate rather than serve the congressional policy expressed in that section. \"The possibility that individual contract terms might have different meanings \n\n[371 \nU.S. 195, 201]\n\u00a0\n under state and federal law would inevitably exert a disruptive influence upon both the negotiation and administration of collective agreements.\" Local 174, Teamsters v. Lucas Flour Co., supra, at 103.\n\nWe conclude that petitioner's action arises under 301 and is not pre-empted under the Garmon rule.\n9\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Michigan is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n     Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] There was no grievance arbitration procedure in this contract which had to be exhausted before recourse could be had to the courts.

J.) and cases cited therein.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Two other Justices, in a separate opinion, concluded that under 301 a union as a party plaintiff may not enforce the wage claims of individual employees.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] The only part of the collective bargaining contract set out in this record is the no-discrimination clause. Respondent does not argue here and we need not consider the question of federal law of whether petitioner, under this contract, has standing to sue for breach of the no-discrimination clause nor do we deal with the standing of other employees to sue upon other clauses in other contracts.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, dissenting.\n\nI would affirm the Michigan Supreme Court's holding that Michigan courts are without jurisdiction to entertain suits by employees against their employers for damages measured by \"back pay\" based on discrimination, which discrimination 8 (a) of the National Labor Relations Act makes an unfair labor practice and which 10 (b) and (c) subject to the jurisdiction of the Labor Board with power after hearings to award \"back pay.\" It is true that there have been expressions in recent cases which indicate that a suit for the violation of a collective bargaining contract may be brought in a state or federal court even though the conduct objected to was also arguably an unfair labor practice within the Labor Board's jurisdiction.\n1\n It seems clear to me that these expressions of \n\n[371 \nU.S. 195, 202]\n\u00a0\n opinion were not necessary to the decisions in those cases\n2\n and that neither these prior decisions nor 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act requires us to hold that either employers or unions can be made to defend themselves against governmental regulation and sanctions of the same type for the same conduct by both courts and the Labor Board. Such duplication of governmental supervision over industrial relationships is bound to create the same undesirable confusion, conflicts, and burdensome proceedings that the National Labor Relations Act was designed to prevent, as we have interpreted that Act in prior cases like San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, \n359 \nU.S. 236\n (1959).\n\nOne example is enough to show how Congress' policy of confining controversies over unfair labor practices to the Labor Board might well be frustrated by permitting unfair labor practice claimants to choose whether they will seek relief in the courts or before the Board. Section 10 (b) of the Act provides that \"no complaint shall issue based upon any unfair labor practice occurring more than six months prior to the filing of the charge with the Board . . . .\" In contrast, the statute of limitations in Michigan governing breach of contract suits like this is six years.\n3\n The Court's holding thus opens up a way to \n\n[371 \nU.S. 195, 203]\n\u00a0\n defeat the congressional plan, adopted over vigorous minority objection, to expedite industrial peace by requiring that both the complaining party and the Board act promptly in the initiation of unfair labor practice proceedings.\n4\n Instead, by permitting suits like this one to be filed, it is now not only possible but highly probable that unfair labor practice disputes will hang on like festering sores that grow worse and worse with the years.\n5\n Of course this Court could later, by another major statutory surgical operation, apply the six-months Labor Board statute of limitations to actions for breach of collective bargaining contracts under 301. But if such drastic changes are to be wrought in the Act that Congress passed, it seems important to me that this Court should wait for Congress to perform that operation.\n\nThere is another reason why I cannot agree with the Court's disposition of this case. In the last note on the last page of its opinion, the Court says:\n\n \"The only part of the collective bargaining contract set out in this record is the no-discrimination clause. Respondent does not argue here and we need not consider the question of federal law of whether petitioner, under this contract, has standing to sue for breach of the no-discrimination clause nor do we deal with the standing of other employees to sue upon other clauses in other contracts.\" \n\n[371 \nU.S. 195, 204]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Unless my reading of this note is wrong, the Court purports to reserve the question of whether an employee who has suffered the kind of damages here alleged arising from breach of a collective bargaining agreement can file a lawsuit for himself under 301. Earlier in its opinion the Court decides that a claim for individual wages or back pay is within the subject-matter jurisdiction of courts under 301, that is, that such a claim is of the type that the courts are empowered to determine. The Court then rejects respondent's argument that an individual employee can never under any circumstances bring a 301 suit. But it seems to me that the Court studiously refrains from saying when, for what kinds of breach, or under what circumstances an individual employee can bring a 301 action and when he must step aside for the union to prosecute his claim. Nor does the Court decide whether the suit brought in this case is one of the types which an individual can bring. This puzzles me. This Court usually refrains from deciding important questions of federal law such as are involved in this case without first satisfying itself that the party raising those questions is entitled (has standing) to prosecute the case. It seems to me to be at least a slight deviation from the Court's normal practice to determine the law that would be applicable in a particular lawsuit while leaving open the question of whether such a lawsuit has even been brought in the particular case the court is deciding. This Court has not heretofore thought itself authorized to render advisory opinions. Moreover, I am wholly unable to agree that the right of these individuals to bring this lawsuit under 301 was not argued here.\n\nFinally, since the Court is deciding that this type of action can be brought to vindicate workers' rights, I think it should also decide clearly and unequivocally whether an employee injured by the discrimination of either his employer or his union can file and prosecute his \n\n[371 \nU.S. 195, 205]\n\u00a0\n own lawsuit in his own way. I cannot believe that Congress intended by the National Labor Relations Act either as originally passed or as amended by 301 to take away rights to sue which individuals have freely exercised in this country at least since the concept of due process of law became recognized as a guiding principle in our jurisprudence. And surely the Labor Act was not intended to relegate workers with lawsuits to the status of wards either of companies or of unions.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Atkinson v. Sinclair Rfg.

In my view, none of the activities in any of these cases were even arguably unfair labor practices subject to the Labor Board's jurisdiction, and the Court did not suggest that they were.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Mich.

PICKARD(1962)\nNo. 46\nArgued: October 16, 1962Decided: November 5, 1962\n\n\n\n\n In the circumstances of this case, in which two different suits under the Miller Act were brought in two different District Courts by the same subcontractor against the same general contractor and its surety, based on separate projects in the two Districts, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 13 (a) did not compel a counterclaim, which involved a payment that had not been allocated as between the projects, to be made in whichever of the two suits the first responsive pleading was filed. Its assertion in the later of the two suits, to which the general contractor, not without reason, considered it more appurtenant, did not violate Rule 13 (a). Pp. 57-61.\n\n 293 F.2d 493, reversed in part and case remanded.\n\nWilliam J. Harbison argued the cause for petitioners. On the briefs were Charles C. Trabue, Jr. and Harry S. McCowen.\n\nEdward Gallagher argued the cause and filed briefs for respondent.\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\nSouthern Construction Company, one of the petitioners here, was the prime contractor on contracts with the United States for the rehabilitation of certain barracks at Fort Campbell, Tennessee, and Fort Benning, Georgia. There were three contracts covering the Georgia project and one covering the Tennessee project. Pursuant to the provisions of the Miller Act, 49 Stat. 793, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 270a-270d, Southern furnished performance and payment bonds, with Continental Casualty Company, co-petitioner here, as surety. The plumbing and heating \n\n[371 \nU.S. 57, 58]\n\u00a0\n subcontractor on both projects was the respondent Samuel J. Pickard, doing business as Pickard Engineering Company. Pickard's primary supplier on both projects was the Atlas Supply Company.\n\nIn December 1955, Pickard's men left the Tennessee job before it was fully completed, and shortly thereafter left the Georgia project. Atlas, Pickard's supplier, claimed that $34,520 was due it for materials furnished on the Tennessee job and $104,000 for materials furnished on the Georgia project. Following a conference in August 1956 between Southern officials and representatives of Atlas, Southern paid Atlas $35,000 in exchange for a complete release of all liability of Southern on Pickard's accounts with respect to both the Georgia and Tennessee projects.\n1\n\u00a0\n\nIn December 1956, acting under the provisions of the Miller Act, Pickard brought suit, in the name of the United States, in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia against Southern and Continental for recovery of amounts allegedly owing on both the Georgia and Tennessee jobs. In January 1957, Southern filed an answer and a counterclaim in which it alleged that Southern had paid out more than the contract price on both jobs and in which recovery of the excess was sought. The $35,000 payment to Atlas was at that time included in the counterclaim.\n\nThe Miller Act, however, requires that suits instituted under its provisions \"shall be brought . . . in the United States District Court for any district in which the contract was to be performed and executed and not elsewhere . . . .\" 40 U.S.C. 270b (b). Since this statute appeared to prohibit an action in the Georgia District Court on the Tennessee project, Pickard in April 1957 \n\n[371 \nU.S. 57, 59]\n\u00a0\n filed the present action against petitioners in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee relating to the Tennessee project only, and by amendment eliminated this part of his claim from the Georgia action.\n\nThe Georgia action proceeded to trial in 1959, and according to the findings of the District Court in the present case the $35,000 payment to Atlas was \"dropped\" prior to trial from the counterclaim originally asserted in that action. The Georgia suit has not yet proceeded to final judgment, the Georgia District Court in September 1961 having granted Southern's motion for a new trial on its counterclaim.\n\nIn the Tennessee action here involved Southern included the $35,000 payment as part of its counterclaim for affirmative relief, and Pickard answered that the counterclaim was barred by \"res judicata.\" Southern later waived any claim to affirmative relief in this action and sought only a credit of $34,520 against Pickard's contract claim on the Tennessee project. This figure was the precise amount that had been claimed by Atlas to be due it for materials supplied on this job.\n\nThe District Court, in deciding that Pickard was not entitled to any recovery, allowed this $34,520 item as a credit against Pickard's claim, but on this point the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed. 293 F.2d 493. It held that since there had been no allocation of the $35,000 payment as between the Georgia and Tennessee projects the item, under Rule 13 (a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, was a \"potential compulsory counterclaim\" in either of the two suits;\n2\n that when the responsive \n\n[371 \nU.S. 57, 60]\n\u00a0\n pleading in the Georgia suit was filed the counterclaim was not the subject of any other pending action and was therefore \"compulsory\" in that suit; and, accordingly, that such counterclaim could not later be asserted in the present action. We granted certiorari to consider the applicability of Rule 13 (a) in these unusual circumstances. \n368 \nU.S. 975\n.\n\nWe accept for present purposes the ruling below that the $35,000 payment had not been allocated as between the Tennessee and Georgia projects and that it therefore could have been asserted in either action. Nevertheless, we do not believe that Rule 13 (a) operates to prohibit its use in the later Tennessee action. The requirement that counterclaims arising out of the same transaction or occurrence as the opposing party's claim \"shall\" be stated in the pleadings was designed to prevent multiplicity of actions and to achieve resolution in a single lawsuit of all disputes arising out of common matters. The Rule was particularly directed against one who failed to assert a counterclaim in one action and then instituted a second action in which that counterclaim became the basis of the complaint. See, e. g., United States v. Eastport S. S. Corp., 255 F.2d 795, 801-802.\n\nIt is readily apparent that this policy has no application here. In this instance, the plaintiff-respondent, who originally sought to combine all his claims in a single suit, correctly concluded that he was required by statute to split those claims and to bring two separate actions in two different districts. The fragmentation of these claims, therefore, was compelled by federal law, and the primary defendant in both actions was thus for the first time confronted with the choice of which of the two pending suits \n\n[371 \nU.S. 57, 61]\n\u00a0\n should be resorted to for the assertion of a counterclaim common to both. Under these circumstances, we hold that Rule 13 (a) did not compel this counterclaim to be made in whichever of the two suits the first responsive pleading was filed.\n3\n Its assertion in the later suit, to which Southern, not without reason, considered it more appurtenant (pp. 58-59, supra), by no means involved the circuity of action that Rule 13 (a) was aimed at preventing. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals insofar as it related to this counterclaim is reversed, and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n     It is so ordered.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Under the Miller Act, 40 U.S.C. 270b, Southern as a prime contractor was secondarily liable to suppliers of the subcontractor.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Rule 13 (a) provides: \"(a) Compulsory Counterclaims. A pleading shall state as a counterclaim any claim which at the time of serving the pleading the pleader has against any opposing party, if it arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party's \n\n[371 \nU.S. 57, 60]\n\u00a0\n claim and does not require for its adjudication the presence of third parties of whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction, except that such a claim need not be so stated if at the time the action was commenced the claim was the subject of another pending action.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] We are informed that after certiorari was granted in the present case, Southern filed an amended counterclaim in the Georgia action which included the $35,000 item involved here. Further proceedings in the Georgia action, however, are awaiting our decision in this case. Of course once this counterclaim has been adjudicated in one of the actions it cannot be reasserted in the other. \n\n[371 \nU.S. 57, 62]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","179":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSPAHOS ET AL. v.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nWhen we held in United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Assn., \n322 \nU.S. 533\n, that the modern business of insurance was \"interstate commerce,\" we put it in a category which Congress could regulate and which, if our prior decisions controlled, could not in some respects be regulated by the States, even in absence of federal regulation. See Frankfurter, The Commerce Clause (1937); Rutledge, A Declaration of Legal Faith (1947).\n\nCongress promptly passed the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 59 Stat. 33, 15 U.S.C. 1011, which provided that the regulation and taxation of insurance should be left to the States, without restriction by reason of the Commerce Clause.\n1\n Subsequently, by force of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, we upheld the continued taxation and regulation by the States of interstate insurance transactions. Prudential Ins. Co. v. Benjamin, \n328 \nU.S. 408\n.\n\nPrior to the South-Eastern Underwriters decision, we had given broad scope to local regulation of the insurance business. Osborn v. Ozlin, \n310 \nU.S. 53\n; Hoopeston Canning Co. v. Cullen, \n318 \nU.S. 313\n. The Osborn case upheld a Virginia requirement that insurance companies authorized to do business in that State must write policies through resident agents. The Hoopeston case, while it involved the making of out-of-state insurance \n\n[370 \nU.S. 451, 453]\n\u00a0\n contracts, also involved servicing of policies in New York, the regulating State.\n\nHere, unlike the Osborn and Hoopeston cases, the insurance companies carry on no activities within the State of Texas. Of course, the insured does business in Texas and the property insured is located there. It is earnestly argued that, unless the philosophy of the Osborn and Hoopeston decisions is to be restricted, the present Texas tax\n2\n on premiums paid out-of-state on out-of-state contracts should be sustained. We are urged to follow the approach of the Osborn and Hoopeston decisions, look to the aspects of the insurance transactions taken as a whole, and decide that there are sufficient contacts with Texas to justify this tax under the requirements of due process.\n\nWere the Osborn and Hoopeston cases and the bare bones of the McCarran-Ferguson Act our only criteria for decision, we would have presented the question whether three prior decisions - Allgeyer v. Louisiana, \n165 \nU.S. 578\n; St. Louis Cotton Compress Co. v. Arkansas, \n260 \nU.S. 346\n; Connecticut General Life Ins. Co. v. Johnson, \n303 \nU.S. 77\n - have continuing vitality. The first two were distinguished in the Osborn (\n310 \nU.S., at 66\n-67) and Hoopeston (\n318 \nU.S., at 318\n-319) cases. The Allgeyer case held that Louisiana by reason of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment could not make it a misdemeanor \n\n[370 \nU.S. 451, 454]\n\u00a0\n to effect insurance on Louisiana risks with an insurance company not licensed to do business in Louisiana, where the insured through use of the mails contracted in New York for the policy. The St. Louis Cotton Compress case held invalid under the Due Process Clause an Arkansas tax on the premiums paid for a policy on Arkansas risks, made with an out-of-state company having no office or agents in Arkansas. The Connecticut General Life Insurance case held invalid under the Due Process Clause a California tax on premiums paid in Connecticut by one insurance company to another for reinsurance of life insurance policies written in California on California residents, even though both insurance companies were authorized to do business in California. The Court stated:\n\n \"All that appellant did in effecting the reinsurance  was done without the state and for its transaction no  privilege or license by California was needful. The  tax cannot be sustained either as laid on property,  business done, or transactions carried on within the  state, or as a tax on a privilege granted by the state.\"  \n303 \nU.S., at 82\n.\n\n\n The Texas Court of Civil Appeals, 340 S. W. 2d 339, and the Texas Supreme Court, feeling bound by these decisions, held the tax on premiums unconstitutional, 162 Tex. 8, 343 S. W. 2d 241. We granted certiorari, \n368 \nU.S. 810\n.\n\nThe insurance transactions involved in the present litigation take place entirely outside Texas. The insurance, which is principally insurance against loss or liability arising from damage to property, is negotiated and paid for outside Texas. The policies are issued outside Texas. All losses arising under the policies are adjusted and paid outside Texas. The insurers are not licensed to do business \n\n[370 \nU.S. 451, 455]\n\u00a0\n in Texas, have no office or place of business in Texas, do not solicit business in Texas, have no agents in Texas, and do not investigate risks or claims in Texas.\n\nThe insured is not a domiciliary of Texas but a New York corporation doing business in Texas. Losses under the policies are payable not to Texas residents but to the insured at its principal office in New York City. The only connection between Texas and the insurance transactions is the fact that the property covered by the insurance is physically located in Texas.\n\nWe need not decide de novo whether the results (and the reasons given) in the Allgeyer, St. Louis Cotton Compress, and Connecticut General Life Insurance decisions are sound and acceptable. For we have in the history of the McCarran-Ferguson Act an explicit, unequivocal statement that the Act was so designed as not to displace those three decisions. The House Report stated:\n\n \"It is not the intention of Congress in the enactment of this legislation to clothe the States with any power to regulate or tax the business of insurance beyond that which they had been held to possess prior to the decision of the United States Supreme Court in the Southeastern Underwriters Association case. Briefly, your committee is of the opinion that we should provide for the continued regulation and taxation of insurance by the States, subject always, however, to the limitations set out in the controlling decisions of the United States Supreme Court, as, for instance, in Allgeyer v. Louisiana (\n165 \nU.S. 578\n), St. Louis Cotton Compress Co. v. Arkansas (\n260 \nU.S. 346\n), and Connecticut General Insurance Co. v. Johnson (\n303 \nU.S. 77\n), which hold, inter alia, that a State does not have power to tax contracts of insurance or reinsurance entered into outside its jurisdiction by individuals or corporations resident or \n\n[370 \nU.S. 451, 456]\n\u00a0\n  domiciled therein covering risks within the State or  to regulate such transactions in any way.\" H. R.  Rep. No. 143, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 3.\n\n\n Senator McCarran, after reading the foregoing part of the House Report during the Senate debate, stated, \". . . we give to the States no more powers than those they previously had, and we take none from them.\" 91 Cong. Rec. 1442.\n\nSo, while Congress provided in 15 U.S.C. 1012 (a) that the insurance business \"shall be subject to the laws of the several States which relate to the regulation or taxation of such business,\"\n3\n it indicated without ambiguity that such state \"regulation or taxation\" should be kept within the limits set by the Allgeyer, St. Louis Cotton Compress, and Connecticut General Life Insurance decisions.\n\nThe power of Congress to grant protection to interstate commerce against state regulation or taxation (Bethlehem Steel Co. v. State Board, \n330 \nU.S. 767, 775\n-776; Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., \n331 \nU.S. 218, 235\n-236) or to withhold it (In re Rahrer, \n140 \nU.S. 545, 560\n et seq.; Prudential Ins. Co. v. Benjamin, supra) is so complete\n4\n that its ideas of policy should prevail. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 451, 457]\n\u00a0\n\n\nCongress, of course, does not have the final say as to what constitutes due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. And while Congress has authority by 5 of that Amendment to enforce its provisions (Ex parte Virginia, \n100 \nU.S. 339\n; Monroe v. Pape, \n365 \nU.S. 167\n), the McCarran-Ferguson Act does not purport to do so. We have, of course, freedom to change our decisions on the constitutionality of laws. Smith v. Allwright, \n321 \nU.S. 649, 665\n. But the policy announced by Congress in the McCarran-Ferguson Act was one on which the industry had reason to rely since 1897, when the Allgeyer decision was announced; and we are advised by an amicus brief how severe the impact would be on small insurance companies should the old rule be changed. When, therefore, Congress has posited a regime of state regulation on the continuing validity of specific prior decisions (see Federal Trade Comm'n v. Travelers Health Assn., \n362 \nU.S. 293, 301\n-302), we should be loath to change them.\n\nWe have accepted the status quo in comparable situations. After this Court held in Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, \n244 \nU.S. 205\n, that a State could not provide compensation to stevedores doing maritime work, Congress enacted the Longshoremen's Act. See S. Rep. No. 973, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 16; H. R. Rep. No. 1767, 69th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 20. In Davis v. Department of Labor, \n317 \nU.S. 249\n, we took note of the passage of laws which \"accepted the Jensen line of demarcation between state and federal jurisdiction\" (id., at 256), which line we also accepted in spite of the fact that the Jensen case had become in the eyes of some a derelict in the stream of the law.\n\nIn Toolson v. New York Yankees, Inc., \n346 \nU.S. 356, 357\n, we refused to re-examine a prior decision holding baseball not to be covered by the antitrust laws, stating that \"[t]he business has thus been left for thirty years to develop, on the understanding that it was not subject \n\n[370 \nU.S. 451, 458]\n\u00a0\n to existing antitrust legislation.\" In that case Congress had remained silent, not changing the law. Here Congress tailored the new regulations for the insurance business with specific reference to our prior decisions. Since these earlier decisions are part of the arch on which the new structure rests, we refrain from disturbing them lest we change the design that Congress fashioned.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the decision of this case.\n\nMR.

Its plenary scope enables Congress not only to promote but also to prohibit interstate commerce, as it has done frequently and for a great variety of reasons. That power does not run down a one-way street or one of narrowly fixed dimensions. Congress may keep the way open, confine it broadly or closely, or close it entirely, subject only to the restrictions placed upon its authority by other constitutional provisions and the requirement that it shall not invade the domains of action reserved exclusively for the states.\"\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE BLACK, dissenting.\n\nIn holding that the McCarran-Ferguson Act withdrew from the States the power to tax the ownership and use of insurance policies on property located within their borders merely because those policies were made by representatives of the insurer and the insured in another State, I think the Court places an unwarranted construction upon that Act which may seriously impair the capacity of Texas and other States to provide and enforce effective regulation of the insurance business. The Texas statute held invalid was enacted by the State Legislature in 1957 in order to protect the State's comprehensive supervision of insurance companies and their policies from being undercut by the practice of insuring Texas property with insurance companies not authorized to do business in that State. Prior to 1957, the whole cost of the Texas program had been placed upon those insurance companies which had subjected themselves to Texas regulation and taxation by qualifying to do business in the State. The 1957 statute was passed for the express purpose of equalizing that burden by placing a tax upon the purchasers of \n\n[370 \nU.S. 451, 459]\n\u00a0\n unregulated insurance roughly equal to that imposed directly upon regulated companies. In this way the State tried to protect its qualified and regulated companies from unfair competition by companies which could sell insurance on Texas property cheaper because they did not have to pay their part of the cost of the Texas insurance regulation program. The Court's construction of the McCarran-Ferguson Act bars Texas from providing this sort of protection to regulated companies. This holding seems to me to threaten the whole foundation of the Texas regulatory program for it plainly encourages Texas residents to insure their property with unregulated companies and discourages out-of-state companies from qualifying to do business in and subjecting themselves to regulation and taxation by the State of Texas.\n\nI cannot believe that an Act which was basically designed to leave the power to regulate and tax insurance companies to the States was intended to have any such effect. The McCarran-Ferguson Act \"declares that the continued regulation and taxation by the several States of the business of insurance is in the public interest, and that silence on the part of the Congress shall not be construed to impose any barrier to the regulation or taxation of such business by the several States\" - a declaration which is not qualified by any other language of the Act. Nothing in the legislative history which the Court relies upon persuades me that we should read this Act in a way which so seriously impairs the power of the States to discharge their responsibilities under the Act to provide a comprehensive, effective, well-integrated program for regulating insurance on property within their borders. I think the McCarran-Ferguson Act left Texas with adequate power to place a tax on the ownership and use of insurance policies covering the vast properties owned and operated by this respondent in Texas, and I therefore dissent. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 451, 460]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","182":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTRELICH v.

Respondents sued petitioners, the areawide cooperative and one of the processing cooperatives, for treble damages under 4 of the Clayton Act, claiming that they had conspired with the other processing cooperative and two privately owned processing corporations to restrain and monopolize interstate trade in citrus fruit and by-products and had actually monopolized the same, in violation of 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. Held: In view of the exemption from the antitrust laws accorded to agricultural cooperatives by 6 of the Clayton Act and 1 of the Capper-Volstead Act, 7 U.S.C. 291, a judgment based on a general verdict against petitioners, which may have rested on a finding of an unlawful conspiracy among the three cooperatives, must be reversed.

Fisher.\n\nWilliam C. Dixon argued the cause for respondents. With him on the briefs was Holmes Baldridge.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis is a treble damage suit brought under 4 of the Clayton Act. 38 Stat. 731, 15 U.S.C. 15, charging petitioners, Sunkist Growers, Incorporated, and The Exchange Orange Products Company, with conspiracy to restrain and monopolize interstate trade and commerce in citrus fruits and by-products and with actual monopolization thereof in violation of 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 26 Stat. 209, 15 U.S.C. 1, 2, as amended. The petitioners are each agricultural cooperative organizations, Exchange Orange being a wholly owned subsidiary of Sunkist. Petitioners contend the case was submitted under instructions permitting the jury to find an illegal conspiracy among them and Exchange Lemon Products Company, a cooperative processing association owned and operated exclusively by a number of lemon-grower associations all of which are members of Sunkist Growers, Inc. They say that under the exemptions from the antitrust laws granted agricultural associations by 6 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731, 15 U.S.C. 17, and 1 of the Capper-Volstead Act, 42 Stat. 388, 7 U.S.C. 291, Sunkist, Exchange Orange, and Exchange Lemon, being made up of the same growers and associations, cannot be charged with conspiracy among themselves. The trial court overruled this contention, among others, and the jury returned a verdict of $500,000. Judgment for treble this amount and attorney fees, less some minor offsets, was entered. The Court of Appeals, accepting petitioners' view of the instructions, held that the exemption claimed did not apply here and affirmed the judgment as to liability but \n\n[370 \nU.S. 19, 21]\n\u00a0\n reversed as to the amount of damages. 284 F.2d 1. We granted certiorari limited to the issue of the immunity of interorganizational dealings among the three cooperatives from the conspiracy provisions of the antitrust laws. \n368 \nU.S. 813\n. We have concluded that the case was submitted to the jury on the theory claimed by petitioners and that this was erroneous. Thus we reverse the judgment.\n\nSunkist Growers, Inc., has at its base 12,000 growers of citrus fruits in California and Arizona. These growers are organized into local associations which operate packing houses. The associations in turn are grouped into district exchanges, and representatives from these exchanges make up the governing board of Sunkist, a nonstock membership corporation. Sunkist serves the members as an organization for marketing their fresh fruit and fruit products\n1\n through its field, advertising, sales, and traffic departments. All of its net revenues are distributed to the members.\n\nIn 1915 several member associations of Sunkist undertook to develop by-products for lemons in order to create a market for produce not salable as fresh fruit. Because this was a new, untried field the entire cooperative did not participate. Rather a separate cooperative - Exchange Lemon, a nonprofit stock corporation - was formed for this venture by the interested associations. Since that time Exchange Lemon has retained its separate identity although it is made up exclusively of lemon-grower associations which are also members of Sunkist. Its function now is primarily one of processing, and the resultant products are marketed for the owners by Sunkist through its products department, which is jointly managed by directors of Exchange Lemon and Exchange Orange. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 19, 22]\n\u00a0\n\n\nOne year after the organization of Exchange Lemon a similar association was formed to develop by-products for oranges. This organization, Exchange Orange, was comprised of a number of Sunkist member associations until 1931. At that time the Sunkist directors decided to make the processing facilities of Exchange Orange available to all of its member associations by purchasing it and operating it as a wholly owned subsidiary.\n\nIn sum, the individual growers involved each belong to a local grower association. Fruit which is to be sold fresh is packed by the associations and marketed by Sunkist, a nonstock membership corporation comprised of district exchanges to which the associations belong. Most fruit which is to be processed into by-products is handled by Exchange Orange, a subsidiary of Sunkist, or by Exchange Lemon, a separate organization comprised of a number of Sunkist member associations.\n2\n It is then marketed by the products department of Sunkist which is managed by directors of Exchange Orange and Exchange Lemon.\n\nCompeting with the three cooperatives in the California-Arizona area in the business of processing and selling canned orange juice were four independent processors, which were primarily dependent upon Sunkist for their supply of by-product oranges.\n3\n In 1951 two of these concerns, TreeSweet Products Company and E. A. Silzle Corporation, had process-and-purchase contracts with Exchange Orange. Under its contract TreeSweet agreed to process at cost an undetermined amount of oranges provided by Exchange Orange and to purchase the resultant orange juice at the then current price of Sunkist. The average net price for the oranges under this contract was \n\n[370 \nU.S. 19, 23]\n\u00a0\n alleged to have been $25.10 per ton.\n4\n The contract with Silzle provided that it would process a stated amount of oranges for Exchange Orange and purchase the juice at a stated price less its processing cost alleged to have netted $17.66 per ton.\n5\n The third producer, Case-Swayne Company, allegedly declined Sunkist's offer of a similar contract. Respondent Winckler & Smith Citrus Products Company, the final processor, was offered oranges only at the list price of $40 to $44 per ton, depending upon content of soluble solids and was refused the process-and-purchase arrangements described above.\n\nRespondents brought this suit on the theory that Sunkist and Exchange Orange controlled the supply of byproduct oranges available in the California-Arizona area to independent processors; that they combined and conspired with Exchange Lemon, TreeSweet, and Silzle to restrain and to monopolize interstate trade and commerce in 1951 in the processing and sale of citrus fruit juices, particularly canned orange juice; that they in fact monopolized such trade and commerce; and that the purpose or effect thereof was the elimination of Winckler as a competitor in the sale of such juices. Respondents relied on six specific acts and contracts which allegedly furthered the conspiracy, namely: (1) the processing of oranges at cost by Exchange Lemon for Exchange Orange during 1951; (2) the processing of lemons at cost by Exchange Orange for Exchange Lemon during 1951; (3) the establishment by Sunkist and Exchange Orange of a price to independent processors alleged to be too high to enable purchasers to compete, i. e., the $40-$44 per ton list price; (4) the contract between Exchange Orange and TreeSweet in 1951; (5) the contract between Exchange \n\n[370 \nU.S. 19, 24]\n\u00a0\n Orange and Silzle in 1951; (6) the refusal to sign a comparable contract with respondent Winckler.\n\nAfter a lengthy trial producing a 4,000-page transcript, the case went to the jury under a necessarily complicated charge. As to the parties the jury might find to have participated in an illegal conspiracy, the court gave several instructions. One, given early in the charge, was that:\n\n\"a parent corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiary can be guilty of combining or conspiring together to violate the antitrust laws. The defendants Sunkist Growers, Inc., and its wholly-owned subsidiary Exchange Orange Products Company, can accordingly combine or conspire together or with others to violate Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act as charged in the first and second causes of action, subject to other instructions concerning the Capper-Volstead Act, and Section 6 of the Clayton Act, and the exemptions contained therein.\"\n\n\n The instructions on the Clayton and Capper-Volstead Acts merely stated that the cooperatives could lawfully have a monopoly of the fruit and products in which they dealt. Later references to the alleged conspiracy often mentioned only petitioners and the two independent processors, e. g., \"If you find that either or both of the defendants [Sunkist and Exchange Orange, petitioners here] combined with TreeSweet or Silzle to eliminate the competition of the plaintiff . . . .\" However, the court's concluding instructions on the subject could well have been taken by the jury as permitting them to find an illegal conspiracy solely among the three cooperatives:\n\n \"Unless you find, therefore, from the preponderance of the evidence, that Sunkist or Exchange Orange or either of them, combined or conspired with either TreeSweet, or Silzle, or ELP [Exchange Lemon Products], \n\n[370 \nU.S. 19, 25]\n\u00a0\n and in 1951 did one or more of the specific acts charged . . . .\n\n\n \". . . Unless you find from the preponderance of the evidence that defendants Sunkist and Exchange Orange, or either of them, and one or more of the alleged co-conspirators [one of which was Exchange Lemon], combined and conspired, and pursuant to such combination or conspiracy . . . .\n\n\n \"Those are summary instructions which sort of sum up what is charged and what the plaintiff must prove.\"\n\n\n And in a final addendum after consultation with counsel the court instructed that:\n\n \"I also am told that I spoke about how the defendants had conspired on one occasion. The charge is not that the defendants conspired. The charge is that the defendants and co-conspirators conspired.\"\n\n\n \"However, as a matter of fact, you may find that nobody conspired, or you may pick out and decide that some number less than the total conspired.\"\n\n\n On the question now before us, the Court of Appeals held that any objection to at least one of the conspiracy instructions was waived; that in any event different agricultural cooperatives combining together are not entitled to claim a total immunity for acts which they might do unilaterally and individually; and that the common ownership of Sunkist, Exchange Orange, and Exchange Lemon did not prevent the finding of an illegal conspiracy among them.\n\nWe believe the instructions quite plainly left it open for the jury to base their verdict upon a finding of a conspiracy among petitioners and Exchange Lemon.\n6\n At the outset \n\n[370 \nU.S. 19, 26]\n\u00a0\n the court instructed that a conspiracy could be found between Sunkist and its wholly owned subsidiary Exchange Orange. Thereafter the charge advised the jury that a finding of conspiracy between \"Sunkist or Exchange Orange or either of them . . . [and] either TreeSweet, or Silzle, or ELP\" was sufficient basis for a judgment against petitioners. From this it is entirely probable that the jury's verdict against both petitioners was based on their finding of a conspiracy among Sunkist, Exchange Orange, and Exchange Lemon. There is no question that Exchange Lemon was identified in the complaint and throughout the trial as an alleged co-conspirator. In no fewer than five instances did the trial court refer to the alleged conspiracy as being among petitioners and the \"co-conspirators\" or petitioners and Exchange Lemon, TreeSweet, or Silzle. The final summarization on conspiracy was in terms of finding that petitioners combined or conspired with either TreeSweet or Silzle or Exchange Lemon, and the addendum instructions emphasized that the jury could find either or both petitioners had illegally conspired with any one of the alleged co-conspirators. It is true that in some instances the court's conspiracy instructions mentioned only TreeSweet and Silzle as co-conspirators. Conjecture as to the reasons for this would not be fruitful. For it is clear that the court never limited the jury to a consideration of those parties as the sole co-conspirators. And other instructions, including the summarization, allowed the jury to base their verdict upon a finding of an illegal conspiracy solely among Sunkist, Exchange Orange, and Exchange Lemon.\n\nIt is suggested by respondents and the court below that petitioners waived their objection to these instructions. This is based on petitioners' acquiescence in the additional instructions, including references to the conspiracy, given the jury after the general charge. But petitioners' actions \n\n[370 \nU.S. 19, 27]\n\u00a0\n here must be viewed in context. Prior to the general charge, conferences of counsel and the trial court were held to discuss the instructions. At each point counsel for petitioners objected to instructions which suggested that the three cooperatives might be found to have illegally conspired among themselves and requested instructions that would have limited a finding of an unlawful conspiracy in this case to one among petitioners and TreeSweet or Silzle. The trial court consistently ruled adversely to petitioners on this point. After the charge was delivered, counsel were told that all prior objections would be preserved and asked if they had any additional objections. In light of this assurance and petitioners' prior objections and requests, we believe the acquiescence in the added instructions could not be considered a waiver.\n\nWe are squarely presented, then, with the question of whether Sunkist, Exchange Orange, and Exchange Lemon - the three legal entities formed by these 12,000 growers - can be considered independent parties for the purposes of the conspiracy provisions of 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. We conclude not. Section 6 of the Clayton Act provides, inter alia, that agricultural organizations instituted for the purposes of mutual help shall not be held or construed to be illegal combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade under the antitrust laws.\n7\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 19, 28]\n\u00a0\n The Capper-Volstead Act sets out this immunity in greater specificity:\n\n \"That persons engaged in the production of agricultural products as farmers, planters, ranchmen, dairymen, nut or fruit growers may act together in associations, corporate or otherwise, with or without capital stock, in collectively processing, preparing for market, handling, and marketing in interstate and foreign commerce, such products of persons so engaged. Such associations may have marketing agencies in common; and such associations and their members may make the necessary contracts and agreements to effect such purposes . . . .\"\n8\n\u00a0\n\n\n There can be no doubt that under these statutes the 12,000 California-Arizona citrus growers ultimately involved could join together into one organization for the collective processing and marketing of their fruit and fruit products without the business decisions of their officers being held combinations or conspiracies. The language of the Capper-Volstead Act is specific in permitting concerted efforts by farmers in the processing, preparing for market, and marketing of their products. And the legislative history of the Act reveals several references to the Sunkist organization - then called the California Fruit Growers Exchange and numbering 11,000 members - including a suggestion by Senator Capper that this was the type of cooperative that would find \"definite legalization\" under the legislation.\n9\n Although we cannot draw from these references a knowing approval of the \n\n[370 \nU.S. 19, 29]\n\u00a0\n tripartite legal organization of the 11,000 growers, they do indicate that a cooperative of such size and general activities was contemplated by the Act.\n\nInstead of a single cooperative, these growers through local associations first formed one area-wide organization (Sunkist) for marketing purposes. When it was decided to perform research and processing on a joint basis, separate organizations were formed by the interested associations for reasons outlined above. At a later date one of these (Exchange Orange) was acquired by the Sunkist organization and is presently held as a subsidiary. The other (Exchange Lemon) is still owned by the lemongrower associations, all of whom are also member associations of Sunkist. With due respect to the contrary opinions of the Court of Appeals and District Court, we feel that the 12,000 growers here involved are in practical effect and in the contemplation of the statutes one \"organization\" or \"association\" even though they have formally organized themselves into three separate legal entities. To hold otherwise would be to impose grave legal consequences upon organizational distinctions that are of de minimis meaning and effect to these growers who have banded together for processing and marketing purposes within the purview of the Clayton and Capper-Volstead Acts. There is no indication that the use of separate corporations had economic significance in itself or that outsiders considered and dealt with the three entities as independent organizations. That the packing is done by local associations, the advertising, sales, and traffic by divisions of the area association, and the processing by separate organizations does not in our opinion preclude these growers from being considered one organization or association for purposes of the Clayton and Capper-Volstead Acts.\n\nSince we hold erroneous one theory of liability upon which the general verdict may have rested - a conspiracy \n\n[370 \nU.S. 19, 30]\n\u00a0\n among petitioners and Exchange Lemon - it is unnecessary for us to explore the legality of the other theories. As was stated of a general verdict in Maryland v. Baldwin, \n112 \nU.S. 490, 493\n (1884), \"[I]ts generality prevents us from perceiving upon which plea they found. If, therefore, upon any one issue error was committed, either in the admission of evidence, or in the charge of the court, the verdict cannot be upheld . . . .\" Suffice it to say that our decision in no way detracts from earlier cases holding agricultural cooperatives liable for conspiracies with outside groups, United States v. Borden Co., \n308 \nU.S. 188\n (1939), and for monopolization, Maryland & Virginia Milk Producers Assn. v. United States, \n362 \nU.S. 458\n (1960).\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the decision of this case.\n\nMR.

LOUISIANA(1962)\nNo. 773\nArgued: Decided: June 4, 1962\n\n\n\n\n Six Negroes were convicted in a state court of violating Louisiana's breach-of-the-peace statute and were fined and sentenced to jail. Four of them went into a waiting room customarily reserved for white people at a bus depot and, when requested by police to leave, they refused to do so, claiming that they were interstate passengers. The other two were arrested while sitting nearby in the automobile which had brought the six to the bus station. There was no evidence of violence; but the trial court said that the mere presence of Negroes in a white waiting room was likely to give rise to a breach of the peace and was sufficient evidence of guilt. It held that four had violated the breach-of-the-peace statute and that the other two had counseled and procured them to do so. Held: Since the only evidence to support the charge was that the defendants were violating a custom that segregated people in waiting rooms according to their race, a practice not allowed by federal law in interstate transportation facilities, the judgments are reversed. Pp. 154-156.\n\n Reversed.\n\nCarl Rachlin and Judith P. Vladeck for petitioners.\n\nJack P. F. Gremillion, Attorney General of Louisiana, and M. E. Culligan, Assistant Attorney General, for respondent.\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\nPetitioners, six Negroes, were convicted of violating Louisiana's breach-of-the-peace statute, La. Rev. Stat., 1950, 14:103.1,\n1\n and were given fines and jail terms by \n\n[370 \nU.S. 154, 155]\n\u00a0\n the state court. The Louisiana Supreme Court declined to review their convictions, and the case is here on petition for a writ of certiorari which we have granted.\n\nFour of the six petitioners went into the waiting room customarily reserved for white people at the Trailways Bus Depot in Shreveport, Louisiana, in order to take a bus to Jackson, Mississippi. The Chief of Police of Shreveport approached the four and asked them why they were in the station. They told him they were interstate passengers and wished to purchase tickets and obtain travel information. The Chief told them they could do this in the colored waiting room and ordered them to move on. When the four refused to leave, stating again that they were interstate passengers and asserting their rights under federal law, they were ordered to leave or be arrested. The spokesman of the group then said, \"We have no choice; go ahead and arrest us.\" The police thereupon arrested the four of them. The other two petitioners were then arrested, while sitting nearby in the automobile which had brought the six to the bus station.\n\nAt the trial there was testimony that immediately upon petitioners' entry into the waiting room many of the people therein became restless and that some onlookers climbed onto seats to get a better view. Nevertheless, respondent admits these persons moved on when ordered to do so by the police. There was no evidence of violence. The record shows that the petitioners were quiet, orderly, and polite. The trial court said, however, that the mere presence of Negroes in a white waiting room was likely to give rise to a breach of the peace. It held the mere presence of the Negroes in the waiting room, as part \n\n[370 \nU.S. 154, 156]\n\u00a0\n of a preconceived plan, was sufficient evidence of guilt. It accordingly held that the four had violated the state breach-of-the-peace statute and that the other two had counseled and procured the others to commit the crime.\n\nHere, as in Garner v. Louisiana, \n368 \nU.S. 157\n, the only evidence to support the charge was that petitioners were violating a custom that segregated people in waiting rooms according to their race, a practice not allowed in interstate transportation facilities by reason of federal law.\n2\n Boynton v.

LUCAS FLOUR CO.(1962)\nNo. 50\nArgued: Decided: March 5, 1962\n\n\n\n\n A collective bargaining contract between an employer in a business affecting interstate commerce and a union of its employees reserved to the employer the right to discharge any employee for unsatisfactory work and provided for compulsory, final and binding settlement by arbitration of any dispute between the employer and any employee; but it did not contain an explicit no-strike clause applicable to such disputes. The employer discharged an employee for unsatisfactory work, and the union called a strike to force the employer to rehire him. The employer sued the union in a Washington State Court for damages for business losses caused by the strike. The trial court awarded a judgment in favor of the employer and a Department of the Supreme Court of Washington affirmed. Without petitioning that Court for a rehearing en banc, the union petitioned this Court for certiorari, which was granted. Held:\n\n 1. Under Washington law, the judgment below was a final judgment of the State's highest court, and this Court has jurisdiction of this case under 28 U.S.C. 1257. Gorman v. Washington University, \n316 \nU.S. 98\n, distinguished. Pp. 98-101.\n\n\n 2.

Oles argued the cause for respondent. With him on the briefs was Seth W. Morrison.\n\nMR. JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe petitioner and the respondent (which we shall call the union and the employer) were parties to a collective bargaining contract within the purview of the National Labor Relations Act. The contract contained the following provisions, among others:\n\n    \"ARTICLE II\n\n\n\"The Employer reserves the right to discharge any man in his employ if his work is not satisfactory.\n\n\n  .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n   \"ARTICLE XIV\n\n\n\"Should any difference as to the true interpretation of this agreement arise, same shall be submitted to a Board of Arbitration of two members, one representing the firm, and one representing the Union. If said members cannot agree, a third member, who must be a disinterested party shall be selected, and the decision of the said Board of Arbitration shall be binding. It is further agreed by both parties hereto that during such arbitration, there shall be no suspension of work.\n\n\n\"Should any difference arise between the employer and the employee, same shall be submitted to arbitration by both parties. Failing to agree, they shall mutually appoint a third person whose decision shall be final and binding.\" \n\n[369 \nU.S. 95, 97]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n In May of 1958 an employee named Welsch was discharged by the employer after he had damaged a new fork-lift truck by running it off a loading platform and onto some railroad tracks. When a business agent of the union protested, he was told by a representative of the employer that Welsch had been discharged because of unsatisfactory work. The union thereupon called a strike to force the employer to rehire Welsch. The strike lasted eight days.\n1\n After the strike was over, the issue of Welsch's discharge was submitted to arbitration. Some five months later the Board of Arbitration rendered a decision, ruling that Welsch's work had been unsatisfactory, that his unsatisfactory work had been the reason for his discharge, and that he was not entitled to reinstatement as an employee.\n\nIn the meantime, the employer had brought this suit against the union in the Superior Court of King County, Washington, asking damages for business losses caused by the strike. After a trial that court entered a judgment in favor of the employer in the amount of $6,501.60.\n2\n On appeal the judgment was affirmed by Department One of the Supreme Court of Washington. 57 Wash. 2d 95, 356 P.2d 1. The reviewing court held that the pre-emption doctrine of San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, \n359 \nU.S. 236\n, did not deprive it of jurisdiction over the controversy. The court further held that 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, 29 U.S.C. 185, could not \"reasonably be interpreted as pre-empting state jurisdiction, or as affecting it by limiting the substantive law to be applied.\" 57 Wash. 2d, at 102, 356 P.2d, at 5. Expressly applying principles of state law, the court reasoned that the strike was a violation \n\n[369 \nU.S. 95, 98]\n\u00a0\n of the collective bargaining contract, because it was an attempt to coerce the employer to forego his contractual right to discharge an employee for unsatisfactory work.\n3\n We granted certiorari to consider questions of federal labor law which this case presents. \n365 \nU.S. 868\n.\n\nWe note at the outset a question as to our jurisdiction. Although the judgment before us has been certified as that of the Supreme Court of Washington, this case was actually heard and decided by Department One of that court, consisting of five of the nine members of the full court. Since the union could have filed a petition for rehearing en banc but did not do so, the argument is made that the judgment before us was not \"rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had,\" and that the judgment is one we therefore have no power to review. 28 U.S.C. 1257. This argument primarily rests upon Gorman v. Washington University, \n316 \nU.S. 98\n, which held that, in view of the structure of Missouri's judicial system, a separate division of the Supreme Court of that State was not the highest state court in which a decision of a federal question could be had.\n4\n It is evident, however, that the law governing rehearing in the Supreme Court of Washington is quite unlike the particularized provisions of Missouri law which led this Court to dismiss the writ in Gorman. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 95, 99]\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs the opinion in Gorman pointed out, the Constitution of the State of Missouri expressly conferred the right to an en banc rehearing by the Supreme Court of Missouri in any case originally decided by a division of the court in which a federal question was involved. It was this provision of the state constitution which was the basis for the conclusion in Gorman that the State of Missouri did not regard a decision by a division of the court as the final step in the state appellate process in a case involving a federal question. \"[T]he constitution of Missouri,\" it was said, \"has thus provided in this class of cases for review of the judgment of a division . . . .\" \n316 \nU.S., at 100\n.\n\nBy contrast, a rehearing en banc before the Supreme Court of Washington is not granted as a matter of right. The Constitution and statutes of the State of Washington authorize its Supreme Court to sit in two Departments, each of which is empowered \"to hear and determine causes, and all questions arising therein.\"\n5\n Cases coming before \n\n[369 \nU.S. 95, 100]\n\u00a0\n the court may be assigned to a Department or to the court en banc at the discretion of the Chief Justice and a specified number of other members of the court.\n6\n The state law further provides that the decision of a Department becomes a final judgment of the Supreme Court of Washington, unless within 30 days a petition for rehearing has been filed, or a rehearing has been ordered on the court's own initiative.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nWe can discern in Washington's system no indication that the decision in the present case, rendered unanimously \n\n[369 \nU.S. 95, 101]\n\u00a0\n by a majority of the judges of the Supreme Court of Washington, was other than the final word of the State's final court.\n8\n This case is thus properly before us, and we turn to the issues which it presents.\n\nOne of those issues - whether 301 (a) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 deprives state courts of jurisdiction over litigation such as this - we have decided this Term in Charles Dowd Box Co. v. Courtney, \n368 \nU.S. 502\n. For the reasons stated in our opinion in that case, we hold that the Washington Supreme Court was correct in ruling that it had jurisdiction over this controversy.\n9\n\u00a0\n\n[369 \nU.S. 95, 102]\n\u00a0\n There remain for consideration two other issues, one of them implicated but not specifically decided in Dowd Box. Was the Washington court free, as it thought, to decide this controversy within the limited horizon of its local law? If not, does applicable federal law require a result in this case different from that reached by the state court?\n\nIn Dowd Box we proceeded upon the hypothesis that state courts would apply federal law in exercising jurisdiction over litigation within the purview of 301 (a), although in that case there was no claim of any variance in relevant legal principles as between the federal law and that of Massachusetts. In the present case, by contrast, the Washington court held that there was nothing in 301 \"limiting the substantive law to be applied,\" and the court accordingly proceeded to dispose of this litigation exclusively in terms of local contract law. The union insists that the case was one to be decided by reference to federal law, and that under applicable principles of national labor law the strike was not a violation of the collective bargaining contract. We hold that in a case such as this, incompatible doctrines of local law must give way to principles of federal labor law.\n10\n We \n\n[369 \nU.S. 95, 103]\n\u00a0\n further hold, however, that application of such principles to this case leads to affirmance of the judgment before us.\n\nIt was apparently the theory of the Washington court that, although Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills, \n353 \nU.S. 448\n, requires the federal courts to fashion, from the policy of our national labor laws, a body of federal law for the enforcement of collective bargaining agreements, nonetheless, the courts of the States remain free to apply individualized local rules when called upon to enforce such agreements. This view cannot be accepted. The dimensions of 301 require the conclusion that substantive principles of federal labor law must be paramount in the area covered by the statute. Comprehensiveness is inherent in the process by which the law is to be formulated under the mandate of Lincoln Mills, requiring issues raised in suits of a kind covered by 301 to be decided according to the precepts of federal labor policy.\n\nMore important, the subject matter of 301 (a) \"is peculiarly one that calls for uniform law.\" Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Public Service Comm'n, \n250 \nU.S. 566, 569\n; see Cloverleaf Butter Co. v. Patterson, \n315 \nU.S. 148, 167\n-169. The possibility that individual contract terms might have different meanings under state and federal law would inevitably exert a disruptive influence upon both the negotiation and administration of collective agreements. Because neither party could be certain of the rights which it had obtained or conceded, the process of negotiating an agreement would be made immeasurably more difficult by the necessity of trying to formulate contract provisions in such a way as to contain the same meaning under two or more systems of law which might someday be invoked in enforcing the contract. Once the collective bargain was \n\n[369 \nU.S. 95, 104]\n\u00a0\n made, the possibility of conflicting substantive interpretation under competing legal systems would tend to stimulate and prolong disputes as to its interpretation.\n11\n Indeed, the existence of possibly conflicting legal concepts might substantially impede the parties' willingness to agree to contract terms providing for final arbitral or judicial resolution of disputes.\n\nThe importance of the area which would be affected by separate systems of substantive law makes the need for a single body of federal law particularly compelling. The ordering and adjusting of competing interests through a process of free and voluntary collective bargaining is the keystone of the federal scheme to promote industrial peace. State law which frustrates the effort of Congress to stimulate the smooth functioning of that process thus strikes at the very core of federal labor policy. With due regard to the many factors which bear upon competing state and federal interests in this area, California v. Zook, \n336 \nU.S. 725, 730\n-731; Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., \n331 \nU.S. 218, 230\n-231, we cannot but conclude that in enacting 301 Congress intended doctrines of federal labor law uniformly to prevail over inconsistent local rules.\n\nWhether, as a matter of federal law, the strike which the union called was a violation of the collective bargaining contract is thus the ultimate issue which this case presents. It is argued that there could be no violation in the absence of a no-strike clause in the contract \n\n[369 \nU.S. 95, 105]\n\u00a0\n explicitly covering the subject of the dispute over which the strike was called. We disagree.\n\nThe collective bargaining contract expressly imposed upon both parties the duty of submitting the dispute in question to final and binding arbitration.\n12\n In a consistent course of decisions the Courts of Appeals of at least five Federal Circuits have held that a strike to settle a dispute which a collective bargaining agreement provides shall be settled exclusively and finally by compulsory arbitration constitutes a violation of the agreement.\n13\n The National Labor Relations Board has reached the same conclusion. W. L. Mead, Inc., 113 N. L. R. B. 1040. We approve that doctrine.\n14\n To hold otherwise would obviously do violence to accepted principles of traditional contract law. Even more in point, a contrary view would be completely at odds with the basic policy of national labor legislation to promote the arbitral process as a substitute for economic warfare. See United Steelworkers v. Warrior & Gulf Nav. Co., \n363 \nU.S. 574\n. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 95, 106]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhat has been said is not to suggest that a no-strike agreement is to be implied beyond the area which it has been agreed will be exclusively covered by compulsory terminal arbitration. Nor is it to suggest that there may not arise problems in specific cases as to whether compulsory and binding arbitration has been agreed upon, and, if so, as to what disputes have been made arbitrable.\n15\n But no such problems are present in this case. The grievance over which the union struck was, as it concedes, one which it had expressly agreed to settle by submission to final and binding arbitration proceedings. The strike which it called was a violation of that contractual obligation.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The strike was terminated by a temporary injunction issued by the state court.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The amount of damages is not in issue here.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The court noted that the unreported memorandum opinion of the trial judge indicated a theory of liability based upon tort, rather than contract, liability. The appellate court said, however: \"From the pleadings, the theory is established that the respondent was injured by the appellant's breach of contract and this theory is clearly supported by the record. Therefore, the rule that the judgment of the trial court will be sustained on any theory established by the pleadings and supported by the proof is applicable.\" 57 Wash. 2d, at 103, 356 P.2d, at 6.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See also Osment v. Pitcairn, \n317 \nU.S. 587\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Article IV, 2 of the state constitution provides, in pertinent part, \"The legislature may increase the number of judges of the supreme court from time to time and may provide for separate departments of said court.\"\n\nRevised Code of Washington, 2.04.120, provides:\n\n\"Two departments - Quorum. There shall be two departments of the supreme court, denominated respectively department one and department two. The chief justice shall assign four of the associate judges to each department and such assignment may be changed by him from time to time: Provided, That the associate judges shall be competent to sit in either department and may interchange with one another by agreement among themselves, or if no such agreement be made, as ordered by the chief justice. The chief justice may sit in either department and shall preside when so sitting, but the judges assigned to each department shall select one of their number as presiding judge. Each of the departments shall have the power to hear and determine causes, and all questions arising therein, subject to the provisions in relation to the court en banc. The presence of three judges shall be necessary to transact any business in either of \n\n[369 \nU.S. 95, 100]\n\u00a0\n the departments, except such as may be done at chambers, but one or more of the judges may from time to time adjourn to the same effect as if all were present, and a concurrence of three judges shall be necessary to pronounce a decision in each department: Provided. That if three do not concur, the cause shall be reheard in the same department or transmitted to the other department, or to the court en banc.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Revised Code of Washington, 2.04.150, provides:\n\n\"Apportionment of business - En banc hearings. The chief justice shall from time to time apportion the business to the departments, and may, in his discretion, before a decision is pronounced, order any cause pending before the court to be heard and determined by the court en banc. When a cause has been allotted to one of the departments and a decision pronounced therein, the chief justice, together with any two associate judges, may order such cause to be heard and decided by the court en banc. Any four judges may, either before or after decision by a department, order a cause to be heard en banc.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Revised Code of Washington, 2.04.160, provides:\n\n\"Finality of departmental decision - Rehearings. The decision of a department, except in cases otherwise ordered as hereinafter provided, shall not become final until thirty days after the filing thereof, during which period a petition for rehearing, or for a hearing en banc, may be filed, the filing of either of which, except as hereinafter otherwise provided, shall have the effect of suspending such decision until the same shall have been disposed of. If no such petition be filed the decision of a department shall become final thirty days from the date of its filing, unless during such thirty-day period an order for a hearing en banc shall have been made: . . . . Whenever a decision shall become final, as herein provided, a judgment shall issue thereon.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] See Market Street R. Co. v. Comm'n, \n324 \nU.S. 548, 551\n-552. In recent years we have, without challenge, reviewed on their merits several cases decided by a Department of the Washington Supreme Court in which no petition for rehearing en banc had been filed. See, e. g., McGrath v. Rhay, \n364 \nU.S. 279\n; Ross v. Schneckloth, \n357 \nU.S. 575\n; United States v. Carroll Construction Co., \n346 \nU.S. 802\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] Since this was a suit for violation of a collective bargaining contract within the purview of 301 (a) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, the pre-emptive doctrine of cases such as San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, \n359 \nU.S. 236\n, based upon the exclusive jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board, is not relevant. See Local 4264, United Steelworkers v. New Park Mining Co., 273 F.2d 352 (C. A. 10th Cir.); Independent Petroleum Workers v. Esso Standard Oil Co., 235 F.2d 401 (C. A. 3d Cir.); see generally Lodge No. 12, District No. 37, Int'l Assn. of Machinists v. Cameron Iron Works, Inc., 257 F.2d 467 (C. A. 5th Cir.); Local 598, Plumbers & Steamfitters Union v. Dillion, 255 F.2d 820 (C. A. 9th Cir.); Local 181, Int'l Union of Operating Engineers v. Dahlem Constr. Co., 193 F.2d 470 (C. A. 6th Cir.). As pointed out in Charles Dowd Box Co. v. Courtney, \n368 \nU.S., at 513\n, Congress \"deliberately chose to leave the enforcement of collective agreements `to the usual processes of the law.'\" See also H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 510, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. p. 52. It is, of course, true that conduct which is a violation of a contractual obligation may also be conduct constituting an unfair labor practice, and what has been said is not to imply that enforcement by a court of a contract obligation affects the jurisdiction of the N. L. R. B. to remedy unfair labor practices, as such. See generally Dunau, Contractual Prohibition of Unfair Labor Practices: Jurisdictional Problems, 57 Col. L. Rev. 52.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] Of the many state courts which have assumed jurisdiction over suits involving contracts subject to 301, few have explicitly considered the problem of state versus federal law. McCarroll v. Los Angeles County Dist. Council of Carpenters, 49 Cal. 2d 45, 60, 315 P.2d 322, 330, held that federal law must govern. Accord: Local Lodge No. 774, Int'l Assn. of Machinists v. Cessna Aircraft Co., 186 Kan. 569, 352 P.2d 420; Harbison-Walker Refractories Co. v. Local 702, United Brick & Clay Workers, 339 S. W. 2d 933, 935-936 (Ky. Ct. App.). Other courts have found it unnecessary to decide the question, because they found no conflict between state and federal law on the issues presented. Karcz v. Luther Mfg. Co., 338 Mass. 313, 317, 155 N. E. 2d 441, 444; Springer v. Powder Power Tool Corp., 220 Ore. 102, 106-107, 348 P.2d 1112, 1114; Clark v. Hein-Werner Corp., 8 Wis. 2d 264, 277, 100 N. W. 2d 317, 318 (on motion for rehearing). It bears noting, however, that these courts and others, e. g., Connecticut \n\n[369 \nU.S. 95, 103]\n\u00a0\n Co. v. Division 425, Street & Electric Railway Employees, 147 Conn. 608, 622-623, 164 A. 2d 413, 420, have carefully considered applicable federal precedents in resolving the litigation before them.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] As one commentator has said: \"Words in any legal document are ambiguous, but the body of law which grows up in an area through decision helps to dispel this ambiguity. The existence of two bodies of law which cannot be accommodated by any conflict-of-laws rule, however, is calculated to aggravate rather than to alleviate the situation.\" Wellington, Labor and the Federal System, 26 U. of Chi. L. Rev. 542, 557.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] It appears that this would be true whether the dispute be considered as a \"difference as to the true interpretation of this agreement\" or as a difference \"between the employer and the employee\" under Article XIV of the contract. See p. 96, supra. The union not only now concedes that the dispute as to Welsch's discharge was subject to final and binding arbitration, but, indeed, after the strike, the dispute was so arbitrated.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] See Local 25, Teamsters Union v. W. L. Mead, Inc., 230 F.2d 576, 583-584 (C. A. 1st Cir.); United Construction Workers v. Haislip Baking Co., 223 F.2d 872, 876-877 (C. A. 4th Cir.); Labor Board v.

A. 9th Cir.).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] Deciding the case as we do upon this explicit ground, we do not adopt the reasoning of the Washington court. Insofar as the language of that court's opinion is susceptible to the construction that a strike during the term of a collective bargaining agreement is ipso facto a violation of the agreement, we expressly reject it.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] With respect to such problems, compare United Mine Workers v. Labor Board, 103 U.S. App. D.C. 207, 257 F.2d 211, with Lewis v. Benedict Coal Corp., 259 F.2d 346 (affirmed on this question by an equally divided Court, \n361 \nU.S. 459\n), for differing interpretations of an identical contract.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, dissenting.\n\nThe petitioner local union and the respondent company entered into a written collective bargaining agreement containing an express provision for the arbitration of disputes growing out of differences as to the proper application of the agreement in the following terms:\n\n\"Should any difference arise between the employer and the employee, same shall be submitted to arbitration by both parties. Failing to agree, they shall mutually appoint a third person whose decision shall be final and binding.\"\n\n\n The Court now finds - out of clear air, so far as I can see - that the union, without saying so in the agreement, not only agreed to arbitrate such differences, but also promised that there would be no strike while arbitration of a dispute was pending under this provision. And on the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 95, 107]\n\u00a0\n basis of its \"discovery\" of this additional unwritten promise by the union, the Court upholds a judgment awarding the company substantial damages for a strike in breach of contract.\n\nThat the Court's decision actually vacates and amends the contract that the parties themselves had made and signed is shown, I think, by the very face of that original contract. The arbitration provision covering disputes growing out of the application of the contract immediately follows another quite different arbitration provision - one covering disputes \"as to the true interpretation of this agreement\" in the following terms:\n\n\"Should any difference as to the true interpretation of this agreement arise, same shall be submitted to a Board of Arbitration of two members, one representing the firm, and one representing the Union. If said members cannot agree, a third member, who must be a disinterested party shall be selected, and the decision of the said Board of Arbitration shall be binding. It is further agreed by both parties hereto that during such arbitration, there shall be no suspension of work.\" (Emphasis supplied.)\n\n\n In view of the fact that this latter provision contains an explicit promise by the union \"that during such arbitration, there shall be no suspension of work,\" it seems to me plain that the parties to this contract, knowing how to write a provision binding a union not to strike, deliberately included a no-strike clause with regard to disputes over broad questions of contractual interpretation and deliberately excluded such a clause with regard to the essentially factual disputes arising out of the application of the contract in particular instances. And there is not a word anywhere else in this agreement which indicates that this perfectly sensible contractual framework for handling these two different kinds of disputes was not \n\n[369 \nU.S. 95, 108]\n\u00a0\n intended to operate in the precise manner dictated by the express language of the two arbitration provisions.\n\nThe defense offered for the Court's rewriting of the contract which the parties themselves made is that to allow the parties' own contract to stand \"would obviously do violence to accepted principles of traditional contract law\" and \"be completely at odds with the basic policy of national labor legislation to promote the arbitral process.\" I had supposed, however - though evidently the Court thinks otherwise - that the job of courts enforcing contracts was to give legal effect to what the contracting parties actually agree to do, not to what courts think they ought to do. In any case, I have been unable to find any accepted principle of contract law - traditional or otherwise - that permits courts to change completely the nature of a contract by adding new promises that the parties themselves refused to make in order that the new court-made contract might better fit into whatever social, economic, or legal policies the courts believe to be so important that they should have been taken out of the realm of voluntary contract by the legislative body and furthered by compulsory legislation.\n\nThe mere fact that the dispute which brought about this strike was subject to \"final and binding\" arbitration under this contract certainly does not justify the conclusion that the union relinquished its right to strike in support of its position on that dispute. The issue here involves, not the nature of the arbitration proceeding, but the question of whether the union, by agreeing to arbitrate, has given up all other separate and distinct methods of getting its way. Surely, no one would suggest that a provision for final and binding arbitration would preclude a union from attempting to persuade an employer to forego action the union was against, even where that action was fully within the employer's rights under the contract. The same principle supports the right of the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 95, 109]\n\u00a0\n union to strike in such a situation for historically, and as was recognized in both the Wagner and Taft-Hartley Acts, the strike has been the unions' most important weapon of persuasion. To say that the right to strike is inconsistent with the contractual duty to arbitrate sounds like a dull echo of the argument which used to be so popular that the right to strike was inconsistent with the contractual duty to work - an argument which frequently went so far as to say that strikes are inconsistent with both the common law and the Constitution.\n\nThe additional burden placed upon the union by the Court's writing into the agreement here a promise not to strike is certainly not a matter of minor interest to this employer or to the union. The history of industrial relations in this country emphasizes the great importance to unions of the right to strike as well as an understandable desire on the part of employers to avoid such work stop-pages. Both parties to collective bargaining discussions have much at stake as to whether there will be a no-strike clause in any resulting agreement. It is difficult to believe that the desire of employers to get such a promise and the desire of the union to avoid giving it are matters which are not constantly in the minds of those who negotiate these contracts. In such a setting, to hold - on the basis of no evidence whatever - that a union, without knowing it, impliedly surrendered the right to strike by virtue of \"traditional contract law\" or anything else is to me just fiction. It took more than 50 years for unions to have written into federal legislation the principle that they have a right to strike. I cannot understand how anyone familiar with that history can allow that legislatively recognized right to be undercut on the basis of the attenuated implications the Court uses here.\n\nI do not mean to suggest that an implied contractual promise cannot sometimes be found where there are facts and circumstances sufficient to warrant the conclusion \n\n[369 \nU.S. 95, 110]\n\u00a0\n that such was the intention of the parties. But there is no factual basis for such a conclusion in this case and the Court does not even claim to the contrary. The implication of a no-strike clause which the Court purports to find here - an implication completely at war with the language the parties used in making this contract as well as with the normal understanding of the negotiation process by which such contracts are made - has not been supported by so much as one scrap of evidence in this record. The implication found by the Court thus flows neither from the contract itself nor, so far as this record shows, from the intention of the parties. In my judgment, an \"implication\" of that nature would better be described as a rigid rule of law that an agreement to arbitrate has precisely the same effect as an agreement not to strike - a rule of law which introduces revolutionary doctrine into the field of collective bargaining.\n\nI agree that the Taft-Hartley Act shows a congressional purpose to treat collective bargaining contracts and agreements for arbitration in them as one important way of insuring stability in industrial production and labor relations. But the fact that we may agree, as I do, that these settlements by arbitration are desirable is no excuse whatever for imposing such \"contracts,\" either to compel arbitration or to forbid striking, upon unwilling parties. That approach is certainly contrary to the industrial and labor philosophy of the Taft-Hartley Act. Whatever else may be said about that Act, it seems plain that it was enacted on the view that the best way to bring about industrial peace was through voluntary, not compelled, labor agreements. Section 301 is torn from its roots when it is held to require the sort of compulsory arbitration imposed by this decision. I would reverse this case and relegate this controversy to the forum in which it belongs - the collective bargaining table. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 95, 111]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","186":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTEAMSTERS v.

He rested jurisdiction on 28 U.S.C. 1343 (3), based the cause of action on 42 U.S.C. 1983 and alleged that appellees had acted under color of state law. A three-judge District Court convened to consider the case abstained from further proceedings pending interpretation by the state courts of certain state statutes relied upon by appellees as requiring racial segregation in the restaurant. Appellants appealed both to the Court of Appeals and directly to this Court. Held:\n\n 1. Since the unconstitutionality of state statutes requiring racial segregation in publicly operated facilities is so well settled that it is foreclosed as a litigable issue (Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, \n365 \nU.S. 715\n), a three-judge court was not required to pass on this case under 28 U.S.C. 2281 (Bailey v.

Smith.\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\nAppellant, a Negro who was refused nonsegregated service in the Memphis Municipal Airport restaurant operated by appellee Dobbs Houses, Inc., under a lease from appellee City of Memphis, instituted this action on behalf of himself and other Negroes similarly situated seeking an injunction against such discrimination. He rested jurisdiction upon 28 U.S.C. 1343 (3) and premised the cause of action upon 42 U.S.C. 1983. Although the complaint alleged that appellees acted under color of state law, it did not identify any particular state statutes or regulations being challenged. But appellees' answers, in addition to asserting that the restaurant was a private enterprise to which the Fourteenth Amendment did not apply, invoked Tenn. Code Ann. 53-2120, 53-2121, and Regulation No. R-18 (L). The statutes as now phrased authorize the Division of Hotel and Restaurant Inspection of the State Department of Conservation to issue \"such rules and regulations . . . as may be necessary pertaining to the safety and\/or sanitation of hotels and restaurants . . .\" and make violations of such regulations a misdemeanor. The regulation, promulgated by the Division, provides that \"Restaurants catering to both white and negro patrons should be arranged so that each race is properly segregated.\" The answers also set up the lease agreement which provides, inter alia, that the leased premises are to be used \"only and exclusively for lawful purposes, \n\n[369 \nU.S. 350, 352]\n\u00a0\n and no part of the premises shall be used in any manner whatsoever for any purposes in violation of the laws of . . . the State of Tennessee . . . .\" The City of Memphis alleged further that unless and until the regulation was declared unconstitutional, the city would be bound to object to desegregation of the restaurant by Dobbs Houses as a violation of Tennessee law and of the lease. Dobbs Houses alleged that desegregation by it of the restaurant would therefore subject it to forfeiture of the lease. Dobbs Houses later amended its answer to include a defense based on Tenn. Code Ann. 62-710. That statute \"abrogates\" Tennessee's common-law cause of action for exclusion from hotels or other public places, and declares that the operators of such establishments are free to exclude persons \"for any reason whatever.\"\n\nWhen the appellant moved for summary judgment before a single district judge, the appellees opposed the motion on the ground that the relief sought necessarily challenged the constitutionality of the state statutes and regulation so that under 28 U.S.C. 2281, 2284, a three-judge court was required. The single judge thereupon convened a three-judge court. Upon renewal by the appellant before that court of his motion for summary judgment, the appellees urged, and the three-judge court ordered, that appellant's suit should be held in abeyance pending a \"Declaratory Judgment suit to be brought by plaintiffs in the Tennessee Courts seeking an interpretation of the State statutes under consideration.\" Appellant, being in doubt whether the case was one \"required . . . to be heard and determined by a district court of three judges,\" in addition to appealing from the abstention order directly to this Court under 28 U.S.C. 1253, also perfected a timely appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. We postponed consideration of the question of our jurisdiction of the direct appeal to the hearing on the merits. \n368 \nU.S. 808\n. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 350, 353]\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhether or not it may be said that appellant's complaint is to be read as seeking, under 28 U.S.C. 2281, an \"injunction restraining the enforcement, operation or execution of [a] . . . State statute by restraining the action of any officer of such State in the enforcement or execution of such statute,\" a question which we need not decide, it is clear for other reasons that a three-judge court was not required for the disposition of this case. Since, as was conceded by Dobbs Houses at the bar of this Court, the Dobbs Houses restaurant was subject to the strictures of the Fourteenth Amendment under Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, \n365 \nU.S. 715\n, the statutes and regulation invoked by appellees could have furnished a defense to the action only insofar as they expressed an affirmative state policy fostering segregation in publicly operated facilities. But our decisions have foreclosed any possible contention that such a statute or regulation may stand consistently with the Fourteenth Amendment. Brown v. Board of Education, \n347 \nU.S. 483\n; Mayor & City Council v. Dawson, \n350 \nU.S. 877\n; Holmes v. City of Atlanta, \n350 \nU.S. 879\n; Gayle v. Browder, \n352 \nU.S. 903\n; New Orleans City Park Improvement Assn. v. Detiege, \n358 \nU.S. 54\n. It follows under our recent decision in Bailey v. Patterson, ante, p. 31, that a three-judge court was not required and that jurisdiction of this appeal is vested in the Court of Appeals.\n\nBut we see no reason why disposition of the case should await decision of the appeal by the Court of Appeals. On the merits, no issue remains to be resolved. This is clear under prior decisions and the undisputed facts of the case. Accordingly no occasion is presented for abstention, and the litigation should be disposed of as expeditiously as is consistent with proper judicial administration. In light of the perfected appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, it is appropriate that we treat, and we do treat, appellant's jurisdictional statement as a petition for writ \n\n[369 \nU.S. 350, 354]\n\u00a0\n of certiorari prior to judgment in the Court of Appeals. 28 U.S.C. 1254 (1), 2101 (e); Stainback v.

The suit, based on diversity of citizenship, sought contractual reimbursement of taxes paid to the City of Mobile relative to sales of natural gas to the appellees. They defended on the ground that the contracts contemplated reimbursement only of valid tax payments, and that the License Code of the City of Mobile, 1, par. 193 (1955), under which the tax was exacted and paid, was invalid under the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The Court of Appeals sustained this contention, by interpreting both the primary and enforcement provisions of the License Code and its surrounding state legislation as operating not to tax a separable local portion of interstate commerce but as a means of licensing appellant's right of entry into the City from without the State. 282 F.2d 574, 580. We postponed determination of our jurisdiction to consideration of the merits, \n366 \nU.S. 916\n, and now find that the case is properly here under 28 U.S.C. 1254 (2).\n\nThe interpretation of state law by the Court of Appeals, in an opinion by its Alabama member, was rendered in advance of construction of the License Code by the courts of the State, which alone, of course, can define its authoritative meaning. We ought not, certainly on this record, either accept the Court of Appeals' construction or, on an independent consideration, reject what the Alabama Supreme Court may later definitively approve. The availability of appropriate declaratory-judgment proceedings under Ala. Code, Tit. 7, 156-168 (1940), avoids this unsatisfactory dilemma. Wise judicial administration in this case counsels that decision of the federal \n\n[369 \nU.S. 134, 136]\n\u00a0\n question be deferred until the potentially controlling state-law issue is authoritatively put to rest. See Leiter Minerals, Inc., v. United States, \n352 \nU.S. 220, 228\n-229. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated to permit a construction of the License Code of the City of Mobile, so far as relevant to this litigation, to be sought with every expedition in the state courts.\n\n    It is so ordered.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE WHITTAKER took no part in the disposition of this case.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS.\n\nThis case should be disposed of here; the long-drawn-out litigation\n*\n foisted on the parties by the Court is needless. No matter how the local ordinance is construed the tax is constitutional. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 134, 137]\n\u00a0\n\n\nCongress under the Natural Gas Act, as amended, would have the authority to prevent interstate pipelines from delivering any gas for industrial use. Federal Power Comm'n v. Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp., \n365 \nU.S. 1\n. Yet once the interstate movement commences, the line between permissible and impermissible local regulation is no longer a puzzle.\n\nUnited is an interstate pipeline company that brings natural gas into Alabama and supplies it in the City of Mobile to a distributor, Mobile Gas. United delivers gas to Mobile Gas at three stations not for resale, but for delivery to appellees under contracts between appellant and appellees. The gas, when delivered to Mobile Gas, is at a lower pressure than when it enters the State. When Mobile Gas delivers it to the industrial customers here involved, the gas is at a still lower pressure. The case is therefore on all fours with East Ohio Gas Co. v. Tax Comm'n, \n283 \nU.S. 465\n. In speaking of the delivery of gas at a reduced pressure within Ohio by an interstate carrier, the Court said that the gas was then\n\n\"divided into the many thousand relatively tiny streams that enter the small service lines connecting such mains with the pipes on the consumers' premises. So segregated the gas in such service lines and \n\n[369 \nU.S. 134, 138]\n\u00a0\n pipes remains in readiness or moves forward to serve as needed. The treatment and division of the large compressed volume of gas is like the breaking of an original package, after shipment in interstate commerce, in order that its contents may be treated, prepared for sale and sold at retail. . . . It follows that the furnishing of gas to consumers in Ohio municipalities by means of distribution plants to supply the gas suitably for the service for which it is intended is not interstate commerce but a business of purely local concern exclusively within the jurisdiction of the State.\" Id., at 471.\n\n\n Here too the package is broken on delivery of the gas intrastate to Mobile Gas, the distributor, at a reduced pressure.\n\nIt matters not that the City of Mobile calls the tax levied here a \"license tax.\" In Interstate Pipe Line Co. v. Stone, \n337 \nU.S. 662\n, Mississippi levied a \"privilege\" tax on the gross receipts of a pipeline that was bringing oil from Mississippi fields to loading racks in that State, where the oil was pumped into railroad cars for shipment out of state.\n\nMr. Justice Rutledge, speaking for himself and three others, said:\n\n \"Since all the activities upon which the tax is imposed are carried on in Mississippi, there is no due process objection to the tax. The tax does not discriminate against interstate commerce in favor of competing intrastate commerce of like character. The nature of the subject of taxation makes apportionment unnecessary; there is no attempt to tax interstate activity carried on outside Mississippi's borders. No other state can repeat the tax. For these reasons the commerce clause does not invalidate this tax.\" Id., at 667-668. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 134, 139]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Mr. Justice Burton, who also joined in the judgment, approved the tax for the following reason: \"I concur in the judgment solely on the ground that the tax imposed by the State of Mississippi was a tax on the privilege of operating a pipe line for transporting oil in Mississippi in intrastate commerce and that, as such, it was a valid tax.\" Id., at 668.\n\nIn Southern Natural Gas Corp. v. Alabama, \n301 \nU.S. 148\n, an interstate pipeline company made deliveries in Alabama to three distributors and one industrial user. These activities were held to be local, on which a non-discriminatory franchise tax could be levied. In Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. v. Public Service Comm'n, \n332 \nU.S. 507, 514\n, direct sales by interstate pipelines to local consumers (as distinguished from deliveries to local distributing companies for resale) were held to be subject to state regulation. Speaking of the Natural Gas Act, we said:\n\n\"Congress, it is true, occupied a field. But it was meticulous to take in only territory which this Court had held the states could not reach. That area did not include direct consumer sales, whether for industrial or other uses. Those sales had been regulated by the states and the regulation had been repeatedly sustained. In no instance reaching this Court had it been stricken down.\" Id., at 519.\n\n\n The \"license tax\" in the present case, if it be such, is only a tax on a wholly intrastate activity, to wit - the delivery of gas to the local distributor for delivery to local consumers.\n\nThis conclusion is more in the tradition of our cases than was Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. v. Public Service Comm'n; \n341 \nU.S. 329\n, where a State was allowed to exact from an interstate pipeline company a certificate of public convenience and necessity to make direct deliveries of gas to industrial consumers. The Court said that \"the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 134, 140]\n\u00a0\n sale and distribution of gas to local consumers\" was a transaction \"essentially local\" and was \"subject to state regulation without infringement of the Commerce Clause.\" Id., at 333. The sales there proposed were to be made directly from the pipeline to the industrial users. Here the gas first goes to the local distributor, which in turn reduces the pressure and makes delivery to the industrial customers. The local nature of the transaction is more apparent and less complicated than it was in the Panhandle case.\n\nI would reverse the judgment below and hold the tax valid.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] The practice of remitting parties who sue in court to an administrative remedy (see, e. g., Pennsylvania R. Co. v. United States, \n363 \nU.S. 202\n) or of remitting those who sue in a federal court to a state court (Clay v. Sun Insurance Office, \n363 \nU.S. 207\n; Clark, Federal Procedural Reform and States' Rights, 40 Tex. L. Rev. 211) places a financial burden on litigants, which can be afforded only by those who can take the cost as a tax deduction or get reimbursement through increased rates. For a case where the parties at the end of 14 years were still litigating a $7,000 (approx.) claim after starting in one court, being shunted to an agency, and then ending in a different court, see Pennsylvania R. Co. v. United States, supra.\n\nIn Gardner, The Administrative Process, Legal Institutions Today and Tomorrow (1959), pp. 139-140, it was said:\n\n\"Anyone who considers judicial review of agency action must allow about a year if he has access to direct review by a court of appeals and about two years if he must file in a district court and then carry the controversy to the court of appeals. If a certiorari question should develop which would warrant Supreme Court review, another year should be added. If the result of the review should be to require further agency proceedings, yet another year or so must be added. Except for the litigant who advantages by delay, not many administrative \n\n[369 \nU.S. 134, 137]\n\u00a0\n issues warrant an investment of time such as this. In probably a majority of the circumstances, it would be sounder business practice to adjust at once to the agency decision and go on from there, rather than to endure several years of uncertainty in order to try to improve the result.\n\n\n\"The matter of expense is closely related to that of delay. It is not possible to be precise, and surely it is not polite to mention money. Yet none can discuss realistically judicial review unless he recognizes that an issue of average complexity cannot adequately be carried to the courts except at a cost which will range upward from $5,000.\" See also Landis, Report on Regulatory Agencies to the President-Elect (1960), pp. 5-13.\n\n\n The cost of printing records for this Court is now $3.80 a page.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, dissenting.\n\nIn my opinion none of the considerations underlying the doctrine of federal judicial abstention (see Harrison v. N. A. A. C. P., \n360 \nU.S. 167, 176\n-177) call for its application here. There is no reasonable likelihood that a prior state construction of this License Code would either change the complexion of the constitutional issue or avoid the necessity of its eventual adjudication by this Court.\n\nEven were this local enactment to be construed by the state courts to require a license of the appellant as a precondition of engaging in the distribution of natural gas within the City of Mobile, that of itself would not ordain the answer to the constitutional question. See Southern Natural Gas Corp. v. Alabama, \n301 \nU.S. 148\n; East Ohio Gas Co. v. Tax Comm'n, \n283 \nU.S. 465\n; see also Illinois Natural Gas Co. v. Central Illinois Pub. Serv. Co., \n314 \nU.S. 498, 506\n. Cf. Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v. Minnesota, \n358 \nU.S. 450\n. Nor can I see how such a state adjudication would serve to illumine the nature of United's activities in Mobile.\n\nAs I view matters, nothing useful is to be accomplished by remitting the parties to the state courts, and I would adjudicate the constitutional issue now. \n\n[369 \nU.S. 134, 141]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","190":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v.

The District Court found that the pricing plan of each appellee was a prima facie violation of 2 (a); but it concluded that these discriminatory prices were justified under the proviso of 2 (a) which permits price differentials which make only \"due allowance for differences in the cost of manufacture, sale, or delivery.\" In doing so, it relied upon a showing by appellees that the average cost of sales and deliveries to all chain stores was lower than the average cost of sales and deliveries to all independent stores. Held: The class cost justifications submitted to the District Court by appellees did not satisfy their burden under 2 (b) of showing that their respective discriminatory pricing plans reflected only a \"due allowance\" for actual cost differences, since there was not a sufficient resemblance of the individual members of each class in the essential cost-determinative factors on which the classifications were based.

JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThis is a direct appeal\n1\n from a judgment dismissing the Government's Section 2 (a) Clayton Act\n2\n suit in which it sought an injunction against the selling of fluid milk products by the appellees, The Borden Company and Bowman Dairy Company, at prices which discriminate between independently owned grocery stores and grocery store chains. The District Court in an unreported decision found the pricing plan of each dairy to be a prima facie violation of 2 (a) but concluded that these discriminatory prices were legalized by the cost justification proviso of 2 (a), which permits price differentials as long as they \"make only due allowance for differences in the cost of manufacture, sale, or delivery resulting from the differing methods or quantities in which such commodities are to such purchasers sold or delivered.\" To review the Government's contention that the District Court had improperly permitted cost justifications based on the average cost of dealing with broad groups of customers unrelated in \n\n[370 \nU.S. 460, 462]\n\u00a0\n cost-saving factors,\n3\n we noted probable jurisdiction, \n368 \nU.S. 924\n, and directed the parties to brief and argue the case separately as to each appellee, \n368 \nU.S. 963\n. However, finding the same problem at the root of the cost justifications of each appellee, we have dealt with both in this single opinion. We have concluded that the class cost justifications submitted to the District Court by the appellees did not satisfy their burden of showing that their respective discriminatory pricing plans reflected only a \"due allowance\" for cost differences.\n\nBy way of background, we first point out that the present appeal is merely a glimpse of protracted litigation between the parties which began in 1951 and which has not yet seen its end. The original complaint charged violations of 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and 2 (a) of the Clayton Act. The District Court dismissed the suit, holding that there was no proof of the alleged Sherman Act violations and that no equitable relief was necessary under the Clayton Act charge because appellees were already restrained by a consent decree entered in a private antitrust case. 111 F. Supp. 562. On direct appeal we affirmed the dismissal of the Sherman Act charges but held erroneous the refusal to grant an injunction on the Clayton Act claim solely because of the existence of the private decree. \n347 \nU.S. 514\n. On remand the case was reopened and on its prima facie case the Government introduced recent general price schedules and illustrated their effect on sample stores to show that each appellee was still engaged in illegal price discriminations \n\n[370 \nU.S. 460, 463]\n\u00a0\n notwithstanding the consent decree. In defense the appellees each introduced voluminous cost studies in justification of their pricing systems. The entire case was submitted via stipulations, depositions, and briefs. There was no dispute as to the existence of price discrimination; the sole question was whether the differences in price reflected permissible allowances for variances in cost.\n\nIn view of our disposition, we need not relate the facts in detail. Both appellees are major distributors of fluid milk products in metropolitan Chicago. The sales of both dairies to retail stores during the period in question were handled under plans which gave most of their customers - the independently owned stores - percentage discounts off list price which increased with the volume of their purchases to a specified maximum while granting a few customers - the grocery store chains - a flat discount without reference to volume and substantially greater than the maximum discount available under the volume plan offered independent stores. These discounts were made effective through schedules which appeared to cover all stores; however, the schedules were modified by private letters to the grocery chains confirming their higher discounts.\n4\n Although the two sets of discounts were never \n\n[370 \nU.S. 460, 464]\n\u00a0\n officially labeled \"independent\" and \"chain\" prices, they were treated, called, and regarded as such throughout the record.\n\nTo support their defense that the disparities in price between independents and chains were attributable to differences in the cost of dealing with the two types of \n\n[370 \nU.S. 460, 465]\n\u00a0\n customers, the appellees introduced cost studies which will be described separately because of their differing content and analytical approach.\n\nThe Borden pricing system produced two classes of customers. The two chains, A & P and Jewel, with their combined total of 254 stores constituted one class. The 1,322 independent stores, grouped in four brackets based on the volume of their purchases, made up the other. Borden's cost justification was built on comparisons of its average cost per $100 of sales to the chains in relation to the average cost of similar sales to each of the four groups of independents. The costs considered were personnel (including routemen, clerical and sales employees), truck expenses, and losses on bad debts and returned milk. Various methods of cost allocation were utilized: Drivers' time spent at each store was charged directly to that store; certain clerical expenses were allocated between the two general classes; costs not susceptible of either of the foregoing were charged to the various stores on a per stop, per store, or volume basis.\n\nBowman's cost justification was based on differences in volume and methods of delivery. It relied heavily upon a study of the cost per minute of its routemen's time. It determined that substantial portions of this time were devoted to three operations, none of which were ever performed for the 163 stores operated by its two major chain customers.\n5\n These added work steps arose from the method of collection, i. e., cash on delivery and the delayed collections connected therewith, and the performance of \"optional customer services.\" The customer services, performed with varying frequency depending upon the circumstances, included \"services that the driver may be requested to do, such as deliver the order inside, place the containers in a refrigerator, rearrange \n\n[370 \nU.S. 460, 466]\n\u00a0\n containers so that any product remaining unsold from yesterday will be sold first today, leave cases of products at different spots in the store, etc.\" The experts conducting the study calculated as to these elements a \"standard\" cost per unit of product delivered: the aggregate time required to perform the services, as determined by sample time studies, was divided by the total number of units of product delivered. In essence, the Bowman justification was merely a comparison of the cost of these services in relation to the disparity between the chain and independent prices. Although it was shown that the five sample independents in the Government's prima facie case received the added services,\n6\n it was not shown or found that all 2,500 independents supplied by Bowman partook of them. On the basis of its studies Bowman estimated that about two-thirds of the independent stores received the \"optional customer services\" on a daily basis and that \"most store customers pay the driver in cash daily.\"\n\nOn these facts, stated here in rather summary fashion, the trial court held that appellees had met the requirements of the proviso of 2 (a) on the theory that the general cost differences between chain stores as a class and independents as a class justified the disparities in price reflected in appellees' schedules. In so doing the trial court itself found \"the studies . . . imperfect in \n\n[370 \nU.S. 460, 467]\n\u00a0\n some respects . . . .\" It noted the \"seemingly arbitrary\" nature of a classification resulting \"in percentage discounts which do not bear a direct ratio to differences in volume of sales.\" But it found \"this mode of classification is not wholly arbitrary - after all, most chain stores do purchase larger volumes of milk than do most independent stores.\"\n7\n We believe it was erroneous for the trial court to permit cost justifications based upon such classifications.\n\nThe burden, of course, was upon the appellees to prove that the illegal price discrimination, which the Government claimed and the trial court found present, was immunized by the cost justification proviso of 2 (a). Such is the mandate of 2 (b) as interpreted by this Court in Federal Trade Comm'n v. Morton Salt Co., \n334 \nU.S. 37, 44\n-45 (1948).\n8\n There can be no doubt that the 2 (a) proviso as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act contemplates, both in express wording and legislative history, a showing of actual cost differences resulting from the differing methods or quantities in which the commodities in question are sold or delivered.\n9\n The only \n\n[370 \nU.S. 460, 468]\n\u00a0\n question before us is how accurate this showing must be in relation to each particular purchaser.\n\nAlthough the language of the proviso, with some support in the legislative history,\n10\n is literally susceptible of a construction which would require any discrepancy in price between any two purchasers to be individually justified, the proviso has not been so construed by those charged with its enforcement. The Government candidly recognizes in its briefs filed in the instant case that \"[a]s a matter of practical necessity . . . when a seller deals with a very large number of customers, he cannot be required to establish different cost-reflecting prices for each customer.\" In this same vein, the practice of grouping customers for pricing purposes has long had the approval of the Federal Trade Commission.\n11\n We ourselves have noted the \"elusiveness of cost data\" in a Robinson-Patman Act proceeding. Automatic Canteen Co. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, \n346 \nU.S. 61, 68\n (1953). In short, to completely renounce class pricing as justified by class accounting would be to eliminate in practical effect the cost justification proviso as to sellers having a large number of purchasers, thereby preventing such sellers from passing on economies to their customers. It seems hardly necessary to say that such a result is at war with Congress' language and purpose.\n\nBut this is not to say that price differentials can be justified on the basis of arbitrary classifications or even \n\n[370 \nU.S. 460, 469]\n\u00a0\n classifications which are representative of a numerical majority of the individual members. At some point practical considerations shade into a circumvention of the proviso. A balance is struck by the use of classes for cost justification which are composed of members of such selfsameness as to make the averaging of the cost of dealing with the group a valid and reasonable indicium of the cost of dealing with any specific group member.\n12\n High on the list of \"musts\" in the use of the average cost of customer groupings under the proviso of 2 (a) is a close resemblance of the individual members of each group on the essential point or points which determine the costs considered.\n\nIn this regard we do not find the classifications submitted by the appellees to have been shown to be of sufficient homogeneity. Certainly, the cost factors considered were not necessarily encompassed within the manner in which a customer is owned. Turning first to Borden's justification, we note that it not only failed to show that the economies relied upon were isolated within the favored class but affirmatively revealed that members of the classes utilized were substantially unlike in the cost saving aspects considered. For instance, the favorable cost comparisons between the chains and the larger independents were for the greater part controlled by the higher average volume of the chain stores in comparison to the average volume of the 80-member class to which these independents were relegated. The District Court allowed this manner of justification because \"most chain stores do purchase larger volumes of milk than do most independent stores.\" However, such a grouping for cost justification purposes, composed as it is of some independents \n\n[370 \nU.S. 460, 470]\n\u00a0\n having volumes comparable to, and in some cases larger than, that of the chain stores, created artificial disparities between the larger independents and the chain stores. It is like averaging one horse and one rabbit. As the Federal Trade Commission said in In the Matter of Champion Spark Plug Co., 50 F. T. C. 30, 43 (1953): \"A cost justification based on the difference between an estimated average cost of selling to one or two large customers and an average cost of selling to all other customers cannot be accepted as a defense to a charge of price discrimination.\" This volume gap between the larger independents and the chain stores was further widened by grouping together the two chains, thereby raising the average volume of the stores of the smaller of the two chains in relation to the larger independents. Nor is the vice in the Borden class justification solely in the paper volumes relied upon, for it attributed to many independents cost factors which were not true indicia of the cost of dealing with those particular consumers. To illustrate, each independent was assigned a portion of the total expenses involved in daily cash collections, although it was not shown that all independents paid cash and in fact Borden admitted only that a \"large majority\" did so.\n\nLikewise the details of Bowman's cost study show a failure in classification. Only one additional point need be made. Its justification emphasized its costs for \"optional customer service\" and daily cash collection with the resulting \"delay to collect.\" As shown by its study these elements were crucial to Bowman's cost justification. In the study the experts charged all independents and no chain store with these costs. Yet, it was not shown that all independents received these services daily or even on some lesser basis. Bowman's studies indicated only that a large majority of independents took these services on a daily basis. Under such circumstances \n\n[370 \nU.S. 460, 471]\n\u00a0\n the use of these cost factors across the board in calculating independent store costs is not a permissible justification, for it possibly allocates costs to some independents whose mode of purchasing does not give rise to them. The burden was upon the profferer of the classification to negate this possibility, and this burden has not been met here. If these factors control the cost of dealing, then their presence or absence might with more justification be the password for admission into the various price categories.\n13\n\u00a0\n\nThe appellees argue in the alternative that their cost justifications can be sufficiently unscrambled to remove any taint the Court may find in them and still show a cost gap sufficient to justify the price disparity between the chains and any independent. This mass of underlying statistical data not considered by the trial court and now tied together by untried theories can best be evaluated on remand, and we therefore do not consider its sufficiency here.\n\nIn sum, the record here shows that price discriminations have been permitted on the basis of cost differences between broad customer groupings, apparently based on the nature of ownership but in any event not shown to be so homogeneous as to permit the joining together of these purchasers for cost allocations purposes. If this is the only justification for appellees' pricing schemes, they are illegal. We do not believe that an appropriate decree would require the trial court continuously to \"pass judgment on the pricing practices of these defendants.\" As to the issuance of an injunction, however, the case is now \n\n[370 \nU.S. 460, 472]\n\u00a0\n 11 years old and we have no way of knowing whether equitable relief is in order. Certainly a relevant factor in such consideration would be whether the practices described above are still being followed in any form. This the record here does not show. Such matters can only be ascertained upon the presently existing facts and the careful application of the principles we have enunciated. For that purpose the case is\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Jurisdiction is conferred under 2 of the Expediting Act of February 11, 1903, 32 Stat. 823, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 29.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] \"SEC. 2.

At the time the stipulation was proposed, the trial court made it quite clear that the Government by so stipulating was not waiving its right to argue the legal sufficiency of the proffered cost studies.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Borden in June of 1954 issued the following discount schedule to \"be applied to all purchases of Borden's fresh milk\":\n\n      Percent of Average converted units per day:   discounts\n\n\n 0- 24 ............................................ 0  25- 74 ............................................ 2  75-149 ............................................ 3 150 and over ....................................... 4\n\n\n At this same time, letters were sent to The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company and The Jewel Food Stores granting them flat 8 1\/2% discounts. A few of the larger independents by special arrangement were given an additional 1 1\/2% discount, thereby raising their total discount to 5 1\/2%. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 460, 464]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn September 1955, Borden discontinued the above discount system and utilized a net price scheme which resulted in even greater disparities between chains and independents.\n\nBowman in June of 1954 operated under the following \"Resale Store Discount Schedule\":\n\n      Percent of Average converted points per day:   discounts\n\n\n 0 to 10 ..................................... 3.0 to 3.4  10 to 20 ..................................... 3.4 to 3.8  20 to 30 ..................................... 3.8 to 4.2  30 to 40 ..................................... 4.2 to 4.6  40 to 50 ..................................... 4.6 to 5.0  50 to 60 ..................................... 5.0 to 5.2  60 to 70 ..................................... 5.2 to 5.4  70 to 80 ..................................... 5.4 to 5.6  80 to 90 ..................................... 5.6 to 5.8  90 to 100 ..................................... 5.8 to 6.0 100 to 110 ..................................... 6.0 to 6.2 110 to 120 ..................................... 6.2 to 6.4 120 to 130 ..................................... 6.4 to 6.6 130 to 140 ..................................... 6.6 to 6.8 140 to 150 ..................................... 6.8 to 7.0\n\n\n This schedule was modified in August by the addition of the following discounts:\n\n      Percent of Average converted points per day:   discounts\n\n\n150 to 200 ..................................... 7.0 to 8.0 Over 200 ....................................... 8.0\n\n\n During this same period Bowman by letter granted The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company and The Kroger Company flat 11% discounts. Goldblatt Bros., also a multi-store operation, was granted a flat 8 1\/2%.\n\nIn 1955 and again in 1956 Bowman modified the brackets and percentages of its discount schedules, but not in a manner which reduced the disparity between independents and chains.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The third chain, Goldblatt Bros., also did not take these services.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The contention is made that the Government limited its prima facie case to a few stores on some routes and that therefore cost justification was only necessary as to them. This overlooks the fact that sampling has long been a recognized technique in price discrimination cases and that this offering was in support of the Government's position, found valid by the trial court, that the entire Chicago pricing scheme of each appellee, as evidenced by its published price lists, was in violation of 2 (a). In addition, appellee's cost justifications were not limited to the Government's sample stores.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Even the trial court was unwilling to give its \"stamp of approval to all pricing policies and practices revealed by the evidence.\" But it concluded that to enjoin such practices would lead to regulation and would require the court continually \"to pass judgment on the pricing practices of these defendants,\" a matter which might better be handled by proceedings before the Federal Trade Commission.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] Sec. 2 (b). \"Upon proof being made, at any hearing on a complaint under this section, that there has been discrimination in price or services or facilities furnished, the burden of rebutting the prima-facie case thus made by showing justification shall be upon the person charged with a violation of this section . . . .\" 49 Stat. 1526, 15 U.S.C. 13 (b).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] For a collection and discussion of the pertinent legislative history as well as the cases and treatises on the 2 (a) proviso, see Rowe, Price Discrimination Under the Robinson-Patman Act, c. 10 (1962).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] For instance, the Chairman of the Conference on the Bill reported to the House: \"The differential granted a particular customer must be traceable to some difference between him and other particular customers, either in the quantities purchased by them or in the methods by which they are purchased or their delivery taken.\" 80 Cong.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS, concurring.\n\nThis is not a case that involves problems of centralized purchasing by a large enterprise for all its constituent members, where the volume involved reduces the unit cost. We have here purchases by constituent members of chain stores of milk and milk products that will be sold at the particular store. The competitor is not a member of a competing chain or, if it is, the chain of which it is a part is a smaller one. The costs studies here involved have little, if any, relation to centralized management. They in the main pertain to two factors of cost. First, is the volume of sales of milk and milk products to the individual store and the method of payment. Second, the degree to which the store relieves the seller of milk and milk products from the costs of handling the product as it enters the store, of stacking or storing the products, and of returning the empty bottles or cartons.\n\nThe changes in the Clayton Act made by the Robinson-Patman Act now before us were made to limit discounts as \"instruments of favor and privilege and weapons of competitive oppression.\" S. Rep. No. 1502, 74th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 5; H. R. Rep. No. 2287, 74th Cong., 2d Sess., \n\n[370 \nU.S. 460, 473]\n\u00a0\n p. 9. The allowance by 2 (a) of \"differentials which make only due allowance for differences in the cost of manufacture, sale, or delivery resulting from the differing methods or quantities in which such commodities are to such purchasers sold or delivered\" was explained as follows:\n\n \"This limits the differences in cost which may justify price differentials strictly to those actual differences traceable to the particular buyer for and against whom the discrimination is granted, to the different methods of serving them, and to the different quantities in which they buy.\n\n\n \"But such differentials whether they arise in operating or overhead cost must, as is plainly stated in the phrase quoted above, be those resulting from the differing methods or quantities in which such commodities are to such purchasers sold or delivered.\n\n\n \"This, in its plain meaning, permits differences in overhead where they can actually be shown as between the customers or classes of customers concerned, but it precludes differentials based on the imputation of overhead to particular customers, or the exemption of others from it, where such overhead represents facilities or activities inseparable from the seller's business as a whole and not attributable to the business of particular customers or of the particular customers concerned in the discrimination. It leaves open as a question of fact in each case whether the differences in cost urged in justification of a price differential - whether of operating or of overhead costs - is of one kind or the other. That is, whether or not it answers the above requirements as to differences resulting from differing methods or quantities in which such commodities are to such purchasers sold or delivered.\" H. R. Rep. No. 2287, supra, p. 10. (Italics added.) \n\n[370 \nU.S. 460, 474]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n While in some cases costs relevant to the issue of discrimination under the Robinson-Patman Act may be computed class by class, the only costs relevant here are those computed store by store. The question of cost of delivery to all stores in the favored chain is irrelevant, because overhead costs applicable to a business as a unit have no bearing on any of the cost formulae presented by this record.\n\nIn the case of Bowman Dairy Co., as the Court points out, the company charged all independents for customer service rendered by Bowman's deliverymen whether the independents availed themselves of the service or not. Bowman also charged independents for the time and expense of daily cash collections and for the costs of delays in collecting. These items were charged to independents even though it was not shown that their system of payment was always in cash, rather than by central billings, the system used by the chains.\n\nIn the Borden case an independent who purchased substantially larger quantities than the average chain store could not qualify for the discount the chain store obtained. This resulted because the independents were treated as one class, the chain stores as another class. As in Bowman the independents who did not make cash payments were treated as if they did; and they were not given the advantage which the chain stores enjoyed by reason of centralized billing even though they were on a credit basis.\n\nWhat was said in Champion Spark Plug Co., 50 F. T. C. 30, 43, is relevant here:\n\n\"Respondent's cost of doing business undoubtedly varied as among its different customers. All of its selling expenses were not applicable on a proportionately equal basis to sales to all of its customers. However, in the absence of a sound basis for determining the actual cost of selling to particular customers, \n\n[370 \nU.S. 460, 475]\n\u00a0\n the sales to each customer must bear their proportionate share of the entire selling expense. A cost justification based on the difference between an estimated average cost of selling to one or two large customers and an average cost of selling to all other customers cannot be accepted as a defense to a charge of price discrimination.\"\n\n\n Where centralized purchasing for many stores takes place, the costs of dealing with the group as a class become relevant to the problem under 2 (a). But where, as here, no centralized purchasing is involved, the store-by-store costs are the only criteria relevant to the 2 (a) problem. Otherwise those with the most prestige get the largest discounts and the independent merchants are more and more forced to the wall.\n\nThe case was argued as if the grant of discounts was a natural right and that the Act should be construed so as to make the granting of them easy. The Act reflects, however, a purpose to control practices that lead to monopoly and an impoverishment of our middle class. I would therefore read it in a way that preserves as much of our traditional free enterprise as possible. Free enterprise is not free when monopoly power is used to breed more monopoly. That is the case here unless store-by-store costs are used as the criteria for discounts. This case is thus kin to that in Moore v. Mead's Fine Bread Co., \n348 \nU.S. 115\n, where the lush treasury of a chain was used to bring a local bakery to its knees. Here, as there, the chains obtain a \"competitive advantage\" not as a result \"of their skills or efficiency\" but as a consequence of other influences.\n*\n There price-cutting was \n\n[370 \nU.S. 460, 476]\n\u00a0\n the weapon. Here it is the discount. Each leads to the same end - the aggrandizement of power by the chains and the ploughing under of the independents. The antitrust laws, of which the Robinson-Patman Act is a part, were designed to avert such an inquest on free enterprise.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] See Curtiss Candy Co., 44 F. T. C. 237, 267-268, 274; International Salt Co., 49 F. T. C. 138, 153-155, 157; Champion Spark Plug Co., 50 F. T. C. 30, 43.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, dissenting.\n\nThe Court treats this case as if the District Court had introduced novel and disruptive principles into the law of \"cost justification\" under 2 (a) of the Clayton Act.\n\nAlthough I consider the respective cost studies much more adequate than the Court credits them with being, it is sufficient to say that, as I read the opinion below, the District Court judged their over-all adequacy in accordance with accepted principles of law in this field. The lower court indeed carefully refrained from giving unqualified approval to either set of cost studies, in substance merely holding (1) that the studies had been conscientiously prepared and prima facie appeared to justify generally the price discriminations arising from the appellees' discount practices (and more particularly to justify those specifically relied on by the Government as \"trial\" samples); and (2) that, in light of the long-drawn-out history of this litigation, the appropriate disposition was to deny injunctive relief, allowing the Government to bring to the attention of the Federal Trade Commission any other specific price differentials which it believed not justifiable under these or other cost studies.\n\nThis seems to me an eminently sensible and fair disposition of this state litigation which has now been in the courts for nearly 12 years. I can see no point whatever in this Court sending the case back to the District Court for what will presumably amount to a third trial, especially when it is apparent that drastic changes in the \n\n[370 \nU.S. 460, 477]\n\u00a0\n situation complained of by the Government have taken place since 1955.\n\nHad what the record now reveals been fully appreciated at the time the Jurisdictional Statement was considered, a summary disposition of the case would have been called for.\n*\n\u00a0\n\nI would affirm.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] The delays occasioned by the overcrowded docket of this Court as well as the nature of the issues in this litigation again point up the inadvisability of vesting sole appellate jurisdiction over this type of case in this Court.

DAVIS(1962)\nNo. 190\nArgued: March 28, 1962Decided: June 4, 1962\n\n\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Together with No. 268, Davis et al. v. United States, also on certiorari to the same Court.\n\n Pursuant to a property settlement agreement later incorporated in a divorce decree, a taxpayer in Delaware transferred to his former wife, in return for the release of her marital claims, certain shares of stock which had appreciated in market value and which were solely his property subject to certain inchoate marital rights of the wife, including a right of intestate succession and a right upon divorce to a \"reasonable\" share of the husband's property. He also paid the fees of her attorney for advice given to her about the tax consequences of the property settlement. Held:\n\n 1. In these circumstances and in view of pertinent provisions of Delaware law, this transfer of stock is to be considered under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 not a nontaxable division of property between co-owners but a taxable transfer of property in satisfaction of a legal obligation. Pp. 68-71.\n\n\n 2. On the record in this case, the Commissioner's assessment of a taxable gain based upon the value of the stock at the date of its transfer has not been shown to be erroneous. Pp. 71-74.\n\n\n 3. The amount paid by the husband to his former wife's attorney as a fee for advice given to her about the tax consequences of the property settlement was not deductible by the husband under 212 (3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. Pp. 74-75.\n\n\n 152 Ct. Cl. 805, 287 F.2d 168, affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n\nI. Henry Kutz and Harold C. Wilkenfeld argued the cause for the United States in both cases. With them on the briefs were Solicitor General Cox, Assistant Attorney General Oberdorfer, Wayne G. Barnett, Meyer Rothwacks and Arthur I. Gould.\n\nConverse Murdoch argued the cause and filed briefs for the respondents in No. 190 and petitioners in No. 268. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 65, 66]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThese cases involve the tax consequences of a transfer of appreciated property by Thomas Crawley Davis\n1\n to his former wife pursuant to a property settlement agreement executed prior to divorce, as well as the deductibility of his payment of her legal expenses in connection therewith. The Court of Claims upset the Commissioner's determination that there was taxable gain on the transfer but upheld his ruling that the fees paid the wife's attorney were not deductible. 152 Ct. Cl. 805, 287 F.2d 168. We granted certiorari on a conflict in the Court of Appeals and the Court of Claims on the taxability of such transfers.\n2\n\u00a0\n368 \nU.S. 813\n. We have decided that the taxpayer did have a taxable gain on the transfer and that the wife's attorney's fees were not deductible.\n\nIn 1954 the taxpayer and his then wife made a voluntary property settlement and separation agreement calling for support payments to the wife and minor child in addition to the transfer of certain personal property to the wife. Under Delaware law all the property transferred was that of the taxpayer, subject to certain statutory marital rights of the wife including a right of intestate succession and a right upon divorce to a share of the husband's property.\n3\n Specifically as a \"division in settlement of their property\" the taxpayer agreed to transfer to his wife, inter alia, 1,000 shares of stock in the E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. The then Mrs. Davis agreed to \n\n[370 \nU.S. 65, 67]\n\u00a0\n accept this division \"in full settlement and satisfaction of any and all claims and rights against the husband whatsoever (including but not by way of limitation, dower and all rights under the laws of testacy and intestacy) . . . .\" Pursuant to the above agreement which had been incorporated into the divorce decree, one-half of this stock was delivered in the tax year involved, 1955, and the balance thereafter. Davis' cost basis for the 1955 transfer was $74,775.37, and the fair market value of the 500 shares there transferred was $82,250. The taxpayer also agreed orally to pay the wife's legal expenses, and in 1955 he made payments to the wife's attorney, including $2,500 for services concerning tax matter relative to the property settlement.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nThe determination of the income tax consequence of the stock transfer described above is basically a two-step analysis: (1) Was the transaction a taxable event? (2) If so, how much taxable gain resulted therefrom? Originally the Tax Court (at that time the Board of Tax Appeals) held that the accretion to property transferred pursuant to a divorce settlement could not be taxed as capital gain to the transferor because the amount realized by the satisfaction of the husband's marital obligations was indeterminable and because, even if such benefit were ascertainable, the transaction was a nontaxable division of property. Mesta v. Commissioner, 42 B. T. A. 933 (1940); Halliwell v. Commissioner, 44 B. T. A. 740 (1941). However, upon being reversed in quick succession by the Courts of Appeals of the Third and Second Circuits, Commissioner v. Mesta, 123 F.2d 986 (C. A. 3d Cir. 1941); Commissioner v. Halliwell, 131 F.2d 642 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1942), the Tax Court accepted the position of these courts and has continued to apply these views in appropriate cases since that time, Hall v. Commissioner, \n\n[370 \nU.S. 65, 68]\n\u00a0\n 9 T. C. 53 (1947); Patino v. Commissioner, 13 T. C. 816 (1949); Estate of Stouffer v. Commissioner, 30 T. C. 1244 (1958); King v. Commissioner, 31 T. C. 108 (1958); Marshman v. Commissioner, 31 T. C. 269 (1958). In Mesta and Halliwell the Courts of Appeals reasoned that the accretion to the property was \"realized\" by the transfer and that this gain could be measured on the assumption that the relinquished marital rights were equal in value to the property transferred. The matter was considered settled until the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in reversing the Tax Court, ruled that, although such a transfer might be a taxable event, the gain realized thereby could not be determined because of the impossibility of evaluating the fair market value of the wife's marital rights. Commissioner v. Marshman, 279 F.2d 27 (1960). In so holding that court specifically rejected the argument that these rights could be presumed to be equal in value to the property transferred for their release. This is essentially the position taken by the Court of Claims in the instant case.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nWe now turn to the threshold question of whether the transfer in issue was an appropriate occasion for taxing the accretion to the stock. There can be no doubt that Congress, as evidenced by its inclusive definition of income subject to taxation, i. e., \"all income from whatever source derived, including . . . [g]ains derived from dealings in property,\"\n4\n intended that the economic growth of this stock be taxed. The problem confronting us is simply when is such accretion to be taxed. Should the economic gain be presently assessed against taxpayer, or should this assessment await a subsequent transfer of the property by the wife? The controlling \n\n[370 \nU.S. 65, 69]\n\u00a0\n statutory language, which provides that gains from dealings in property are to be taxed upon \"sale or other disposition,\"\n5\n is too general to include or exclude conclusively the transaction presently in issue. Recognizing this, the Government and the taxpayer argue by analogy with transactions more easily classified as within or without the ambient of taxable events. The taxpayer asserts that the present disposition is comparable to a nontaxable division of property between two co-owners,\n6\n while the Government contends it more resembles a taxable transfer of property in exchange for the release of an independent legal obligation. Neither disputes the validity of the other's starting point.\n\nIn support of his analogy the taxpayer argues that to draw a distinction between a wife's interest in the property of her husband in a common-law jurisdiction such as Delaware and the property interest of a wife in a typical community property jurisdiction would commit a double sin; for such differentiation would depend upon \"elusive \n\n[370 \nU.S. 65, 70]\n\u00a0\n and subtle casuistries which . . . possess no relevance for tax purposes,\" Helvering v. Hallock, \n309 \nU.S. 106, 118\n (1940), and would create disparities between common-law and community property jurisdictions in contradiction to Congress' general policy of equality between to two. The taxpayer's analogy, however, stumbles on its own premise for the inchoate rights granted a wife in her husband's property by the Delaware law do not even remotely reach the dignity of co-ownership. The wife has no interest - passive or active - over the management or disposition of her husband's personal property. Her rights are not descendable, and she must survive him to share in his intestate estate. Upon dissolution of the marriage she shares in the property only to such extent as the court deems \"reasonable.\" 13 Del. Code Ann. 1531 (a). What is \"reasonable\" might be ascertained independently of the extent of the husband's property by such criteria as the wife's financial condition, her needs in relation to her accustomed station in life, her age and health, the number of children and their ages, and the earning capacity of the husband. See, e. g., Beres v. Beres, 52 Del. 133, 154 A. 2d 384 (1959).\n\nThis is not to say it would be completely illogical to consider the shearing off of the wife's rights in her husband's property as a division of that property, but we believe the contrary to be the more reasonable construction. Regardless of the tags, Delaware seems only to place a burden on the husband's property rather than to make the wife a part owner thereof. In the present context the rights of succession and reasonable share do not differ significantly from the husband's obligations of support and alimony. They all partake more of a personal liability of the husband than a property interest of the wife. The effectuation of these marital rights may ultimately result in the ownership of some of the husband's \n\n[370 \nU.S. 65, 71]\n\u00a0\n property as it did here, but certainly this happenstance does not equate the transaction with a division of property by co-owners. Although admittedly such a view may permit different tax treatment among the several States, this Court in the past has not ignored the differing effects on the federal taxing scheme of substantive differences between community property and common-law systems. E. g., Poe v. Seaborn, \n282 \nU.S. 101\n (1930). To be sure Congress has seen fit to alleviate this disparity in many areas, e. g., Revenue Act of 1948, 62 Stat. 110, but in other areas the facts of life are still with us.\n\nOur interpretation of the general statutory language is fortified by the long-standing administrative practice as sounded and formalized by the settled state of law in the lower courts. The Commissioner's position was adopted in the early 40's by the Second and Third Circuits and by 1947 the Tax Court had acquiesced in this view. This settled rule was not disturbed by the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in 1960 or the Court of Claims in the instant case, for these latter courts in holding the gain indeterminable assumed that the transaction was otherwise a taxable event. Such unanimity of views in support of a position representing a reasonable construction of an ambiguous statute will not lightly be put aside. It is quite possible that this notorious construction was relied upon by numerous taxpayers as well as the Congress itself, which not only refrained from making any changes in the statutory language during more than a score of years but re-enacted this same language in 1954.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nHaving determined that the transaction was a taxable event, we now turn to the point on which the Court of Claims balked, viz., the measurement of the taxable gain realized by the taxpayer. The Code defines the taxable \n\n[370 \nU.S. 65, 72]\n\u00a0\n gain from the sale or disposition of property as being the \"excess of the amount realized therefrom over the adjusted basis . . . .\" I. R. C. (1954) 1001 (a). The \"amount realized\" is further defined as \"the sum of any money received plus the fair market value of the property (other than money) received.\" I. R. C. (1954) 1001 (b). In the instant case the \"property received\" was the release of the wife's inchoate marital rights. The Court of Claims, following the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, found that there was no way to compute the fair market value of these marital rights and that it was thus impossible to determine the taxable gain realized by the taxpayer. We believe this conclusion was erroneous.\n\nIt must be assumed, we think, that the parties acted at arm's length and that they judged the marital rights to be equal in value to the property for which they were exchanged. There was no evidence to the contrary here. Absent a readily ascertainable value it is accepted practice where property is exchanged to hold, as did the Court of Claims in Philadelphia Park Amusement Co. v. United States, 130 Ct. Cl. 166, 172, 126 F. Supp. 184, 189 (1954), that the values \"of the two properties exchanged in an arms-length transaction are either equal in fact, or are presumed to be equal.\" Accord, United States v. General Shoe Corp., 282 F.2d 9 (C. A. 6th Cir. 1960); International Freighting Corp. v. Commissioner, 135 F.2d 310 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1943). To be sure there is much to be said of the argument that such an assumption is weakened by the emotion, tension and practical necessities involved in divorce negotiations and the property settlements arising therefrom. However, once it is recognized that the transfer was a taxable event, it is more consistent with the general purpose and scheme of the taxing statutes to make a rough approximation of the gain realized thereby than to ignore altogether its tax \n\n[370 \nU.S. 65, 73]\n\u00a0\n consequences. Cf. Helvering v. Safe Deposit & Trust Co., \n316 \nU.S. 56, 67\n (1942).\n\nMoreover, if the transaction is to be considered a taxable event as to the husband, the Court of Claims' position leaves up in the air the wife's basis for the property received. In the context of a taxable transfer by the husband,\n7\n all indicia point to a \"cost\" basis for this property in the hands of the wife.\n8\n Yet under the Court of Claims' position her cost for this property. i. e., the value of the marital rights relinquished therefore, would be indeterminable, and on subsequent disposition of the property she might suffer inordinately over the Commissioner's assessment which she would have the burden of proving erroneous, Commissioner v. Hansen, \n360 \nU.S. 446, 468\n (1959). Our present holding that the value of these rights is ascertainable eliminates this problem; for the same calculation that determines the amount received by the husband fixes the amount given up by the wife, and this figure, i. e., the market value of the property transferred by the husband, will be taken by her as her tax basis for the property received.\n\nFinally, it must be noted that here, as well as in relation to the question of whether the event is taxable, we \n\n[370 \nU.S. 65, 74]\n\u00a0\n draw support from the prior administrative practice and judicial approval of that practice. See p. 71, supra. We therefore conclude that the Commissioner's assessment of a taxable gain based upon the value of the stock at the date of its transfer has not been shown erroneous.\n9\n\u00a0\n\n\nIV.\n\n\n\nThe attorney-fee question is much simpler. It is the customary practice in Delaware for the husband to pay both his own and his wife's legal expenses incurred in the divorce and the property settlement. Here petitioner paid $5,000 of such fees in the taxable year 1955 earmarked for tax advice in relation to the property settlement. One-half of this sum went to the wife's attorney. The taxpayer claimed that under 212 (3) of the 1954 Code, which allows a deduction for the \"ordinary and necessary expenses paid . . . in connection with the determination, collection, or refund of any tax,\" he was entitled to deduct the entire $5,000. The Court of Claims allowed the $2,500 paid taxpayer's own attorney but denied the like amount paid the wife's attorney. The sole question here is the deductibility of the latter fee; the Government did not seek review of the amount taxpayer paid his own attorney, and we intimate no decision on that point. As to the deduction of the wife's fees, we read the statute, if applicable to this type of tax expense, to include only the expenses of the taxpayer himself and not those of his wife. Here the fees paid her attorney do not appear to be \"in connection with the determination, collection, or refund\" of any tax of the taxpayer. As the Court of Claims found, the wife's attorney \"considered the problems from the standpoint of his client alone. Certainly \n\n[370 \nU.S. 65, 75]\n\u00a0\n then it cannot be said that . . . [his] advice was directed to plaintiff's tax problems . . . .\" 152 Ct. Cl., at 805, 287 F.2d, at 171. We therefore conclude, as did the Court of Claims, that those fees were not a deductible item to the taxpayer.\n\n  Reversed in part and affirmed in part.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the decision of these cases.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITE took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Davis' present wife, Grace Ethel Davis, is also a party to these proceedings because a joint return was filed in the tax year in question.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The holding in the instant case is in accord with Commissioner v. Marshman, 279 F.2d 27 (C. A. 6th Cir. 1960), but is contra to the holdings in Commissioner v. Halliwell, 131 F.2d 642 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1942), and Commissioner v. Mesta, 123 F.2d 986 (C. A. 3d Cir. 1941).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 12 Del. Code Ann. (Supp. 1960) 512; 13 Del. Code Ann. 1531. In the case of realty, the wife in addition to the above has rights of dower. 12 Del.

Property transferred pursuant to a negotiated settlement in return for the release of admittedly valuable rights is not a gift in any sense of the term. To intimate that there was a gift to the extent the value of the property exceeded that of the rights released not only invokes the erroneous premise that every exchange not precisely equal involves a gift but merely raises the measurement problem discussed in Part III, infra, p. 71. Cases in which this Court has held transfers of property in exchange for the release of marital rights subject to gift taxes are based not on the premise that such transactions are inherently gifts but on the concept that in the contemplation of the gift tax statute they are to be taxed as gifts. Merrill v. Fahs, \n324 \nU.S. 308\n (1945); Commissioner v. Wemyss, \n324 \nU.S. 303\n (1945); see Harris v. Commissioner, \n340 \nU.S. 106\n (1950). In interpreting the particular income tax provisions here involved, we find ourselves unfettered by the language and considerations ingrained in the gift and estate tax statutes. See Farid-Es-Sultaneh v. Commissioner, 160 F.2d 812 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1947).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Under the present administrative practice, the release of marital rights in exchange for property or other consideration is not considered a taxable event as to the wife.

In any event both findings represent a choice of inferences to be drawn from the subsidiary facts contained in the affidavits, attached exhibits, and depositions submitted below. On summary judgment the inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts contained in such materials must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. A study of the record in this light leads us to believe that inferences contrary to those drawn by the trial court might be permissible. The materials before the District Court having thus raised a genuine issue as to ultimate facts material to the rule of International Shoe Co. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, it was improper for the District Court to decide the applicability of the rule on a motion for summary judgment. Fed. Rules Civ.

DRUM(1962)\nNo. 23\nArgued: Decided: January 15, 1962\n\n\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Together with No. 24, Regular Common Carrier Conference of American Trucking Associations, Inc., v. Drum et al., also on appeal from the same Court.\n\n Each of the individual appellees owns a truck tractor which he operates under a leasing arrangement with a furniture manufacturer in the interstate transportation of the manufacturer's furniture and in the backhaul of raw materials used in the manufacture of its products. Appellees are compensated for the use of their tractors and for their services as drivers solely on the basis of fixed rates per mile driven. They bear all of the operating costs of the transportation and assume the financial risk of profit or loss thereon. The manufacturer has a collective-bargaining agreement with the union representing appellees and grants them certain benefits of employees, including, inter alia, seniority rights, job security, death benefits, vacation pay and social security and workmen's compensation coverage. The Interstate Commerce Commission found that appellees are \"contract carriers\" within the meaning of 203 (a) (15) of the Interstate Commerce Act and are subject to the licensing requirements of 209 (a) (1), and it ordered them to cease and desist from operating without permits. The District Court held that the transportation was by the manufacturer as a \"private carrier,\" within the meaning of 203 (a) (17), and it set aside the Commission's order. Held: The Commission's finding is sustained and the judgment of the District Court is reversed. Pp. 371-386.\n\n (a) The Commission's conclusion that the financial risks of this transportation had been shifted from the manufacturer to the owner-operators to an extent which rendered the sanctioning of the operation as private carriage by the manufacturer a departure from the statutory design was well within the range of the responsibility assigned by Congress to the Commission. Pp. 383-385.\n\n\n (b) If the District Court intended to hold that the Commission was confined to the \"control\" test - i. e., whether the manufacturer had any right to control, direct or dominate the transportation-it \n\n[368 \nU.S. 370, 371]\n\u00a0\n was in error, since a finding of shipper control does not require a resolution of the ultimate issue in the shipper's favor. Pp. 381-383, 385-386.\n\n\n (c) If the District Court meant to substitute its judgment for that of the Commission on the question of substance on this record, it indulged in an unwarranted incursion into the administrative domain.

JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nIn an investigation initiated by it under 49 U.S.C. 304 (c),\n1\n the Interstate Commerce Commission held that appellees who leased their motor vehicles and hired \n\n[368 \nU.S. 370, 372]\n\u00a0\n their services as drivers to the appellee Oklahoma Furniture Manufacturing Company (hereinafter \"Oklahoma\") were contract carriers within 49 U.S.C. 303 (a) (15)\n2\n and subject to the permit requirements of 49 U.S.C. 309 (a) (1).\n3\n 79 M. C. C. 403. \n\n[368 \nU.S. 370, 373]\n\u00a0\n\n\nA three-judge court in the District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma, convened under 28 U.S.C. 2325 in a proceeding commenced by appellees pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1336 and 1398,\n4\n set aside the cease-and-desist order by which the Commission required the lessors to refrain from their operations unless and until they received appropriate authority therefor from the Commission. 193 F. Supp. 275. The District Court held that Oklahoma was engaged in private carriage as defined in 49 U.S.C. 303 (a) (17).\n5\n We noted probable jurisdiction of the appeals lodged here under 28 U.S.C. 1253. \n365 \nU.S. 839\n.\n\nThe Motor Carrier Act of 1935\n6\n subjected many aspects of interstate motor carriage - including entry of \n\n[368 \nU.S. 370, 374]\n\u00a0\n persons into the business of for-hire motor transportation and the oversight of motor carrier rates - to administrative controls, on the premise that the public interest in maintaining a stable transportation industry so required.\n7\n However, although aware that \"Both [contract carriers and common carriers] . . . are continually faced with actual or potential competition from private truck operation . . .,\"\n8\n Congress took cognizance of a shipper's interest in furnishing his own transportation,\n9\n and limited the application of the licensing requirements to those persons who provide \"transportation . . . for compensation\"\n10\n or, under a 1957 Amendment, \"for-hire transportation.\"\n11\n The Commission, therefore, has had to decide whether a particular arrangement gives rise to that \"for-hire\" carriage which is subject to economic regulation in the public interest, or whether it is, in fact, private carriage as to which Congress determined that the shipper's interest in carrying his own goods should prevail. This case is a recent instance of the Commission's developing technique of decision.\n\nFrom the beginning underlying principles have been, and have remained, clear. A primary objective of the scheme of economic regulation is to assure that shippers generally will be provided a healthy system of motor carriage to which they may resort to get their goods to market. This is the goal not only of Commission surveillance \n\n[368 \nU.S. 370, 375]\n\u00a0\n of licensed motor carriers as to rates and services, but also of the requirement that the persons from whom shippers would purchase a transportation service designed to meet the shippers' distinctive needs must first secure Commission approval. See Contracts of Contract Carriers, 1 M. C. C. 628, 629; Keystone Transportation Co., 19 M. C. C. 475, 490-492. The statutory requirement that a certificate or permit be issued before any new for-hire carriage may be undertaken bespeaks congressional concern over diversions of traffic which may harm existing carriers upon whom the bulk of shippers must depend for access to market.\n12\n Accordingly, the statutory definitions, while confirming that a shipper is free to transport his own goods without utilizing a regulated instrumentality, at the same time deny him the use of \"for compensation\" or \"for-hire\" transportation purchased from a person not licensed by the Interstate Commerce Commission. Because the definitions must, if they are to serve their purpose, impose practical limitations upon unregulated competition in a regulated industry, they are to be interpreted in a manner which transcends the merely formal. From the outset the Commission has correctly interpreted them as importing that a purported private carrier who hires the instrumentalities of transportation from another must - if he is not to utilize a licensed carrier - assume in significant measure the characteristic burdens of the transportation business. The problem is one of determining - by reference to \n\n[368 \nU.S. 370, 376]\n\u00a0\n the clear but broad remedial purpose of a regulatory statute committed to agency administration - the applicability to a narrow fact situation of imprecise definitional language which delineates the coverage of the measure. Private carriers are defined simply as transporters of property who are neither common nor contract carriers; and the statute will yield up no better verbal guide to the reach of its licensing provisions than transportation \"for compensation\" or \"for-hire.\" Compare Bates & Guild Co. v. Payne, \n194 \nU.S. 106\n; Rochester Tel. Corp. v. United States, \n307 \nU.S. 125, 144\n-146; Gray v. Powell, \n314 \nU.S. 402, 412\n-413; Labor Board v. Hearst Publications, \n322 \nU.S. 111, 130\n-131. Because the Commission's resolution of the issue does not seem to us to violate the coherence of the body of administrative and judicial precedents so far developed in this area, we are of the opinion that there was no occasion for the District Court to disturb the conclusion reached by the Commission. We therefore reverse the District Court's judgment.\n\nIt was a wish to rid itself of certain burdens of its existing transportation operation which caused Oklahoma to enter into the arrangement here involved. Prior to 1952 Oklahoma, a manufacturer of low-cost furniture, had maintained a full fleet of tractors and trailers in which all its furniture was shipped. A full crew of drivers was employed. Oklahoma absorbed all the expenses, and carried all the risks, of its transportation operation. It utilized a system of delivered pricing which eliminated transportation charges as an identifiable element of the price of its furniture. Its status as a private carrier exempt from licensing requirements was never questioned under the pre-1952 arrangement. But that method of operation was found to incorporate certain burdensome disadvantages. Oklahoma discovered that its employee-drivers were embezzling its funds through the misuse of \n\n[368 \nU.S. 370, 377]\n\u00a0\n credit arrangements which the company had established for the purchasing of fuel and minor repairs on the road. In addition, Oklahoma became convinced that its equipment was too often involved in accidents, and too often in need of repairs and maintenance which could have been avoided by careful operation.\n\nIn an effort to eliminate these disadvantages, Oklahoma in 1952 altered its modus operandi. It decided to terminate its investment in tractors for long hauls and, instead, to lease them from the drivers. The original lease agreements encountered difficulty when, in 1956, the Supreme Court of Arkansas held that the resultant operation constituted for-hire carriage by the owner-operators which required licensing under the applicable Arkansas statutes.\n13\n Following this turn of events, Oklahoma revised the leases, and also entered into a collective agreement with the union representing its workers setting forth the terms under which the owner-operators were to be employed as drivers. The current lease and collective agreement provide the factual predicate of the present litigation.\n\nThe Company presently owns 26 trailers and 6 tractors. It leases 11 tractors for long-haul use in connection with the trailers which it owns. It is solely in connection with the 11 leased tractors and the services of their owner-operators that the Commission discerned the provision of for-hire transportation. The leases are for renewable terms of one year, but they are terminable by either party on 30 days' notice. Oklahoma is granted the sole right to control the use of the tractor through drivers employed by it; in return, it covenants that such use will be lawful and will be confined to the transportation of the Company's property. Oklahoma pays for its \n\n[368 \nU.S. 370, 378]\n\u00a0\n use of the tractors strictly on a mileage basis. The owner receives weekly rental payments of 10 or 11 cents for each mile the vehicle is driven, plus an extra 3 cents per mile on the backhaul if there is a load of raw materials. Oklahoma does not guarantee any minimum mileage. Operating costs - including gasoline, oil, grease, parts, and registration fees - are paid by the owners. Oklahoma assumes no responsibility for wear and tear or damage to the tractors, nor does it provide collision or fire and theft insurance coverage - although it does pay for public liability and property damage insurance. The owners assume no responsibility to Oklahoma for damage to the cargoes.\n\nUnder the collective agreement covering the drivers among its employees, the drivers enjoy certain common employment privileges such as collective bargaining, seniority rights, death benefits, immunity from discharge except for cause, military-service protection, and vacation pay in an amount based on their average weekly pay. Owner-drivers may be discharged for cause.\n14\n Their remuneration is calculated strictly on a mileage basis, and they are obliged to pay their own living expenses while on the road. No minimum weekly pay or mileage is guaranteed.\n15\n Drivers are required to maintain their trucks in good running condition at all times.\n\nOklahoma's actual operations were a generally faithful reflection of the leases and the collective agreement. Certain matters, not explicitly or unambiguously covered by the written instruments, are of significance. Ordinarily the drivers were assigned to their own tractors. \n\n[368 \nU.S. 370, 379]\n\u00a0\n though there were occasional exceptions. Oklahoma's truck superintendent testified that the owner-operators' services were not utilized each day. The owners were required to pay for all repairs, though Oklahoma conducted safety inspections.\n16\n The Company closely directed all details of loading and delivery routes. It instructed the drivers as to steps to be taken in emergencies. It administered physical examinations, supervised the preparation of reports required by the Interstate Commerce Commission, paid social security taxes and withheld income taxes, and provided workmen's compensation.\n\nIn sum, Oklahoma's operation possessed a number of the hallmarks of a genuine lease of equipment and a genuine employment arrangement.\n\nStill, the Company was able to spare itself - and pass to the owner-operators - certain characteristic burdens of the transportation business. The large capital investment in the tractors and the risk of their premature depreciation or catastrophic loss, was borne by the owner-operators, not by the Company. The owner-operators, rather than Oklahoma, stood the risk of a rise in variable costs such as fuel, repairs and maintenance of the tractors in good operating condition, and living expenses, although the thirty-day cancellation privilege, taken together with the possible bargaining power of the owner-operators en bloc, may have affected the degree to which that burden was actually shifted. Finally, Oklahoma was able \n\n[368 \nU.S. 370, 380]\n\u00a0\n to divest itself, to a significant extent, of the risk of non-utilization of high-priced equipment. The owner-operators received neither rental payments nor wages when their tractors were not used and they did not drive. Oklahoma did, however, carry the risk of a nonproductive backhaul.\n17\n\u00a0\n\nThe question before the Commission was whether, under these particular facts, Oklahoma had so far emancipated itself from the burdens of transportation that to permit it, on such terms, to secure a transportation service from these unlicensed owner-operators would be inconsistent with the statutory scheme. The Commission resolved the issue adversely to Oklahoma and the owner-operators. Division 1, one Commissioner dissenting, held that the owner-operators were engaged in contract carriage and ordered them to cease and desist from the activities thus found to be unlawful until such time as they had secured the necessary permits from the Commission. Applications for such permits were invited, the Division's Report observing that the activities presently condemned should not prejudice such applications.\n18\n This disposition was approved by the full Commission on reconsideration.\n19\n\u00a0\n\n[368 \nU.S. 370, 381]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Commission dealt with the problem before it by setting out two inquiries which would have to be satisfied before the operations in question could be held to constitute private carriage: First, it would have to be found that no person other than Oklahoma had \"any right to control, direct, and dominate\" the transportation. Second, it would have to be found that no person before the Commission was \"in substance, engaged in the business of . . . transportation of property . . . for hire.\"\n20\n The Commission found against the respondents on both tests. In connection with the first, or \"control,\" test the Commission pointed out that earlier decisions had established a presumption of for-hire transportation whenever equipment was leased by a shipper, which presumption might be defeated by a showing that the shipper had retained the exclusive right to control the operation. Despite the evidence of actual shipper control in this case, the Commission held that the presumption of for-hire transportation remained in effect because \"There is present, whenever the owner-operator drives his own equipment, the right and power of the lessor to defeat any supposed right to control that the shipper-lessee may believe exists.\"\n21\n The three-judge District Court reversed the Commission's conclusion relative to shipper control,\n22\n and that action of the District Court is not challenged by the Commission on this appeal.\n23\n\u00a0\n\n[368 \nU.S. 370, 382]\n\u00a0\n\n\nBut a finding of shipper control does not require a resolution of the ultimate issue in the shipper's favor.\n24\n It is true that until recently, \"control\" has been at the focus of the Commission's efforts to delineate verbally the permissible area of non-licensed leases of transportation equipment. The initial technique of the Commission was to assess the lessee-shipper's assumption of the burdens of transportation in terms of the degree to which he undertook to \"control\" or \"dominate\" it.\n25\n The interest in \"control\" in turn generated an interest in whether the drivers of leased equipment were in substance treated as the shipper's employees.\n26\n Throughout, however, Commission \n\n[368 \nU.S. 370, 383]\n\u00a0\n reports have taken note of various factors which clearly transcend any narrow concept of physical direction of the details of the operation; and it has always been apparent that the vesting of such physical \"control\" in the shipper would not in itself suffice to render the transportation private carriage.\n27\n\u00a0\n\nLatterly, the Commission has begun to move away from \"control\" as the verbal embodiment of its manifold inquiry.\n28\n The Commission thus accords explicit recognition to a premise which has long been implicit in its decisions: \n\n[368 \nU.S. 370, 384]\n\u00a0\n That some indicia of private carriage may be assumed, and detailed surveillance of operations undertaken, without a shipper's having significantly shouldered the burdens of transportation. The test of substance with which the Commission supplemented its \"control\" inquiry in this case thus betokens no heedless departure from the beaten track of administrative decision which might occasion a judicial curb upon the exercise of administrative discretion.\n29\n No more so does the inclusion in the arrangement between Oklahoma and its owner-drivers of a number of particulars also discoverable in arrangements found to constitute private carriage in earlier Commission decisions. We deal in totalities; indicia are instruments of decision, not touchstones. The Commission allowably dealt with this novel situation as an integral and unique problem in judgment, rather than simply as an exercise in counting common-places. Nor did it leave the basis for its decision unarticulated. \n\n[368 \nU.S. 370, 385]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Commission's meaning in applying the test of substance in this case is clearly told in the following language in its report:\n\n \"Here each owner-operator assigns his motor vehicle for a continuing period of time to the exclusive use of the company, furnishing a service designed to meet the distinct need of the company. He provides a service in which the equipment is furnished, maintained, and driven by the owners thereof to transport property in interstate commerce. He guarantees a fixed and definite cost for the transportation, bears the risk of profit or loss from such transportation hazards as delays in transit, breakdowns of equipment, and highway detours, and meets all of the cost of operation including appropriate licenses and trip expenses.\" 79 M. C. C., at 412.\n\n\n It is evident that the Commission here refused to allow Oklahoma the status of a private carrier because of its belief that financial risks are a significant burden of transportation, and its belief that such risks had been shifted by Oklahoma to the owner-operators to an extent which rendered the sanctioning of the operation as private carriage a departure from the statutory design. We think that such conclusions were well within the range of the responsibility Congress assigned to the Commission. The District Court explicitly recognized the propriety of the Commission's inquiring into the substance of the arrangements. Yet the court's conclusion that \"what is involved here is private carriage on the part of the Company, rather than transportation for-hire by the owner-operators,\" 193 F. Supp., at 281, rests on no articulated premise other than that Oklahoma did have control. If the court intended to hold that the Commission is confined to the \"control\" test, we think it clearly in error in view of the \n\n[368 \nU.S. 370, 386]\n\u00a0\n statutory objectives which we have set forth above. If, on the other hand, the court meant to substitute its judgment for the Commission's on the question of substance, we think that, on this record, it indulged in an unwarranted incursion into the administrative domain.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Interstate Commerce Act 204 (c), 49 Stat. 547, as amended, 49 U.S.C. 304 (c):\n\n\"Upon complaint in writing to the Commission by any person, State board, organization, or body politic, or upon its own initiative without complaint, the Commission may investigate whether any motor carrier or broker has failed to comply with any provision of this chapter, or with any requirement established pursuant thereto.

We assume, for present purposes, that the court below correctly applied that test as relating only to the operational aspects of the transportation.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 24\n] We need not and we do not now pass on the Commission's view that if the shipper does not direct the details of the operation he cannot be a private carrier.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 25\n] The leading case is H. B. Church Truck Service Co., 27 M. C. C. 191, 195:\n\n\"Essentially the issue is as to who has the right to control, direct, and dominate the performance of the service. If that right remains in the carrier, the carriage is carriage for hire and subject to regulation. If it rests in the shipper, it is private carriage and not subject to regulation . . . .\"\n\n\n It was the H. B. Church case which established the presumption that a lease of equipment results in for-hire carriage. The presumption was said to \"yield to a showing that the shipper has the exclusive right and privilege of directing and controlling the transportation service, as, for example, if the equipment were operated by the shipper's employee.\" 27 M.

Oliver, \n358 \nU.S. 283\n, did not, as appellees suggest (Brief for Henry E. Drum et al., at 29), hold that owner-operators are in any sense \"employees.\" That case held that a bargaining unit including an overwhelming majority of concededly employed drivers of carrier-owned equipment was entitled, under 8 (d) of the National Labor Relations Act, 61 Stat. 142, 29 U.S.C. 158 (d), to bargain to impasse concerning minimum rentals to be received by owner-drivers. It was not necessary to determine \n\n[368 \nU.S. 370, 383]\n\u00a0\n whether the owner-drivers were \"employees\" protected by the Act, since the establishment of the minimum rental to them was integral to the establishment of a stable wage structure for clearly covered employee-drivers.

C. 161, 172-173:\n\n\"The primary question here . . . can be asked in two forms; namely (1) Is the transportation here involved such that any person or persons other than the purported private carriers have any right to control, direct, and dominate it, or (2) Are any persons here, in substance, engaged in the business of interstate or foreign transportation of property on the public highways for hire? . . . We are convinced here that, even if all the responsibilities of an employer with respect to the driver are assumed by a shipper, the service offered . . . is, in substance, for-hire motor carriage subject to regulation under part II of the act. To hold otherwise would be inconsistent with the remedial purpose of part II and would be in contravention of our duty, imposed by Congress . . . . It is evident that, were we to hold that the shipper's assumption (as an employer) of certain responsibilities which more normally fall upon a carrier, transforms an operation which, apart from such assumption, is clearly a for-hire carrier service, into an operation different in substance, we would open the door to unfair and destructive competitive practices contrary to the national transportation policy declared by Congress.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 29\n] The courts have commonly articulated their plotting of the boundary between private and regulated carriage in leased equipment cases in terms of over-all substance, rather than simply in terms of \"control.\" See Georgia Truck System, Inc., v.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS, whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK joins, concurring.\n\nIf I read the Court's opinion as my Brother HARLAN reads it, I would dissent from the disposition that is made of the case. The Commission is not a free-wheeling agency that can impose its ideas on this industry by fiat. Congress has provided the standard by which the Commission must adjudicate each case. And it is required to make not only findings that support its decision (Interstate Commerce Comm'n v. J-T Transport Co., \n368 \nU.S. 81\n), but also findings that are intelligible and complete. United States v. Carolina Carriers Corp., \n315 \nU.S. 475, 488\n-489. The case is for me a marginal one on which commissioners as well as judges might differ.\n*\n But I do not believe the Commission distorted the statutory standard nor made findings out of conformity with the facts.\n\nHence I join the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Three judges in the District Court disagreed with the Commission (193 F. Supp. 275) and one of the three Commissioners dissented. 79 M. C. C. 403.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER joins, dissenting.\n\nWere this an instance of a District Court substituting its judgment for that of the Interstate Commerce Commission on a matter which Congress had reserved for agency determination, I would be among the first to maintain that the Commission's action should be respected. Cf. I. C. C. v. J-T Transport Co., \n368 \nU.S. 81, 126\n-130 \n\n[368 \nU.S. 370, 387]\n\u00a0\n (dissenting opinion). But the order entered by the Commission in the cases now before us is so utterly lacking in evidentiary support, so inconsistent with the uniform course of agency and court decisions, and so contrary to the regulatory plan embodied in the Motor Carrier Act of 1935 and its later amendments, that I cannot join in the judgment which reinstates that order. As I view this record what the Commission has done here amounts in effect to an exercise of power which it does not possess.\n\nUnder the Motor Carrier Act two things are indisputably clear: (1) Congress, in subjecting \"private\" motor carriage only to safety regulation, did not mean otherwise to regulate interstate transportation by persons of \"their own goods in their own vehicles for commercial purposes\" (79 Cong. Rec. 5651 (1935), remarks of Senator Wheeler, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce);\n1\n (2) one engaged in the business of leasing motor vehicles for commercial carriage is not by that fact alone made a \"contract carrier,\" subject to full Commission regulation; in other words, equipment rentals as such are not reached by the statute.\n2\n Under the plain terms of the Act and Commission rulings, economic regulation of such rentals comes into play only where \"for-hire\" motor carriage has been shown.\n3\n\u00a0\n\n[368 \nU.S. 370, 388]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThis then is not a case like Labor Board v. Hearst Publications, Inc., \n322 \nU.S. 111\n, where the construction of an inexplicitly defined term in a statute which was broadly remedial was left to the agency enforcing the law. Despite strong suggestions to the contrary,\n4\n Congress saw fit to exempt private carriers from economic regulation under the Motor Carrier Act. If we were to permit the Commission to exercise its discretion to sweep in a variety of arrangements which legitimately constitute private carriage, we would be authorizing disobedience of the legislative mandate as surely as if we allowed the agency to remove from regulation what clearly amounts to \"for-hire\" carriage.\n\nUntil late 1952, Oklahoma Furniture Company, a manufacturer of low-priced furniture, shipped its product to retail purchasers throughout the United States in company-owned tractors and trailers, driven by its own full-time salaried employees. Discovering that some of its drivers were misusing company credit cards, given them to enable their charging against the Company operating and living expenses while on the road. Oklahoma revamped its long-haul transportation system in such a way as to remove these temptations.\n5\n In essence the new \n\n[368 \nU.S. 370, 389]\n\u00a0\n arrangement involved, on the one hand, leasing from each of 11 of the Company's employee-drivers one of the tractors used in long-haul service,\n6\n and shifting to the driver the economic incidents of its maintenance and operation; and, on the other hand, preserving to the Company the exclusive use of the tractor in the conduct of its business, and keeping, in every practical sense, the employee relationship between the driver and the Company. The details of the arrangement and its operation are accurately summarized in the District Court's opinion.\n7\n\u00a0\n\n[368 \nU.S. 370, 390]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe process of reasoning by which the Commission reached the conclusion that this rearrangement changed to fully regulatable activity that which had therefore been subject to Commission jurisdiction only from the standpoint of safety, is at best obscure. However, the true measure of what the Court now sanctions is revealed \n\n[368 \nU.S. 370, 391]\n\u00a0\n by laying bare the extent to which the agency's conclusion involved a departure from the common-sense criteria that have heretofore entered into Commission determinations as to whether particular arrangements reflected \"private\" or \"for-hire\" motor carriage.\n8\n\u00a0\n\n[368 \nU.S. 370, 392]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Court holds that the shifting of three economic burdens from the Company to the drivers justified the Commission's determination: (1) the substantial capital investments in the tractors, along with the risk of premature loss, were borne by the drivers;\n9\n (2) they undertook the costs of maintaining the vehicles and their own living expenses on the road; and (3) they bore the risk, as the Court envisages it, of \"non-utilization of high-priced equipment\" and of their own unemployment. These factors, either singly or in combination, do not, in my view, suffice to warrant the Commission's ruling. The first of them is the normal concomitant of any equipment rental; its presence cannot serve to change the character of a relationship which is not of itself subject to Commission regulation, except from the standpoint of safety (supra, p. 387, note 1). The costs of gas, repairs, and garaging are commonly also assumed by those leasing out motor vehicles for private use.\n10\n See, e. g., R. N. G. Commercial Auto Renters, Inc., 73 M. C. C. 665; Scott Bros., Inc., 32 M. C. C. 253; U-Drive-It Co. of Pennsylvania, 23 M. C. C. 799. The third factor, whatever may be its weight when supported by actuality, is, in the circumstances depicted in this record, no more than a pure abstraction (pp. 394-395, infra).\n\nAs the Court appears to recognize, the other provisions of the arrangement, relating to the cost of maintaining the leased equipment, all point to \"private\" carriage. Past \n\n[368 \nU.S. 370, 393]\n\u00a0\n cases in the Commission where \"for-hire\" carriage has been found, in the face of similar provisions, all involved other factors not present here. Under this arrangement, the Company was entitled to exclusive use of the tractors during the rental period (cf. Joseph A. Bisceglia, 34 M. C. C. 233); it loaded, dispatched, and routed the trucks (cf. William A. Shields, 41 M. C. C. 100);\n11\n it instructed the drivers as to details of service (cf. McKeown Transportation Co., 42 M. C. C. 792); it assumed the risk of loss or damage to the cargo (cf. Edward Allen Carroll, 1 M. C. C. 788); it paid for liability and property damage insurance (cf. Centre Trucking Co., 32 M. C. C. 313);\n12\n it undertook to inspect the tractors to insure compliance with safety regulations (cf. Driver Service, Inc., 77 M. C. C. 243); and it shipped the goods without bills of lading (cf. Jacobs Transfer Co., 46 M. C. C. 265).\n\nNor is the Commission's case strengthened by the circumstance that the appellees, in addition to supplying the vehicles, provided their own services as drivers. That factor would be significant only if the appellees furnished these services as independent contractors, for it is only then that the arrangement differs from an equipment rental in which the lessee mans the leased vehicle with his own employees. It would be strange indeed to attribute to Congress a purpose to classify as a \"for-hire\" carrier any employee who, as a condition of employment, is required to purchase a vehicle in which his employer's goods are to be transported.\n\nAll the standards by which the Commission has previously tested a purported \"employment\" relationship \n\n[368 \nU.S. 370, 394]\n\u00a0\n prove the existence of such a relationship here. The Company paid the drivers' wages (cf. Columbia Terminals Co., 18 M. C. C. 662);\n13\n deducted social security and federal income taxes (cf. Motor Haulage Co., 46 M. C. C. 107); retained drivers' trip logs and medical certificates (cf. Watson Mfg. Co., 51 M. C. C. 223); bargained with the drivers' labor union over conditions of employment (cf. R. N. G. Commercial Auto Renters, Inc., 73 M. C. C. 665); and reserved the right to engage and discharge (cf. John J. Casale, Inc., 49 M. C. C. 15). In Teamsters Union v. Oliver, \n358 \nU.S. 283\n, we held that an agreement setting a minimum rental and other terms for the use of a lessor-driver's equipment was \"within the scope of collective bargaining as defined by federal law.\" Id., at 293. In light of the dissenting opinion, id., at 297-298, it seems clear that the Court concluded that the lessor-drivers were employees, not independent contractors, for purposes of the National Labor Relations Act.\n\nDespite the total supervision thus exercised by the Company, if the record revealed that these drivers really risked having no work at all, thus earning no wage, over any period of time, there might be room for argument that they were, in fact, independent contractors. Under the terms of their employment such a theoretical possibility exists, but the facts prove it could not happen.\n\nThe appellees were paid rental for their vehicles and wages for their services on a per-mile basis. But the testimony of the Company's truck superintendent shows that the Company deliberately attempted to distribute the work so as to assure to each driver weekly wages which were within limits acceptable both to the individual concerned and his labor union. Six tractors continued to be \n\n[368 \nU.S. 370, 395]\n\u00a0\n owned by the Company, and individual employees were assigned to these tractors, one to a vehicle, just as the appellees were in effect assigned by the Company to the tractors they owned. Those assigned to company-owned tractors were paid $50 a week plus two cents a mile, and they were dispatched on short hauls. The appellees were sent on long hauls, so that their total mileage would make up for the absence of any fixed wage.\n14\n In addition, if one of the appellees was sick, a driver usually assigned to a company-owned vehicle would be directed to operate the tractor belonging to the incapacitated man in order to assure him of at least the rental payment for his equipment. In short, there is nothing in the record which warrants a finding that the status of the appellees was anything other than that of bona fide employees, or that they in fact shouldered, or anticipated that they might have to bear, any of the economic burdens undertaken by independent contractors.\n\nI am not unmindful that the Interstate Commerce Commission has, of late, been much concerned with the problem of drawing the line between legitimate equipment rentals, which it concedes to be \"private carriage,\" and what it has come to call \"pseudo-private carriage,\" i. e., contract carriage disguised as lease of equipment.\n15\n\u00a0\n\n[368 \nU.S. 370, 396]\n\u00a0\n Obviously the Commission must have the power to deal with schemes that have been devised to avoid regulation. No one would suppose that the Commission was acting beyond its authority if it pierced through the form assumed by a business enterprise purportedly engaged in providing equipment for \"private\" carriage and disclosed that it was really supplying \"for-hire\" carriage. Decisions of District Courts and Courts of Appeals have uniformly approved the application of the test of \"substance\" in such circumstances. E. g., Lamb v. I. C. C., 259 F.2d 358; I. C. C. v. Isner, 92 F. Supp. 582; I. C. C. v. Gannoe, 100 F. Supp. 790. I disagree with the result reached here by the Court, not because the Commission has supplemented its earlier test of \"control\" with one of \"substance,\"\n16\n but because the application of the very test that is now urged persuades me that this was in reality an employment relationship with an employer engaged in private carriage, and not a \"for-hire\" carriage arrangement.\n\nIn sum, this is a case in which there is no allegation of subterfuge and no basis in the record for attributing a devious motive to the lessee; in which the economic risks transferred by the arrangement to the lessor are no more, \n\n[368 \nU.S. 370, 397]\n\u00a0\n and possibly even less, substantial\n17\n than those in the ordinary rental of equipment; and in which the actual conditions of hire disclose that the drivers are bona fide employees of the lessor and are protected by their union representatives against overreaching by the employer. The Commission's order is not saved by the \"totality\" test which the Court now brings to its aid. For however viewed, this record adds up to nothing more than a mere rearrangement of Oklahoma's private carriage activities in such a way as, and for no other purpose than, to protect the Company against being cheated by its long-haul driver-employees.\n\nIf it is within the range of the Commission's permissible discretion to classify these appellees as contract carriers - and thus subject them to the rigorous standards of financial fitness and suitability that the Commission's regulations require of such carriers - what has been thought of as the \"gray\" area becomes black, and, in truth, much of what has heretofore been taken for white is now gray. What, for example, would have been the result had title to these tractors remained with the Company under an arrangement whereby they were leased to the drivers and then subleased back to the Company, with the Company assuming the risk of catastrophic loss or destruction? Or what if the drivers had been guaranteed $50 a week in \n\n[368 \nU.S. 370, 398]\n\u00a0\n total rental and wages? Would either of these changed circumstances have ousted the Commission of authority to hold the contracts to be \"for-hire\" carriage?\n\nIndeed, the Court's decision goes far to encourage the Commission to obliterate entirely the congressionally drawn distinction between private and contract carriage. It will be interesting to see as time goes on whether there will be an aftermath to this decision similar to that which followed the blurring of the line between common and contract motor carriers effected by the Court's decision in United States v. Contract Steel Carriers, \n350 \nU.S. 409\n. See I. C. C. v. J-T Transport Co., supra, at 107-109 (dissenting opinion).\n\nI would affirm.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See also S. Doc. No. 152, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. 33 (1934); H. R. Doc. No. 89, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. 17 (1935); S. Rep. No. 482, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. 1 (1935); H. R. Rep. No. 1645, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. 4 (1935).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] There has been some equipment rental regulation by the States, whether it is also desirable as a matter of federal policy has yet to be determined by Congress. See Nutting and Kuhn, Motor Carrier Regulation - The Third Phase, 10 U. of Pitt. L. Rev. 477, 487-491 (1949); Note, 39 Ky. L. J. 338 (1951).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The relevant statutory provisions are set forth in footnotes 1, 2, 3 and 5 of the Court's opinion. See also U-Drive-It Co. of Pennsylvania, 23 M. C. C. 799; Scott Bros., Inc., 32 M. C. C. 253. In Lease and Interchange of Vehicles by Motor Carriers, 51 M. C. C. 461, 521, \n\n[368 \nU.S. 370, 388]\n\u00a0\n the Commission did not premise its authority to regulate lease and interchange practices among common and contract carriers on any authority generally to control vehicles engaged in interstate commerce. The Commission rather infered from its authority to regulate the transportation offered by common and contract carriers the power to regulate, as well, \"the procurement of transportation.\" This conclusion in no way suggests its authority to regulate the rental of vehicles by noncarriers from companies engaged solely in rental activities.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See S. Doc. No. 152, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. 26 (1934); Hearings before Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce on the Motor Carrier Act of 1935, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. 333, 345, 347-350 (1935).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Short hauls of company products in company-owned and driven equipment remained unaffected by the new arrangement, presumably because there was less opportunity for the misuse of company credit cards in connection with such hauls.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The record does not show the terms on which the drivers acquired the tractors, whether they were bought from the Company or others, and if from the Company, what, if any, consideration was paid. The trailers drawn by these tractors continued to be owned by the Company.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] \"The leases provide in substance as follows: (1) the Company shall pay the owner-operator 10 a mile for hauling single-axle trailers and 11 a mile for hauling tandem-axle trailers, plus an additional 3 a mile for backhaul of the Company's raw materials, (2) payments under the agreement shall be made weekly, (3) motor vehicles covered by the agreement shall be operated by an employee of the Company who shall be properly qualified and physically fit in accordance with state and federal regulations, (4) the owner-operator shall pay all operating costs arising from operation of said equipment (gasoline, oil, grease and parts) and shall pay cost of license plates, (5) the Company shall keep and maintain said equipment in first-class operating condition and in compliance with all safety rules and regulations of state and federal regulatory bodies, (6) if owner-operator fails to pay operating cost of equipment, the Company may cancel the agreement or at its option pay the necessary operating costs and charge same to owner-operator's account with the Company, (7) the Company shall have sole control, right of direction, and use of the leased equipment, all property transported by the leased vehicles shall belong to the Company and the Company will not sub-lease the equipment to any other person, firm or corporation, (8) the Company shall not be liable for wear, tear and depreciation nor for any damage caused to the leased equipment by accident, theft, fire or any other hazard or casualty, (9) the owner-operator shall not be responsible for loss to company equipment, property and cargo, (10) the Company will have the name of the owner-operator endorsed as an additional assured upon its policies of property damage and \n\n[368 \nU.S. 370, 390]\n\u00a0\n public liability insurance covering the operation of motor vehicles, (11) either party may cancel the lease upon giving 30 days' written notice to the other party, (12) the agreement shall remain in full force and effect for one year from date of execution and shall be automatically renewed for further periods of one year unless cancelled in accordance with provisions of the agreement, or terminated by operation of law.\n\n\"The Company also entered into a union contract as employer of its drivers. The contract covers both drivers of company-owned vehicles and the owner-operators who usually drive their own tractors and who are also treated by the Company as employees. Although all the drivers do not belong to the union, the terms of the contract apply equally to non-union employees. This contract provides, in pertinent part, as follows: (1) the Company may discharge any employee for cause, (2) the owner-operators shall be paid at the rate of 4.5 cents a mile for driving, 0.25 cents a mile for living expenses, and 0.25 cents a mile for labor in the maintenance of the truck, or a total of 5 cents a mile, and shall be paid 6 cents a mile for backhauls of raw materials, (3) drivers of company-owned tractors shall receive a basic salary of $50 a week plus 2 cents a mile for driving, (4) owner-operators having driven 75,000 miles during a year in which the contract is in effect shall be entitled to vacation pay computed upon the rate of pay for driving and the average weekly mileage in the preceding year, (5) owner-operators shall maintain their trucks in good running condition at all times, (6) owner-operators shall pay their own living expenses while on the road, (7) the provision of the union contract which guarantees employees 6 hours work or pay if they report for work at their usual or regular time shall not apply to owner-operators.\n\n\n\"The record made before the Commission shows that the operations of the Company and the owner-operators are in substance carried on in accordance with the provisions of the lease agreements and the union contract, with one exception. The lease agreements provide that the Company shall maintain the tractors of the owner-operators and the union contract provides that the owner-operators shall maintain \n\n[368 \nU.S. 370, 391]\n\u00a0\n them. The testimony in the record supports the Commission's finding that the owner-operators in fact maintain their vehicles.\n\n\n\"The record also reveals the following: The owner-operators are not authorized by the Interstate Commerce Commission to engage in the transportation of property either as contract carriers or common carriers by motor vehicle in interstate commerce. The Company uses the 6 tractors which it owns chiefly for short hauls and these are usually driven by the salaried company drivers. The tractors leased by the Company are utilized chiefly for long hauls and are usually operated by the owner-operators, each driving his own tractor. It is the practice of the Company to assign the same driver to the same equipment, regardless of whether it is company-owned or leased. However, when necessity or convenience make it more feasible to do so, drivers who usually drive company-owned tractors are assigned to leased tractors and owner-operators to company-owned tractors. All trailers used in the Company's operations are owned by it. A supervisor employed by the Company oversees all drivers, assigns trips and checks to see that all equipment is properly maintained and repaired. Detailed routing instructions are issued to all drivers and compliance therewith is insured by manner of loading, e. g., last goods to come off are loaded first and the first to come off are loaded last. Prior to departure drivers are handed a truck bill manifest which differs from a bill of lading in that the drivers are not required to sign a receipt for the freight they transport. Each owner operator receives two weekly paychecks, one for rental of his tractor and the other for his service as a driver. The Company deducts from the paychecks of the owner-operators social security and withholding taxes, pays the employer's share of social security and provides workmen's compensation benefits for them. The Company maintains on file drivers' logs, physicians' certificates and vehicle inspection reports. Both company-owned tractors and leased tractors are garaged at the homes of their respective drivers. The Company has the right to hire and fire drivers independently of the lease agreement.\" 193 F.

C. 265 (shippers' control over routing and dispatching held insufficient to constitute private carriage).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 12\n] Since some equipment rental firms pay for liability insurance, the financial burden assumed by the appellees here may even have been less than that assumed by equipment rental firms.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 13\n] The Commission does not consider itself bound by the form in which wage payments are made and occasionally considers who it is who actually bears the wage burden. See Roy Rittenhouse, 78 M. C. C. 389. But even this factor is not always determinative. Pacific Diesel Rental Co., 78 M. C. C. 161.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 14\n] The reasons for differentiating between long and short hauls, as respects the ownership of the tractors used in each type of service, have already been given. Supra, note 5\n\n\n[\nFootnote 15\n] E. g., 69 I. C. C. Ann. Rep. 99; 72 I. C. C. Ann. Rep. 43; 73 I. C. C. Ann. Rep. 51; 74 I. C. C. Ann. Rep. 57-58. A thorough study of the \"gray area\" - defined as \"transport operations which lie between legitimate private carriage and the transportation authorized by Government regulatory bodies\" - was recently submitted to the Senate Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce by the Commission's Bureau of Transport Economics and Statistics. It recognized that one major type of operation conducted in order to avoid regulation was the \"shipper lease of vehicle with driver.\" I. C. C., Bureau of Transport Economics and Statistics, Gray Area of Transportation Operations (1960), 27-37.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 16\n] In a leading decision the Commission set down a rule whereby \"in cases in which the question of the status created by a lease of equipment with drivers by a carrier to a shipper is presented, in the absence of a showing to the contrary, the presumption arises that the transportation is performed by the carrier for compensation, in other words is for-hire transportation and as such is subject to regulation.\" H. B. Church Truck Service, 27 M. C. C. 191, 196. I do not quarrel with the general validity of this presumption, although, until the present case, even the Commission thought it applicable only to leases by those who were otherwise \"for-hire\" carriers. John J. Casale, Inc., 44 M. C. C. 45, 52-53. It is only because the \"showing to the contrary\" in this instance is so overwhelming that I think it was impermissible for the Commission to apply that rule here.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 17\n] The Company here assumed the full cost of an unproductive backhaul, since it paid its drivers for their tractors and their services whether the trailer returned empty or full. If the backhaul was productive, four cents per mile was added to the total payment, possibly as compensation for increased wear-and-tear and more rigorous duties. Although a lease of equipment may, under certain circumstances, require a lessee to return the vehicle to the location where it was first taken, large rental firms do provide for one-way leases at slightly increased rates. The Company might, therefore, well have been able to reduce its loss on an unproductive backhaul by leasing equipment on terms which would have permitted it to return the equipment at the destination. \n\n[368 \nU.S. 370, 399]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","196":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v.

In light of the issues tendered in the papers filed on that appeal there can be no doubt that this Court's judgment finally established the Government's right to the relief sought in this action, subject only to the District Court's resolution of Haley's procedural defense, still unadjudicated, to the effect that the Government had failed to comply with conditions requisite to the effective establishment of a wheat acreage allotment for Haley. See Jurisdictional Statement of the United States and Appellee's Statement Opposing Jurisdiction and Motion to Dismiss or Affirm in No. 587, October Term, 1958; Appellee's Motion to Vacate the Court's Judgment of February 24, 1959, denied April 27, 1959, \n359 \nU.S. 977\n; and Appellee's Motion for Rehearing, denied April 27, 1959, \n359 \nU.S. 981\n.\n\nMore particularly, this Court then necessarily decided (1) that it had jurisdiction over such appeal; (2) that the relevant provisions of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 31, as amended, 7 U.S.C. 1281 et seq., embraced the conduct of Haley complained of in this action; and (3) that the Act was constitutional as applied in the premises. Under the remand ordered by this Court's judgment of February 24, 1959, there was thus left open to the District Court only the adjudication of Haley's above-mentioned procedural defense. The District Court erred in believing that it was not foreclosed from inquiring into this Court's jurisdiction over the \n\n[371 \nU.S. 18, 20]\n\u00a0\n Government's appeal and from reinstating its own original judgment in the case, which appears to have been the effect of its denial of the Government's motion for judgment following remand.

United States District Court, \n334 \nU.S. 258, 263\n, 264. Accordingly, in No. 139, Misc., the Government's motion for leave to file a petition for a writ of mandamus, and its petition for a writ of mandamus, are granted.\n\nWe shall not, however, issue a formal writ at this time, since we are confident that the District Court, once its misconception of our judgment of February 24, 1959, has been called to its attention, will promptly take steps (1) to set aside its order of February 26, 1962, denying the motion of the United States for judgment; (2) to proceed to resolve Haley's aforesaid procedural defense; (3) if such defense is found to be insufficient, to enter a final judgment in this action in favor of the United States; and (4) if such defense is found sufficient, to enter judgment accordingly.

JUSTICE GOLDBERG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThese consolidated appeals present as a key question the validity under 1 of the Sherman Act\n1\n of block booking of copyrighted feature motion pictures for television exhibition. We hold that the tying agreements here are illegal and in violation of the Act. \n\n[371 \nU.S. 38, 40]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe United States brought separate civil antitrust actions in the Southern District of New York in 1957 against six major distributors of pre-1948 copyrighted motion picture feature films for television exhibition, alleging that each defendant had engaged in block booking in violation of 1 of the Sherman Act. The complaints asserted that the defendants had, in selling to television stations, conditioned the license or sale of one or more feature films upon the acceptance by the station of a package or block containing one or more unwanted or inferior films. No combination or conspiracy among the distributors was alleged; nor was any monopolization or attempt to monopolize under 2 of the Sherman Act averred. The sole claim of illegality rested on the manner in which each defendant had marketed its product. The successful pressure applied to television station customers to accept inferior films along with desirable pictures was the gravamen of the complaint.\n\nAfter a lengthy consolidated trial, the district judge filed exhaustive findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a carefully reasoned opinion, 189 F. Supp. 373, in which he found that the actions of the defendants constituted violations of 1 of the Sherman Act. The conclusional finding of fact and law was that\n\n\". . . the several defendants have each, from time to time and to the extent set forth in the specific findings of fact, licensed or offered to license one or more feature films to television stations on condition that the licensee also license one or more other such feature films, and have, from time to time and to the extent set forth in the specific findings of fact, refused, expressly or impliedly, to license feature films to television stations unless one or more other such feature films were accepted by the licensee.\" 189 F. Supp., at 397-398. \n\n[371 \nU.S. 38, 41]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n The judge recognized that there was keen competition between the defendant distributors, and therefore rested his conclusion solely on the individual behavior of each in engaging in block booking. In reaching his decision he carefully considered the evidence relating to each of the 68 licensing agreements that the Government had contended involved block booking. He concluded that only 25 of the contracts were illegally entered into. Nine of these belonged to defendant C & C Super Corp., which had an admitted policy of insisting on block booking that it sought to justify on special grounds.\n\nOf the others, defendant Loew's, Incorporated, had in two negotiations that resulted in licensing agreements declined to furnish stations KWTV of Oklahoma City and WBRE of Wilkes-Barre with individual film prices and had refused their requests for permission to select among the films in the groups. Loew's exacted from KWTV a contract for the entire Loew's library of 723 films, involving payments of $314,725.20. The WBRE agreement was for a block of 100 films, payments to total $15,000.\n\nDefendant Screen Gems, Inc., was also found to have block booked two contracts, both with WTOP of Washington, D.C., one calling for a package of 26 films and payments of $20,800 and the other for 52 films and payments of $40,000. The judge accepted the testimony of station officials that they had requested the right to select films and that their requests were refused.\n\nAssociated Artists Productions, Inc., negotiated four contracts that were found to be block booked. Station WTOP was to pay $118,800 for the license of 99 pictures, which were divided into three groups of 33 films, based on differences in quality. To get \"Treasure of the Sierra Madre,\" \"Casablanca,\" \"Johnny Belinda,\" \"Sergeant York,\" and \"The Man Who Came to Dinner,\" among others, WTOP also had to take such films as \"Nancy Drew \n\n[371 \nU.S. 38, 42]\n\u00a0\n Troubleshooter,\" \"Tugboat Annie Sails Again,\" \"Kid Nightingale,\" \"Gorilla Man,\" and \"Tear Gas Squad.\" A similar contract for 100 pictures, involving a license fee of $140,000, was entered into by WMAR of Baltimore. Triangle Publications, owner and operator of five stations, was refused the right to select among Associated's packages, and ultimately purchased the entire library of 754 films for a price of $2,262,000 plus 10% of gross receipts. Station WJAR of Providence, which licensed a package of 58 features for a fee of $25,230, had asked first if certain films it considered undesirable could be dropped from the offered packages and was told that the packages could not be split.\n\nDefendant National Telefilm Associates was found to have entered into five block booked contracts. Station WMAR wanted only 10 Selznick films, but was told that it could not have them unless it also bought 24 inferior films from the \"TNT\" package and 12 unwanted \"Fabulous 40's.\" It bought all of these, for a total of $62,240. Station WBRE, before buying the \"Fox 52\" package in its entirety for $7,358.50, requested and was refused the right to eliminate undesirable features. Station WWLP of Springfield, Massachusetts, inquired about the possibility of splitting two of the packages, was told this was not possible, and then bought a total of 59 films in two packages for $8,850. A full package contract for National's \"Rocket 86\" group of 86 films was entered into by KPIX of San Francisco, payments to total $232,200, after KPIX requested and was denied permission to eliminate undesirable films from the package. Station WJAR wanted to drop 10 or 12 British films from this defendant's \"Champagne 58\" package, was told that none could be deleted, and then bought the block for $31,000.\n\nThe judge found that defendant United Artists Corporation had in three consummated negotiations conditioned the sale of films on the purchase of an entire \n\n[371 \nU.S. 38, 43]\n\u00a0\n package. The \"Top 39\" were licensed by WAAM of Baltimore for $40,000 only after receipt of a refusal to sell 13 of the 39 films in the package. Station WHTN of Huntington, West Virginia, purchased \"Award 52\" for $16,900 after United Artists refused to deal on any basis other than purchase of the entire 52 films. Thirty-nine films were purchased by WWLP for $5,850 after an initial inquiry about selection of titles was refused.\n\nSince defendant C & C was found to have had an overall policy of block booking, the court did not analyze the particular circumstances of the nine negotiations which had resulted in the licensing of packages of films. C & C's policies resulted in at least one station having to take a package in which \"certain of the films were unplayable since they had a foreign language sound track.\" 189 F. Supp., at 389.\n\nThe court entered separate final judgments against the defendants, wherein each was enjoined from\n\n \"(A) Conditioning or tying, or attempting to condition or tie, the purchase or license of the right to exhibit any feature film over any television station upon the purchase or license of any other film;\n\n\n \"(B) Conditioning the purchase or license of the right to exhibit any feature film over any television station upon the purchase or license for exhibition over any other television station of that feature film, or any other film;\n\n\n \"(C) Entering into any agreement to sell or license the right to exhibit any feature film over any television station in which the differential between the price or fee for such feature film when sold or licensed alone and the price or fee for the same film when sold or licensed with one or more other film [sic] has the effect of conditioning the sale or license of such film upon the sale or license of one or more other films.\" \n\n[371 \nU.S. 38, 44]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n All of the defendants except National Telefilm\n2\n appeal from the decree. The appeals of defendants Loew's, Screen Gems, Associated Artists, and United Artists raise identical issues and are consolidated as No. 43. The appeal of defendant C & C raises additional issues, and is therefore separately numbered as No. 44. The Government, although it won on the merits below, asserts in a cross-appeal (No. 42) that the scope and specificity of the decree entered by the District Court were inadequate to prevent the continued attainment of illegal objectives. It seeks to have the decree broadened in a number of ways. All of the defendants below oppose these modifications. The cases are here on direct appeal from the District Court under 2 of the Expediting Act, 32 Stat. 823, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 29. We noted probable jurisdiction, \n368 \nU.S. 973\n, and consolidated the appeals. We shall consider No. 43 first, since appellants there raise the fundamental question whether their activities were in violation of the antitrust laws. We shall thereafter consider No. 44, the special arguments of appellant C & C, and finally No. 42, the Government's request for broadening the decree.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nThis case raises the recurring question of whether specific tying arrangements violate 1 of the Sherman Act.\n3\n This Court has recognized that \"[t]ying agreements serve hardly any purpose beyond the suppression of competition,\" Standard Oil Co. of California v. United States, \n337 \nU.S. 293, 305\n-306. They are an object of antitrust \n\n[371 \nU.S. 38, 45]\n\u00a0\n concern for two reasons - they may force buyers into giving up the purchase of substitutes for the tied product, see Times-Picayune Pub. Co. v. United States, \n345 \nU.S. 594, 605\n, and they may destroy the free access of competing suppliers of the tied product to the consuming market, see International Salt Co. v. United States, \n332 \nU.S. 392, 396\n. A tie-in contract may have one or both of these undesirable effects when the seller, by virtue of his position in the market for the tying product, has economic leverage sufficient to induce his customers to take the tied product along with the tying item. The standard of illegality is that the seller must have \"sufficient economic power with respect to the tying product to appreciably restrain free competition in the market for the tied product . . . .\" Northern Pacific R. Co. v. United States, \n356 \nU.S. 1, 6\n. Market dominance - some power to control price and to exclude competition - is by no means the only test of whether the seller has the requisite economic power. Even absent a showing of market dominance, the crucial economic power may be inferred from the tying product's desirability to consumers or from uniqueness in its attributes.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nThe requisite economic power is presumed when the tying product is patented or copyrighted, International Salt Co. v. United States, \n332 \nU.S. 392\n; United States \n\n[371 \nU.S. 38, 46]\n\u00a0\n v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., \n334 \nU.S. 131\n. This principle grew out of a long line of patent cases which had eventuated in the doctrine that a patentee who utilized tying arrangements would be denied all relief against infringements of his patent. Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co., \n243 \nU.S. 502\n; Carbice Corp. v. American Patents Dev. Corp., \n283 \nU.S. 27\n; Leitch Mfg. Co. v. Barber Co., \n302 \nU.S. 458\n; Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United States, \n309 \nU.S. 436\n; Morton Salt Co. v. G. S. Suppiger Co., \n314 \nU.S. 488\n; Mercoid Corp. v. Mid-Continent Investment Co., \n320 \nU.S. 661\n. These cases reflect a hostility to use of the statutorily granted patent monopoly to extend the patentee's economic control to unpatented products. The patentee is protected as to his invention, but may not use his patent rights to exact tribute for other articles.\n\nSince one of the objectives of the patent laws is to reward uniqueness, the principle of these cases was carried over into antitrust law on the theory that the existence of a valid patent on the tying product, without more, establishes a distinctiveness sufficient to conclude that any tying arrangement involving the patented product would have anticompetitive consequences. E. g., International Salt Co. v. United States, \n332 \nU.S. 392\n. In United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., \n334 \nU.S. 131, 156\n-159, the principle of the patent cases was applied to copyrighted feature films which had been block booked into movie theaters. The Court reasoned that\n\n \"The copyright law, like the patent statutes, makes  reward to the owner a secondary consideration. In  Fox Film Corp. v. Doyal, \n286 \nU.S. 123, 127\n, Chief  Justice Hughes spoke as follows respecting the copyright  monopoly granted by Congress, `The sole interest  of the United States and the primary object in  conferring the monopoly lie in the general benefits \n\n[371 \nU.S. 38, 47]\n\u00a0\n  derived by the public from the labors of authors.' It  is said that reward to the author or artist serves to  induce release to the public of the products of his  creative genius. But the reward does not serve its  public purpose if it is not related to the quality of  the copyright. Where a high quality film greatly  desired is licensed only if an inferior one is taken,  the latter borrows quality from the former and  strengthens its monopoly by drawing on the other.  The practice tends to equalize rather than differentiate  the reward for the individual copyrights. Even  where all the films included in the package are of  equal quality, the requirement that all be taken if  one is desired increases the market for some. Each  stands not on its own footing but in whole or in part  on the appeal which another film may have. As the  District Court said, the result is to add to the monopoly  of the copyright in violation of the principle of  the patent cases involving tying clauses.\" 334 U.S.,  at 158.\n\n\n Appellants attempt to distinguish the Paramount decision in its relation to the present facts: the block booked sale of copyrighted feature films to exhibitors in a new medium - television. Not challenging the District Court's finding that they did engage in block booking, they contend that the uniqueness attributable to a copyrighted feature film, though relevant in the movie-theater context, is lost when the film is being sold for television use. Feature films, they point out, constitute less than 8% of television programming, and they assert that films are \"reasonably interchangeable\" with other types of programming material and with other feature films as well. Thus they argue that their behavior is not to be judged by the principle of the patent cases, as applied to copyrighted materials in Paramount Pictures, but by the general \n\n[371 \nU.S. 38, 48]\n\u00a0\n principles which govern the validity of tying arrangements of nonpatented products, e. g., Northern Pacific R. Co. v. United States, \n356 \nU.S. 1, 6\n, 11. They say that the Government's proof did not establish their \"sufficient economic power\" in the sense contemplated for nonpatented products.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nAppellants cannot escape the applicability of Paramount Pictures. A copyrighted feature film does not lose its legal or economic uniqueness because it is shown on a television rather than a movie screen.\n\nThe district judge found that each copyrighted film block booked by appellants for television use \"was in itself a unique product\"; that feature films \"varied in theme, in artistic performance, in stars, in audience appeal, etc.,\" and were not fungible; and that since each defendant by reason of its copyright had a \"monopolistic\" position as to each tying product, \"sufficient economic power\" to impose an appreciable restraint on free competition in the tied product was present, as demanded by the Northern Pacific decision. 189 F. Supp., at 381.\n6\n We agree. These findings of the district judge, supported by the record, confirm the presumption of uniqueness resulting from the existence of the copyright itself.\n\nMoreover, there can be no question in this case of the adverse effects on free competition resulting from appellants' \n\n[371 \nU.S. 38, 49]\n\u00a0\n illegal block booking contracts. Television stations forced by appellants to take unwanted films were denied access to films marketed by other distributors who, in turn, were foreclosed from selling to the stations. Nor can there be any question as to the substantiality of the commerce involved. The 25 contracts found to have been illegally block booked involved payments to appellants ranging from $60,800 in the case of Screen Gems to over $2,500,000 in the case of Associated Artists. A substantial portion of the licensing fees represented the cost of the inferior films which the stations were required to accept. These anti-competitive consequences are an apt illustration of the reasons underlying our recognition that the mere presence of competing substitutes for the tying product, here taking the form of other programming material as well as other feature films, is insufficient to destroy the legal, and indeed the economic, distinctiveness of the copyrighted product. Standard Oil Co. of California v. United States, \n337 \nU.S. 293, 307\n; Times-Picayune Pub. Co. v. United States, \n345 \nU.S. 594, 611\n and n. 30. By the same token, the distinctiveness of the copyrighted tied product is not inconsistent with the fact of competition, in the form of other programming material and other films, which is suppressed by the tying arrangements.\n\nIt is therefore clear that the tying arrangements here both by their \"inherent nature\" and by their \"effect\" injuriously restrained trade. United States v. American Tobacco Co., \n221 \nU.S. 106, 179\n. Accommodation between the statutorily dispensed monopoly in the combination of contents in the patented or copyrighted product and the statutory principles of free competition demands that extension of the patent or copyright monopoly by the use of tying agreements be strictly confined. There may be rare circumstances in which the doctrine we have enunciated under 1 of the Sherman Act prohibiting tying arrangements involving patented or copyrighted \n\n[371 \nU.S. 38, 50]\n\u00a0\n tying products is inapplicable. However, we find it difficult to conceive of such a case, and the present case is clearly not one.\n\nThe principles underlying our Paramount Pictures decision have general application to tying arrangements involving copyrighted products, and govern here. Applicability of Paramount Pictures brings with it a meeting of the test of Northern Pacific, since Paramount Pictures is but a particularized application of the general doctrine as reaffirmed in Northern Pacific. Enforced block booking of films is a vice in both the motion picture and television industries, and that the sin is more serious (in dollar amount) in one than the other does not expiate the guilt for either. Appellants' block booked contracts are covered by the flat holding in Paramount Pictures, \n334 \nU.S., at 159\n, that \"a refusal to license one or more copyrights unless another copyright is accepted\" is \"illegal.\"\n\nAppellants (other than C & C) make the additional argument that each of them was found to have entered into such a small number of illegal contracts as to make it improper to enter injunctive relief. Appellants urge that their over-all sales policies were to allow selective purchasing of films, and that in light of this, the fact that a few contracts were found to be illegal does not justify the entering of injunctive relief. We disagree. Illegality having been properly found, appellants cannot now complain that its incidence was too scattered to warrant injunctive relief. The trial judge, exercising sound judgment, has concluded that injunctive relief is necessary to prevent further violations. We think that finding wholly warranted. Moreover, the record shows that Loew's only instituted its policy of making individual films available shortly after suit was brought, and there is evidence that United Artists was conscientious in publicizing its willingness \n\n[371 \nU.S. 38, 51]\n\u00a0\n to deal in individual films only after the commencement of suit was imminent. There is no reason to disturb the judge's legal conclusions and decree merely because he did not find more illegal agreements when, as here, the illegal behavior of each defendant had substantial anticompetitive effects.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nAppellant C & C in its separate appeal raises certain arguments which amount to an attempted business justification for its admitted block booking policy. C & C purchased the telecasting rights in some 742 films known as the \"RKO Library.\" It did so with a bank loan for the total purchase price, and to get the bank loan it needed a guarantor, which it found in the International Latex Corporation. Latex, however, demanded and secured an agreement from C & C that films would not be sold without obtaining in return a commitment from television stations to show a minimum number of Latex spot advertisements in conjunction with the films. Thus, since stations could not feasibly telecast the minimum number of spots without buying a large number of films to spread them over, C & C by requiring the minimum number of advertisements effectively forced block booking on those stations which purchased its films. C & C contends the block booking was merely the by-product of two legitimate business motives - Latex' desire for a saturation advertising campaign, and C & C's wish to buy a large film library. However, the obvious answer to this contention is that the thrust of the antitrust laws cannot be avoided merely by claiming that the otherwise illegal conduct is compelled by contractual obligations. Were it otherwise, the antitrust laws could be nullified. Contractual obligations cannot thus supersede statutory imperatives. Hence, tying arrangements, once found to exist in a context \n\n[371 \nU.S. 38, 52]\n\u00a0\n of sufficient economic power, are illegal \"without elaborate inquiry as to . . . the business excuse for their use,\" Northern Pacific R. Co. v. United States, \n356 \nU.S. 1, 5\n.\n\nIn Nos. 43 and 44, therefore, we agree with the merits of the District Court's decision. It correctly found that the conditioning of the sale of one or more copyrighted feature films to television stations upon the purchase of one or more other films is illegal. The antitrust laws do not permit a compounding of the statutorily conferred monopoly.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n\nThe trial judge's ability to formulate a decree tailored to deal with the violations existent in each case is normally superior to that of any reviewing court, due to his familiarity with testimony and exhibits. Notwithstanding our belief that primary responsibility for the decree must rest with the trial judge if workable results are to obtain, it is our duty to examine the decree in light of the record to see that the relief it affords is adequate to prevent the recurrence of the illegality which brought on the given litigation. United States v. United States Gypsum Co., \n340 \nU.S. 76, 89\n.\n\nThe United States contends that the relief afforded by the final judgments\n7\n is inadequate and that to be adequate it must also: (1) require the defendants to price the films individually and offer them on a picture-by-picture basis; (2) prohibit noncost-justified differentials in price between a film when sold individually and when sold as part of a package; (3) proscribe \"temporary\" refusals by a distributor to deal on less than a block basis while he is negotiating with a competing television station for a package sale. \n\n[371 \nU.S. 38, 53]\n\u00a0\n\n\nSome of the practices which the Government seeks to have enjoined with its requested modifications are acts which may be entirely proper when viewed alone. To ensure, however, that relief is effectual, otherwise permissible practices connected with the acts found to be illegal must sometimes be enjoined. Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United States, \n309 \nU.S. 436, 461\n; United States v. Bausch & Lomb Optical Co., \n321 \nU.S. 707, 724\n; Hartford-Empire Co. v. United States, \n323 \nU.S. 386, 409\n; International Salt Co. v. United States, \n332 \nU.S. 392, 401\n; United States v. United States Gypsum Co., \n340 \nU.S. 76, 88\n-89. When the Government has won the lawsuit, it is entitled to win the cause as well, International Salt Co. v. United States, supra, \n332 \nU.S., at 401\n.\n\n  A. Initial Offer of Individual Films,   Individually Priced.\n\n\n Under the final judgments entered by the court, a distributor would be free to offer films in a package initially, without stating individual prices. If, however, he delayed at all in producing individual prices upon request, he would subject himself to a possible contempt sanction. The Government's first request would prevent this \"first bite\" possibility, forcing the offer of the films on an individual basis at the outset (but, as we view it, not precluding a simultaneous package offer, United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., supra, \n334 \nU.S., at 159\n).\n\nThis is a necessary addition to the decrees, in view of the evidence appearing in the record. Television stations which asked for the individual prices of some of the better pictures \"couldn't get any sort of a firm kind of an answer,\" according to one station official. He stated that they received a \"certain form of equivocation, like the price for the better pictures that we wanted was so high that it wouldn't be worth our while to discuss the matter, \n\n[371 \nU.S. 38, 54]\n\u00a0\n . . . the implication being that it wouldn't happen.\" A Screen Gems intracompany memorandum about a Baton Rouge station's price request stated that \"I told him that I would be happy to talk to him about it, figuring we could start the old round robin that worked so well in Houston & San Antonio.\" Without the proposed amendment to the decree, distributors might surreptitiously violate it by allowing or directing their salesmen to be reluctant to produce the individual price list on request. This subtler form of sales pressure, though not accompanied by any observable delay over time, might well result in some television stations buying the block rather than trying to talk the seller into negotiating on an individual basis. Requiring the production of the individual list on first approach will obviate this danger.\n\n B. Prohibition of Noncost-justified   Price Differentials.\n\n\n The final judgments as entered only prohibit a price differential between a film offered individually and as part of a package which \"has the effect of conditioning the sale or license of such film upon the sale or license of one or more other films.\" The Government contends that this provision appearing by itself is too vague and will lead to unnecessary litigation. Differentials unjustified by cost savings may already be prohibited under the decree as it now appears. Nevertheless, the addition of a specific provision to prevent such differentials will prevent uncertainty in the operation of the decree. To ensure that litigation over the scope and application of the decrees is not left until a contempt proceeding is brought, the second requested modification should be added. The Government, however, seeks to make distribution costs the only saving which can legitimately be the basis of a discount. We would not so limit the relevant cost justifications. To prevent definitional arguments, and to ensure \n\n[371 \nU.S. 38, 55]\n\u00a0\n that all proper bases of quantity discount may be used, the modification should be worded in terms of allowing all legitimate cost justifications.\n\nC. Prohibition of \"Temporary\" Refusals to Deal.\n\nThe Government's third request is, like the first, designed to prevent distributors from subjecting prospective purchasers to a \"run-around\" on the purchase of individual films. No doubt temporary refusal to sell in broken lots to one customer while negotiating to sell the entire block to another is a proper business practice, viewed in vacuo, but we think that if permitted here it may tend to force some stations into buying pre-set packages to forestall a competitor's getting the entire group. In recognition of this the Government seeks a blanket prohibition against all temporary refusals to deal. We agree in the main, except that the modification proposed by the Government fails to give full recognition to that part of this Court's holding in Paramount Pictures which said,\n\n \"We do not suggest that films may not be sold in blocks or groups, when there is no requirement, express or implied, for the purchase of more than one film. All we hold to be illegal is a refusal to license one or more copyrights unless another copyright is accepted.\" \n334 \nU.S., at 159\n.\n\n\n We therefore grant the Government's request, but modify it only to the limited degree necessary to permit a seller briefly to defer licensing or selling to a customer pending the expeditious conclusion of bona fide negotiations already being conducted with a competing station on a proposal wherein the distributor has simultaneously offered to license or sell films either individually or in a package.\n\nThe modifications we have specified will bring about a greater precision in the operation of the decrees. We \n\n[371 \nU.S. 38, 56]\n\u00a0\n have concluded that they will properly protect the interest of the Government in guarding against violations and the interest of the defendants in seeking in good faith to comply.\n\nThe judgments are vacated and the causes are remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n\n    Vacated and remanded.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal . . . .\" 26 Stat. 209 (1890), as amended, 15 U.S.C. 1.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] National Telefilm has, however, filed a brief in opposition to the Government's requests for modifications in the decree, discussed below.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See International Salt Co. v. United States, \n332 \nU.S. 392\n; United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., \n334 \nU.S. 131\n; Times-Picayune Pub. Co. v. United States, \n345 \nU.S. 594\n; Northern Pacific R. Co. v. United States, \n356 \nU.S. 1\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Since the requisite economic power may be found on the basis of either uniqueness or consumer appeal, and since market dominance in the present context does not necessitate a demonstration of market power in the sense of 2 of the Sherman Act, it should seldom be necessary in a tie-in sale case to embark upon a full-scale factual inquiry into the scope of the relevant market for the tying product and into the corollary problem of the seller's percentage share in that market. This is even more obviously true when the tying product is patented or copyrighted, in which case, as appears in greater detail below, sufficiency of economic power is presumed. Appellants' reliance on United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., \n351 \nU.S. 377\n, is therefore misplaced.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Appellants' framing of their argument in terms of each of them not having dominance in the market for television exhibition of feature films misconceives the applicable legal standard. As noted, supra, p. 45, \"sufficient economic power\" as contemplated by the Northern Pacific case is a term more inclusive in scope than \"market dominance.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] To use the trial court's apt example, forcing a television station which wants \"Gone With The Wind\" to take \"Getting Gertie's Garter\" as well is taking undue advantage of the fact that to television as well as motion picture viewers there is but one \"Gone With The Wind.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The operative portion of the injunctions appears at p. 43, supra.\n\nMR.

As to Part III, relating to No. 42, I dissent. My disagreement goes not so much to the particular additional relief granted, but to the fact that the Court has deemed it appropriate to concern itself at all with such comparatively trivial remedial glosses upon the District Court's decree.\n\nI think it distorts the proper relationship of this Court to the lower federal courts, whose assessment of a particular situation is bound to be more informed than ours, for us to exercise revisory power over the terms of antitrust relief, except in instances where things have manifestly gone awry. This is not such a case, as the meticulous handling of it by the District Court abundantly shows. In my view its decree should be left undisturbed. \n\n[371 \nU.S. 38, 57]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","199":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. SAMPSON(1962)\nNo. 69\nArgued: October 18, 1962Decided: November 19, 1962\n\n\n\n\n Appellees were indicted in a Federal District Court for using the mails to defraud and conspiring to do so, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1341 and 371. The indictment alleged that, after appellees' salesmen had fraudulently represented that appellees would help businessmen to obtain loans or sell their businesses and had obtained applications for such services and advance payments therefor, appellees mailed acceptances of such applications to the victims, in order to lull them into believing that the services would be performed. The District Court dismissed the indictment on the ground that, since the money had already been obtained before the acceptances were mailed, these mailings could not have been \"for the purpose of executing\" the fraudulent scheme, within the meaning of 1341. Held: The judgment is reversed. Pp. 76-81.\n\n (a) This case is properly in this Court on direct appeal by the Government under 18 U.S.C. 3731. P. 76.\n\n\n (b) It cannot be held that such a deliberate and planned use of the mails by defendants engaged in a fraudulent scheme in pursuance of a previously formulated plan could not, if established by evidence, be found by a jury under proper instructions to be \"for the purpose of executing\" a fraudulent scheme, within the meaning of 1341, and the District Court erred in dismissing the substantive counts.

Willens argued the cause for the United States. On the briefs were Solicitor General Cox, Assistant Attorney General Miller, Louis F. Claiborne and Philip R. Monahan.\n\nRandolph W. Thrower argued the cause for appellees. With him on the briefs was D. R. Cumming, Jr. \n\n[371 \nU.S. 75, 76]\n\u00a0\n\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nThe appellees were indicted in a United States District Court on charges that they had used the mails \"for the purpose of executing\" a fraudulent scheme in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1341\n1\n and that they had conspired to so use the mails.\n2\n It is clear that the allegations, if proved, would show that a fraudulent scheme existed and that the mailings charged in fact occurred. The District Court dismissed 34 of the counts, however, on the ground that the facts alleged showed that the mails were not used \"for the purpose of executing\" the alleged scheme, as required by the statute. The court also dismissed the conspiracy count without giving additional reasons. The case is properly here on direct appeal by the Government under 18 U.S.C. 3731. The only question we must decide with reference to the 34 substantive counts is whether the allegations in the indictment were sufficient to permit a jury to find that the mails were used \"for the purpose of executing\" the fraudulent scheme. Whether the indictment sufficiently charges that the mails were so used depends upon its allegations.\n\nIn brief summary, these allegations are:\n\nThe individual defendants were officers, directors, and employees of a large, nationwide corporation, also a \n\n[371 \nU.S. 75, 77]\n\u00a0\n defendant, with regional offices in various States. The defendants purported to be able to help businessmen obtain loans or sell out their businesses. Although lavish promises were freely given, the defendants did not intend to and in fact did not make any substantial efforts to perform these promised services. As a part of this scheme, the defendants secured salesmen who were trained to deceive those with whom they dealt by innuendos, half-truths, and false statements.\n3\n These defendants, according to the allegations, were not mere small-time, sporadic swindlers but rather they have deliberately planned and devised a well-integrated, long-range, and effective scheme for the use of propaganda, salesmen, and other techniques to soften up and then cheat their victims one by one. Under the plan, personal calls were made upon prospects who were urged by false and fraudulent representations to sign applications asking defendants to help them obtain loans or sell their businesses. The salesmen further urged prospects, many times successfully, to give a check for an \"advance fee,\" all being assured that if their applications were not accepted at the regional office the \"advance fee\" would be refunded. Payments of the fees were promptly converted by the salesmen into cashiers' checks on local \n\n[371 \nU.S. 75, 78]\n\u00a0\n banks and then forwarded with the applications to the corporate regional offices where all applications, as a part of the plan, were accepted if signed and accompanied by a check for the right amount. The fees were immediately deposited in the defendants' bank account. Although the money had already been obtained, the plan still called for a mailing of the accepted application together with a form letter to the victims \"for the purpose of lulling said victims by representing that their applications had been accepted and that the defendants would therefore perform for said victims the valuable services which the defendants had falsely and fraudulently represented that they would perform.\"\n4\n It was further a part of the scheme to compile rudimentary financial data and forward it to various lending agencies and to inform the victims of this fact in an attempt to convince them that they had not been defrauded and that the defendants were performing meaningful services on their behalves. Moreover, under the plan defendants, while refusing to refund the fee, pretended to investigate complaints from their victims and encouraged their salesmen to deny having made false representations, all the time seeking by false and fraudulent statements to make the victims believe that the defendants had faithfully performed and would continue to perform the promised services. In short, the indictment alleged that the scheme, as originally planned by the defendants and as actually carried out, included fraudulent activities both before and after the victims had actually given over their money to the defendants. Of course, none of these charges have been established by evidence, but at this stage of the proceedings \n\n[371 \nU.S. 75, 79]\n\u00a0\n the indictment must be tested by its sufficiency to charge an offense.\n\nThe use of the mails relied on in the 34 dismissed counts was the mailing by the defendants of their acceptances of the victims' applications for their services. As conceded by the Government, prior to each mailing of an acceptance to a victim the defendants had obtained all the money they expected to get from that victim. The district judge's reason for holding that these counts did not charge a federal offense was that, since the money had already been obtained by the defendants before the acceptances were mailed, these mailings could not have been \"for the purpose of executing\" the scheme. For this holding the court relied chiefly on Kann v. United States, \n323 \nU.S. 88\n (1944), and Parr v. United States, \n363 \nU.S. 370\n (1960).\n\nIn Kann, the defendants defrauded their corporate employer in matters confined to their local region. As a part of their scheme, the defendants had fraudulently obtained checks payable to them which were cashed or deposited at a bank. The use of the mails charged as a violation of the federal statute was the mailing of the checks for collection by the banks which cashed them to the banks upon which they were drawn. Prior to that mailing, the Court found, the defendants had obtained the money they sought, and as far as they were concerned their plan had reached its fruition and come to a complete rest. The scheme, as the Court viewed it, had contemplated no more. The mailing was done by outsiders, the banks, which had no connection whatsoever with the fraud. The checks were mailed for the banks' own purposes and not in any way for the furthering of the fraudulent scheme. In the Court's view it was immaterial to the consummation of the defendants' scheme how or whether the banks which had cashed the checks sought to collect them. \n\n[371 \nU.S. 75, 80]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn Parr, the second case upon which the District Court relied, the defendants had obtained gasoline and other products and services for themselves by the use of the credit card of a School District which had authorized the defendants to use the card for the District's purposes only. The mailings complained of in the Parr case were two invoices sent by the oil company to the District and the District's check mailed back in payment. Again the Court was able to find that the mailings by the outsiders were not an integral part of the scheme as planned and executed by the defendants and that, as a matter of fact, it was completely immaterial to them what the oil company did about collecting its bill.\n\nWe are unable to find anything in either the Kann or the Parr case which suggests that the Court was laying down an automatic rule that a deliberate, planned use of the mails after the victims' money had been obtained can never be \"for the purpose of executing\" the defendants' scheme. Rather the Court found only that under the facts in those cases the schemes had been fully executed before the mails were used. And Court of Appeals decisions rendered both before and after Kann have followed the view that subsequent mailings can in some circumstances provide the basis for an indictment under the mail fraud statutes.\n5\n\u00a0\n\nMoreover, as pointed out above, the indictment in this case alleged that the defendants' scheme contemplated from the start the commission of fraudulent activities which were to be and actually were carried out both before and after the money was obtained from the victims. The indictment specifically alleged that the signed copies of \n\n[371 \nU.S. 75, 81]\n\u00a0\n the accepted applications and the covering letters were mailed by the defendants to the victims for the purpose of lulling them by assurances that the promised services would be performed. We cannot hold that such a deliberate and planned use of the United States mails by defendants engaged in a nationwide, fraudulent scheme in pursuance of a previously formulated plan could not, if established by evidence, be found by a jury under proper instructions to be \"for the purpose of executing\" a scheme within the meaning of the mail fraud statute. For these reasons, we hold that it was error for the District Court to dismiss these 34 substantive counts.\n\nAt the time the trial court dismissed the substantive counts it also dismissed the conspiracy count without stating additional reasons. In this Court, however, it is contended that the conspiracy count duplicates the 43 substantive counts because each substantive count is in reality a conspiracy count. On this basis, it is argued that there is an unjustified pyramiding of conspiracy counts which could be used by the Government in such a way as to deny the defendants, in particular the salesmen, a fair trial. We cannot anticipate arguments that would be more appropriately addressed to the trial court should the conduct or the result of the trial deny any of the defendants their rights. Since the conspiracy count on its face, like the substantive counts on their faces, properly charges a separate offense against each of the defendants, it was also error to dismiss the conspiracy count.\n\n      Reversed.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"SEC. 1341.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting.\n\nI think that today the Court materially qualifies Parr v. United States, \n363 \nU.S. 370\n. There, in the face of the jury's verdict, we held that a check on a third party's \n\n[371 \nU.S. 75, 82]\n\u00a0\n funds, mailed to pay for property after the property had been fraudulently \"obtained,\" could not be \"for the purpose of executing\" a scheme to obtain the property. As the statute makes clear,\n1\n there is only one foundation for prosecution under the statute and that is using the mails \"for the purpose of executing\" the various schemes described in the Act. So far as is relevant here, those schemes are either to defraud or to obtain money by false or fraudulent representations.\n\nIt is possible that in this case indictments could be drawn which charge the use of mails to lull existing victims into a feeling of security so that a scheme to obtain money from other victims could be successfully consummated. The opinion does not so construe the indictment but concludes, as I read it, that the mere lulling of existing victims into a sense of security is enough.\n2\n If that is enough, then in the Parr case it would seem that we should have sustained the conviction because the defendants there may well have wanted the third party to pay for the property that had been fraudulently obtained so that they would not be apprehended. In the Parr case, as here, there was \"a continuing course of conduct\" (to borrow a phrase from the dissent, \n363 \nU.S., at 402\n) not only to obtain money fraudulently but also to conceal the fraud so that future peculations might be possible. In Parr, future peculations from the same taxpayers were part of the scheme. Here there is no suggestion that those previously \n\n[371 \nU.S. 75, 83]\n\u00a0\n defrauded were to be defrauded a second time.\n3\n The mails were used only to tranquilize those already defrauded. Or at least that is the only way I can read this indictment. It is therefore a much weaker case than Parr.\n\nWe should not struggle to uphold poorly drawn counts. To do so only encourages more federal prosecution in fields that are essentially local.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"Whoever, having devised . . .

WISE(1962)\nNo. 488\nArgued: April 16, 1962Decided: June 25, 1962\n\n\n\n\n A grand jury indicted appellee and a corporation of which he was an officer for engaging in a combination and conspiracy to eliminate price competition in the sale of milk in the Kansas City area, in violation of 1 of the Sherman Act. In a bill of particulars, the Government charged that appellee had been acting \"solely in his capacity as an officer, director, or agent who authorized, ordered, or did\" some of the acts constituting a violation. The District Court dismissed the indictment as to appellee, on the ground that 1 of the Sherman Act does not apply to corporate officers acting in a representative capacity. Held: A corporate officer is subject to prosecution under 1 of the Sherman Act whenever he knowingly participates in effecting an illegal contract, combination or conspiracy - be he one who authorizes, orders or helps to perpetrate the crime - regardless of whether he is acting in a representative capacity. Pp. 406-416.\n\n (a) An officer of a corporation acting solely in his representative capacity is a \"person\" within the meaning of 1 of the Sherman Act, which imposes criminal sanctions upon \"every person\" who violates its provisions. Pp. 407-408.\n\n\n (b) A different conclusion is not required by 8, which defines \"person\" to include \"corporations and associations.\" Pp. 408-411.\n\n\n (c) A different conclusion is not required by 14 of the Clayton Act or its legislative history. Pp. 411-415.\n\n\n (d) Nothing in the language or legislative history of the 1955 amendment to the Sherman Act, increasing the penalty for violation thereof from $5,000 to $50,000 without making a corresponding increase in the $5,000 penalty under the Clayton Act, indicates that Congress intended to restrict the applicability of the increased fine to corporations. P. 415.\n\n\n 196 F. Supp. 155, reversed.\n\nRobert L. Wright argued the cause for the United States. With him on the briefs were Solicitor General Cox, Assistant Attorney General Loevinger, Daniel M. Friedman and Richard A. Solomon. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 405, 406]\n\u00a0\n\n\nJohn T. Chadwell argued the cause for appellee. With him on the briefs were Richard W. McLaren, James A. Rahl, James E. Hastings, Martin J. Purcell and John H. Lashly.\n\nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nA grand jury returned an indictment charging the National Dairy Products Corporation with engaging \"in a combination and conspiracy to eliminate price competition in the sale of milk in the Greater Kansas City market in unreasonable restraint of . . . trade and commerce, in violation of Section 1\" of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 1. Two counts incorporated by reference the alleged illegal acts of the corporation and named the appellee as codefendant. In a bill of particulars the Government charged that the appellee had \"been acting solely in his capacity as an officer, director, or agent who authorized, ordered, or did some of the acts\" constituting the violation. The appellee moved for a dismissal on the ground that the indictment, as particularized by the bill, failed to charge a crime. According to appellee, the Sherman Act does not apply to corporate officers acting in a representative capacity; he contends that the statute exclusively applicable to these officers is 14 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 24. Over the Government's opposition the dismissal was ordered by the district judge. 196 F. Supp. 155. An appeal was perfected pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3731, and we noted probable jurisdiction. \n368 \nU.S. 945\n.\n\nAlthough the Sherman Act has been in existence for over 70 years and although corporate officers have been indicted under that Act for almost as long, see, e. g., United States v. Greenhut, 50 F. 469 (D.C. D. Mass. 1892); United States v. Patterson, 55 F. 605 (D.C. D. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 405, 407]\n\u00a0\n Mass. 1893),\n1\n this question is one of first impression for this Court. The impetus for raising this issue at such a late date comes from the fact that in 1955 the Congress raised the penalty provision in the Sherman Act from $5,000 to $50,000 without making a corresponding increase in the $5,000 penalty found in the Clayton Act.\n\nSection 1 of the Sherman Act imposes criminal sanctions upon \"every person\" who violates that provision, 15 U.S.C. 1.\n2\n The Government contends that a corporate officer is obviously a \"person\" within the Act. The appellee, however, distinguishes between a corporate officer who represents his corporation and one who acts on his own account. In the latter case the appellee agrees that the Sherman Act applies. But, when the officer is acting solely for his corporation, the appellee contends that he is no longer a \"person\" within the Act. The rationale for this distinction is that the activities of an officer, however illegal and culpable, are chargeable to the corporation as the principal but not to the individual who perpetrates them.\n\nNo substantial support for such an artificial interpretation of a seemingly clear statute is provided by the legislative history. The most that can be said for the appellee's position is that the Reagan Bill, an unsuccessful competitor of the Sherman Bill, specifically included corporate \n\n[370 \nU.S. 405, 408]\n\u00a0\n officers in its penal section while the Sherman Bill had no penal section at one time. The penal provision of the Reagan Bill was offered as an amendment to the Sherman Bill, and the Senate Committee on the Judiciary then redrafted and resubmitted a bill in the form which became the Sherman Act. 21 Cong. Rec. 2731, 3152. That Act outlawed certain acts by \"persons,\" and there is nothing to indicate that the Congress intended to restrict the meaning as applied to corporate officers. See Trailmobile Co. v. Whirls, \n331 \nU.S. 40, 61\n.\n\nThe appellee points to 8 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 7, which defines \"person\" \"to include corporations and associations.\" He argues that, since corporations are included within the term, individual corporate officers are thereby excluded. This is a non sequitur. The mere fact that the term is given a broad construction does not alter its basic meaning, and no such inference can be drawn from the express inclusion of corporations as \"persons.\" The reason for this inclusion is readily understandable. The doctrine of corporate criminal responsibility for the acts of the officers was not well established in 1890. See New York Central & H. R. R. Co. v. United States, \n212 \nU.S. 481\n. When a criminal statute proscribed conduct by \"persons,\" corporate defendants contended that only natural persons were included. United States v. Amedy, 11 Wheat. 392. The same issue raised in other cases was not always resolved by a unanimous Court. Beaston v. Farmers' Bank of Delaware, 12 Pet. 102. Cf. United States v. Shirey, \n359 \nU.S. 255\n. The dissent by Mr. Justice Story in the Beaston case would be sufficient reason for a careful draftsman to avoid the whole problem of a provision such as 8. Further reason for caution lay in the language found in cases then recent. Sinking-Fund Cases, \n99 \nU.S. 700, 718\n-719, and Canada Southern R. Co. v. Gebhard, \n109 \nU.S. 527, 542\n (dissenting opinion), which distinguished between persons \n\n[370 \nU.S. 405, 409]\n\u00a0\n and corporations when considering the application of the Fourteenth Amendment's protection to \"persons.\" See Philadelphia Fire Assn. v. New York, \n119 \nU.S. 110, 120\n (dissenting opinion). Therefore, we attribute no significance to the specific inclusion of corporations in the definition of \"persons\" in determining whether a corporate officer is within the term.\n\nThis Court was faced with the same problem in United States v. Dotterweich, \n320 \nU.S. 277\n, involving the construction of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 301-392. An earlier version of the Act stated that the acts of a corporate officer would be chargeable both to him and to the corporation. In a 1938 revision the statute made any \"person\" responsible and specifically included corporations within that term. 52 Stat. 1040. The Court of Appeals reversed the conviction of a corporate officer on the ground that only a corporation was a \"person\" within the Act. This Court reversed the Court of Appeals, rejecting substantially the same argument that is advanced by the appellee in this case. The reason for the rejection is equally applicable to the case at bar. No intent to exculpate a corporate officer who violates the law is to be imputed to Congress without clear compulsion; else the fines established by the Sherman Act to deter crime become mere license fees for illegitimate corporate business operations. Following Dotterweich, we construe 1 of the Sherman Act in its common-sense meaning to apply to all officers who have a responsible share in the proscribed transaction. Cf. Carolene Products Co. v. United States, \n323 \nU.S. 18, 21\n.\n\nThis construction is supported by the decisions of the lower federal courts which considered the problem of whether corporate officers were \"persons\" within the Sherman Act in the interim before the passage of the Clayton Act. The most significant case is United States v. MacAndrews & Forbes Co., 149 F. 823 (C. C. S. D. N. Y. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 405, 410]\n\u00a0\n 1906), in which the Court considered the joint indictment of a corporation and some of its officers for violations of the Sherman Act. The defendants demurred to the joinder, the corporation pleading that only the human agents could be held responsible for the misdemeanor while the officers pleaded that only the corporation was responsible. The Court refused to hold as a matter of law that either proposition was correct because responsibility was, in each case, a matter of fact. The Court noted that the officers may or may not be convicted, depending upon whether they were personally responsible for the crime.\n3\n\u00a0\n\nIn United States v. Winslow, 195 F. 578 (D.C. D. Mass. 1912), the same contention by corporate officers was given short disposition:\n\n \"The indictment, however, expressly charges them  [the corporate officers] as actors, and two fundamental  principles are thoroughly settled. One is that  neither in the civil nor the criminal law can an officer  protect himself behind a corporation where he is the  actual, present, and efficient actor; and the second  is that all parties active in promoting a misdemeanor,  whether agents or not, are principals.\" 195 F., at 581. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 405, 411]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n We have found no case between 1890 and 1914 in which a corporate officer successfully secured the dismissal of an indictment or the reversal of a conviction on the ground that he was not a \"person\" within the Sherman Act when he acted solely as a representative of the corporation.\n\nUnless subsequent statutes have repealed or amended this aspect of the Sherman Act, our inquiry is at an end.\n\nThe appellee seeks succor in the subsequent legislative history accompanying attempts to amend the Sherman Act between 1890 and 1914. He particularly relies upon H. R. 10539, 56th Cong., 1st Sess. (1900). This bill would have expressly included corporate officers and agents in the definition of \"persons\" found in 8. The report accompanying that bill stated that the existing law did not subject agents, officers, and attorneys to penalties. H. R. Rep. No. 1506, 56th Cong., 1st Sess. However, statutes are construed by the courts with reference to the circumstances existing at the time of the passage. The interpretation placed upon an existing statute by a subsequent group of Congressmen who are promoting legislation and who are unsuccessful has no persuasive significance here. United States v. Price, \n361 \nU.S. 304, 313\n; United States v. Turley, \n352 \nU.S. 407, 415\n, n. 14; Fogarty v. United States, \n340 \nU.S. 8, 13\n-14; Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath, \n339 \nU.S. 33, 47\n; United States v. United Mine Workers, \n330 \nU.S. 258, 281\n-282; Gemsco, Inc., v. Walling, \n324 \nU.S. 244, 265\n. Logically, several equally tenable inferences could be drawn from the failure of the Congress to adopt an amendment in the light of the interpretation placed upon the existing law by some of its members, including the inference that the existing legislation already incorporated the offered change.\n\nIn 1914 the Congress passed \"An Act To supplement existing laws against unlawful restraints and monopolies, \n\n[370 \nU.S. 405, 412]\n\u00a0\n and for other purposes,\" commonly called the Clayton Act. Section 14 of that Act provided:\n\n \"That whenever a corporation shall violate any of the penal provisions of the antitrust laws, such violation shall be deemed to be also that of the individual directors, officers, or agents of such corporation who shall have authorized, ordered, or done any of the acts constituting in whole or in part such violation, and such violation shall be deemed a misdemeanor, and upon conviction therefor of any such director, officer, or agent he shall be punished by a fine of not exceeding $5,000 or by imprisonment for not exceeding one year, or by both, in the discretion of the court.\" 38 Stat. 736.\n\n\n The appellee contends that 14 is an entirely new provision added by Congress to provide for the criminal responsibility of corporate officers who act in a representative capacity. The Government contends that 14 is merely supplemental and that appellee's construction results in an implied repeal of part of 1 of the Sherman Act.\n4\n\u00a0\n\nAppellee asserts that 14 would not literally apply to the officer who acted on his own account because his misconduct would not be attributed to the corporation. From this premise he argues that since 14 of the Clayton Act applies only to an officer acting in a representative capacity, 1 of the Sherman Act only applies to an officer acting on his own account.\n\nWe do not agree. The reasons for 14 are sufficiently revealed by the legislative history. The provision originated \n\n[370 \nU.S. 405, 413]\n\u00a0\n in the House, and after conferences with the Senate, survived substantially intact. The reports provide no assistance, but the debates do. Whether any supplementary legislation was necessary was the essence of the debates. As Senator Shields, an opponent, said, \"[ 14] is merely a reenactment of the Sherman law, sections 1, 2, and 3. In other words, it has always been held that the officers of corporations violating the law were punishable under these sections . . . .\" 51 Cong. Rec. 14214. See 51 Cong. Rec. 9079, 9080, 9169, 9201, 9202, 9595, 9610, 14225, 15820, 16143. The proponents of the bill agreed that the Sherman Act did cover officers whose conduct constituted the offense (without distinction as to the capacity in which the officer was acting), but were disappointed in the sympathy shown to corporate officers by judges, juries, and prosecutors. Second, the proponents feared that the present Sherman Act did not cover officers who merely authorized or ordered the commission of the offense. These ideas were clearly expressed by Representative Floyd, a House manager:\n\n \"The purpose we had was to make it clear that, when a corporation had been guilty, those officers, agents, and directors of the corporation that either authorized, ordered, or did the thing prohibited should be guilty. Under the existing law, and without that provision of the statute, the person who did the things would undoubtedly be guilty; but in the enforcement of the criminal provisions of the Sherman law, experience has demonstrated that both juries and courts are slow to convict men who have simply done acts authorized or ordered by some officers of the concern higher up, and the words `authorized' and `ordered' were introduced to reach the real offenders, the men who caused the things to be done . . . .\" 51 Cong. Rec. 9609. See 51 Cong. Rec. 9074, 9185, 9676, 9677, 9678, 9679, 16317. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 405, 414]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Third, the proponents were fearful that the Sherman Act might not cover the activities of an officer which made a single \"link\" in the \"chain\" of events constituting the antitrust violation. Hence, the provision fixing responsibility for an act constituting \"in whole or in part\" the violations. 51 Cong. Rec. 9679, 16275, 16317.\n\nWe examine this legislative history in order to ascertain the intent of Congress as to the ultimate purpose of 14 of the Clayton Act. United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., \n353 \nU.S. 586, 591\n-592; Schwegmann Bros. v. Calvert Distillers Corp., \n341 \nU.S. 384, 390\n-395; Federal Trade Comm'n v. Morton Salt Co., \n334 \nU.S. 37, 43\n-46, 49; Corn Products Refining Co. v. Federal Trade Comm'n, \n324 \nU.S. 726, 734\n-737. How members of the 1914 Congress may have interpreted the 1890 Act is not of weight for the purpose of construing the Sherman Act. Federal Housing Administration v. Darlington, Inc., \n358 \nU.S. 84\n; Rainwater v. United States, \n356 \nU.S. 590\n; Koshkonong v. Burton, \n104 \nU.S. 668\n; Ogden v. Blackledge, 2 Cranch 272, 277. See United States v. Stafoff, \n260 \nU.S. 477\n; Penn Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Lederer, \n252 \nU.S. 523\n; Levindale Lead & Zinc Mining Co. v. Coleman, \n241 \nU.S. 432\n; Talbot v. Seeman, 1 Cranch 1, 35. But see Sioux Tribe v. United States, \n316 \nU.S. 317\n; Stockdale v. Insurance Co., 20 Wall. 323, 331 (separate opinion); United States v. Freeman, 3 How. 556. Cf. United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., \n353 \nU.S. 586\n.\n\nSection 14 was intended to be a reaffirmation of the Sherman Act's basic penal provisions and a mandate to prosecutors to bring all responsible persons to justice. In the light of the congressional purpose revealed on the face of the statute and by the legislative history, this Court cannot construe 14 as a restriction of 1 of the Sherman Act. Thus, insofar as 14 relates to the corporate officer who participates in the Sherman Act violation, whether or not in a representative capacity, no change was either intended or effected. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 405, 415]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe cases subsequent to the Clayton Act reveal an understanding in accord with our own. The Government continued to seek indictments of corporate officers under the Sherman Act, not the Clayton Act, and many convictions were obtained. See, e. g., United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., \n310 \nU.S. 150\n; United States v. Trenton Potteries Co., \n273 \nU.S. 392\n; American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 147 F.2d 93 (C. A. 6th Cir.), affirmed, \n328 \nU.S. 781\n.\n\nThe appellee does not call to our attention any case during this time in which the contention he now makes was successfully urged. He suggests that the dearth of cases on this point reflects the belief on the part of corporate officers that, because of the identical penalties of the Clayton Act, the successful challenge to a Sherman Act indictment would be an academic victory. We cannot even attempt to evaluate the motives of individual defendants in raising or not raising defenses, even if we regarded the matter as being significant, which we do not.\n\nThe Government, on the other hand, relies upon United States v. Atlantic Comm'n Co., 45 F. Supp. 187 (D.C. E. D. N.C.); United States v. General Motors Corp., 26 F. Supp. 353 (D.C. N. D. Ind.), affirmed, 121 F.2d 376 (C. A. 7th Cir.); and United States v. National Malleable & Steel Castings Co., 6 F.2d 40 (D.C. N. D. Ohio), holding that nothing in 14 of the Clayton Act altered the existing liability for prosecution of all officers who participate in the violation of the Sherman Act. With this, we agree.\n\nWe also agree that there is nothing in the 1955 amendment to the Sherman Act nor in its legislative history to indicate that the Congress intended to restrict the applicability of the increased fine to corporations. See 69 Stat. 282; S. Rep. No. 618, 84th Cong., 1st Sess.; H. R. Rep. No. 70, 84th Cong., 1st Sess. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 405, 416]\n\u00a0\n\n\nBased upon the foregoing, we hold that a corporate officer is subject to prosecution under 1 of the Sherman Act whenever he knowingly participates in effecting the illegal contract, combination, or conspiracy - be he one who authorizes, orders, or helps perpetrate the crime - regardless of whether he is acting in a representative capacity. It follows that the District Court erred when it dismissed the indictment against the appellee. The case is reversed and remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n    Reversed and remanded.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In the Government's brief the Solicitor General cites 40 cases in which corporate officers were indicted under the Sherman Act between 1890 and 1914. Brief for Appellant, pp. 69-72.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] \"Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal . . . . Every person who shall make any contract or engage in any combination or conspiracy declared . . . to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding fifty thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court.\"\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] \"It is not without significance that offenses as serious, in congressional opinion, as those created by this statute are made misdemeanors. When the statute declares that certain acts notoriously to be accomplished under modern business conditions only through corporate instrumentality shall be misdemeanors [sic], and further declares that the word `person' as used therein shall be deemed to include corporations, such statute seems to me clearly passed in contemplation of the elementary principle that in respect of a misdemeanor all those who personally aid or abet in its commission are indictable as principals. . . . I am compelled to the conclusion that, under this statute, if the officer or agent of a corporation charged with fault be also charged with personal participation, direction, or activity therein, both may be so charged in the same indictment.\" 149 F., at 832.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Appellee also argues, \"[t]he Government in this case has not expressly relied on an aider and abettor theory, but . . . it has sought tacit support from the theory.\" Brief for Appellee, pp. 62-68. Under the view we take of the case, it is unnecessary to consider the application of the general aider and abettor statute, 18 U.S.C. 2.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring.\n\nI join in the opinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE with some additional observations, believed warranted by the circumstance that the holding below has since been followed by five District Courts, with only two others to the contrary.\n1\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 405, 417]\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe language of 1 of the Sherman Act, providing a penalty for \"every person\" who engages in a conspiracy or makes a contract in restraint of trade, of course presents a serious obstacle to appellee's contention that he cannot be prosecuted thereunder. I agree with the Court that 8, defining \"person\" to include corporations and associations, does not imply the exclusion of natural persons. Moreover, the fiction of corporate entity, operative to protect officers from contract liability, had never been applied as a shield against criminal prosecutions when the Sherman Act was passed. In fact I think there can have been no serious doubt even as early as 1890 that officers could be punished for crimes committed for their corporations. Until well into the nineteenth century the corporation itself could not be convicted; the individuals who acted in its name of course could be. See the anonymous note of Holt, C. J., 12 Mod. 559, Case 935, 88 Eng. Rep. 1518 (K. B. 1701); Rex v. Medley, 6 Car. & P. 292, 297, 299, 172 Eng. Rep. 1246, 1249-1250 (K. B. 1834); State v. Great Works Milling & Mfg. Co., 20 Me. 41, 44 (1841); Ballantine, Corporations (rev. ed. 1946), 113. However, it was recognized that corporate officers could be convicted for \"representative\" crimes even after the corporation's immunity was worn away, Regina v. Great North of England R. Co., 1846. 9 Q. B. 315, 325-327, 115 Eng. Rep. 1294, 1298; State v. Morris & E. R. Co., 23 N. J. L. 360, 369 (1852); State v. Patton, 26 N.C. 16 (1843), in line with the rule stated in 1 Bishop, Criminal Law (7th ed. 1882), 892, that an agent might be punished for crimes committed for his principal. Cf. United \n\n[370 \nU.S. 405, 418]\n\u00a0\n States v. Mills, 7 Pet. 138, 142. A substantial volume of convictions of individuals for corporate crimes had accumulated by 1890.\n2\n Congress legislated against this background; it used words sufficiently broad that representative crimes fell within their ordinary meaning; and the normal inference would be that Congress intended to punish those responsible for acts which it declared unlawful.\n\nThe legislative history discloses no intention on the part of Congress to exempt the representative offenses of corporate officers. The Sherman bill, S. 1, 50th Cong., 1st Sess., was reported to the Senate with criminal penalties expressly extending to corporate officers and agents, but Senator Sherman soon omitted the criminal provisions altogether. 21 Cong. Rec. 1765, 2455. Senator Reagan then offered a substitute bill which, among other things, reinstated the criminal provisions, again expressly naming corporate agents in slightly different language. Id., at 2456. Appellee relies on statements made by Senator Sherman in the debate:\n\n\"Whether this law should extend to mere clerks, as was proposed in the third section [as reported by the Committee], is a matter of grave doubt. . . . To restrain and prevent the illegal tendency of a corporation is the proper duty of a court of equity. To punish the criminal intention of an officer is a much \n\n[370 \nU.S. 405, 419]\n\u00a0\n more difficult process and might be well left to the future. . . . These corporations do not care about your criminal statutes aimed at their servants. . . .\" Id., at 2456, 2457, 2569.\n\n\n However, the issue before the Senate at that time was not whether to exempt corporate officers from criminal prosecution but whether to omit criminal sanctions entirely. The objections raised - that the addition of criminal penalties would result in strict construction in favor of legality and would inflict punishment for violations of vague and uncertain provisions - applied as well to persons acting for their own account, admittedly included within the Act as passed, as to those acting for corporations. Moreover, Senator Sherman was promptly overruled by a vote of 34-12, adopting the Reagan amendment as an amendment to the Sherman bill. Id., at 2611. A number of additional amendments rendered the bill quite unwieldy, see id., at 2655 (Senator Sherman), and it was submitted to the Committee on the Judiciary for tailoring, id., at 2731. The bill was redrafted in committee to its approximate present form and passed by a 52-1 vote, id., at 2901, 3145, 3153.\n\nI am not persuaded, as argued by the appellee, that the greater margin of support for the final bill than for the Reagan bill indicates that the criminal liability of corporate officers was narrowed. Opposition to the Reagan bill was based in part on its specification of unlawful purposes that would render a combination a trust, id., at 2469 (Senator Reagan), 2561 (Senator Teller), which was omitted by the Committee, and in part on the inclusion of any criminal penalties at all, a feature common to the Reagan and the final bills which was accepted at the end in a spirit of compromise, as it was by Senator Sherman himself, id., at 2604, 2655. No Senator ever suggested, so far as can be found, that criminal penalties should be provided for corporations and for self-employed or \"ultra \n\n[370 \nU.S. 405, 420]\n\u00a0\n vires\" individuals alone. Thirty-four Senators - a majority of the whole body - voted to include, via the Reagan bill, sanctions against officers acting for the corporation. The Committee's reduction of the explicit, but cumbersome, language of the Reagan bill to the simple and on its face equally all-encompassing \"every person\" appears to have been simply a part of the general streamlining of the bill that took place in the Committee, with no intention of changing substance.\n\nThese and the further considerations dealt with in the opinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE\n3\n lead to the conclusion that the indictment in this case must be sustained.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The opinion below is reported at 196 F. Supp. 155 (W. D. Mo. 1961). In accord are United States v. A. P. Woodson Co., 198 F. Supp. 582 (D. D.C. 1961), appeal pending, No. 1019, O. T. 1961; United States v. Milk Distributors Assn., 200 F.

General Motors Corp., 1962 Trade Cases, par. 70,203 (S. D. Cal. 1962), reversed sub nom. United States v. Staley, post, p. 719; and United States v. Engelhard-Hanovia, Inc., 204 F. Supp. 407 (S. D. N. Y. 1962), appeal pending sub nom. United States v. Brown, No. 983, O. T. 1961.\n\nIn United States v. North American Van Lines, Inc., 202 F. Supp. 639 (D. D.C. 1962), the court refused to dismiss an indictment of corporate officers, holding that they were not charged with acting solely in a representative capacity. It went on to say that in any \n\n[370 \nU.S. 405, 417]\n\u00a0\n event the Sherman Act applied to representative acts. We are informed by the parties here that in United States v. Packard-Bell Electronics Corp., Cr. No. 30158, S. D. Cal., a motion to dismiss was denied without opinion. The indictment, see 5 CCH Trade Reg. Rep. (1961), par. 45,061, case 1632, charged violations of 14 as well as of 1.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Moore v. State, 48 Miss. 147 (1873); Elsberry v. State, 52 Ala. 8, 10 (1875); Ex parte Schmidt, 2 Tex. App. 196 (1877); Cowley v. People, 83 N. Y. 464, 469 (1881); State v. Parsons, 12 Mo. App. 205 (1882); City of Wyandotte v. Corrigan, 35 Kan. 21, 26, 10 P. 99, 102 (1886). The only decision found to the contrary is Commonwealth v. Demuth, 12 S. & R. 389, 392 (Pa. 1825), in which a particular statute was read not to impose a duty on individual officers. That this did not state a general rule even in Pennsylvania was made clear by the Supreme Court of that State in Commonwealth v. Ohio & P. R. Co., 1 Grant 329, 350 (1856) (dictum).\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] I find little support, however, for our conclusion in United States v. MacAndrews & Forbes Co., 149 F. 823 (C. C. S. D. N. Y. 1906), or United States v. Winslow, 195 F. 578 (D. Mass. 1912), despite some of the language in those opinions. Neither case squarely upholds criminal responsibility in a \"representative\" capacity. Among other things the court in MacAndrews & Forbes declared it possible to infer from the indictment that the corporations were \"doing one thing and the individuals another at or about the same time, which things were utterly different . . . . It is conceivable that the evidence may show that the individual defendants were not free agents, but acted under a species of corporate coercion, for which they should not be held personally responsible; but it is impossible to arrive at this conclusion on demurrer.\" 149 F., at 832. In Winslow, the indictment charged the officers with controlling the industry \"by the device and means of and through and in the names of\" certain corporations. 195 F., at 591. Thus all that was held in MacAndrews & Forbes, and all that needed to be held in Winslow, was that corporate officers are not shielded from criminal responsibility when they act on their own individual account or when they use a sham corporation as a means of furthering their personal ends.\n\nNor do I find much weight in the decisions since 1914 upholding the applicability of the Sherman Act to representative crimes of corporate officers; while the penalties for violating the two statutes were identical there was little incentive to argue to the contrary. The most that can be said of the decisions since 1890 is that they have suggested no doubt of the applicability of the Sherman Act to corporate officers acting only in a representative capacity. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 405, 421]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","201":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v.

ATKINSON(1962)\nNo. 323\nArgued: March 22, 1962Decided: May 14, 1962\n\n\n\n\n Petitioner, a seaman, was discharged from respondents' ship at the end of a voyage, and the master gave him a certificate to enter a Public Health Service Hospital, which admitted him as an inpatient, treated him for suspected tuberculosis for several weeks and then treated him as an outpatient for over two years before declaring him fit for duty. When he was admitted to outpatient status, petitioner sent the shipowner an abstract of his medical record and requested payment for maintenance and cure; but his request was not complied with, and he worked as a taxi driver to support himself while receiving outpatient treatment. Finally he employed counsel and brought this suit in admiralty to recover (a) maintenance and cure, and (b) damages for failure to pay for maintenance and cure. The District Court awarded him maintenance, minus the amount of his earnings as a taxi driver, but denied him damages. Held:\n\n 1. On the record in this case, petitioner was entitled to reasonable counsel fees as damages for failure to pay for maintenance. Pp. 530-531.\n\n\n 2. On the record in this case, petitioner was entitled to pay for maintenance without deduction of the amount of his earnings as a taxi driver. Pp. 531-534.\n\n\n 291 F.2d 813, reversed.\n\nJacob L.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS, announced by MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN.\n\nThis is a suit in admiralty brought by a seaman to recover (a) maintenance and cure and (b) damages for \n\n[369 \nU.S. 527, 528]\n\u00a0\n failure to pay maintenance and cure.\n1\n The District Court, while disallowing the claim for damages, granted maintenance, less any sums earned by the libellant during the period in question. 200 F. Supp. 802. The Court of Appeals affirmed, Chief Judge Sobeloff dissenting. 291 F.2d 813. The case is here on a writ of certiorari. \n368 \nU.S. 888\n.\n\nLibellant served on respondents'\n2\n vessel from November 26, 1956, to March 2, 1957, when he was discharged on termination of a voyage. On March 7, 1957, he reported to a United States Public Health Service Hospital for examination and was admitted on March 18, 1957, as an inpatient, and treated for suspected tuberculosis. On June 6, 1957, he was discharged to an outpatient status and he remained in that status for over two years. On August 25, 1959, he was notified that he was fit for duty as of August 19, 1959.\n\nThe hospital records show a strong probability of active tuberculosis. The Master furnished libellant a certificate to enter the hospital on his discharge, March 2, 1957. Though libellant forwarded to the owner's agent an abstract of his clinical record at the hospital in 1957, the only investigation conducted by them was an interrogation of the Master and Chief Engineer, who stated that the libellant had never complained of any illness during his four months' service. The owner made no effort to make any further investigation of libellant's claim for maintenance and cure, and according to the findings did not bother even to admit or deny the validity \n\n[369 \nU.S. 527, 529]\n\u00a0\n of that claim. Nearly two years passed during which libellant was on his own. Ultimately he was required to hire an attorney and sue in the courts to recover maintenance and cure, agreeing to pay the lawyer a 50% contingent fee. Even so, the District Court held that no damages for failure to furnish maintenance and cure had been shown. In its view such damages are payable not for attorney's fees incurred but only when the failure to furnish maintenance and cure caused or aggravated the illness or other physical or mental suffering.\n\nThe District Court first allowed maintenance at the rate of $8 a day from June 6, 1957, to February 18, 1959. Since libellant during that period had worked as a taxi driver, the District Court ordered that his earnings be deducted from the amount owed by respondents. Subject to that credit, the order also provided that maintenance at $8 per day be continued until such time as the libellant reached the maximum state of recovery. The District Court allowed in addition 6% interest for each week's maintenance unpaid. Subsequently the District Court extended the maintenance to cover the period from March 7, 1957, to March 17, 1957, and from February 18, 1959, through August 25, 1959, these later awards being without interest.\n\nThe Court of Appeals denied counsel fees as damages, relying on the conventional rule that in suits for breach of contract the promisee is not allowed that item in computing the damages payable by the promisor. And the Court of Appeals, following Wilson v. United States, 229 F.2d 277, and Perez v. Suwanee S. S. Co., 239 F.2d 180, from the Second Circuit, held that a seaman has the duty to mitigate damages and that since \"the purpose of maintenance and cure is to make the seaman whole,\" \"he will get something more than he is entitled to\" unless his \n\n[369 \nU.S. 527, 530]\n\u00a0\n earnings during the period are deducted. 291 F.2d, at 814, 815.\n\nWe disagree with the lower courts on both points.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nEquity is no stranger in admiralty; admiralty courts are, indeed, authorized to grant equitable relief. See Swift & Co. v. Compania Caribe, \n339 \nU.S. 684, 691\n-692, where we said, \"We find no restriction upon admiralty by chancery so unrelenting as to bar the grant of any equitable relief even when that relief is subsidiary to issues wholly within admiralty jurisdiction.\"\n\nCounsel fees have been awarded in equity actions, as where Negroes were required to bring suit against a labor union to prevent discrimination. Rolax v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 186 F.2d 473, 481. As we stated in Sprague v. Ticonic Bank, \n307 \nU.S. 161, 164\n, allowance of counsel fees and other expenses entailed by litigation, but not included in the ordinary taxable costs regulated by statute, is \"part of the historic equity jurisdiction of the federal courts.\" We do not have here that case. Nor do we have the usual problem of what constitutes \"costs\" in the conventional sense. Cf. The Baltimore, 8 Wall. 377. Our question concerns damages. Counsel fees were allowed in The Apollon, 9 Wheat. 362, 379, an admiralty suit where one party was put to expense in recovering demurrage of a vessel wrongfully seized. While failure to give maintenance and cure may give rise to a claim for damages for the suffering and for the physical handicap which follows (The Iroquois, \n194 \nU.S. 240\n), the recovery may also include \"necessary expenses.\" Cortes v. Baltimore Insular Line, \n287 \nU.S. 367, 371\n.\n\nIn the instant case respondents were callous in their attitude, making no investigation of libellant's claim and \n\n[369 \nU.S. 527, 531]\n\u00a0\n by their silence neither admitting nor denying it. As a result of that recalcitrance, libellant was forced to hire a lawyer and go to court to get what was plainly owed him under laws that are centuries old. The default was willful and persistent. It is difficult to imagine a clearer case of damages suffered for failure to pay maintenance than this one.\n3\n\u00a0\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nMaintenance and cure is designed to provide a seaman with food and lodging when he becomes sick or injured in the ship's service; and it extends during the period when he is incapacitated to do a seaman's work and continues until he reaches maximum medical recovery. The policy underlying the duty was summarized in Calmar S. S. Corp. v. Taylor, \n303 \nU.S. 525, 528\n:\n\n\"The reasons underlying the rule, to which reference must be made in defining it, are those enumerated in the classic passage by Mr. Justice Story in Harden v. Gordon, Fed. Cas. No. 6047 (C. C.): the protection of seamen, who as a class, are poor, friendless and improvident, from the hazards of illness and abandonment while ill in foreign ports; the inducement to masters and owners to protect the safety and health of seamen while in service; the maintenance of a merchant marine for the commercial service and maritime defense of the nation by inducing men to accept employment in an arduous and perilous service.\"\n\n\n Admiralty courts have been liberal in interpreting this duty \"for the benefit and protection of seamen who are \n\n[369 \nU.S. 527, 532]\n\u00a0\n its wards.\" Id., at 529. We noted in Aguilar v. Standard Oil Co., \n318 \nU.S. 724, 730\n, that the shipowner's liability for maintenance and cure was among \"the most pervasive\" of all and that it was not to be defeated by restrictive distinctions nor \"narrowly confined.\" Id., at 735. When there are ambiguities or doubts, they are resolved in favor of the seaman. Warren v. United States, \n340 \nU.S. 523\n.\n\nMaintenance and cure differs from rights normally classified as contractual. As Mr. Justice Cardozo said in Cortes v. Baltimore Insular Line, supra, 371, the duty to provide maintenance and cure\n4\n \"is imposed by the \n\n[369 \nU.S. 527, 533]\n\u00a0\n law itself as one annexed to the employment. . . . Contractual it is in the sense that it has its source in a relation which is contractual in origin, but given the relation, no agreement is competent to abrogate the incident.\"\n\nIn Johnson v. United States, \n333 \nU.S. 46\n, we held that a seaman who while an outpatient was living on his parents' ranch without cost to himself was not entitled to maintenance payments. There maintenance and cure was wholly provided by others. Here the libellant was on his own for nearly two years and required to work in order to survive. It would be a sorry day for seamen if ship-owners, knowing of the claim for maintenance and cure, could disregard it, force the disabled seaman to work, and then evade part or all of their legal obligation by having it reduced by the amount of the sick man's earnings. This would be a dreadful weapon in the hands of unconscionable employers and a plain inducement, as Chief Judge Sobeloff said below (291 F.2d, at 820), to use the withholding of maintenance and cure as a means of forcing sick seamen to go to work when they should be resting, and to make the seamen themselves pay in whole or in part the amounts owing as maintenance and cure. This result is at war with the liberal attitude that heretofore has obtained and with admiralty's tender regard for seamen. We think the view of the Third Circuit (see Yates v. Dann, 223 F.2d 64, 67) is preferable to that of \n\n[369 \nU.S. 527, 534]\n\u00a0\n the Second Circuit as expressed in Wilson v. United States and Perez v. Suwanee S. S. Co., supra, and to that of the Fourth Circuit in this case.\n\n     Reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the decision of this case.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Claims for damages for the illness and for wages, disallowed below, are not presented here.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The owner was American Waterways Corp., and National Shipping & Trading Corp. was its agent, both being respondents. Respondent Atkinson was the Master.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Whether counsel fees in the amount of 50% of the award are reasonable is a matter on which we express no opinion, as it was not considered by either the District Court or the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] It derives from Article VI of the Laws of Oleron, 30 Fed. Cas. 1171, 1174:\n\n\"If any of the mariners hired by the master of any vessel, go out of the ship without his leave, and get themselves drunk, and thereby there happens contempt to their master, debates, or fighting and quarrelling among themselves, whereby some happen to be wounded: in this case the master shall not be obliged to get them cured, or in any thing to provide for them, but may turn them and their accomplices out of the ship; and if they make words of it, they are bound to pay the master besides: but if by the master's orders and commands any of the ship's company be in the service of the ship, and thereby happen to be wounded or otherwise hurt, in that case they shall be cured and provided for at the costs and charges of the said ship.\"\n\n\n Justice Story, in holding that maintenance and cure was a charge upon the ship, said concerning its history:\n\n\"The same principle is recognised in the ancient laws of Wisbuy (Laws of Wisbuy, art. 19), and in those of Oleron, which have been held in peculiar respect by England, and have been in some measure incorporated into her maritime jurisprudence. The Consolato del Mare does not speak particularly on this point; but from the provisions of this venerable collection of maritime usages in cases nearly allied, there is every reason to infer, that a similar rule then prevailed in the Mediterranean. Consolato del Mare, cc. 124, 125; Boucher, Consulat de la Mer, cc. 127, 128. Molloy evidently adopts it as a general doctrine of maritime law (Molloy, b. 2, c. 3, 5, p. 243); and \n\n[369 \nU.S. 527, 533]\n\u00a0\n two elementary writers of most distinguished reputation have quoted it from the old ordinances without the slightest intimation, that it was not perfectly consonant with the received law and usage of England. Abb. Shipp. p. 2, c. 4, 14; 2 Brown, Adm. 182-184. There is perhaps upon this subject a greater extent and uniformity of maritime authority, than can probably be found in support of most of those principles of commercial law, which have been so successfully engrafted into our jurisprudence within the last century.\" Harden v. Gordon, 11 Fed. Cas. 480, 483.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE STEWART, whom MR. JUSTICE HARLAN joins, dissenting.\n\nI agree with the Court that whether earnings received by a disabled seaman prior to his maximum medical recovery are to be credited against the shipowner's obligation for maintenance is an issue which should not be resolved by a mechanical application of the rules of contract law relating to mitigation of damages. But I cannot agree that in this case the petitioner's earnings should not have been set off against the maintenance owed to him. Nor can I agree with the Court's conclusion that the petitioner is entitled as a matter of law to damages in the amount of the counsel fees expended in his suit for maintenance and cure.\n\nThe duty to provide maintenance and cure is in no real sense contractual, and a suit for failure to provide maintenance or cure can hardly be equated, therefore, with an action for breach of contract. \"The duty . . . is one annexed by law to a relation, and annexed as an inseparable incident without heed to any expression of the will of the contracting parties.\" Cortes v. Baltimore Insular Line, \n287 \nU.S. 367, 372\n. Moreover, if the seaman's accountability for earnings were to be determined solely by reference to damage mitigation principles of contract law, the breach of the shipowner's duty to pay maintenance \n\n[369 \nU.S. 527, 535]\n\u00a0\n would become crucial, since without such a breach on his part no duty to mitigate would arise.\n1\n The assignment of such a dispositive role to the shipowner's failure to perform his obligation would create an unwarranted incentive for refusing to perform it.\n\nThe issue should be decided, rather, with reference to the scope of the duty which the admiralty law imposes. The obligation of a shipowner, irrespective of fault, to provide maintenance and cure to a seaman injured or taken ill while in the ship's service has lost much of its original significance in this era of relaxed unseaworthiness and negligence concepts. But the obligation is of ancient origin,\n2\n first recognized in our law in Harden v. Gordon, 11 Fed. Cas. 480, No. 6,047, and Reed v. Canfield, 20 Fed. Cas. 426, No. 11,641.\n3\n The duty was historically imposed in order to alleviate the physical and financial hardships which otherwise would have beset a sick or injured seaman put ashore, perhaps in a foreign port, without means of support, or hope of obtaining medical care. See Harden v. Gordon, supra, at 483 (Story, J.). The law \n\n[369 \nU.S. 527, 536]\n\u00a0\n of the sea sought to alleviate these hardships, partly for humanitarian reasons, and partly because of the strong national interest in maintaining the morale and physical effectiveness of the merchant marine. Calmar S. S. Corp. v. Taylor, \n303 \nU.S. 525, 528\n.\n\nBut \"[t]he duty does not extend beyond the seaman's need.\" Calmar S. S. Corp. v. Taylor, supra, at 531. It ends absolutely when a point of maximum medical recovery has been reached. Id., at 530; Farrell v. United States, \n336 \nU.S. 511\n. And when the seaman has not incurred expense, the shipowner has no obligation to make payment.\n4\n Thus a seaman hospitalized without expense in a marine hospital is not entitled to maintenance and cure for that period. Calmar S. S. Corp. v. Taylor, supra, at 531. Nor must the shipowner pay maintenance to a seaman who convalesces at the home of his parents without incurring expense or liability for his support. Johnson v. United States, \n333 \nU.S. 46, 50\n.\n\nSince the limited purpose of maintenance is to make the seaman whole, it would logically follow that there should be no such duty for periods when the seaman, though not yet at the point of maximum cure, either does in fact obtain equivalently gainful employment or is able to do so.\n5\n Moreover, no rule which keeps able workers idle can \n\n[369 \nU.S. 527, 537]\n\u00a0\n be deemed a desirable one.\n6\n But there are countervailing policies involved in resolving the issue. The adequate protection of an injured or ill seaman against suffering and want requires more than the assurance that he will \n\n[369 \nU.S. 527, 538]\n\u00a0\n receive payments at some time in the indefinite future. Payments must be promptly made, at a time contemporaneous to the illness or injury. And for this reason the maintenance remedy should be kept simple, uncluttered by fine distinctions which breed litigation, with its attendant delays and expenses. See Farrell v. United States, \n336 \nU.S. 511, 516\n. A shipowner should therefore not be encouraged to withhold maintenance payments in the hope that economic necessity will force the seaman back to work and thereby reduce the shipowner's liability. Moreover, maintenance payments are designed to meet the living expenses of the seaman until maximum cure is reached. The ultimate goal is the recovery of the seaman, and this requires the avoidance of pressures which would force him to obtain employment which hinders his recovery.\n7\n\u00a0\n\nThe need for prompt payment and the desirability of avoiding any rule which might force a seaman back to work to the detriment of his recovery might well require that no compulsion to seek employment be placed on a convalescing seaman, and that a setoff be allowed only with respect to actual, as opposed to potential, earnings. But this question is not presented by the record before us. Similarly, it may well be that a seaman should not be held to account for actual earnings to a shipowner whose dereliction in making payments compels the seaman, as \n\n[369 \nU.S. 527, 539]\n\u00a0\n a matter of economic necessity, to obtain gainful employment. But that question is not presented by the present case either, for there is no showing here that the seaman's return to work was brought on by economic necessity. So far as the record before us indicates, the petitioner's return to work was completely voluntary, and not the result of the shipowner's failure to pay maintenance. Holding the seaman accountable for his earnings in such circumstances carries out the basic purpose of making the seaman whole, and creates neither an undue incentive for withholding payments, nor pressure compelling a premature return to work. I therefore think that the District Court and the Court of Appeals were right in holding that the petitioner was not entitled to maintenance for the period during which he was gainfully employed as a taxicab driver.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nThe second issue presented in this case is whether the petitioner should have been awarded damages in the amount of the counsel fees incurred in bringing his action for maintenance and cure. The Court held in Cortes v. Baltimore Insular Line, supra, at 371, that \"[i]f the failure to give maintenance or cure has caused or aggravated an illness, the seaman has his right of action for the injury thus done to him, the recovery in such circumstances including not only necessary expenses, but also compensation for the hurt.\" But neither the Cortes decision, nor any other that I have been able to find, furnishes a basis for holding as a matter of law that a seaman \n\n[369 \nU.S. 527, 540]\n\u00a0\n forced to bring suit to recover maintenance and cure is also entitled to recover his counsel fees. Cortes dealt with compensatory damages for a physical injury, and the opinion in that case contains nothing to indicate a departure from the well-established rule that counsel fees may not be recovered as compensatory damages. McCormick, Damages, 61.\n\nHowever, if the shipowner's refusal to pay maintenance stemmed from a wanton and intentional disregard of the legal rights of the seaman, the latter would be entitled to exemplary damages in accord with traditional concepts of the law of damages. McCormick, Damages, 79. While the amount so awarded would be in the discretion of the fact finder, and would not necessarily be measured by the amount of counsel fees, indirect compensation for such expenditures might thus be made. See Day v. Woodworth, 13 How. 363, 371. On this issue I would accordingly remand the case to the District Court, so that the circumstances which motivated the respondents' failure to make maintenance payments could be fully canvassed.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] McCormick, Damages, 158-160; Restatement, Contracts, 336 (1); 5 Corbin, Contracts, 1041.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The earliest codifications of the law of the sea provided for medical treatment and wages for mariners injured or falling ill in the ship's service. These early maritime codes are, for the most part, reprinted in 30 Fed. Cas. 1171-1216. See Arts. VI and VII of the Laws of Oleron, 30 Fed. Cas. 1174-1175; Arts.

XI and XII, of the Marine Ordinances of Louis XIV, 30 Fed. Cas. 1209. These provisions may also be found reprinted in 2 Norris, The Law of Seamen, 537. Other provisions rather similar to the present maintenance and cure remedy may be found in the Ordinances of Trani, Art. X, 4 Black Book of the Admiralty (Twiss'ed. 1876) 531; The Tables of Amalphi, Art. 14, 4 Black Book of the Admiralty (Twiss' ed. 1876) 13.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See Gilmore and Black, Admiralty, 253.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See Stankiewicz v.

Supp. 10; Gilmore and Black, Admiralty, 266; 2 Norris, The Law of Seamen, 568.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Similarly, there is generally no duty to make payments for cure if marine hospital service is available, and a seaman seeks hospitalization elsewhere. United States v. Loyola, 161 F.2d 126; United States v. Johnson, 160 F.2d 789; Marshall v. International Mercantile Marine Co., 39 F.2d 551; Zackey v. American Export Lines, Inc., \n\n[369 \nU.S. 527, 537]\n\u00a0\n 152 F. Supp. 772; Benton v. United Towing Co., 120 F. Supp. 638. See Kossick v. United Fruit Co., \n365 \nU.S. 731, 737\n; Calmar S. S. Corp. v. Taylor, \n303 \nU.S. 525, 531\n. In exceptional circumstances, however, where adequate treatment is not available at a marine hospital, expenses incurred for hospitalization elsewhere may be chargeable to the shipowner. Williams v. United States, 133 F. Supp. 319, aff'd, 228 F.2d 129.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Actual earnings during a period prior to maximum cure have been allowed as an offset against maintenance payments in many reported cases, usually without discussion. Rodgers v. United States Lines Co., 189 F.2d 226; Inter Ocean S. S. Co. v. Behrendsen, 128 F.2d 506; Loverich v. Warner Co., 118 F.2d 690; Colon v. Trinidad Corp., 188 F. Supp. 97; Scott v. Lykes Bros. S. S. Co., 152 F. Supp. 104; Benton v. United Towing Co., 120 F. Supp. 638, aff'd, 224 F.2d 558; Steinberg v. American Export Lines, Inc., 81 F. Supp. 362; Burch v. Smith, 77 F. Supp. 6; The Eastern Dawn, 25 F.2d 322. In Wilson v. United States, 229 F.2d 277, the court held, after discussion, that the shipowner should be permitted to offset potential earnings, the seaman having failed to establish that he could not have secured work. The seaman had done some work during the period, and had not sought maintenance for the days he was actually employed. The same court subsequently ruled that under Wilson a recuperating seaman must account for actual earnings. Perez v. Suwanee S. S. Co., 239 F.2d 180.\n\nIn three cases setoff of actual earnings has been denied. In Yates v. Dann, 124 F. Supp. 125, the district judge found that the seaman had been \"in need\" throughout the whole period and should not be \"penalized\" because he returned to work. The case was reversed on other grounds, 223 F.2d 64, the court sustaining the ruling of the District Court on this point with the statement that \"the circumstance that appellee was forced by financial necessity to return to his regular employment is not legally a bar to his recovery.\" 223 F.2d ___, at 67. See also Hanson v. Reiss Steamship Co., 184 F. Supp. 545, 550 (\"Liability for maintenance and cure does not necessarily cease when the injured person obtains gainful occupation where such \n\n[369 \nU.S. 527, 538]\n\u00a0\n employment is compelled or induced by economic necessity.\"); Meirino v. Gulf Oil Corp., 170 F. Supp. 515, 517 (\"The fact that libellant returned to work because of economic necessity while he was in need of medical care and attention does not deprive him of his right to maintenance and cure.\").\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] A seaman whose condition is actually aggravated by reason of the shipowner's dereliction in making maintenance and cure payments may of course seek damages above and beyond the maintenance and cure payments due. Cortes v. Baltimore Insular Line, \n287 \nU.S. 367\n. But the availability of this remedy does not detract from the importance of avoiding the harmful effects of a premature return to work.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] I would, however, remand the case to the District Court for recomputation of its award. Maintenance is a day-by-day concept, and in my view maintenance should be reduced or denied only as to days during which the petitioner was gainfully employed. Instead, the District Court computed the total amount of maintenance due, and then deducted the total amount earned by the petitioner. Compare Perez v. Suwanee S. S. Co., 239 F.2d 180, with Wilson v. United States, 229 F.2d 277. See the full discussion of this aspect of the problem in Note, 37 N. Y. U. L.

Morgan for appellees.\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\nOn January 11, 1962, the three-judge District Court dismissed the complaint alleging violation of the Constitution of the United States by New York State's constitutional and statutory provisions governing apportionment of State Senate and Assembly Districts. 202 F. Supp. 741. The three judges filed separate opinions, no two of which supported the judgment of dismissal on identical grounds. One opinion expressed the view that the action should be dismissed for failure to state a claim, want of \n\n[370 \nU.S. 190, 191]\n\u00a0\n justiciability, and want of equity. 202 F. Supp., at 742. A second opinion expressed the view that since the apportionment was not alleged to effect a discrimination against any particular racial or religious group, but merely a geographical discrimination, jurisdiction should be exercised, but only to dismiss. 202 F. Supp., at 754. A third opinion rested on the ground that the action was not justiciable and expressed no view on the merits. 202 F. Supp., at 755.\n\nOn March 26, 1962, we held in Baker v. Carr, \n369 \nU.S. 186\n, that a justiciable federal constitutional cause of action is stated by a claim of arbitrary impairment of votes by means of invidiously discriminatory geographic classification. Our well-established practice of a remand for consideration in the light of a subsequent decision therefore applies. As in Scholle v. Hare, \n369 \nU.S. 429\n, we believe that the court below should be the first to consider the merits of the federal constitutional claim, free from any doubts as to its justiciability and as to the merits of alleged arbitrary and invidious geographical discrimination. The judgment is vacated and the case is remanded for further consideration in the light of Baker v. Carr, supra.\n\nThe motions to substitute Paul R. Screvane in the place of Abe Stark, and Eugene H. Nickerson in the place of A. Holly Patterson, as parties appellee, are granted.\n\nMR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, dissenting.\n\nFor reasons given in my dissent in Scholle v. Hare, \n369 \nU.S. 429, 430\n, I would affirm, or, failing that, note probable jurisdiction. The complaint in this case squarely tenders the issue as to whether the Equal Protection \n\n[370 \nU.S. 190, 192]\n\u00a0\n Clause of the Federal Constitution is violated by a state apportionment of seats in both its legislative chambers on other than a substantially proportional populational basis. As in Scholle, the lower court considered this claim on the merits and rejected it by holding that the existing distribution of New York State legislators (founded on principles embodied in the State Constitution since 1894) violated no federal constitutional right.\n\nI read the opinions below quite differently than does the Court. The first opinion is that of Judge Levet, which the Court states \"expressed the view that the action should be dismissed for failure to state a claim, want of justiciability, and want of equity.\" After first holding that the Court had jurisdiction over the action, Judge Levet held that \"the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted\" (202 F. Supp., at 753), in that \"[t]here is no authoritative indication that the relative weight accorded individual votes in elections for the state legislature, pursuant to the applicable provisions of the State Constitution, is protected by the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In fact, the contrary seems true.\" Id., at 749. (Emphasis added.) He then proceeded further: \"If the insufficiency of the complaint be not adequate to require dismissal of the complaint, as I believe it is, then the want of equity in the relief sought, or, to view it slightly differently, want of justiciability, clearly demands dismissal.\" Id., at 753.\n\nThe second opinion is that of Judge Ryan, described by the Court as expressing \"the view that since the apportionment was not alleged to effect a discrimination against any particular racial or religious group, but merely a geographical discrimination, jurisdiction should be exercised, but only to dismiss.\" Actually, however, Judge Ryan agreed with Judge Levet, stating at the outset of his separate opinion: \"I concur with Judge Levet and the conclusions \n\n[370 \nU.S. 190, 193]\n\u00a0\n he has reached that this Court has jurisdiction to entertain this suit and that the complaint should be dismissed on its merits.\" Id., at 754. (Emphasis added.) He went on to state: \"The complaint is that the method of apportionment gives rise solely to territorial or purely geographical discrimination which grossly dilutes the vote of urban dwellers. Judicial interference by federal courts with the power of the state to create internal political or geographical boundaries affecting the right of suffrage can not be supported by mere territorial discrimination and nothing more.\" Ibid. While this language, taken in connection with some of that which precedes it (ibid.), might lend itself to the view that Judge Ryan was thinking only in terms of \"justiciability,\" I do not think it is properly so read. Judge Ryan nowhere suggests that he disagrees with Judge Levet's further, and distinctive, ground for dismissal, that the complaint failed to state a federal constitutional claim.\n\nThe third opinion, that of Judge Waterman, did, as the Court says, turn only on \"non-justiciability.\" Judge Waterman declined to \"express any views with reference to whether the present legislative apportionment in the State of New York violates the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution,\" id., at 755, thereby evincing his understanding that his colleagues had also rested decision on a ground which he found unnecessary to reach.\n\nFor me, it thus seems clear that two members of the three-judge court dismissed the action on two alternative grounds: (1) that the matter was not \"justiciable\"; (2) that the complaint stated no cause of action, in that the \"territorial discrimination\" existing under New York's legislative apportionment did not give rise to a claim cognizable under the Fourteenth Amendment. The latter ground was precisely the issue that was avoided in Baker \n\n[370 \nU.S. 190, 194]\n\u00a0\n v. Carr, \n369 \nU.S. 186, 330\n (dissenting opinion); see also id., at 265 (concurring opinion).\n\nIt is unfortunate that the Court, now for the second time, has remanded a case of this kind without first coming to grips itself with this basic constitutional issue, or even indicating any guidelines for decision in the lower courts. Baker v. Carr, supra, of course did neither. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 190, 195]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","208":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWALTON v.

OHIO(1962)\nNo. 200\nArgued: Decided: November 5, 1962\n\n\n\n\n In this case, in which appellant had been convicted in an Ohio court of a state crime, had been sentenced to imprisonment and to pay the costs of prosecution, and had died while his appeal was pending, a motion to substitute the administratrix of his estate is granted and the appeal is dismissed for want of a substantial federal question.\n\n Reported below: 173 Ohio St. 16, 179 N. E. 2d 773.\n\nJack G. Day for appellant.\n\nThomas Spellerberg for appellee.\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM.\n\n\nThis is an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Ohio affirming a judgment of conviction of a criminal offense entered in the Court of Common Pleas, Wyandot County, Ohio.\n\nThe motion to substitute Margie Wetzel, Administratrix of the Estate of Edward J. Wetzel, who died April 26, 1962, as appellant in place of Edward J. Wetzel is granted. The motion of appellee to dismiss the appeal for want of a substantial federal question is granted.\n\nMR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, concurring.\n\nAppellant was convicted of possessing obscene matter with intent to sell it under Ohio Statutes 2905.34. On May 25, 1960, he was \"sentenced to an indeterminate period . . . of not less than one year nor more than seven years and to pay costs of prosecution.\" The sentence \n\n[371 \nU.S. 62, 63]\n\u00a0\n was suspended pending appeal in the Ohio courts. On January 17, 1962, the Supreme Court of Ohio reversed the Court of Appeals, which had reversed appellant's conviction, and on February 2, 1962, ordered the trial court's judgment executed. On the same day a warrant was issued by the trial court authorizing the sheriff to sell enough of appellant's property to satisfy costs of $469.20. This was in accordance with Revised Code 2949.15. On February 27, 1962, the Supreme Court of Ohio suspended sentence \"until further order\" of that court.\n\nAppellant died pending appeal to this Court. His wife, as administratrix, has moved to be substituted as a party.\n\nWhen a convicted and fined federal criminal defendant has died pending review of his case here it has been the practice of this Court to dismiss his case and leave the disposition of his fine to the lower federal courts. See American Tobacco Co. v. United States, \n328 \nU.S. 781, 815\n; United States v. Johnson, \n319 \nU.S. 503, 520\n. But this practice is premised on the ground \"that in the federal domain prosecutions abate . . . on the death of [a] . . . defendant.\" Melrose Distillers v. United States, \n359 \nU.S. 271, 272\n. See Daniel v. United States, 268 F.2d 849. But such is not the case in Ohio. There the appeal will be dismissed as moot (Makley v. State, 128 Ohio St. 571, 192 N. E. 738) but \"the dismissal of an appeal, because of the death of the defendant during the pendency thereof, leaves the judgment as it was before the appeal proceeding was instituted.\" State v. Sholiton, 128 N. E. 2d 666, 667.\n\nIn the Sholiton case the court expressly refused to pass on whether decedent's estate would be liable for costs, because the issue was not presented. It is apparently the rule in Ohio, however, that costs can be collected from a deceased convicted criminal's estate. Clark County v. \n\n[371 \nU.S. 62, 64]\n\u00a0\n Keifer, 16 ONPNS 41. See Ohio Jur. 2d, Costs, 89. Under the present sentence costs seem to be a penalty which is part of the sentence. See Hayes v. Pontius, 2 Ohio Op. 453.\n\nThus, under existing Ohio law it appears that Wetzel's estate will have to pay a $469.20 penalty to the State of Ohio unless this Court reverses his conviction. His administratrix, and probable heir, is rightly concerned about this and is the proper party to substitute.\n\nIt is often stated that \"Where no controversy remains except as to costs, this Court will not pass upon the merits.\" Heitmuller v. Stokes, \n256 \nU.S. 359\n; see Paper-Bag Machine Cases, \n105 \nU.S. 766\n; Elastic Fabrics Co. v. Smith, \n100 \nU.S. 110\n. The genesis of these cases was Canter v. American Ins. Co., 3 Pet. 307, wherein the Court stated:\n\n \"As to the costs and expenses, we perceive no error in the allowance of them in the circuit court. They are not matters positively limited by law, but are allowed in the exercise of a sound discretion of the court. And, besides, it may be added, that no appeal lies from a mere decree respecting costs and expenses.\" Id., at 319.\n\n\n As stated by Chief Justice Taft, writing for the Court in Newton v. Consolidated Gas Co., \n265 \nU.S. 78, 82\n-83:\n\n\"There is no doubt that, as a general rule, an appeal does not lie from a decree solely for costs . . . . [This rule] is easily deducible from the discretion vested in the trial court . . . . But the rule is not absolute and should not be enforced when the trial court assumes the power to assess . . . costs . . . not legally assessable as such.\" (Italics added.)\n\n\n Those were all civil cases and this is a criminal one. Yet the rule of the civil cases should obtain here. \n\n[371 \nU.S. 62, 65]\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn this case the trial court had no discretion concerning the matter of costs. Under Ohio law costs are automatically assessed against a convicted felon. See Ohio Revised Code, 2949.14, 2949.15. The costs were not \"legally assessable\" if the conviction was invalid.\n\nIn Pollard v. United States, \n352 \nU.S. 354\n, the question was raised as to whether or not the case was moot because the petitioner had been released from prison after his petition for certiorari had been granted. Id., p. 358. The issue presented was not that of guilt, but instead one that related only to the propriety or legality of the sentence imposed. We said \"The possibility of consequences collateral to the imposition of sentence is sufficiently substantial to justify our dealing with the merits.\" Ibid. Though we divided on the merits, we were unanimous on that point.\n\nIn the present case there is a strong probability of collateral consequences or \"penalties or disabilities.\" St. Pierre v. United States, \n319 \nU.S. 41, 43\n. If the conviction stands, those collateral consequences or penalties will be the likely reduction of appellant's estate through the collection of costs from it.\n\nTo support her substitution Mrs. Wetzel asserts that the deceased and his family have a substantial interest in clearing his name, that she should be allowed to protect the estate from the penalty that may be collected from it, and that the importance of the issues presented by this appeal justifies review. It is unnecessary to decide in this case whether the decedent's or his family's interest in his good name satisfies the case-or-controversy requirement. Cf. St. Pierre v. United States, \n319 \nU.S. 41, 43\n. For I am convinced that under existing precedent decedent's wife and administratrix has a sufficient interest in protecting his estate from unlawful penalties to be substituted as a party and maintain this appeal. \n\n[371 \nU.S. 62, 66]\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor these reasons I believe the motion to substitute is properly granted. But on the facts of this record I have concluded that a substantial federal question is not presented.\n\nMR. JUSTICE BLACK, while joining this opinion insofar as it deals with the motion to substitute, believes that a substantial federal question is presented and that probable jurisdiction should be noted.\n\nMR. JUSTICE CLARK, with whom MR. JUSTICE HARLAN and MR. JUSTICE STEWART join, dissents, believing that the appeal abated upon the death of the appellant, Edward J. Wetzel. Menken v. Atlanta, \n131 \nU.S. 405\n (1889). This Court has held numerous times that the existence of a judgment taxing costs in such cases cannot alone prevent dismissal here. Heitmuller v. Stokes, \n256 \nU.S. 359, 362\n (1921); Wingert v. First National Bank, \n223 \nU.S. 670\n (1912); Paper-Bag Machine Co. v. Nixon, \n105 \nU.S. 766, 772\n (1881); Elastic Fabrics Co. v. Smith, \n100 \nU.S. 110\n (1879). Although such judgments may confer appellate jurisdiction to inquire into the lower court's power to tax costs, Newton v. Consolidated Gas Co., \n265 \nU.S. 78, 82\n-83 (1924); Citizens' Bank v. Cannon, \n164 \nU.S. 319, 323\n-324 (1896); cf. Intertype Corp. v. Clark-Congress Corp., 249 F.2d 626, 628 (1957), the existence of such a judgment has been held not to confer jurisdiction to inquire into the merits of the original controversy, Smith v. Indiana, \n191 \nU.S. 138, 149\n (1903); Davis v. Preston, \n280 \nU.S. 406, 408\n (1930). Accordingly, the motion to substitute the administratrix as a party should be denied, the appeal dismissed and the case remanded to the Supreme Court of Ohio for such proceedings as may be appropriate under state law. \n\n[371 \nU.S. 62, 67]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n","215":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWHITUS v.

GEORGIA(1962)\nNo. 369\nArgued: March 29, 1962Decided: June 25, 1962\n\n\n\n\n In the midst of a local political campaign, a County Judge, in the presence of representatives of news media assembled at the Judge's request, issued a charge to a grand jury giving it special instructions to investigate rumors and accusations of alleged bloc voting by Negroes and the rumored use of money by political candidates to obtain their votes. The next day, while the grand jury was in session, petitioner, an elected Sheriff who was a candidate for reelection, issued from his office in the same building a press statement criticizing the Judge's action and urging citizens to take notice when their judges threatened political intimidation and persecution of voters under the guise of law enforcement. Petitioner was cited in the County Court for contempt, on the ground that his statement was calculated to be contemptuous of the Court and to obstruct the grand jury in its investigation and that it constituted a \"clear, present and imminent danger\" to the administration of justice. Petitioner issued a further statement repeating substantially his earlier charges and asserting that his defense would be that he had spoken the truth. The contempt citation was then amended by the addition of another count based on this latter statement and a charge that it constituted a clear and present danger to the grand jury investigation and to the disposition of the contempt citation against him. Without making any findings or giving any reasons for its conclusion that his conduct actually obstructed the grand jury or contempt proceedings, the trial court adjudged petitioner guilty of contempt and sentenced him to fine and imprisonment.

CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\nWe granted certiorari to consider the scope of the constitutional protection to be enjoyed by persons when the publication of their thoughts and opinions is alleged to be in conflict with the fair administration of justice in state courts. The petitioner, an elected sheriff in Bibb County, Georgia, contends that the Georgia courts, in holding him in contempt of court for expressing his personal ideas on a matter that was presently before the grand jury for its consideration, have abridged his liberty of free speech as protected by the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.\n\nOn June 6, 1960, a judge of the Bibb Superior Court issued a charge to a regularly impaneled grand jury, giving it special instructions to conduct an investigation into a political situation which had allegedly arisen in the county. The jury was advised that there appeared to be \"an inane and inexplicable pattern of Negro bloc voting\" in Bibb County, and that \"rumors and accusations\" had been made which indicated candidates for public office had paid large sums of money in an effort to gain favor and to obtain the Negro vote. The charge explained that certain Negro leaders, after having met and endorsed a candidate, had switched their support to an opposing candidate who put up a large sum of money, and that this \"create[d] an unhealthy, dangerous, and unlawful situation [which] tend[ed] to corrupt public office holders and some candidates for public office.\" The charge continued by indicating the violations of law which would be involved should the grand jury find the charges \n\n[370 \nU.S. 375, 377]\n\u00a0\n to be founded in truth.\n1\n In addition, certain questions were posed to the jury which it was to investigate in inquiring into the charges of election law violations.\n2\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 375, 378]\n\u00a0\n The instructions were given in the midst of a local political campaign and the judge, in order to publicize the investigation, requested reporters for all local news media \n\n[370 \nU.S. 375, 379]\n\u00a0\n to be present in the courtroom when the charge was delivered.\n\nThe following day, while the grand jury was in session investigating the matters set forth in the instructions delivered by the court, the petitioner issued to the local press a written statement in which he criticized the judges' action and in which he urged the citizenry to take notice when their highest judicial officers threatened political intimidation and persecution of voters in the county under the guise of law enforcement. This news release, which was published and disseminated to the general public, stated:\n\n \"Whatever the Judges' intention, the action . . . ordering [the grand jury] . . . to investigate `negro block voting' will be considered one of the most deplorable examples of race agitation to come out of Middle Georgia in recent years.\n\n\n \"At a time when all thinking people want to preserve the good will and cooperation between the races in Bibb County, this action appears either as a crude attempt at judicial intimidation of negro voters and leaders, or, at best, as agitation for a `negro vote' issue in local politics.\n\n\n \"No one would question the duty of a Grand Jury to investigate any and all election law violations. However, simple justice would demand that the Judge not single out the negro people for particular investigation. . . .\n\n\n .  .   .   .  .\n\n\n \"Negro people will find little difference in principle between attempted intimidation of their people by judicial summons and inquiry and attempted intimidation by physical demonstration such as used by the K. K. K. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 375, 380]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \"It is hoped that the present Grand Jury will not let its high office be a party to any political attempt to intimidate the negro people in this community.\n\n\n \"It seems incredible that all three of our Superior Court Judges, who themselves hold high political office, are so politically nieve [naive] as to actually believe that the negro voters in Bibb County sell their votes in any fashion, either to candidates for office or to some negro leaders.\n\n\n \"If anyone in the community [should] be free of racial prejudice, it should be our Judges. It is shocking to find a Judge charging a Grand Jury in the style and language of a race baiting candidate for political office.\n\n\n .  .  .  .  .\n\n\n \"However politically popular the judges action may be at this time, they are employing a practice far more dangerous to free elections than anything they want investigated.\n\n\n    \"James I. Wood.\"\n\n\n The following day, the petitioner delivered to the bailiff of the court, stationed at the entrance to the grand jury room, \"An Open Letter to the Bibb County Grand Jury,\" which was made available to the grand jury at petitioner's request. This letter, implying that the court's charge was false, asserted that in the petitioner's opinion, the Bibb County Democratic Executive Committee was the organization responsible for corruption in the purchasing of votes, and that the grand jury would be well-advised also to investigate that organization.\n\nA month later, on July 7, 1960, the petitioner was cited in two counts of contempt based on the above statements. The citation charged that the language used by the petitioner was designed and calculated to be contemptuous of the court, to ridicule the investigation ordered by the charge, and \"to hamper, hinder, interfere with and \n\n[370 \nU.S. 375, 381]\n\u00a0\n obstruct\" the grand jury in its investigation. It also alleged that the news release was issued from the Bibb County Sheriff's Office, located in the courthouse in which the grand jury had been charged and where it was deliberating, and that the language imputed lack of judicial integrity to the three judges of the court responsible for the charge. An amendment to the citation alleged that the statements \"in and of [themselves] created . . . a clear, present and imminent danger to the investigation being conducted . . . and . . . to the proper administration of justice in Bibb Superior Court.\"\n\nThe next day the petitioner issued a further press release in which he repeated substantially the charges he had made in the release on June 7, and in which he asserted that his defense to the contempt citation would be that he had spoken the truth. The contempt citation was thereupon amended by including a third count based on this latter statement. The third count contained the same allegations as the other counts and, in addition, charged that the petitioner's action presented a clear and present danger to the handling of the contempt citation against the petitioner.\n\nAt a hearing before the trial judge,\n3\n certain facts were stipulated: that the petitioner's statements were made while the grand jury was in session investigating matters suggested in the charge by the court; that the grand jury had before it the voting tabulations and other documents, including endorsements by certain political groups relating to primaries and elections in which the petitioner participated as a candidate and as an active supporter for other candidates; and that the members of the grand jury and the judges themselves had seen and read the \n\n[370 \nU.S. 375, 382]\n\u00a0\n press releases issued by the petitioner. In addition, it was stipulated that the petitioner's sworn response be admitted as evidence. The allegations in this response, which must be considered as true in the absence of contrary evidence and in the absence of findings of fact by the trial judge, included the verification that the statements were made by petitioner in his capacity as a private citizen and not as sheriff of the county; that petitioner was directly and personally interested in the outcome of the current primary election not only as a private citizen but also as an announced candidate for public office in the general election to be held the following November, and in which election the petitioner would be running against the contestant who prevailed in the democratic primary; that he believed the language employed in the charge was of such a nature that it tended to create or emphasize issues likely to have a drastic impact upon the outcome of the primary; that his purpose in issuing the statements was simply to inform the public of what he sincerely believed to be the other side of the issue created by the charge; and that the statements were not intended to be contemptuous of the court or to hinder the investigation. The petitioner also asserted that he adopted the same method of distributing his views to the general public as did the court in disseminating the grand jury charge. No witnesses were presented at the hearing and no evidence was introduced to show that the publications resulted in any actual interference or obstruction of the court or the work of the grand jury. The gravamen of the contempt citation, and of the State's case against the petitioner, was that the mere publishing of the news release and defense statement constituted a contempt of court, and in and of itself was a clear and present danger to the administration of justice.\n\nThe trial court, without making any findings and without giving any reasons, adjudged petitioner guilty on all \n\n[370 \nU.S. 375, 383]\n\u00a0\n counts and imposed concurrent sentences of 20 days and separate fines of $200 on each. On writ of error to the Court of Appeals the convictions on counts one and three were affirmed and the conviction on count two, based on the open letter to the grand jury, was reversed. Wood v. Georgia, 103 Ga. App. 305, 119 S. E. 2d 261. After the Georgia Supreme Court, without opinion, declined to review the convictions on the first and third counts, the petitioner sought a writ of certiorari to this Court which we granted. \n368 \nU.S. 894\n.\n\nWe start with the premise that the right of courts to conduct their business in an untrammeled way lies at the foundation of our system of government and that courts necessarily must possess the means of punishing for contempt when conduct tends directly to prevent the discharge of their functions. While courts have continuously had the authority and power to maintain order in their courtrooms and to assure litigants a fair trial, the exercise of that bare contempt power is not what is questioned in this case. Here it is asserted that the exercise of the contempt power, to commit a person to jail for an utterance out of the presence of the court, has abridged the accused's liberty of free expression. In this situation the burden upon this Court is to define the limitations upon the contempt power according to the terms of the Federal Constitution.\n\nIn Bridges v. California, \n314 \nU.S. 252\n, this Court for the first time had occasion to review a State's exercise of the contempt power utilized to punish the publisher of an out-of-court statement. The accused contended that the exercise abridged his right of free speech guaranteed against state infringement by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n4\n To determine the scope of this constitutional \n\n[370 \nU.S. 375, 384]\n\u00a0\n protection, the Court reviewed the history of the contempt power, both in England and in this country. It held that \"the only conclusion supported by [that] history is that the unqualified prohibitions laid down by the framers were intended to give to liberty of the press, as to the other liberties, the broadest scope that could be countenanced in an orderly society.\" Id., at 265.\n5\n Thus clarifying the exercise of this judicial power in the context of the protections assured by the First Amendment, the Court held that out-of-court publications were to be governed by the clear and present danger standard, described as \"a working principle that the substantive evil must be extremely serious and the degree of imminence extremely high before utterances can be punished.\" Id., at 263.\n6\n Subsequently, in Pennekamp v. Florida, \n328 \nU.S. 331\n, after noting that \"[f]ree discussion of the problems of society is a cardinal principle of Americanism - a principle which all are zealous to preserve\" (id., at 346), the Court reaffirmed its belief that the \"essential right of the courts to be free of intimidation and coercion . . . [is] consonant with a recognition that freedom of the press must \n\n[370 \nU.S. 375, 385]\n\u00a0\n be allowed in the broadest scope compatible with the supremacy of order.\" Id., at 334.\n7\n The Court's last occasion to consider the application of the clear and present danger principle to a case of the type under review was in Craig v. Harney, \n331 \nU.S. 367\n. There the Court held that to warrant a sanction \"[t]he fires which [the expression] kindles must constitute an imminent, not merely a likely, threat to the administration of justice. The danger must not be remote or even probable; it must immediately imperil.\" Id., at 376.\n8\n\u00a0\n\nIt is with these principles in mind that we consider the case before us. Initially, however, it should be noted that the Georgia courts have determined that the power to punish for contempt of court is inherent in its state judiciary\n9\n and the Court of Appeals thus ignored the express limitations imposed by the Georgia Legislature in punishing out-of-court statements.\n10\n This holding thus \n\n[370 \nU.S. 375, 386]\n\u00a0\n deprives the judgment of coming to this Court \"encased in the armor wrought by prior legislative deliberation,\" Bridges v. California, supra, at 261, and it is upon this basis that we proceed.\n\nThis case differs from Bridges and Pennekamp, first, in that the court below has upheld petitioner's conviction on the basis that his conduct presented a clear and present danger to the proceedings of the court and grand jury, a standard this Court has held to warrant punishment for alleged contemptuous conduct. But state courts may not preclude us from our responsibility to examine \"the evidence to see whether it furnishes a rational basis for the characterization put on it\" (In re Sawyer, \n360 \nU.S. 622, 628\n) by the enunciation of a constitutionally acceptable standard in describing the effect of the conduct. The ultimate responsibility to define the limits of state power regarding freedom of speech and expression rests with this Court, Pennekamp v. Florida, supra, at 335; see Chambers v. Florida, \n309 \nU.S. 227, 228\n-229; Fiske v. Kansas, \n274 \nU.S. 380, 385\n-386; and when it is claimed that such liberties have been abridged, we cannot allow a presumption of validity of the exercise of state power to interfere with our close examination of the substantive claim presented.\n11\n\u00a0\n\nDespite its conclusion that the petitioner's conduct created a serious evil to the fair administration of justice, \n\n[370 \nU.S. 375, 387]\n\u00a0\n the Court of Appeals did not cite or discuss the Bridges, Pennekamp or Harney cases, nor did it display an awareness of the standards enunciated in those cases to support a finding of clear and present danger.\n12\n It simply adopted as conclusions of law the allegations made in the contempt citation. The court did not indicate in any manner how the publications interfered with the grand jury's investigation, or with the administration of justice. Unlike those cases in which elaborate findings have been made to support such a conclusion,\n13\n this record is barren of such findings. The prosecution called no witnesses to show that the functioning of the jury was in any way disturbed; no showing was made that the members of the grand jury, upon reading the petitioner's comments in the newspapers, felt unable or unwilling to complete their assigned task because petitioner \"interfered\" with its completion.\n14\n There is nothing in the record to indicate that the investigation was not ultimately successful or, if it was not, that the petitioner's conduct was responsible for its failure. And to the extent that the conviction on the third count was upheld because petitioner's last statement presented a clear and present danger to the contempt hearing, it is indeed novel that under the circumstances of this case the petitioner might be responsible for a substantial interference \n\n[370 \nU.S. 375, 388]\n\u00a0\n with his contempt hearing because he had made public his defense to the charges made against him. What interference to petitioner's hearing or what harm this assertion might inflict on the administration of justice is not stated in the opinion. Nor is there any evidence of either in the record.\n15\n\u00a0\n\nThus we have simply been told, as a matter of law without factual support, that if a State is unable to punish persons for expressing their views on matters of great public importance when those matters are being considered in an investigation by the grand jury, a clear and present danger to the administration of justice will be created. We find no such danger in the record before us. The type of \"danger\" evidenced by the record is precisely one of the types of activity envisioned by the Founders in presenting the First Amendment for ratification. \"Those who won our independence had confidence in the power of free and fearless reasoning and communication of ideas to discover and spread political . . . truth.\" Thornhill v. Alabama, \n310 \nU.S. 88, 95\n. In Thornhill the Court also reiterated the thinking of the Founders when it said that a broad conception of the First Amendment is necessary\n\n\"to supply the public need for information and education with respect to the significant issues of the times. [Footnote omitted.] . . . Freedom of discussion, if it would fulfill its historic function in this nation, must embrace all issues about which information is needed or appropriate to enable the members of society to cope with the exigencies of their period.\" Id., at 102.\n16\n\u00a0\n\n[370 \nU.S. 375, 389]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Men are entitled to speak as they please on matters vital to them; errors in judgment or unsubstantiated opinions may be exposed, of course, but not through punishment for contempt for the expression. Under our system of government, counterargument and education are the weapons available to expose these matters, not abridgment of the rights of free speech and assembly. Cf. Mr. Justice Brandeis, concurring in Whitney v. California, \n274 \nU.S. 357, 378\n. Hence, in the absence of some other showing of a substantive evil actually designed to impede the course of justice in justification of the exercise of the contempt power to silence the petitioner, his utterances are entitled to be protected.\n\nThe respondent attempts to distinguish this case from Bridges by offering, as support for the Georgia court's conclusion that the petitioner's conduct presented a clear and present danger to the administration of justice, the fact that here there was an alleged interference with a grand jury and not an attempt to influence or coerce a judge. In the circumstances of this case, we find this argument unpersuasive.\n\nFirst, it is important to emphasize that this case does not represent a situation where an individual is on trial; there was no \"judicial proceeding pending\" in the sense that prejudice might result to one litigant or the other by ill-considered misconduct aimed at influencing the outcome of a trial or a grand jury proceeding. Compare Smith v. Texas, \n311 \nU.S. 128\n; Chambers v. Florida, \n309 \nU.S. 227\n; Pierre v. Louisiana, \n306 \nU.S. 354\n; Tumey v. Ohio, \n273 \nU.S. 510\n; and Moore v. Dempsey, \n261 \nU.S. 86\n. Moreover, we need not pause here to consider the variant factors that would be present in a case involving a petit jury. Neither Bridges, Pennekamp nor Harney involved a trial by jury. In Bridges it was noted that \"trials are not like elections, to be won through the use of the meeting-hall, the radio, and the newspaper\" (314 \n\n[370 \nU.S. 375, 390]\n\u00a0\n U.S. at 271), and of course the limitations on free speech assume a different proportion when expression is directed toward a trial as compared to a grand jury investigation. Rather, the grand jury here was conducting a general investigation into a matter touching each member of the community.\n\nHistorically, this body has been regarded as a primary security to the innocent against hasty, malicious and oppressive persecution; it serves the invaluable function in our society of standing between the accuser and the accused, whether the latter be an individual, minority group, or other, to determine whether a charge is founded upon reason or was dictated by an intimidating power or by malice and personal ill will.\n17\n Particularly in matters of local political corruption and investigations is it important that freedom of communication be kept open and that the real issues not become obscured to the grand jury. It cannot effectively operate in a vacuum. It has been said that the \"ancestors of our `grand jurors' are from the first neither exactly accusers, nor exactly witnesses; they are to give voice to common repute.\" 2 Pollock and Maitland, History of the English Law (2d ed. 1909), 642. The necessity to society of an independent and informed grand jury becomes readily apparent in the context of the present case. For here a panel of judges, themselves elected officers and charged under state law with the responsibility of instructing a grand jury to investigate political corruption, have exercised the contempt power to hold in contempt another elected representative of the people for publishing views honestly held and contrary to those contained in the charge. And, an \n\n[370 \nU.S. 375, 391]\n\u00a0\n effort by the petitioner to prove the truth of his allegations was rejected, the court holding irrelevant the truth or falsity of the facts and opinions expressed in the publications. 103 Ga. App. 305, 321, 119 S. E. 2d 261, 273. If the petitioner could be silenced in this manner, the problem to the people in the State of Georgia and indeed in all the States becomes evident.\n\nThe administration of the law is not the problem of the judge or prosecuting attorney alone, but necessitates the active cooperation of an enlightened public. Nothing is to be gained by an attitude on the part of the citizenry of civic irresponsibility and apathy in voicing their sentiments on community problems. The petitioner's attack on the charge to the grand jury would have been likely to have an impeding influence on the outcome of the investigation only if the charge was so manifestly unjust that it could not stand inspection.\n18\n In this sense discussion serves as a corrective force to political, economic and other influences which are inevitably present in matters of grave importance. The charge given to the jury indicated that the motivation for it was founded on rumor, but that the situation had existed for several years. Yet the charge was directed primarily against one group in the community and was given at the height of the highly important Democratic primary, in which, because of their elected positions, both the judges and the petitioner were interested personally and apart from their official status. The First Amendment envisions that persons be given the opportunity to inform the community of both sides of \n\n[370 \nU.S. 375, 392]\n\u00a0\n the issue under such circumstances. That this privilege should not lightly be curtailed is ably expressed in a passage from Judge Cooley's 2 Constitutional Limitations (8th ed. 1927) 885, where he stated that the purpose of the First Amendment includes the need:\n\n \". . . to protect parties in the free publication of matters of public concern, to secure their right to a free discussion of public events and public measures, and to enable every citizen at any time to bring the government and any person in authority to the bar of public opinion by any just criticism upon their conduct in the exercise of the authority which the people have conferred upon them.\"\n\n\n Moreover, it is difficult to imagine how the voting problem may be alleviated by an abridgment of talk and comment regarding its solution. This problem is important not only to an individual or some isolated group or to individual litigants in a particular lawsuit, but affects the entire Nation. When the grand jury is performing its investigatory function into a general problem area, without specific regard to indicting a particular individual, society's interest is best served by a thorough and extensive investigation, and a greater degree of disinterestedness and impartiality is assured by allowing free expression of contrary opinion. Consistent suppression of discussion likely to affect pending investigations would mean that some continuing public grievances could never be discussed at all, or at least not at the moment when public discussion is most needed. The conviction here produces its \"restrictive results at the precise time when public interest in the matters discussed would naturally be at its height,\" and \"[n]o suggestion can be found in the Constitution that the freedom there guaranteed for speech and the press bears an inverse ratio to the timeliness and importance of the ideas seeking expression.\" \n\n[370 \nU.S. 375, 393]\n\u00a0\n Bridges v. California, supra, at 268, 269. Thus, in the absence of any showing of an actual interference with the undertakings of the grand jury, this record lacks persuasion in illustrating the serious degree of harm to the administration of law necessary to justify exercise of the contempt power. Compare Craig v. Harney, \n331 \nU.S. 367, 376\n, 378; Pennekamp v. Florida, \n328 \nU.S. 331, 349\n-350.\n\nFinally, we are told by the respondent that, because the petitioner is sheriff of Bibb County and thereby owes a special duty and responsibility to the court and its judges, his right to freedom of expression must be more severely curtailed than that of an average citizen. Under the circumstances of this case, this argument must be rejected.\n\nFirst, although we do not rely on the point exclusively, we noted at the outset of this opinion that there was no finding by the trial court that the petitioner issued the statements in his capacity as sheriff; in fact, the only evidence in the record on this point is the petitioner's allegation in his response, accepted as evidence by the trial court and uncontroverted by the respondent, that the statements were distributed by petitioner as a private citizen. Nowhere in the record, including the contempt citation as twice amended, can we find one word indicating that the prosecution relied on the fact that petitioner was sheriff to show a more substantial likelihood that his conduct would disrupt the administration of justice.\n19\n The opinion \n\n[370 \nU.S. 375, 394]\n\u00a0\n of the Court of Appeals does not articulate any specific reliance on this fact,\n20\n and responses to our inquiries on this subject during oral argument were not illuminating. Moreover, the two counts before us were based on out-of-court publications which the petitioner signed without reference to his official capacity. Only in the letter sent directly to the grand jury room did the petitioner indicate in the statement that he was sheriff, and the Court of Appeals held that this statement did not present a clear and present danger to the administration of the law. In the light of this finding it is difficult to understand how the fact that the petitioner was sheriff of the county can be considered significant as to his news releases.\n\nHowever, assuming that the Court of Appeals did consider to be significant the fact that petitioner was a sheriff, we do not believe this fact provides any basis for curtailing his right of free speech. There is no evidence that the publications interfered with the performance of his duties as sheriff or with his duties, if any he had, in connection with the grand jury's investigation. We are not dealing with a situation where a sheriff refuses to issue summonses or to maintain order in the court building; nor, so far as the record shows, did the petitioner do any act which might present a substantive harm to the jury's solution of the problem placed before it. We are dealing here only with public expression.\n\nThe petitioner was an elected official and had the right to enter the field of political controversy, particularly \n\n[370 \nU.S. 375, 395]\n\u00a0\n where his political life was at stake.\n21\n Cf. In re Sawyer, \n360 \nU.S. 622\n. The role that elected officials play in our society makes it all the more imperative that they be allowed freely to express themselves on matters of current public importance.\n\nOur examination of the content of petitioner's statements and the circumstances under which they were published leads us to conclude that they did not present a danger to the administration of justice that should vitiate his freedom to express his opinions in the manner chosen.\n\n    The judgment is reversed.\n\n\nMR. \nJUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the decision of this case.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\nFootnotes\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Georgia Legislature has provided that it shall be a misdemeanor for any person to \"[b]uy or sell, or offer to buy or sell, a vote, or [to] . . . be in any way concerned in buying or selling, or contribute money or any other thing of value for the purpose of buying a vote at any election . . . .\" Ga. Code Ann., 34-9907. See also Ga. Code Ann., 34-1907, included in the court's charge.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] More fully, the charge, in relevant part, contained the following:\n\n\"GENTLEMEN OF THE GRAND JURY:\n\n\n\"The special instructions now about to be given to you were determined upon and formulated by all of the Judges of this Court en banc after joint consultations and are fully sanctioned by all the Judges.\n\n\n .   .  .   .  .\n\n\"A situation has arisen in Bibb County over the last few years which this Court feels should be thoroughly and completely investigated by the Grand Jury. . . .\n\n\n\"In election after election where no racial issues are involved, and where there are no other issues involved which could possibly cause any particular group to be honestly concerned about supporting or opposing any particular candidate, we find what appears an inane and inexpicable pattern of Negro bloc voting.\n\n\n\"Now there is an answer to the existing situation which should be brought to light so that people of this community may understand what is going on in some of our elections, and do something about it. The people are entitled to know how one candidate or another is able to gather to himself thousands of Negro votes in bloc where there is no apparent reason for it.\n\n.  .   .  .   .\n\n\n\n\"This Grand Jury is hereby instructed by the Court to investigate and examine into the facts of every election of every kind in this County for the past several years in which bloc voting is apparent. Although there are many intelligent and independent voters among the colored people who deplore this situation, it is nevertheless obvious that about 80% to 85% of the Negro voters engage in bloc voting. . . .\n\n.  .   .  .  .\n\n\n\n\". . . [T]he matter you are directed to investigate is the persistent rumors and accusations concerning the methods used in the solicitation \n\n[370 \nU.S. 375, 378]\n\u00a0\n of the Negro vote and the alleged bartering of the bloc vote. There are accusations that candidates for public office have paid large sums of money to certain leaders of the Negro in an effort to gain their favor and get the Negro vote. There are accusations that candidates and their supporters have paid, and these leaders of the Negroes have accepted, money for the purpose of influencing the Negro people to bloc vote for certain candidates. . . .\n\n\n .   .   .   .  .\n\n\"These rumors being circulated, and about which you have been charged, are either true or false and it is the duty of this Grand Jury to determine wherein the truth lies.\n\n\n\"Some questions which this Jury should have answered in your investigation of elections are: Was the Negro vote delivered in bloc to any candidate or candidates? If so, who delivered it and how was it done? What contact did the candidates or their supporters have with the Negro group or its leaders? What money was involved, if any? How was the money used? What workers were employed? What promises did the candidate make, if any, in order to obtain the bloc vote?\n\n.  .  .  .   .\n\n\n\n\"Now, gentlemen, it is your duty to develop the facts of this situation and if there is sufficient evidence of unlawful acts, then all parties participating, white and colored, candidates or non-candidates, should be indicted by this Grand Jury so that the guilty parties, if there are any, may be brought to trial.\n\n\n\"Furthermore, it is your duty to bring to light those practices which, while not technically in violation of any law, are yet so immoral or corrupt as to be destructive of the purposes of our system of elections. It is further your right and duty to determine what additional laws, or amendments to existing laws, are needed to adequately deal with the situation with which we are faced and to recommend enactment thereof by the Legislature.\n\n\n\"The enormity of the task assigned you by these instructions is recognized, but surely all good citizens, both public and private, who stand for good government and an honest elective system will be willing to come before this Grand Jury and disclose every fact concerning the matters about which you are being instructed.\"\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The charge that was delivered to the grand jury was prepared by the three judges of the Bibb County Superior Court, and was delivered by one of them. Another one of the three presided at petitioner's contempt hearing.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Thornhill v. Alabama, \n310 \nU.S. 88, 95\n; Schneider v. State, \n308 \nU.S. 147, 160\n; De Jonge v.

New York, \n268 \nU.S. 652, 666\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Specifically, the Court, after a thorough review of the history behind both the exercise of the contempt power and the adoption of the First Amendment, rejected the idea that the interests were to be accommodated by applying the common law of England at the time the Constitution was adopted. Bridges v. California, \n314 \nU.S. 252, 263\n-268.

[and that it does] no more than recognize a minimum compulsion of the Bill of Rights.\" Bridges v. California, supra, at 263.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] In Pennekamp the Court concluded that \"the danger under . . .

When that door is closed, it closes all doors behind it.\" \n328 \nU.S., at 350\n.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 8\n] In none of these cases, as is also true of the one presently under review, did the Court find it necessary to determine the full power of the State to protect the administration of justice by use of the contempt power.

E. 560.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 10\n] The state legislature has enacted a statute designed to limit the courts in that State in the exercise of the contempt power. Ga. Code Ann., 24-105, provides:\n\n\"Powers of courts to punish for contempt. - The powers of the several courts to issue attachments and inflict summary punishment for contempt of court shall extend only to cases of misbehavior of any person or persons in the presence of said courts or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice, the misbehavior of any of the officers of said courts in their official transactions, and the disobedience or resistance by any officer of said courts, party, juror, \n\n[370 \nU.S. 375, 386]\n\u00a0\n witness, or other person or persons to any lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command of the said courts . . . .\"\n\n\n Compare the legislative determination made by the State of California discussed briefly in Bridges v.

Wood, Sheriff of Bibb County, is a full-time employee of the County of Bibb and is paid a salary for his services as such officer. Respondent is an officer of the Bibb Superior Court.\"\n\n\n There is no allegation that because he was sheriff his conduct was more likely to cause a substantive evil than would the same conduct by a private citizen.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 20\n] The decision of the Court of Appeals, affirming the overruling of petitioner's demurrer to the effect that the allegation quoted in note 19 was irrelevant and should be stricken, is of no weight in light of the trial court's failure to make a finding of fact either that the statements were issued in petitioner's official capacity or that the fact he was sheriff was relevant.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 21\n] Petitioner was not a civil servant, but an elected official, and hence this is not a case like United Public Workers v. Mitchell, \n330 \nU.S. 75\n, in which this Court held that Congress has the power to circumscribe the political activities of federal employees in the career public service.\n\nMR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE CLARK joins, dissenting.\n\nWhether or not the clear and present danger doctrine of Bridges v. California, \n314 \nU.S. 252, 260\n-263, 271, should be deemed to limit a state or federal court's use of the contempt power when employed against a member of its official entourage who has scandalized the conduct of the court in relation to and during the course of a pending judicial proceeding is a question which I need not reach in this case. For even under the most expansive view of Bridges and its offshoots the contempt judgment against this sheriff should be upheld. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 375, 396]\n\u00a0\n\n\nOver fifty years ago Mr. Justice Holmes wrote: \"The theory of our [judicial] system is that the conclusions to be reached in a case will be induced only by evidence and argument in open court, and not by any outside influence, whether of private talk or public print.\" Patterson v. Colorado, \n205 \nU.S. 454, 462\n. For this reason this Court has repeatedly held that a criminal conviction based on the verdict of jurors influenced by extrajudicial statements of the case cannot stand consistently with due process of law. E. g., Irvin v. Dowd, \n366 \nU.S. 717\n. But invalidation of a proceeding so infected is not the only remedy available to combat interference with judicial processes; so to hold would confer a right to frustrate those processes with impunity. And so it is that this Court has uniformly upheld the power of courts to protect themselves by citations for contempt from improper influence upon proceedings before them. Sustaining this power against a claim of freedom of speech in Patterson v. Colorado, supra, \n205 \nU.S., at 463\n, Mr. Justice Holmes wrote: \"When a case is finished, courts are subject to the same criticism as other people, but the propriety and necessity of preventing interference with the course of justice by premature statement, argument or intimidation hardly can be denied.\" The right of free speech, strong though it be, is not absolute; when the right to speak conflicts with the right to an impartial judicial proceeding, an accommodation must be made to preserve the essence of both. Thus in Bridges v. California, supra, \n314 \nU.S., at 271\n, the Court said:\n\n\"The very word `trial' connotes decisions on the evidence and arguments properly advanced in open court. Legal trials are not like elections, to be won through the use of the meeting-hall, the radio, and the newspaper. . . . We must therefore turn to the particular utterances here in question and the circumstances of their publication to determine to \n\n[370 \nU.S. 375, 397]\n\u00a0\n what extent the substantive evil of unfair administration of justice was a likely consequence, and whether the degree of likelihood was sufficient to justify summary punishment.\"\n\n\n And again in Pennekamp v. Florida, \n328 \nU.S. 331, 347\n: \"Courts must have power to protect the interests of prisoners and litigants before them from unseemly efforts to pervert judicial action.\" See Craig v. Harney, \n331 \nU.S. 367, 372\n-373.\n\nThe Court professes to recognize these principles. It holds nevertheless that the contempt sanction cannot be applied in this case, arguing both that \"the limitations on free speech assume a different proportion when expression is directed toward a trial as compared to a grand jury investigation,\" ante, p. 390, and that the findings of clear and present danger are unsupported by the record. I cannot agree with either proposition.\n\n\nI.\n\n\n\nThe grand jury is an integral part of the judicial process, Levine v. United States, \n362 \nU.S. 610, 617\n; Gates v. State, 73 Ga. App. 824, 826, 38 S. E. 2d 311, 312; contempt sanctions are available to protect its functions. Levine v. United States, supra. Congress has recognized the need for safeguarding the deliberations of federal grand juries by making it a crime to attempt to influence a federal grand juror by extrajudicial communication.\n1\n Even \n\n[370 \nU.S. 375, 398]\n\u00a0\n assuming that a State may constitutionally permit a grand jury, unlike a petit jury, to be influenced by extrajudicial statements, a question, explicitly left open in Beck v. Washington, \n369 \nU.S. 541, 546\n, it certainly does not compel them to that course.\n\nThe Court does not dispute this. But, says the Court, no individual is on trial here; and \"When the grand jury is performing its investigatory function into a general problem area, without specific regard to indicting a particular individual, society's interest is best served by a thorough and extensive investigation, and a greater degree of disinterestedness and impartiality is assured by allowing free expression of contrary opinion.\" Ante, p. 392. This, however, is surely a policy decision with respect to which a State may legitimately take a different view. The Court does not suggest that Georgia was attempting to use the mantle of judicial proceedings in order to insulate the transaction of nonjudicial business from criticism; investigation is a traditional function of the grand jury. I see no reason why the State cannot determine for itself what shall and what shall not be considered by grand jurors in conducting any of their traditional tasks. Moreover, it is not the fact that individual rights were not at stake in this proceeding. The judge charged the jury:\n\n\"if there is sufficient evidence of unlawful acts, then all parties participating, white and colored, candidates or non-candidates, should be indicted by this Grand Jury so that the guilty parties, if there are any, may be brought to trial.\"\n\n\n That petitioner's statements would tend to aid rather than to prejudice implicated individuals was equally true in Bridges v. California, supra, but was rightly afforded no significance; the State as well as the individual is entitled to a day in court.\n\nIt is not suggested that in declaring that grand jurors shall be protected from improper \"outside\" influence \n\n[370 \nU.S. 375, 399]\n\u00a0\n Georgia has improperly departed from her own prior law. Nor could it well be maintained that the Georgia courts undertook to judge petitioner's conduct in terms of something other than the Bridges clear and present danger standard. The Georgia Court of Appeals held:\n\n\"With respect to the question as to whether these acts of the defendant constituted a clear, present, or imminent danger or serious threat to the administration of justice, it is to be noted that the citation as amended so charges, the court below has by its conviction so found, and the evidence supports the finding.\" 103 Ga. App., at 321; 119 S. E. 2d, at 273.\n\n\n To be sure this holding cannot preclude this Court from examining the evidence for itself. But this does not mean that it may do so with the same latitude as if it were sitting as a state court of review. The Court's functions are exhausted once it is determined that federal constitutional standards have been met. It is of course not incumbent on the state courts to deal in detail with the facts of this Court's earlier decisions in order to \"display an awareness of the standards enunciated in those cases,\" or to make \"elaborate findings\" to demonstrate \"how the publications interfered with the grand jury's investigation.\" Ante, pp. 386-387.\n\nAccepting as I do for present purposes the Bridges test, this conviction must be upheld if the record supports the inference of clear and present danger.\n\n\nII.\n\n\n\nThat test is amply met here. Petitioner, a public official connected with the court, accused, from his office in the courthouse, the Superior Court judges of fomenting race hatred; of misusing the criminal law to persecute and to intimidate political and racial minorities; of political naivete, racial prejudice, and hypocrisy. He \n\n[370 \nU.S. 375, 400]\n\u00a0\n compared the calling of the grand jury to the activities of the Ku Klux Klan. He made an undisguised effort to influence the outcome of the investigation by declaring that only the politically naive could believe Bibb County Negroes might be guilty of selling votes. It was stipulated that both of petitioner's formal statements were read by the grand jurors during the course of their investigation.\n\nThe Court considers this evidence insufficient because there was no showing of \"an actual interference with the undertakings of the jury,\" that the jurors \"felt unable or unwilling to complete their assigned task because petitioner `interfered' with its completion,\" that \"the investigation was not ultimately successful or, if it was not, that the petitioner's conduct was responsible for its failure.\" Ante, p. 387. Surely the Court cannot mean that attempts to influence judicial proceedings are punishable only if they are successful. Speech creating sufficient danger of an evil which the State may prevent may certainly be punished regardless of whether that evil materializes. See Feiner v. New York, \n340 \nU.S. 315, 320\n-321. Indeed, the test suggested by the Court is even more stringent than that which it applies in determining whether a conviction should be set aside because of prejudicial \"outside\" statements reaching a trial jury. In such cases, although the question is whether the rights of the accused have been infringed rather than whether there has been a clear and present danger of their infringement, it is necessary only to show a substantial likelihood that the verdict was affected, and it is no answer that each juror expresses his belief that he remains able to be fair and impartial. Irvin v. Dowd, supra, \n366 \nU.S., at 728\n; cf. Marshall v. United States, \n360 \nU.S. 310, 312\n-313; Spano v. New York, \n360 \nU.S. 315, 324\n. The test for punishing attempts to influence a grand or petit jury should be less rather than more stringent. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 375, 401]\n\u00a0\n\n\nI cannot agree with the Court that petitioner's statements would have been likely to affect the outcome of the investigation \"only if the charge was so manifestly unjust that it could not stand inspection.\" Ante, p. 391. This is to discredit the persuasiveness of argument, which the Court purports to value so highly. Any expression of opinion on the merits of a pending judicial proceeding is likely to have an impact on deliberations. In this instance that likelihood was increased by two factors which were not present in Bridges, Pennekamp, or Craig, in which the Court held the evidence insufficient to show clear and present danger. None of those cases involved statements by officers of the court; and all concerned statements whose alleged interference was with the deliberations of a judge rather than a jury. Georgia law requires the sheriff to execute and return court processes and orders and to preserve order during sessions of the courts. Ga. Code Ann., 1959, 24-2813. Petitioner was thus a law-enforcement officer, whose office was in the very courthouse where the grand jury was sitting. Whether or not he issued the statements \"in his capacity as sheriff,\" and whether or not the contempt citation alleged it, his words assumed an overtone of official quality and authority that lent them weight beyond those of an ordinary citizen.\n\nOf equal if not greater importance is the fact that petitioner's statements were calculated to influence, not a judge chosen because of his independence, integrity, and courage and trained by experience and the discipline of law to deal only with evidence properly before him, but a grand jury of laymen chosen to serve for a limited term from the general population of Bibb County. It cannot be assumed with grand jurors, as it has been with judges, Craig v. Harney, supra, \n331 \nU.S., at 376\n, that they are all \"men of fortitude, able to thrive in a hardy climate.\" What may not seriously endanger the independent deliberations \n\n[370 \nU.S. 375, 402]\n\u00a0\n of a judge may well jeopardize those of a grand or petit jury. See Maryland v. Baltimore Radio Show, Inc., \n338 \nU.S. 912, 920\n (opinion of FRANKFURTER, J.).\n\nMoreover, the statements themselves were of such a nature as to distinguish this case from Bridges, Pennekamp, and Craig. It cannot be said here, as it was in Bridges, that petitioner's charges of racial bias, hypocrisy, political intimidation, persecution, and political naivete, and his comparison of the judges with the Ku Klux Klan, \"did no more than threaten future adverse criticism which was reasonably to be expected anyway,\" or that \"if there was electricity in the atmosphere, it was generated by the facts; the charge added by the . . . [petitioner's statement] can be dismissed as negligible.\" \n314 \nU.S., at 273\n, 278. The sheriff's remarks were not, as in Pennekamp, \n328 \nU.S., at 348\n, general criticisms with respect to rulings already made, but specific attacks directed toward the disposition of the pending investigation. They cannot be characterized, as in Craig, \n331 \nU.S., at 374\n-375, as merely unfair reports of the activities of others; unlike the editorial in that case, id., at 376-377, petitioner's criticisms went squarely to the merits of the investigation and impugned as well the motives and honesty of those conducting it. I do not understand how it can be denied that a grand juror, reading in the course of this investigation the sheriff's statement that the judges who instructed the grand jury to undertake it were racial bigots making discriminatory use of the laws for purposes of political repression, and that the charges themselves were incredibly false, might well be influenced in his deliberations.\n\nThe petitioner's last formal statement, which he and the Court characterize as a \"defense,\" was also properly found to constitute a contempt. Defenses, like charges, should be presented to a court judicially and not through the public press. But in fact the affirmance of petitioner's conviction was not based at all on the allegation \n\n[370 \nU.S. 375, 403]\n\u00a0\n that this defense interfered with his trial for contempt. Rather, the Court of Appeals held that this further statement had been made \"in an apparent effort to hamper the grand jury which was still considering the charges given it by the court.\" 103 Ga. App., at 321, 119 S. E. 2d, at 273. This conclusion, based on the repetition of a number of petitioner's previous statements and the allegation that they were true,\n2\n was clearly justified. \n\n[370 \nU.S. 375, 404]\n\u00a0\n\n\nFinally, petitioner's case is not saved by the fact that both he and the judges he attacked are elected officials, or by the fact that the statement concerned an issue of some political moment. There was ample opportunity to bring the judges' performance to the voters after the investigation was closed. \"Political interest\" cannot be used as an excuse for affecting the result of a judicial inquiry.\n\nI would affirm.\n\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \"Whoever attempts to influence the action or decision of any grand or petit juror of any court of the United States upon any issue or matter pending before such juror, or before the jury of which he is a member, or pertaining to his duties, by writing or sending to him any written communication, in relation to such issue or matter, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than six months, or both.\n\n\"Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the communication of a request to appear before the grand jury.\" 18 U.S.C. 1504.\n\n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Petitioner's last statement was as follows:\n\n\"My defense will be simply that I have spoken the truth. Anyone who will read, point by point, my statements concerning the Judges' charge will find those statements true.\n\n\n\"The Judges were wrong to use `Negro Bloc Voting', the campaign slogan of Talmadge, and similar phrases as language with which to instruct a Grand Jury. When I stated `It is shocking to find a Judge charging a Grand Jury in the style and language of a race baiting candidate for political office' was it contempt of court or was I pointing out the truth?\n\n\n\"When I said `If anyone in this community be free of racial prejudice, it should be our Judges' was this contempt of Court or was I stating a truth?\n\n\n\"The Judges were morally wrong to suddenly order a Grand Jury to single out the Negro political leaders for indictments under a forgotten law which even judges have violated. When I said `It further seems that [sic] the height of hypocrisy to dust off an old blue law that has been ignored for fifty years and suddenly order its rigid enforcement against a minority group of voters' was this contempt of Court or was I speaking the truth?\n\n\n\"The Judges were professionally wrong in involving the Court in political affairs. I stated that the Judges' charges `threaten political persecution carried out under the guise of law enforcement' and further that `this action appears either as a crude attempt at judicial intimidation of Negro voters and leaders, or, at best, as agitation for a \"Negro Vote\" issues [sic] in local politics.' Can anyone read the Judges' instructions for indictments under the old `influencing voters' law and honestly say no political persecution is threatened when almost all office holders have violated this law? Can anyone read the long charge reciting political rumors and charges against Negro leaders and voters and honestly say there is no appearance of any attempt at intimidation of Negro voters and leaders? Likewise can anyone deny \n\n[370 \nU.S. 375, 404]\n\u00a0\n such a charge and such an investigation in the midst of local political races agitates a `Negro Vote' issue?\n\n\n\"If the Court will permit I believe that many thousands of witnesses would testify in my behalf that they drew the same conclusions as I from the language used by the Judges in their charge.\n\n\n\"Is it just, or even fair play, for the Judges to say they intended no threat, no intimidation, no agitation and therefore it is contempt of court to publicly state honest, sincere conclusions and practical effects caused by the language of the charge.\n\n\n\"Two wrongs do not make a right, and the Judges are wrong to cite me for contempt. I cannot view the Judges' action in any light except to believe I am to be prosecuted for daring to criticize the Judges and for speaking the truth.\n\n\n\"I had hoped that the entire ill-will and race agitation stirred up by the Judges' charge would be permitted to die after a face-saving presentment by the Courts' Grand Jury. To this end I remained silent despite grossly false and discrediting conclusions presented. Now it appears that the Judges want the satisfaction of find [sic] me in contempt of court, but if they so do, they are in effect saying that the court has done no wrong because the court itself finds it has done no wrong.\n\n      \"\/s\/ James I. Wood\" \n\n[370 \nU.S. 375, 405]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
